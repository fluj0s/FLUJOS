2006 draft of this report was shared with the director for the bureau for europe and the regional representative the comments which were received at the end of may 2006 are reflected wher appropriate in the report oios was pleased to note action was taken in the first quarter of 2006 to implement many of the recommendations made overall assessment one of the main objectives of the audit was to revi ew the effectiveness and efficiency of the new regional structure including the activities of the regional representation and the offices under its responsibility at the time of the audit the new arrangement was not fully functional and consequently oios was unable to provide an over all assessment on its effectiveness additionally difficulties were encountered in the implementation of msrp hungary was the initial pilot staff members had not been sufficie ntly trained on the system and were not able to generate the reports required in order to conduct detailed audit and assess compliance with unhcrs rules and procedures regionalization the regional representation was creat ed as of 1 january 2005 and the terms of reference tor of the regional representation and national offices under its responsibility were drafted throughout 2005 the first phase of regionalization was revision to the structure including staffing leve ls and the new organigramme was developed mainly from converting posts already available in the existing regional unit in budapest the orb approved the new structure in august 2004 and the newly appointed regional offic ers were assigned by mid 2005 the second phase of regionalization aimed at the pr ogressive transfer of administrative financial and other support functions from the nati onal offices to the regional representation at the time of the review the process was not final ized and transitional strategy had not been developed the regional representation stated that the transfe r of functions was to begin in 2006 and this was contingent on systems and proced ures being in place to support it namely msrp the framework established by th bureau for administrative and financial procedure s had not been initiated locally and the delegation of autho rity and reporting requirements had not been revised on account of the implementation of msrp the regional representation was of the opinion that it was not its responsibility to intro duce interim measures locally guidelines and procedures should have been developed centrally oios agreed that procedures on account of msrp should have been developed centrally this do not negate however the regional representatives responsibility for ensuring that p roper internal control mechanisms were established and were working effectively during the transitional period oios found that adequate internal controls had not been established administration msrp was rolledout to budapest on 1 january 2005 nd to ljubljana warsaw and bratislava from march to june 2005 it was hoped that msrp wo uld facilitate the regionalization process by enabling remote access by the regional represent ation to financial and administrative data of the countries under its responsibility at the t ime of the audit this had not been achieved moreover mainly as result of the implementation of msrp and the lack of expertise and confidence in using the system internal controls w ere lax for example reports to monitor expenditures could not be generated basic financia l controls certifying and approving functions were weak bank accounts were not reconc iled and month and yearend procedures were either not done or completed after significa nt delay programme management for the eight partners reviewed reasonable assuran ce could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements except for two partners where internal controls were defic ient for most implementing partners internal controls s hould be strengthened in many cases there was lack segregation of duties in others author izing and approving functions were not in place the apportionment of costs between various d onors in some instances was not transparent and there was evidence of doublecharg ing expenditure training courses on unhcr project management will be organized during t he second half of 2006 for all implementing partners project financial and performance monitoring was pe rformed but it was not always properly documented and should be enhanced oios recommended that there was need to rethink project monitoring in the context of the responsibi lities of the regional representation oios was informed that this responsibility would be main tained at the country level security and safety revised policy on security procedures taking int account the reality of regionalization had not yet been established redistribution of respo nsibilities between the country offices and the regional representation was required the level of responsibility for security in other c ountry offices to be assumed by the regional representatio n needed to be discussed and clarified at headquarter between the bureau and fss june 2006 table of

ng expenditure of us 12 million programme planning and monitoring needed to be impr oved and considerable work was required to ensure the validity of assettrak data 3 the unhcr office in budapest was selected t pilot unhcrs regionalization in europe the regional representation was established in budapest covering hungary slovenia the slovak republic and poland this pro cess was designed to ensure harmonized and coordinated strategies by grouping countries ar ound common themes and creating sub regional structures 4 the findings and recommendations contained in the report have been discussed

comments on the ongoing regionalization process ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information provided by msrp which was implemented in the course of 2005 effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subproject agreements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2005 programme activit ies under projects 05abhunls400 401 05abpolls400 05absvkls400 and 05abs vnls400 with budgets of us 15 million our review concentrated on the activit ies implemented by slovene filantropy sl budget of us 106000 pravnoinformacijski center pic budget of us 66000 polish helsinki foundation for human rights phfhr budget of us 31500 polish 2 humanitarian action pha budget of us 93000 s lovak humanitarian council shc budget of us 20000 human rights league hlr budget of

members of staff worked for the unhcr regional representation in hungary and the offices under the regional representation 9 our review focused on general programme man agement and financial management with due consideration to the implications of msrp roll out and the ongoing regionalization process the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations regionalization 10 in january 2005 unhcr established regio nal representation in budapest covering hungary slovenia the slovak republic and poland following eu accession it is planned that the same regional representation will also cov er bulgaria and romania unhcrs review of its presence in europe was initiated by request from donors aiming to reduce the number of fullyfledged national offices in europe regionalization intended to facilitate strategy formulation and generate better synergies in developing responses to common challenges 11 the process was initiated in 2002 and s tudy by the evaluation and policy analysis unit of the configuration of unhcrs presence in in dustrialized countries was conducted in march 2002 the bureau created an internal working group iwg to develop and analyse various models which could be adopted by unhcr th iwg worked actively until the end of 2004 but was gradually dismantled due to the re assignment or retirement of its key members oios was informed that the bureau intends to reestablish working group 12 the unhcr office in budapest was selected to pilot the project for strategic reasons hungary and the other countries making up the regio nal structure share common problems and in 2004 as members of the eu they became the astern border of the union it was also recognised that regionalization could solve the str uctural problem where the previous national office for hungary coexisted with the regional supp ort unit rsub 3 13 the first phase of regionalization include d revision to the structure including staffing levels the new organigramme was develope d on the basis of converting posts already available in the existing regional unit in budapest the orb approved the new structure in august 2004 the regional representati ves post was created and he was formally appointed as of 1 january 2005 the incumb ent was temporary assigned to budapest in may 2004 the assignment of further regional sta ff including the deputy regional representative was carried out in the course of 200 5 the staffing levels of the reporting country offices were also reviewed with the aim in 2006 to gradually reduce numbers 14 the second phase of regionalization was th transfer of administrative financial and other support functions from the country offices to the regional representation policy was developed at headquarters which envisaged progre ssive transition of its supervisory role over functions and processes at the time of the au dit strategy at the local level on how to implement this had not been developed according to the regional representation the delays were outside its control as it was dependent on th central development of systems and procedures on account of msrp given the short period of time from the establishme nt of the regional representation to that of the audit ios agrees that significant change may not have been possible but oios would have expected so evidence that plan had been initiated at least in the last quarter of 2005 on h ow to transfer the major functions protection programme design administration and human resource s for implementation by 1 january 2006 15 the draft framework of change included d efinition of accounting procedures at the country level procedures for submission of monthly accounts to the regional representation and modification of cash replenishment there was n evidence that the regional representation had consulted the various servicesd ivision at headquarters such as finance treasury and msrp on how to initiate these changes the regional representation considered that it was the bureau on behalf of the regional representation that was responsibility for systemic change to support regio nalization oios recognised that the bureau made considerable efforts to identify the ge neric changes to be made but it had required more effort and development by the regiona l representation which was not evident at the time of the audit 16 during oios review of the country offices changes in the working methods were observed all country offices operated as before nd there was evidence of any synergy between the offices and the regional representation the regional representation stated that they did not expect any change in the daytoday wo rking methods of offices in 2005 in terms of administration and finance the sole expected chang in 2005 was that of planning for 2006 17 since 1 january 2006 the lois and abods f or poland slovenia and the slovak republic were addressed to the regional representat ive as consequence revision of financial management and delegation of authority sp ecific to that particular context was required at the time of the audit written inst ructions had been issued to ensure these changes were properly communicated and that staff w ere aware of their responsibilities this was of particular importance as slovenia was alread and the slovak republic would soon be headed by national officer the regional representation stated that in january 2006 memorandum was addressed to the head of financial s ervices requesting authority for the regional representative to approve and budget check vouchers for slovenia and the same 4 will be requested for the slovak republic more for mal instructions and procedures will be issued later in 2006 18 to facilitate the analysis of financial in formation and reporting regional configuration of msrp would be required request for this had not been made although the iwg had raised this issue with the msrp team as ear ly as june 2004 19 there were systematic revision of job d escriptions and reporting lines and none of the job descriptions for local posts had been revis ed since their establishment many years ago this was needed as regionalization will have an imp act on staff responsibilities such as the merging of functions redefinition of the reporting lines and designation of authority the regional representation agreed that job description s needed to be revised and this has been completed also in order to manage human resources in the region post of human resources assistant gl6 was approved as of 1 marc h 2006 oios noted however this post has been discontinued due to budgetary constraints it is expected that the administrative unit in budapest will reorganise its work to cover the issue of human resource function in the region 20 moreover the regional representation had not addre ssed the objective of economies of scale by reducing the staffing levels as initial ly envisaged in the submission to the orb in august 2004 savings of us 57380 were expected fo r 2005 although this was achieved the new staffing structure as seen by the auditor stituted cost increase for the following years the regional representation indicated that by 2006 significant savings would be realized due to the discontinuation of the represen tatives post in slovakia and the closure of the office in slovenia the impact will be in 2007 when regional staff costs are expected to decrease by nearly us200000 as compared to 2006 21 regarding programme management according to the policy developed at headquarters most of it would be delegated to the field with the bulk of the activities handed over to partners the regional representation had not yet defined the respective responsibilities for monitoring partners in the reg ion the regional representation stated the monitoring responsibility of implementing partners will remain with the national offices the responsibilities for monitoring has been further fined and elaborated in the key activities and distribution of responsibility matrix covering programme management 22 moreover there was evidence that the p artners working with unhcr at the time of the audit have the expertise and capacity to imp lement public information pi activities on behalf of unhcr series of ngo media workshops is currently taking place to increase public information expertise and capacity 23 oios was of the opinion that the decision to abolish the national officer pi posts in the slovak republic and poland was not consistent with the need to improve public information in the region media coverage would be difficult w ith only one pi officer based in hungary in oios view revised working procedures should ve been established the policy decision to discontinue the two national officer pi posts in poland and the slovak republic was taken to replace them with two protection assistants to s trengthen the protection capacity it was agreed that developing an effective regional pi str ategy with fewer pi staff would be challenge the senior regional pi officer has revi ewed and analyzed the pi work previously done and established an action plan which is curre ntly being implemented 5 24 in oios opinion the activities carried ut by the three country offices administration finance programme protection sa fety and security supply chain and pi including reporting and monitoring procedures shoul d have been more closely defined it was recommended that progression chart describing the key actions to be taken be developed this was completed in january 2006 b administration and finance 1 msrp rollout 25 msrp was rolledout to budapest ljubljana warsaw and bratislava from january to june 2005 it was hoped that msrp would facilitat the regionalization process enabling the regional representation to have remote access to da ta for the countries under its responsibility 26 oios appreciates that this was pilot pr oject and therefore certain teething problems would be expected this was the case and the implementation process was difficult and not fully successful despite efforts by the sta ff members involved in the field and the msrp support team in geneva in hindsight there wa s insufficient preparedness its training was not fully focused on operations and the level nd depth of training necessary was underestimated as result of this the internal c ontrol systems and procedures in the countries reviewed were not fully functioning in 20 05 oios was informed that the piloting of msrp was highly beneficial to the project team and many lessons were learned this resulted in substantially modifying the training pr ogramme 27 nonetheless throughout the period under r eview oios noted that significant progress had been made in recording transactions and furthe r training in november 2005 was found to be very useful some msrp users needed complementar training on excel to become more efficient in transferring data to enable proper ana lysis to be done and its subsequent reporting moreover there had not been complete migration t msrp with fmis still used to prepare the quarterly spmr forms some of the reports provi ded by fmis were not always available in msrp resulting in countries using different repo rting tools for similar functions oios appreciates that generating reports is major conc ern for msrp users and that this has to be addressed centrally 2 financial management 28 the implementation of msrp has changed how financial controls are implemented and documented the regional representation had not adequately taken this into consideration and this resulted in serious weakness in internal controls throughout the period under review certifying and authorizing functions 29 in msrp the certifying and authorizing fu nctions are combined and performed by the same person reducing the segregation of duties in addition the certificationauthorization control is not performed within the system but on t he hard copy of the payment voucher this means that the same person could perform all the fi nancial functions in the system without this weakness being highlighted 6 30 oios noted that the names of the certifyin g authorizing and approving officers are not visible on the electronic version of payment vo uchers and therefore it is necessary to refer to the hard copy which should be signed manually this was not always done thus there was proper audit trail showing individual responsibi lity nor evidence of the segregation of duties for given transaction for example nat ional officer who initiated most of the project expenditure transactions was at the same t ime the approving officer since the introduction of msrp the payment voucher was not lways completed properly to provide evidence of proper certification and authorization of expenditures there was insufficient documentation to determine whether services had bee n provided in accordance with the contract and items were received in good order 31 the regional representation stated that unhcrs rul were not adapted to the msrp environment and this had been brought to the attention of the head of financial services in 2005 the regional representation was assured that the new delegation of authority instructions would be issued soon this was not the case oios appreciates this and is pleased to note that there has now been fi nancial internal control framework issued to field offices to provide the necessary guidance nonetheless oios is still of the opinion that when these weaknesses in internal controls wer noted by the heads of office they had responsibility to ensure even on an ad hoc basis t hat unhcr assets were properly safeguarded and controlled assurance could not be provided that this was the case recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in hungary in ac cordance with the unhcr rules on delegation of signing autho rity and in order to ensure adequate segregation of duties sho uld ensure that the representative approves expenditures and that t he payment voucher and supporting documents provide evidence t hat the certifying and authorizing function has been carrie d out rec 01 32 the director of the msrp project considered that th financial internal control framework supported by automated workflow which th msrp team has developed under the instruction of dfsm will assist with clarifyin g the internal responsibility within the region and also realign the roles with the structu ral changes that have taken place since the introduction of msrp b transactions made by another cost centre 33 in msrp the representative including per sons to whom representative has delegated functions is able to charge cost centr by recording an encumbrance or payment outside hisher area of responsibility without syst ematically informing the cost centre charged for most of the offices reviewed transactions by ther offices mainly headquarters had charged their cost centre this had been done witho ut notifying the offices concerned and resulted in the double counting of expenditure as an encumbrance and as payment costs being allocated to the wrong cost centre and delay s in recording payments 34 the procedure for authorizing cost centre to incu r expenditures on behalf of another cost centre has not changed with msrp and is usual ly done by email the authorization process however is not integrated in msrp and when charge is made the representative concerned is not systematically notified oios note d that notification by email is an option in 7 msrp and not mandatory in oios view it would be preferable for this to be mandatory step as representative should be informed priori of any commitmentcharges made to hisher cost centre by another unhcr country office or unit at headquarters oios appreciates that the required reports are available in msrp and field offices on their own initiative should periodically generate these repor ts to manage and control expenditures however oios found that staff responsible for thi s did not know how to run the relevant reports oios recommended that measures be taken to ensure that an approving officer is duly informed of any transactions that will be charged b another cost centre and proper mechanisms established to ensure only duly author ized officer can charge expenditure to given cost centre oios understands that the revised delegation of aut hority will address the above issues c use of payment requests 35 in msrp payment requests are longer re quired since payment can be initiated directly by the requesting unit this significantly increases the risk of errors and inaccuracies particularly when staff members involved in the pro cess do not fully understand unhcr financial rules for example oios noted that the programme unit in budapest initiated payment of huf 765104 us 3600 for review ducted of the transposition of eu directives in hungary there was invoice detaili ng the services provided nonetheless the regional protection officer signed the payment vouc her as authorizing and certifying officer electronically without signing the manual payment voucher also there was evidence that unhcr was satisfied with the level of services rend ered to unhcr that the services were in accordance with the terms of the contract and that the final report had been received the regional representation agreed that greater care wi ll be taken to ensure all forms are correctly completed supporting documents are prope rly attached to vouchers and that satisfactory completion of services rendered is cer tified oios is pleased to note the action to be taken it is an important control that full paym ent is not made before all the services are rendered d recording of encumbrance 36 all offices in the region had recorded pay ment vouchers directly without requisition and purchase order since most of the tr ansactions were less than us 1000 this practice represented risk in the context of regio nal activities when the approving function is carried out in budapest in most of the cases the regional representation would be placed in fait accompli situation action is required to address this payments to the representatives 37 oios noted that representatives approved nd certified payments for their own entitlements alternative control measures had b een implemented to compensate for the absence of the segregation of duties meaning that rrors went undetected for example payments relating to travel for the representative in slovenia were incorrectly settled while the overpayments have been recovered if adequate i nternal controls had been established this should have been detected the present enhancements of msrp should prevent certifying and approving functions being carried out by the same p erson 8 recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in hungary pendi ng the implementation of the enhancement of msrp should i n accordance with unhcr rules on delegation of signing authority establish compensatory controls to ensure adequate segregatio n of duties rec 02 f monthly and yearend procedures 38 in 2005 none of the countries reviewed d submitted bank reconciliations to headquarters the bank reconciliation function in m srp was not yet operational meaning that offices were simply establishing list of non reconciled items the problem was compounded as some finance assistants did not know how to manually do bank reconciliations financial resources services frs took action on the absence of this important control until midnovember 2005 39 the offices reviewed had not conducted the endofmonth procedures recommended by frs this was understandable as frs issued the i nstructions on this procedure only six months after the implementation of msrp in budapest and after the msrp training on financial issues 40 msrp has simplified yearend procedures as commitments are directly recorded at the country level for 2005 however the reconciliatio n of open items could not be fully completed on time for instance at the time of the audit budapest had to clear 33 pages of open items and slovenia poland and the slovak rep ublic did not expect to settle all open items before the closure of the 2005 accounts in poland due to significant backlog in posting accounts payable oios was informed that it would be unlikely that the bank reconciliation would be done on time 41 since 1 january 2005 the regional represe ntation and country offices did not reconcile any open items mainly due to the lack of data on the balance in the corresponding general ledger accounts in addition the clearing of receivable accounts between fmis and msrpheadquarters was not properly done as resul t many items already considered as reconciled in fmis are still listed as open items in msrp some open items date back to1997 which presents considerable work guidance from the finance section at headquarters has been requested on how to clear all the outstanding vat and other open items action will be taken as soon as reply is received recommendation head2right the unhcr division of finance and supply management should provide guidance and if required assistance to th regional representation and the offices under its responsibi lity to clear all open items rec 03 3 cash management 42 oios noted that the panel of bank signator ies for the regional representative assures segregation of duties however in the three count ies reviewed there was only one bank 9 signatory oios recommended that the regional repre sentation take this into account when it establishes procedures for monitoring the countries under its authority the regional representation also has to consider the procedures for replenishment of bank accounts and how this will be done in the context of regionaliza tion and that the lois will be addressed to the regional representative the making of payment s in number of foreign currencies also needs to be discussed and clarified the regional representation has taken action they have sought guidance from headquarters on bank signatori and requested authorization from treasury to move to citibank enabling payments to b made electronically in foreign currencies 43 one of the expected improvements introduce d by msrp was the necessity to settle payment voucher before issuing the bank transfer b ank lettertransfer forms currently used by the regional representation and the country offices were not the form generated by msrp and were not integrated into the system payments were frequently made before the payment voucher was recorded in msrp by all countries visit ed the customisation of bank letter format to local requirements was addressed by the d hc in her memorandum following her visits to hungary and bosnia in november 2005 the necessary actions are expected on this issue 44 several payments including mip claims hos pitality translation fees and cleaning services were made in cash instead of by bank trans fer the name of the payee on the bank letter is often cash withdrawal instead of the be neficiary in addition to weakening the controls over payments such practice obliges s taff member to take the unnecessary risk of cashing the money at the bank on behalf of the actu beneficiary in the context of activities in europe there was justification for this the regional representation indicated that the practice of issuing bank letters in the name of ano ther staff member in order to cash them has now stopped all payments including dsa advances are made directly into the beneficiaries bank accounts 4 mip expenditures 45 mip management should be improved for all countries reviewed with the exception of the slovak republic that had different medical insurance policy oios observed that the supporting documents were often attached to the pay ment voucher which does not ensure confidentiality claim submitted by mip adminis trator was not properly documented and was wrongly reimbursed at 100 per cent oios recomm ended that mip management including the maintenance of records be reviewed in the context of regionalization given that the country offices are downsizing transferri ng the management of mip to the regional level might be suitable with the creation of human resource assistant pos t the regional representation expected to centralize the administr ation of mip in budapest which should improve its management c general programme management 46 the implementation of msrp programme modul was progressing very slowly none of the country offices used the subproject agreeme nt format as the epm module was introduced late and was not properly customized an d it was only budgets that were recorded in msrp in all the offices visited implementing partners r ecording iprs had not yet been entered in msrp and not completed for the closure of the 2005 accounts the programme 10 staff members were using excel to monitor the 2005 programme budget and expenditures the regional representation indicated slovenia and poland have completed the entry of the 2005 iprs and the entry in hungary and slovakia wer nearly completed in 2006 it is expected that the msrp generated reports will facil itate the monitoring of budget expenditure spending authority etc and there wil l be further requirement to establish spreadsheet for financial monitoring purposes 47 closer supervision by the regional represe ntation was required due to the complexity of the exchange rate calculation and the policy cha nges introduced by msrp in fmis the exchange rate used for reporting purposes was the r ate of the last month of the reporting period and conversion was automatic with msrp th conversion has to be done manually and is combination of the rate at the time of the last instalment and the previous instalment in cases where there is an unspent balance subproject financial monitoring 48 for all countries visited financial monit oring of implementing partners activities was carried out however with the exception of hungary the financial monitoring performed was not always properly documented and should be enhanc ed oios suggested that in the context of regionalization where the regional representati on will approve the spmrs there is properly documented monitoring regime the regional representation indicated that good practices in the monitoring of and reporting on pro ject activities have been shared with offices in the region and an integrated planning an d monitoring strategy established 49 for the partners audited in the slovak rep ublic oios could not obtain assurance as to the reliability of expenditure reported to unhcr in the spmrs submitted financial monitoring was carried out regularly for most partn ers however it was oios opinion that the office did not have the required capacity to do this effectively oios recommended that partners be more closely monitored the representative in bratislava indicated that the high turnover of partner staff created an additional wor kload for unhcr and was major management constraint and challenge 50 for slovakia with the resources available the office was not able to monitor all its partners for example the financial records of goo dwill society operating in the east of the country had not been reviewed for the last two yea rs also for shc and hrl oios review highlighted weaknesses explanations given by shc w ere vague and even inconsistent in regard to the implementation of activities and the report submitted by hrl on its legal counselling activities was insufficient to assess i ts output there was major change in unhcrs partners in 2005 meaning they required exte nsive training and coaching affecting the resources and staff members ability to monitor all the partners 51 oios raised the concern that with the redu ction of the staffing levels expected in the new regional structure unhcrs capacity to monitor its partners would be low for example ljubljana will close in may 2006 and in poland though the present pi officer will have the responsibility to monitor subprojects related to ducation and integration this post will not be extended beyond the 30 june 2006 the regional representation shared oios concerns nd has taken number of steps to address them to ensu re oios observations and recommendations are implemented 11 recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation hungary should nsure full coverage of the monitoring of implementing partners all project monitoring activities should be documented in order to facilitate the supervision of partner activities at the regional l evel rec 04 52 oios is pleased to note that action has be taken however to be able to close the above recommendation oios requires copy of the 2 006 detailed work plan for monitoring implementing partners and directly implemented acti vities as well as sample reports of the monitoring activities undertaken d review of implementing partners 53 for the eight partners reviewed reasonabl assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements with the exceptions of shc and hrl oio s assessed and recommended that internal controls of most partners should be streng thened where required audit certificates with unqualified opinions were received 54 given that detailed summary of findings and recommendations has already been shared with the regional representation and the nat ional offices oios comments on the partners are summarized per theme corresponding to the most frequent weaknesses observed and in order of priority in the context of regional ization maintenance of accounting and project records 55 most of the unhcrs partners maintained parate records for unhcr subprojects they used computerized accounting systems providing the necessary information for reporting to unhcr 56 arc maintained accords accounting records and they were found adequate for general reporting however some enhancements were r equired to meet unhcrs standards the expenditures charged to unhcr were downloaded f rom the accounting system to excel and since excel is not fully reliable for accountin g purposes further reconciliation exercise was required to provide assurance that the figures reported were complete and accurate 57 in slovenia the partners maintained two s ets of records one for reporting to local authorities the other in excel for monthly expendi ture reporting to unhcr the latter report did not provide direct link to bank transactions and therefore it was difficult to verify the reliability of the financial data reported oios re commended that the partners in slovenia submit with their financial report bank reconcili ation to enable unhcr to compare the charges to the project with the payments made accord and the partners in slovenia have agreed to provide bank reconciliations with its spm r andor monthly expenditure reporting for monitoring purposes b internal control and financial management 58 in general partners needed to strengthen internal controls in particular there was lack of segregation of duties for example oios ob served that the same person was acting as 12 accountant authorizing officer for cash payments namely for assistance and petty cash custodian oios emphasized that when staffing leve ls do not allow segregation of duties measures to compensate this weakness should be blished such as closer supervision and the regular review of records by management to dete ct any error or irregular transaction 59 weaknesses with regard to authorizing and approval procedures were also found the delegation of authority was not clearly assigned c ontrols were not always properly documented and often only one person signed the pa yment vouchers in the future at least two persons at an appropriate level should be assig ned authorizing and approving functions to ensure adequate financial controls are in place i n the context of regionalization to be able to rely on financial information from partners assura nce needs to be obtained that sound financial controls have been established the regional representation stated that the staffin g structure of the partners had limited flexibility d ue to the small number of staff efforts however would be made to address oios concerns c sharing of common costs 60 unhcr partners implemented projects for v arious donors all of them having different budgeting and reporting requirements the partners often faced difficulties in sharing common costs between projects the cost sharing met hodology adopted by partners varied significantly in some cases it was transparent and clear in others it was not for example shcs salary charges to the unhcr subproject could not be substantiated as the time sheets maintained did not provide sufficient details on th activities performed by the employee oios recommended that unhcr in slovakia closely mon itor cost sharing among shc projects the regional representation indicated that this is being followedup d slovakia humanitarian council 61 due to weaknesses in the control environme nt and internal control procedures assurance could be obtained that financial reports submitted to unhcr by shc could be relied upon the project did not appear to be well managed the project coordinator left in september 2005 and the director took over the addi tional tasks and performed both functions the salary cost of two persons was charg ed to unhcr shc claimed that these charges were justified given that both functions we re performed oios recommended that unhcr in slovakia follow up on this issue of double charging the office in bratislava has been following the matter closely and it is expecte d that it will be settled by the end of the third quarter of 2006 62 expenditures for rental of office premises were not made in accordance with the sub project budget in october 2005 without informing unhcr shc moved to new premises for which the rent was significantly higher increa sing the monthly charges by 300 per cent the current cost sharing methodology did not appear fair and the apportionment of costs was not approved by unhcr shc proposed reallocation of the budget from operational sectors to administrative support costs which should not h ave been accepted given that administrative costs represented almost 30 per cent of subproject expenditures shc has reimbursed the amounts exceeded in the budget and ultimately there has been overexpenditure 13 human rights league 63 hrl is an organization that was created in april 2005 by an exemployee of former unhcr partner providing legal assistance to individ uals in refugeeaccommodation centres in the slovak republic unhcr decided to work with this organization to maintain continuity of activities hrl signed its first sub project agreement on 24 june 2005 64 an attorney employed parttime under the u nhcr subproject was also conducting private business from the partners premises the u nhcr office in slovakia did not have the necessary information to monitor the work conducted by the attorney and his assistant on unhcr beneficiaries to ensure they fulfilled their obligations although he had an employment contract with hrl signed by himself as employer and employee the board of directors had not confirmed his working conditions the attorney used significant part of the office premises 30 per cent funded by unhcr f or his private business and reimbursement for these facilitates was made or wa s there an agreement with unhcr on this issue owing to the abrupt discontinuation of the previous partner hrl had been initially established on an ad hoc basis to ensure disrupt ion of legal services to beneficiaries the staffing in particular the lawyers were rapidly i dentified and engaged the arrangements were initially made based on the immediate availabi lity of competent lawyers recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in the slovak republic sho uld request human rights league to confirm the attorneys worki ng conditions and to obtain financial contribution for the priv ate use of the office premises funded by unhcr rec 05 f accord 65 in mid2005 accord bought new software fo r the country of origin information coi database for an amount of 35000 this was f unded jointly by unhcr 10500 the european refugee fund and the ministry of the inter ior of austria for this purchase accord did not strictly follow procurement procedur the criteria for the selection was determined by the best offer among the nine receive d without establishing the respective weight of each criteria or preparing matrix give n that the selected offer amounted to 33890 which was much higher than the lowest offe r 16500 the selection should have been properly documented based on oios recommendation accord submitted w ritten justification to unhcr for the selection made 66 unhcr vienna bought the software used for coi and all users signed right of use agreement in early 2004 it was not clear however where this asset was recorded the software would have to be replaced in early 2006 w ith the data transferred to new system and backup kept on dvd without the support of the current server the system will longer be used as for any other asset the request for writeoff should be submitted to the appropriate asset management board the regional representation indicated that once th regional lamb in budapest is established it is int ended to submit the issue of the coi software for decision and advice on the course of action to be taken for both the new and old software 14 human resource management 67 in 2005 most of the human resources activ ities concentrated on the implementation of msrp and the preparation for regionalization training on msrp and supervision 68 training on msrp was provided and consiste d of preimplementation programme in geneva onthejob training and supplementary trai ning in geneva as some staff members were initially mistakenly excluded from regional train ing session on monthend procedures staff members assessed that the training provided was not adequate or sufficiently focused staff members were of the opinion that the training did n ot suitably prepare them for the major changes and new concepts introduced by msrp in terms of rec ording transactions and running reports the training was too technical and theoretical and practical examples or case studies were given the manual did not supplement or aid the lea rning process consequently staff members continued to have number of questions and queries that had to be answered and resolved over the telephone with the support team at headquarters the director of the msrp project stressed that this was pilot and agreed that important ssons were learned through the initial training the training approach was substantially modified in light of the budapest learning experience and it was recognized that it was difficult for the offices to digest msrp given that its implementation took place in the middle of structur changes 69 there was mechanism to ensure continuit in the training process for replacement staff due to staff members departure or long absen ces for example in budapest due to the maternity and extended sick leave of one staff memb er the recording of programme data was not done as there were other trained person to do this function oios understands that more extensive training will be given in the future also manuals are being updated to ensure that they are userfriendly and address the concerns of staff at the field level the regional representation was of the opinion that thi s would not provide solutions needed for new training as it is centralized in geneva and th ere are funds for travel expenses b updating of job description 70 given the gradual phasing down of activiti in poland and in the slovak republic and the transfer of activities to budapest revis ion of the current tasks should have been carried out at the time of the audit job descript ions had not been updated since the posts were created for instance in bratislava with the exception of the newly created posts job descriptions have not been updated since 1997 sim ilar observations were made for poland and for hungary the regional representative indicated that the revi sion of job descriptions has been completed in budapest and for poland and the slovak republic these will be reviewed and revised in the second half of 2006 oios believes that the revision of the job descriptions should have been done earlier in the p rocess at the time of the revision of the staffing 15 f supply chain management asset management 71 oios noted that for the offices reviewed they have succeeded in transferring assets from assettrak to msrp two of the offices bratislava nd warsaw however still have to verify that all the data has been correctly transferred as recommended by oios the regional representation agrees and will ensure that countrie s under its responsibility conduct physical check of all assets with view to identifying any discrepancies between assettrak records and the msrp records 72 in the context of regionalization oios re commended that the regional representation provide its offices with instruction s on asset management procedures including the future functioning of the lambramb the regional representation informed oios that they have received the authorization to establ ish an asset management board with regional competence 73 given that the unhcr representation in slo venia was to be closed by may 2006 there were detailed procedures established and c ommunicated to the person concerned oios recommended that this be done as soon as possi ble this should include how to deal with decisions on the disposal of assets and the st orage of storagetransfer of files h security and safety 74 oios review aimed to determine the adequa cy of the current security and safety procedures in place it would found that for all th countries visited improvements were required and revised policy on regional securit procedures has been established

regional level and once established th distribution of responsibilities be documented and disseminated the regional representation indicated that any secu rity issues that may be assumed by the regional represen tation if any have not yet been determined this issue needs to be discussed and cl arified in geneva between the bureau and fss v acknowledgement 75 i wish to express my appreciation
