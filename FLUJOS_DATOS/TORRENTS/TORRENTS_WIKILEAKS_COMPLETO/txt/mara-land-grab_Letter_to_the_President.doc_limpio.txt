republic of kenya commander in chief of the armed forces state house nairobi your excellency re request for fair play in maasai mara national reserve 1 your excellency we hate to appear to be pestering you over the execution of justice realm you have understandably left to enjoy its independence as the third pillar of democratic governance we however are firm believers in the old judicial adage that justice delayed is justice denied 2 we appreciate your very busy schedule of work as you struggle to clean up the cobwebs of corruption that clogged the lives of kenyans for decades we pray that god showers you with good health wisdom and courage to clean up the mess without fear or favour in order to establish genuine rule of law 3 we are all walking difficult path given that there are some in this country who still worship money and unfortunately they believe that with money all else is possible it is not denial that our country is still suffering from strong hangover of the decades of run away injustice 4 your excellency the last four years of your governance have given kenyans new meaning to what transparency in public accountability good governance and the rule of law are all about your government has demonstrated to the world that democracy can thrive in africa and be enjoyed by citizens and foreigners alike 5 after years of neglect kenyas allimportant agriculture is buoyant tourism is up and kicking health services have improved and education is not only free at primary level but higher education opportunities abound around the country and internationally kenyans are reclaiming their selfesteem taking up their leadership role within east and central africa and moulding society of working nation far removed from pariah state 6 the maasai community and especially those of us in narok have not lost sight of the tremendous achievements in such short span of time the revival of the kenya meat commission kmc by your government is of great significance to the maasai community and all pastoralists in kenya we are grateful to your excellency 7 as direct beneficiaries of your good governance we feel restrained to express displeasure about the conduct of some officials you have entrusted with the responsibilities and execution of accountable governance and the administration of justice 8 your excellency we wish to bring to your attention matter we believe directly involves deliberate abuse of the judicial process gross violation of sections 116 and 117 of the constitution and contravention of the land adjudication act registered land act registration of titles act laws governing land administration in this country the wildlife conservation and management act cap 276 has not been spared either 9 this deliberate abuse gross violation and contravention had before been dealt with by the offices of the commissioner of lands and the attorney general the office of the head of the civil service had occasion to direct for corrective action on the abuses and violations 10 the deliberate abuses and gross violations involve fraudulent title narokcis maratalek155 whose area is whooping 4000 acres stolen from the trust land of the maasai mara national reserve public property held by the county council of narok for the people of kenya 11 the gross violation of the constitution and statute law has been documented in the commissioner of lands letter to the head of the civil service in letter reference 22408 dated 6th october 2000 in the which the commissioner of lands says 2 the registration of parcel 155 talek adjudication section is fraudulent and is hereby cancelled 12 the gross abuse of the judicial process is also documented in letter reference agmlg152000 dated 29th may 2002 from the attorney general office to the clerk county council of narok in which he says we are surprised and amazed to learn that your council the first defendant has entered into consent judgment in favour of the plaintiff please note that the honourable the attorney general has been instructed by the commissioner of lands on the matter and filed defence in court on 301001 the instructions are clearly borne out in the said defence the commissioner of lands is challenging the validity of title narokcis maratalek155 issued to the plaintiff the said parcel of land was illegally excised from the maasai mara national reserve outside the 48 square kilometres degazetted as part of the maasai mara national reserve 13 the county council of narok on 12th july 2005 resolved t hat it had never allocated any part of the maasai mara national reserve to any body 9 complaints about the grabbed land and the mismanagement of maasai mara national reserve have been prevalent over the years this led to the appointment of an interministerial task force on the management of nationalgame reserves by various county councils last year the task force report was released on 7th april 2006 the report acknowledges large chunk of the maasai mara national reserve had been illegally curved out and dished to developer this was unprocedural as mara is gazetted entity protected by the relevant statutes so should not be encroached upon the council was advised to reestablish the boundaries of the reserve and acquire trust title to prevent encroachment the title in question was unconstitutionally issued to livingstone kunini ole ntutu in 1997 the title was subsequently declared fraudulent and cancelled by the commissioner of lands in the letter reference 224086 of october 6 2000 to the then head of the civil service and secretary to the cabinet dr richard leakey 10 our prayer is that your excellency intervenes to avert crisis triggered by sheer greed at the expense of social harmony and mutual coexistence between man and wildlife our heritage we pray that i if there are any cases involving narokcis maratalek155 that need hearing let them be open and heard on merit and before competent judicial officersmachinery ii the title acquired fraudulently be cancelled once and for all iii those who facilitated the fraud be investigated and punished as per the law iv those who have perpetrated the fraud be punished according to law 11 to date case involving livingstone kunini ole ntutu has been heard on merit instead kunini ole ntutu has been embroiled in fraudulent maneuvers in an attempt to legalize the fraud on the constitution and statute law thanks be to an insensitive and wavering attorney general chambers and wanting judiciary livingstone ole ntutus key advocates have been mr keriako tobiko the current director of public prosecution and mr tobikos university of nairobi cubemate mr kioko kilukumi we are able ready and willing to provide evidence of advocate client relationship between mr tobiko and ole ntutu 12 it is more than apparent that mr tobiko denied his client the advantage and benefit of legal advice on what the constitution of kenya and relevant land laws uphold or defend in terms of national reserves on trust land in the event of any portion being released for adjudication for the public use 13 this we believe has been as result of greed and fraudulent conduct of applying cash and political influence in order to grab national heritage from the current generation and posterity most steps mr tobiko and mr kilukumi take on matters relating to the grabbed land narokcis maratalek155 have been rich cocktail in furtherance of the initial fraud involving judicial improprieties in concerted efforts to cover up any unchallenged argument to the contrary is gross abuse of common sense thanks to the power of money and capricious minds 14 your excellency we attach herewith the commissioner of lands letter reference 224086 dated 6th october 2000 the attorney general letter reference agmlg152000 dated 29th may 2002 the task force report released by the minister for local government on 7th april 2006 and extract of council minutes of 12th july and the council surveyors report dated 8th june 2004 and copy of letter dated 25th july 2006 in which olkiombo ltd says the persons who have purported to settle its case are impostors as proof that livingstone kunini ole ntutu claims for the 4000 acres of maasai mara national reserve are without merit having acquired its title fraudulently regardless of what his lawyers may have advised him 15 the continued failure to cancel the illegal title since 1997 and an equally fraudulent decree allegedly granted by the high court and signed by unnamed deputy registrar on november 24 2005 is provoking the maasai in the neighbourhood of the national reserve to think that they too can also claim share of the national reserve individually and collectively 16 such an invasion into the national reserve would be of grave consequence to the mara delicate ecosystem and the national economy your excellency we trust and believe that you will use your wise counsel to resolve this matter once and for all god bless your excellency we remain loyal citizens of the republic of kenya our motherland
