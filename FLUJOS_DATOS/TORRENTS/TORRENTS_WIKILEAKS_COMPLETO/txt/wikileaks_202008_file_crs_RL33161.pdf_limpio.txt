program originated in the mid1990s and was intended to replace the 25 to 30 families of radio systems used by the military many of which could not communicate with each other with software based radios that could operate across the entire radio frequency spectrum1 jtrs is intended to permit the services to operate together in seamless ma nner via wireless voice video and data communications through all vels of command including direct access to near real time information from airborne and battlefield sensors2 described as software defined radio jtrs is envisioned to function more like computer than conventional radio and is to be upgraded and modified to operate with other communications systems by the addition of software as opposed to redesigning hardware more costly and timeconsu ming process dod also asserts that in many cases single jtrs radio with multiple waveforms3 can replace many separate radios simplifying maintenance and that because jtrs is software programmable they will also provide longer functional life4 with both features offering potential longterm cost savings it is also planned that jtrs will be interoperable with current dod radio syst ems the pentagons global information grid5 and the communications systems of selected allied nations6 jtrs has been characterized by the army as key complementary enabler of the fcs network that would

experienced number of developmental difficulties to date some of the more notable difficulties are discussed in the following sections size and weight constr aints and limited range according to government accountability office gao report to realize the full capabilities of the wideband networking waveform10 including transmission range the cluste r one radio requires significant amounts of memory and processing power which add to the size weight and power consumption of the radio the added size and weight are the results of efforts to ensure the electronic parts in the radi are not overheated by the electricity needed to power the additional memory and processing thus far the program has not been able to develop radios that meet size weight and power requirements and the current projected transmission range is only three kilometers well short of the 10kilometer range required for the wideband networking waveform the cluster one radios size weight and peak power consumption exceeds helicopter platfo rm requirements by as much as 80 percent11 the inability to meet these fundamental design and performance standards has raised concerns that cluster one may not be able to accommodate additional waveforms current plan is for cluster one to have four to eight stored waveforms as intended and that it may be too bulky or heavy to fit into the stringently weight and sizeconstrained fcs manne d ground vehicles mgvs12 as well as the armys helicopter fleet some are concerned that to meet these physical requirements the army may significantly dumb down cluster one

the airborne version of cluster one20 according to boeing officials it would be possible to achieve the 52 kilogram weight limit but it would require significant design changes to design that is already well established and not easily changed21 despite this difficulty certain aspects of the cluste r one program have shown improvement according to boeing officials with the first version of the

global information grid will also interface with the internet which brings with it whole additional set of security concerns for jtrs27 interoperability with legacy radio systems some have expressed concerns that the goal of making jtrs backward compatible with legacy radios may be technologically infeasible28 reportedly early program attempts at cross banding29 to synchronize incompatible legacy radio signals proved to be too complex and current army efforts are focusing on using the wideband networking waveform to link with legacy radio frequencies30 one report suggests that while the wideband networking waveform can receive signals from legacy radios legacy radios cannot receive signals from jtrs and to rectify this situation the army is looking at using 19 different waveforms to facilitate jtrs transmissions to legacy systems31 incorporating up to 19 different waveforms into jtrs radio has the potential tosignificantly increase memory and proce ssing power requirements which in turn could drive up jtrs size weight and power requirements recently the joint staff asked the services to prioritize jtrs waveforms and the army reportedly identified four waveforms as initial priorities for fcs and other complementary programs 32 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33161crs6 33 united states government accountability office gao report to the chairman committee on appropriations house

failure to meet cost schedule and performance requirements shortly after this decision work on cluster five wa s also partially susp ended due in part to developmental problems changing techni cal requirements and contract award protest and also because progress in cluster five was heavily leveraged against progress on cluster one33 as result of the work stoppage dod lifted its requirement for services to obtain dod waiver before purchasing nonjtrs radios and the services were authorized to pur chase legacy radios such as the single channel ground and airborne radio system sincgars which has been in service since the 1980s34 jtrs alternatives some analysts suggest that there are alternatives to jtrs that are already commercially available companies such as harris corporation cluster one team member produces softwaredefined radio falcon ii anprc 117fc and thales cluster five team member and the lead contractor for socoms cluster two radio both produce softwaredefined radios that are already in use in the field35 it should be noted however that these softwaredefined radios currently in use only run subset of the current force waveforms and the wideband networking waveform and

cluster one some suggest that the program has reached an impasse due to aircraft weight and size constraints and that the only way to meet these requirements is to redesign the system into significantly lesscapable version course of action that could further delay the program and carry with it significant cost implications security congress may decide to examine the issue of security in greater detail according to gao in addition to requirement to change jtrs hardware to accommodate processing and memory capacity upgrades for enhanced security the current design of jtrs has been judged by the national security agency as not sufficient to meet security require ments to operate in an open networked environment specifically particular versions of jtrs radios will be used by allied and coalition forces requiring the army to release specific source code of the software architecture to these forces to address the release the national security agency has required chan ges to the security architecture65 although gao expresses security concer ns about jtrs use by allied and coalition forces it is not readily apparent how pervasive problem security is for jtrs and other components of the fcs netw ork given the stated security challenges of softwaredefined radios it is conceivable that even if cluster one and five can meet the armys communications and data transmission requirements that security deficiencies might preclude the operational employment of clusters one and five it can be argued that network security would take on an even more significant role in fcs than compared to the armys current force fcs manned ground vehicles lighter and less heavily armore d than the m1 abrams and m2 bradleys that they are intended to replace would rely extensively on situational awareness provided through the fcs network for their survivability furthermore this network provided situational awareness would have significant impact on fcss ability to engage enemy forces beyond lineofsight given this significant reliance on the fcshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33161crs14 66 annual report to congress the military power of the peoples republic of china

for target acquisition and engagement potential adversaries might seek to identify and exploit security weaknesses in the fcs network including jtrs as mean s to attack fcs units one potential adversary china has likely establis hed information warfare units to deploy viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks and chinas recent exercises have incorporated offensive com puter operations primarily as first strike against enemy networks66 potential scenario for consideration is that if an adversary obtained fcsrelate d source code they could engineer virus that could be introduced into the fcs network and computers while some may consider this an improbable scenario the reported recent discovery by russian security experts of the first known computer virus spread by cell phone networks suggests otherwise67 the army is not unaware of these security challenges and notes that network security and information assurance are an ever growing priority regardless of fcs development68 as part of this recognition th army fcs program conducts bi monthly information assurance architecture development reviews with the army staff sections responsible for intelligence g2 and information and communications g 6 and the national security agency and office of the secretary of defense69 jtrs alternatives with its history of developmental difficulties program delays and additional costs some suggest that the jtrs cluster one program might be candidate for cancellation in this view congress might opt to explore alternatives to cluster one with the ar my and dod possible starting point for such review might be an examination of softwaredefined radios already in service within the us military or commercially available through other manufacturers some critics argue that the military s hould adopt commercia lly available and emerging telecommunications technology one example of such technology is third generation cellular technologies that encompass streaming video netted communications and data and voice co mmunications over internet provider networks70 while proponents maintain that thirdgeneration cellular could exceed jtrs performance capabilities critics of the commercial approach note that these technologies need to be ruggedized cust omized to fit on specific vehicles and systems and require specialized encr yption and therefore the off the shelf approach might be equally as expensive as developing jtrs after thorough technical and costbased evaluation of these and other jtrs alternatives some project the best course of action may be to continue cluster one development as currently planned
