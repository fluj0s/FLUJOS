discuss certain policy issues related to the program and offer an overview of federal programs providing funding for purposes related to those of the pssf program introduction the child and family services improvement act of 2006 pl 109288 extended funding authorization for the promoting safe and stable families pssf program title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act for five years fy2007 fy2011 the program primarily provides formula grants to states territories and tribes for provision of four broad categories of services to children and families communitybased family support family preservation timelimited reunification and adoption promotion and support pl 109288 increased the amount of funds that will be made available to tribes for these purposes and also provides that less than 40 million of funds provided for the program annually through fy2011 are to be setaside for competitive grants to eligible regional partnerships to address child welfare issues raised by parentcaretaker abuse of methamphetamine or other substances and for formula grants to states to support monthly caseworker visits to children in foster care in addition as under prior law part of the total funding provided for the pssf program is reserved for certain grants under the court improvement program cip section 438 of the social security act these cip grants are distributed by formula to each eligible highest state court and are for those courts to assess and make improvements to their handling of child welfare cases finally funds are also set aside for evaluation research and technical assistance related to the pssf program pl 109288 provides that portion of those setaside funds must be used to provide evaluations research and technical assistance related to monthly caseworker visits and grants to improve the outcomes of children affected by parentcaretaker abuse of methamphetamine or other substances crs2 the promoting safe and stable families program was initially created as program of family preservation and support services by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 that program was reauthorized expanded and given its current name by the adoption and safe families act of 1997 pl 105 89 subsequently congress passed the promoting safe and stable families amendments of 2001 pl 107133 which reauthorized the program through fy2006 more recently the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 increased the authorization for mandatory pssf appropriations by 40 million for fy2006 and separately appropriated funding 20 million for each of fy2006fy2010 for two new kinds of grants under the court improvement program the senate finance and house ways and means committees have exercised jurisdiction over the program and both committees held hearings related to reauthorization of this program during 2006 in addition to reauthorizing the promoting safe and stable families program and extending certain court improvement program grants pl 109288 made significant amendments to the child welfare services program title ivb subpart 1 of the social security act that program provides formula grants to states for wide range of services to children and families and was first authorized in 1935 by the original social security act under prior law that program had an indefinite or noyear funding authorization pl 109288 set the programs funding authorization to expire with fy2011 placing it on the same reauthorization calendar as the pssf program and made other changes related to the programs purposes how funds may be used under the program and what states are required to do in order to receive these funds finally pl 109288 extended funding authorization for the mentoring children of prisoners program section 439 of the social security act which provides funds to eligible entities to support mentoring services for children of prisoners in addition to extending the programs funding authorization for these site based competitive grants pl 109288 authorized demonstration project to test the effectiveness of using vouchers to deliver these services more broadly reauthorization activity in the 109th congress on

httpwaysandmeanshousegovhearingsaspformmodedetailhearing482 crs4 provisions of the child and family services improvement act of 2006 pl 109288 as enacted the child and family services improvement act of 2006 s 3525 pl 109288 incorporates language approved in two earlier versions of s 3525 the following discussion describes provisions of the enacted legislation for table comparing selected provisions from each of the predecessor bills along with prior law and current law see appendix funding reauthorization and other changes to pssf under prior law the promoting safe and stable families pssf program was authorized to receive mandatory appropriations of 345 million in fy2006 and discretionary appropriations of 200 million pl 109288 extended these same funding authorization levels to each of fy2007fy2011 broader limitation on administrative spending the costs of the pssf program are shared by the federal government 75 and the states at least 25 under prior law state was not permitted to spend more than 10 of its federal pssf funds for administrative purposes but there was limit on use of the state pssf funds often described as matching funds that could be spent for administrative purposes beginning with fy2008 pl 109288 extends the 10 limit on spending for administrative purposes to include all funds spent under the program both federal and nonfederal or matching reporting on use of funds federal law and policy emphasize planning the use of pssf funds along with the child welfare services and other child welfare or related programs to ensure that comprehensive range of child and family services is developed in each state see appendix c planning and reporting in keeping with this emphasis states are required to annually send information to hhs on their planned use of funds under the pssf child welfare services and other child welfare and related programs beginning on june 30 2007 pl 109288 requires states to annually submit actual in addition to planned expenditure data on their use of funds under the pssf and child welfare services programs states at their own option may also provide data on actual use of funds for child welfare purposes in other programs data on the use of funds are to be submitted on standard forms which were previously used to report planned expenditures only and include for each program spending by service activity or assistance provided and the number of people served the populations targeted for services and the geographic areas served the new law also requires the us department of health and human services hhs to compile the forms showing this planned and actual use of funds and to submit them to the senate finance and house ways and means committees by september 30 of each year targeting the use of new pssf funds the fy2006 mandatory funding authorization for the pssf was raised from 305 million to 345 million by the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 but this additional 40 million was not appropriated in that law pl 109288 crs5 appropriated the newly authorized fy2006 funds and extended the 40 million annual increase in the mandatory funding authorization level through fy2011 further as shown in table 1 the law targets the use of the new funding to support monthly caseworker visits of children in foster care and to provide grants to increase the wellbeing of children affected by parent or caretakers abuse of methamphetamine or other substances table 1 distribution of targeted pssf funds in millions purpose fy2006a fy2007 fy2008 fy2009 fy2010 fy2011 total support for more frequent and improved monthly caseworker 40 0 5 10 20 20 95 visits of children in foster care support for grants to improve outcomes of children affected by parent or caretakers 0 40 35 30 20 20 145 methamphetamine abuse or other substance abuse source table prepared by the congressional research service based on section 4 of pl 109288 these funds are to remain available for states and territories to spend through fy2009 support for monthly caseworker visits between fy2006 and fy2011 pl 109288 provides total of 95 million in funds for support of monthly caseworker visits of children in foster care with primary emphasis on activities designed to improve caseworker retention recruitment training and ability to access the benefits of technology this total figure includes all of the 40 million in new fy2006 pssf funds which were appropriated by the law and will remain available for states to spend through fy2009 as well as 5 million in fy2008 10 million in fy2009 and 20 million in each of fy2010 and fy2011 states are to receive these funds on essentially the same formula basis as is the case for the current pssf program distribution is based on states relative share of children receiving food stamps in the nation states may not use these funds to supplant other federal foster care funds available under title ive of the social security act for the same purposes also for fy2008fy2011 states access to the full allotment of funds reserved for support of monthly caseworker visits will be contingent upon its spending less than 1 on support of caseworker visits for every 3 in federal funds it received for that purpose for additional provisions in pl 109288 that are related to caseworker visits of children in foster care see the discussion under monthly caseworker visit standards below grants to increase the wellbeing of and improve the permanency for children affected by methamphetamine or other substance abuse between fy2007 and fy2011 pl 109288 reserves 145 million in mandatory pssf funds to support competitive grants to regional partnerships for services and activities designed to improve the safety permanency and wellbeing of children who are in an outofhome placement or are atrisk of such placement because of crs6 parent or caretakers abuse of methamphetamine or another substance the annual setaside amounts are 40 million for fy2007 35 million for fy2008 30 million for fy2009 and 20 million in each of fy2010 and fy2011 use of grant funds the services and activities that may be funded under such grant include familybased comprehensive longterm substance abuse treatment and replication of successful models for such treatment early intervention and preventative services counseling for children and families mental health services and parenting skills training what is regional partnership regional partnerships must be established by collaborative agreement between two or more entities for example providers of child welfare services including the state child welfare agency the state agency administering federal substance abuse prevention and treatment funding local law enforcement agencies juvenile justice officials judges and school or court personnel providers of community health and mental health services and tribes including tribal child welfare agencies the state child welfare agency doesnt need to be the lead agency in the partnership applying for these funds but with one exception it must be member of each partnership the agency does not need to be part of the partnership if tribetribal child welfare agency is member of the partnership considerations in awarding grants hhs must first give consideration to the level of need demonstrated in the grant application of regional partnership once that initial consideration is made added weight must be given to those applications from regional partnerships showing the effect of methamphetamine abuse and addiction on the child welfare system in the partnership region size and duration of grant awards and reports on activities grants must extend for minimum of two years but can not be made for more than five years the annual funding to the grantee must be at least 500000 but may not be more than 1 million finally grantees will be required to submit annual reports on their activities and to incorporate information related to their performance on certain indicators to be developed by hhs in consultation with representatives of states and tribes receiving funds further hhs must annually send information regarding the use of this grant funding to the senate finance and house ways and means committees evaluation of targeted spending prior law required hhs to annually reserve 6 million in pssf funds to support research technical assistance and training related to the program and for evaluation of the program or other programs designed to achieve the same purposes pl 109288 further stipulates that hhs must annually spend less than 1 million of those reserved funds for research evaluation and technical assistance related to supporting monthly caseworker visits of children in foster care and separately less than 1 million annually for research evaluation and technical assistance related to the competitive grants to increase the wellbeing and improve the permanency of children affected by methamphetamine or other substance abuse crs7 tribal pssf program funding and access under prior law tribal pssf programs were funded with 1 setaside of the programs mandatory funding plus 2 setaside of any discretionary funds provided for the program and in recent years tribes have received annual pssf funding of roughly 5 million beginning with fy2007 pl 109288 raises the tribal setaside to 3 of the programs mandatory funding plus 3 of any discretionary funding provided for pssf however it would apply the 3 setaside of mandatory funds only after the 40 million in targeted funds are reserved for the purposes described above thus the maximum funding authorized to be made available to tribes out of the pssf would be 152 million and the minimum funding would be 92 million based on these setaside rules and the expected funding provided in the revised continuing appropriations resolution 2007 pl 1105 tribal pssf funding in fy2007 is expected to be 118 million tribal allotment of pssf funds are based on tribes relative share of individuals under the age of 21 among all eligible tribes and allotment may be less than 10000 for fy2006 about 90 tribes received pssf funds or less than third of the tribes that received funds under the child welfare services program pl 109288 permits group of tribes to form consortium and to have their pssf allotment determined based on their combined share of children under the age of 21 the effect of this provision should be to expand access to pssf funds by permitting tribes with smaller populations to band together or to band with larger tribe to ensure their allotment amount is equal to or greater than the 10000 threshold4 finally pl 109288 limits the prior law authority of hhs to exempt tribes from any pssf state plan requirement that the department determines would be inappropriate for that tribe based on the tribes size and resources the law now provides that hhs may continue to exempt tribes from requirements that limit the use of the federal pssf funds for administrative purposes to more than 10 and the requirement that provides that significant portions of pssf federal funds must be spent on each of the four service categories communitybased family support family preservation timelimited reunification and adoption promotion and support however tribes are required to comply with all other plan requirements including assurances that the funds received will not supplant other federal or nonfederal funds available for those purposes as well as other planning and reporting requirements 4 in fy2005 50 million in pssf funding was set aside for tribes and about 90 tribestribal organizations received allotments those allotments ranged from little above 10000 to about 911000 by contrast tribal allotments under the child welfare services program title ivb subpart 1 are not provided by setaside but are taken out of the amount allotted by formula to the given state in which the tribal children live and based on the tribal population under age 21 and there is funding threshold for fy2005 57 million in child welfare services funding was allotted to more than 350 tribestribal organizations and the allotment amounts ranged from less than 10 to just over 1 million crs8 amendments to the child welfare services program under prior law the child welfare services program title ivb subpart 1 of the social security act was authorized to receive funding of 325 million annually on an indefinite basis pl 109288 continues this same funding authorization level but limits it to five years fy2007fy2011 thus placing this program on the same reauthorization calender as the promoting safe and stable families program for fy2006 the child welfare services program received an appropriation of 287 million under pl 1105 fy2007 funding for the program was expected to again be 287 million purposes pl 109288 deleted lengthy prior law definition of child welfare services along with brief program purpose statement however it largely incorporated the intent of those prior provisions in new purpose section the law now describes the purpose of the child welfare services program as to promote state flexibility in the development and expansion of coordinated child and family services program that utilizes communitybased agencies and ensures all children are raised in safe loving families by 1 protecting and promoting the welfare of all children 2 preventing the neglect abuse or exploitation of children 3 supporting atrisk families through services which allow children where appropriate to remain safely with their families or return to their families in timely manner 4 promoting the safety permanence and wellbeing of children in foster care and adoptive families and 5 providing training professional development and support to ensure wellqualified child welfare workforce new aspects of this language include both the assertion that the program is intended to promote state flexibility in the development and expansion of coordinated child and family services program and the inclusion of an explicit program purpose related to providing training development and support to ensure wellqualified child welfare workforce limitation on administrative spending the total cost of the child welfare services program is shared by the federal government 75 and the state 25 prior law placed limit on the amount of program funds states could spend for administrative purposes beginning with fy2008 pl 109288 limits the use of program funds for those purposes to more than 10 which applies to both federal and nonfederal program funds the law also defines administrative costs to include cws programrelated procurement payroll management personnel functions except supervision of caseworker services management maintenance and operation of space and property data processing and computer services accounting budgeting auditing and certain travel expenses under this definition spending on caseworker services is not considered an administrative cost revised limitation on use of federal funds under prior law the state could not spend more of its federal program funds on those foster care maintenance payments adoption assistance payments or to provide child day care that was necessary solely for the employment or employment related training of parentrelative of child than the amount of federal funds it had received under this program in fy1979 in fy1979 funding for the program was 565 million or roughly 20 of the fy2006 funding level by contract pl 109288 provides that beginning with fy2008 state may spend any federal cws funds for foster care maintenance payments adoption assistance payments or child day care unless it can crs9 demonstrate to hhs that it used federal cws funds for at least one of these purposes in fy2005 if state can show this then its new annual limit on spending of federal cws funds for these three purposes combined is the amount of the federal cws funds it spent on them in fy2005 limit on use of nonfederal matching funds for purposes of providing their required 25 of the child welfare services program cost ie their matching dollars states have been permitted to count their own spending for foster care maintenance payments without any limits beginning with fy2008 pl 109 288 prohibits states from using any foster care maintenance payment expenditures for the purpose of providing their nonfederal matching dollars under the cws program unless the state can show that it used foster care maintenance payment spending to meet the matching requirement for cws funds in fy2005 if state can show this then the amount of the foster care maintenance payment spending that it counted under the program for matching purposes in fy2005 is the maximum amount of foster care maintenance payment spending it may count in the program in fy2008 and every following year state plan requirements under the child welfare services program states are required to develop plan that assures the state will meet federal requirements pl 109288 adds several new requirements it requires states to describe how they consult with and involve physicians or other appropriate medical professionals in assessing the health and wellbeing of children in foster care and in determining appropriate medical treatment for them further later than one year after the enactment of pl 109288 that is by late september 2007 states must have procedures in place to ensure continued availability of child and family services in the wake of disaster in addition pl 109288 requires states to describe by the first day of fy2008 their standards for the content and frequency of caseworker visits to children in foster care which at minimum must include monthly visit by the caseworker that is wellplanned and focused on issues pertinent to case planning and service delivery to ensure the safety permanency and wellbeing of the children5 related requirements are described below under monthly caseworker visit standards pl 109288 includes separate requirement to clarify that for children in foster care who have permanency goal of another planned permanent living arrangement such an arrangement may include placement in residential education program it also eliminated certain requirements that have little or meaning today these eliminated provisions required state to assure that the child care standards used in the social services block grant ssbg applied to any child day care services funded under cws it would train and use paraprofessional staff and volunteers to help with the program and it had as of june 1980 conducted an inventory of children in foster care finally the law reorganizes much of the cws 5 the childrens bureau has indicated that it expects states to address these new requirements in its annual progress and services report that is to be submitted by june 30 2007 see us department of health and human services administration for children and families childrens bureau acyfcbim0605 new legislation the child and family services improvement act of 2006 pl 109288 december 7 2006 crs10 program language and makes numerous related conforming amendments and some technical amendments see appendix for more specific information monthly caseworker visit standards beyond requiring specific caseworker visitation standards in state child welfare services plans described above pl 109288 requires each state before it can receive any fy2008 cws funding to provide data to hhs that show for fy2007 the percentage of children in its foster care caseload who were visited on monthly basis by their caseworkers and the percentage of those visits that occurred in the place where the child lived based on these data hhs in consultation with the state must outline as of june 30 2008 statespecific steps including target percentages to be reached to ensure that later than october 1 2011 first day of fy2012 at least 90 of the children in foster care receive monthly visit and that most of these visits occur where the child lives6 further pl 109288 provides that beginning with fy2009 if hhs determines that state has not made the requisite progress toward meeting the monthly caseworker visitation standard then the state must spend more of its own funds under the program in order to receive its full federal allotment the minimum penalty is 1 percentage point meaning the state would need to provide 26 of program funding to receive its full federal allotment and the maximum penalty is 5 percentage points meaning state would need to provide 30 of the program funding to receive its full federal allotment the amount of penalty for state is to be determined by its degree of noncompliance with the statespecific monthly caseworker visit targets established in consultation with hhs described above pl 109288 also requires hhs to prepare progress report including recommendations on state caseworker visitation standards and to submit this report to the house ways and means and senate finance committees later than march 31 2010 publication of state visitation rate finally pl 109288 requires that beginning with the report for fy2007 the annual child welfare outcomes report which hhs is required to prepare under section 479a of the social security act must include statebystate data on the percentage of children in foster care who received monthly caseworker visits and the percentage of the visits that occurred where the child lives mentoring children of prisoners reauthorization since it received its initial funding in fy2003 the mentoring children of prisoners program section 439 of the social security act has provided grants to local public or private entities to establish expand or operate programs that provide mentoring services to children of prisoners7 pl 109288 expands the purpose of 6 for more information about frequency of caseworker visits and child welfare outcomes request copy of crs congressional distribution memorandum cd061205 foster children and caseworker visits june 30 2006 by emilie stoltzfus 7 for more information on the mentoring children of prisoners program see crs report rl32633 mentoring programs funded by the federal government dedicated to continued crs11 the program by requiring hhs to enter into cooperative agreement with qualified entity to demonstrate the effectiveness of using vouchers to deliver mentoring services to children of prisoners nationwide in addition pl 109288 extended program authority for the mentoring children of prisoners program which had been scheduled to expire with fy2006 through fy2007fy2011 it also provides that funds may be appropriated for the program in each of those years at such sums as may be necessary for fy2006 the program received 495 million in funding under pl 1105 the program is expected to receive this amount in fy2007 as well pl 109288 stipulates that hhs must use competitive process to select the entity that will conduct the voucher demonstration under cooperative agreement with the agency and it requires that the entity selected must 1 identify children in need of mentoring services with priority given to indian children and children in areas that are rural are not now served by the program or that have substantial numbers of children of prisoners 2 provide families of these identified children with vouchers as well as list of qualified mentoring programs in their area 3 develop with hhs quality program standards for mentoring services including criminal background checks of prospective mentors and 4 monitor and oversee the delivery of the vouchers contingent on sufficient appropriated funding the entity must agree to provide 3000 vouchers in the first year of the cooperative agreement 8000 in the second year and 13000 in the third year the vouchers are to be valued at oneyear of services and qualified provider may receive periodic payments for voucher by providing mentoring services to the child for whom it was issued and by demonstrating that it will be able to continue these services with

senate finance committees later than 90 days after the end of the second year of the demonstration the new law also provides that the cooperative agreement may be extended two years beyond the initial

this increased mandatory funding was scored or paid for in that law pl 109288 extended the mandatory funding authorization of 345 million for the pssf through each of fy2007fy2011 pl 109288 also

never provided more than 99 million in any one year under this discretionary authorization in fy2006 and fy2007 congress provided 89 million in discretionary funding8 distribution of funds the statute entitles eligible states to receive portion of the fixed mandatory funding amount as well as portion of any discretionary funds that may be appropriated to provide certain child and family services before the funds are allocated to states however the statute provides that certain pssf funds are to be reserved for specific purposes pl 109288 amended those setaside provisions by requiring that 40

outcomes of children affected by parents or caretakers abuse of methamphetamine or another substance table 1 above shows the split of these funds by year it also increased pssf funding to tribes by as

the promoting safe and stable families program at least since the creation of the current federal child welfare program structure by the adoption assistance and child welfare act of 1980 pl 96272 congress has remained consistently concerned about the number of children in foster care and the lack of stability and permanence in their lives during the 1990s congress created new program pl 10366 now called the promoting safe and stable families program which responded to some of those concerns by the end of the 1980s there were widespread concerns about rapidly growing foster care caseload believed to be spurred by the spread of crack cocaine use and belief that too few preventive services were resulting in too many children being unnecessarily placed in foster care at the same time number of states often with the support of private foundations had begun to offer model of family preservation services that provided families with shortterm intensive services early research suggested these services would significantly reduce the number of children unnecessarily placed in foster care in this climate congress began discussions about increasing federal support for preventive services including intensive family preservation several years of legislative efforts lead initially to 1992 agreement between the house and senate on new capped entitlement funding for 1 innovative services to children and families eg family preservation services 2 substance abuse prevention and treatment and 3 respite care the agreement would have entitled states to their share of 165 million for these purposes in fy1993 rising to 575 million in fy1998 and for every succeeding year the fy1998 amount adjusted by an inflation factor the legislation provided specific allotment of the total funds for each purpose with the largest share reserved for innovative services conference agreement to accompany hr 11 102nd cong hrept 1021034 although this legislation was approved by both the senate and the house as part of an omnibus package the revenue act of 1992 it was vetoed by president george h w bush for reasons unrelated to the child welfare provisions and so did not become law original enactment one year later however child welfare advocates succeeded in including new entitlement funding for family preservation and support services in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 which created subpart 2 of title ivb of the social security act proposed by the clinton administration the 1993 legislation drew much of its inspiration from the earlier legislative work but made several notable changes among those it included less entitlement funding and deleted specific allotment of funds for substance abuse prevention and treatment and respite care both of which could nonetheless be funded out of the program that was approved as enacted the family preservation and support services provisions of pl 10366 entitled states to receive certain portion of federal funds rising from 60 million in fy1994 to less than 255 million by fy1998 to enable states and territories to develop and establish or expand and to operate program of family preservation services and communitybased family support services one percent crs37 of the funds was to be reserved for support of tribal child and family services and each state was to be allotted these new funds based on its relative share of children in the nation who receive food stamps10 to receive their full formula allocation states were required to maintain at least their fy1992 level of funding for these services and to support less than 25 of the states total family preservation and family support services program with nonfederal funding finally the new law also provided that funds were to be set aside annually to allow state highest courts to assess their need for improvements to their handling of child welfare cases 5 million for such grants in fy1995 and 10 million for each of fy1996fy1998 and separately to allow hhs to evaluate programs carried out under the new subpart or others designed to achieve the same purposes and to support research training and technical assistance related to the program 2 million in fy1994 and 6 million in each of fy1995fy1998 asfa amendments congress returned to child welfare issues when it passed the 1997 adoption and safe families act asfa pl 10589 that legislation sought to make childs safety the primary concern in all child welfare decisions and also to move foster children to permanent family more quickly with an eye toward childrens development and their concept of time members of congress were concerned that states maintained goal of family reunification long after it was apparent that such goal was inappropriate or in cases where reunification might in fact jeopardize the childs safety they were also troubled by reports that the number of adoptions out of foster care had remained virtually unchanged for years while the number of children in care had risen dramatically11 asfa renamed title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act the promoting safe and stable families program in addition as one part of asfas multiple amendments related to the safety of children congress added requirement that the safety of children be the paramount concern in administering and conducting service programs under the pssf program as part of its focus on expediting decisions around finding permanent home for children in foster care and encouraging adoption as one method of doing this congress defined two additional service categories for which states were required to use significant portions of their pssf funding timelimited family reunification services and adoption promotion and support finally congress set annual increases in the mandatory funding authorized for the program raising it from 275 million in fy1999 to 305 million in fy2001 congress also continued the annual setasides from these funds for tribal child and family services court improvements and program evaluation research training and technical assistance 10 territories receive funds based on minimum allotment of 70000 and formula that assumes low per capita income in each territory and takes into account their relative share of the population under age 21 this is the same formula used to distribute funds to the territories under title ivb subpart 1 of the social security act the child welfare services program 11 for discussion of the full range of significant child welfare policy changes made by this legislation see crs report rl30759 child welfare implementation of the adoption and safe families act by karen spar and matthew shuman crs38 the time limit for the new category of reunification services was set at within 15 months of childs removal from hisher home this is consistent with separate asfaadded requirement which provides that states must initiate termination of parental rights tpr proceedings for any child who has been in foster care for 15 of the past 22 months unless the state can show good cause why it should not do this childs adoption cannot be completed without termination of parental rights and courts are generally reluctant to grant tpr in cases where the family has not first been offered needed reunification services thus the new timelimited reunification funding category sought to ensure that asfas efforts to expedite permanency were not defeated by lack of available or provided services likewise the addition of the adoption promotion and support services category was consistent with other asfa amendments that encouraged adoption as way of attaining permanent family for children 2001 amendments program reauthorization language introduced in 2001 largely mirrored language suggested by the bush administration and initially sought to raise the annual mandatory funding level of the program to 505 million however congress subsequently changed this provision and the administration also changed its budget request to instead authorize discretionary funds above the prior mandatory funding level12 as enacted the promoting safe and stable families amendments of 2001 pl 107133 authorized 200 million in discretionary funding for the program in each of fy2002fy2006 and maintained the prior authorized mandatory funding level 305 million through fy2006 pl 107133 further provided that state was entitled to its share of any discretionary funds appropriated in the same manner ie based on its relative share of children receiving food stamps as was the case with mandatory funding additionally it provided that out of any discretionary funds appropriated and in addition to the preexisting set asides of mandatory funds for these same purposes 2 must be set aside for tribal child and family services 33 for court improvement and 33 for research evaluation training and technical assistance pl 107133 added four findings to the statute and provided four program objectives each linked to one of the four service categories funded by the program it amended the definition of family preservation services to include funding of infant safe haven programs and the definition of family support services to explicitly include funding of services that strengthen parental relationships and promote healthy marriages provided for reallotment of any unused program funds moved the statutory authorization language for the court improvement program previously freestanding into the social security act and provided that in implementing changes identified by an assessment courts could use cip funds to ensure childrens safety wellbeing and permanence in accordance with standards established in asfa and to implement corrective action plan identified as needed via federal conformity review of the child welfare agency finally it established research priorities and specified the kinds of technical assistance hhs may offer to tribes territories and states regarding implementing the promoting safe and stable families 12 for more about the funding proposals made in this reauthorization see crs report rl30894 child welfare reauthorization of the promoting safe and stable families program in the 107th congress by emilie stoltzfus and karen spar crs39 program and required the department to report to congress biennially beginning not later than april 2003 on the evaluations research and technical assistance funded with money setaside for this purpose from the pssf13 the deficit reduction act of 2005 as enacted in february 2006 the deficit reduction act pl 109171 increased the fy2006 mandatory funding authorization for the pssf program for fy2006 only to 345 million separately pl 109171 also amended the court improvement program which had been entirely funded as setaside from the pssf funding these amendments provide for two new kinds of court improvement program grants which are related to improved training and separately timely achievement of safety permanence and wellbeing for children the law appropriated 20 million for each of fy2006fy2010 total of 100 million to make these grants these funds are independent of pssf funding and are in addition to the funds already setaside from the pssf for assessing and improving court performance in child welfare proceedings the promoting safe and stable families and court improvement provisions of the deficit reduction act were incorporated into the legislation during the conference negotiations and had not been previously acted on by the senate or the house however changes to the court improvement program are consistent with recommendations made in may 2004 report by the pew commission on children in foster care and legislation introduced in the senate s 1679 and house hr 3758 sought to make similar or related court improvement changes14 the child and family services improvement act as enacted in september 2006 the child and family services improvement act of 2006 pl 109 288 extends the funding authorization of the pssf program for five years fy2007 fy2011 and annually targets the use of 40 million in new funds for the program for two purposes to support monthly caseworker visits and to improve outcomes for children affected by their parentcaretakers abuse of methamphetamine or another substance hhs is required to use some of the research evaluation and technical assistance funds it is provided under pssf to evaluate or otherwise support those newly authorized pssf activities in addition the law requires states to report on their actual as opposed to simply planned use of pssf and child welfare services funds and both increases the pssf set aside for tribal child and family services and allows access to these funds for more tribes 13 pl 107133 also added new section to title ivb subpart 2 which authorizes discretionary funds for competitive grants to eligible entities that support mentoring for children of prisoners pl 109288 extended and amended this program as described in the body of this report for more information about federal support of mentoring see crs report rl32633 mentoring programs funded by the federal government dedicated to disadvantaged youth issues and activities by edith fairman cooper 14 for more information see crs report rl33350 child welfare the court improvement program by emilie stoltzfus crs40 appendix c selected policy issues the following section was developed prior to the reauthorization of the pssf in 2006 to discuss the definition of service categories under the pssf program findings related to the effectiveness of these services as well as requirements related to planning and reporting child and family services the child and family services improvement act of 2006 pl 109288 did not amend the definition of services under the pssf program although it does require states to report information on the actual as opposed to planned spending of pssf funds further it requires hhs to use some of its research setaside to support research evaluation and technical assistance related to two new purposes for which some pssf funds are targeted improving the quality and quantity of caseworker visits of children in foster care and providing services and activities to improve the outcomes of children affected by parentcaretakers abuse of methamphetamine or another substance service categories defined states are required to spend significant portions of their pssf funding on each of four service categories family support family preservation timelimited family reunification and adoption promotion and support services the statute section 431 of the social security act defines these service categories at some length family support communitybased services to promote the safety and well being of children and families designed to increase the strength and stability of families including adoptive foster and extended families to increase parents confidence and competence in their parenting abilities to afford children safe stable and supportive family environment to strengthen parental relationships and promote healthy marriages and otherwise to enhance child development family preservation services for children and families designed to help families including adoptive and extended families at risk or in crisis including service programs designed to help children safely return to families from which they have been removed or be placed for adoption or with legal guardian or if adoption or legal guardianship is determined not to be safe and appropriate for the child in some other planned permanent living arrangement preplacement preventive services programs such as intensive family preservation programs designed to help children at risk of foster care placement remain safely with their families service programs designed to provide followup care for families to whom child has been returned after foster care placement respite care of children to provide temporary relief of parents and other caregivers including foster parents services designed to improve parenting skills by reinforcing parents confidence in their strengths and helping them to identify where improvement is needed and to obtain assistance in improving those skills with respect to matters such as child development family budgeting coping with stress health and nutrition and crs41 infant safe haven programs to provide way for parent to safely relinquish newborn infant at safe haven designated pursuant to state law timelimited family reunification services and activities provided to child that is removed from hisher home and placed in foster care and to the parents or primary caregiver of such child in order to facilitate the reunification of the child safely appropriately and within timely fashion but only during the 15month period that begins on the date that the child is considered to have entered foster care individual group and family counseling inpatient residential or outpatient substance abuse services mental health services assistance to address domestic violence services designed to provide temporary child care and therapeutic services for families including crisis nurseries transportation to or from any of the services and activities described adoption promotion and support services and activities designed to encourage more adoptions out of the foster care system when adoptions promote the best interests of children including such activities as pre and postadoptive services and activities designed to expedite the adoption process and support adoptive families service category overlap even relatively quick reading of these definitions reveals that in many cases they define mission rather than provide list of specific activities that are expected to achieve this mission further the pssf service categories have similar and in some cases even identical missions at the same time while the service categories can be understood as having overlapping missions or even in certain cases as subsets of each other each of the pssf services categories have different target populations and as the legislative history shows they were created by congress to meet separate if related goals family support services have the broadest target population and in philosophy aim to bolster the functioning of any family in given community family preservation services are generally understood to serve far narrower group of families those where children are at imminent risk of removal to foster care meaning in most cases that child has already experienced abuse or neglect and including some families where child has been removed to foster care and reunification efforts are underway federal child welfare funding for family support and family preservation services was instituted at time when congress was particularly concerned about the burgeoning foster care caseload the services were intended to prevent the need for foster care placement whenever possible and the new funding for these services was the centerpiece of the child welfare legislation in which they were enacted pl 10366 crs42 timelimited reunification services may be understood as subset of family preservation services and are explicitly meant to serve the needs of children and families who have been separated for 15 months or less because the child is placed in foster care adoption promotion and support services aim to encourage families seeking to adopt from foster care and to support those who have done so such services might also be understand as subset of family support services or in the case of adoptive families in crisis as family preservation service federal funding for these services was not the central creation of the adoption and safe families act asfa pl 10589 rather congress increased pssf funding to some extent and required states to spend money on timelimited reunification and adoption promotion and support to augment asfas central goals of promoting safety and permanency for children at the time congress remained deeply concerned about the size of the foster care caseload but asfa helped shift the focus of this concern from policies primarily intended to prevent entries into foster care to policies that sought to safely expedite exits from care state planned spending by category federal statute as interpreted in hhs policy requires states to spend at least 20 of their pssf funds on each of the four service categories15 collectively states reported that they intended to spend their fy2002 pssf funds as follows 29 for family support 30 for family preservation 21 for timelimited reunification and 20 for adoption promotion and support given that family support and family preservation have received dedicated funding the longest and that their service goals and target populations are more expansive program evaluators note that the two newest services categories timelimited family reunification and adoption promotion and support have become wellestablished in the continuum of pssffunded services16 15 the statute provides that states must spend significant portion of funds of each of the four categories hhs has interpreted this to mean that state must spend 20 of the funds allotted to it on each service category unless the state can provide an especially strong rationale for not doing this see acyfcbpi0401 feb 2 2004 16 james bell associates analysis of states annual progress and services reports and child and family services plans 19992002 apr 2002 pp 4950 for fy2002 eight states did not plan to spend at least 20 of their pssf funds on either timelimited family reunification or adoption promotion and support but planned to use other state or federal fund for these services the general accounting office gao now called the government accountability office surveyed states on their fy2002 actual spending of pssf funds when compared to the bell associates analysis of states planned spending pssf funds in that year the gao survey shows states reporting different spending proportions for categories that most closely match the pssf categories these were family supportprevention 50 family preservation 12 family reunification 9 and adoption support and preservation services 11 apart from differences that might be attributed to actual versus estimated spending the overlapping nature of these service categories and various definitions employed by gaostates and james bell makes strict comparison impossible us general accounting office child welfare enhanced federal oversight of title ivb could provide states additional information to improve services gao03956 sept 2003 p 14 data on pssf spending for more recent years have not been compiled or analyzed on national basis crs43 at the same time because states may choose to include the same given activity in more than one service category this spreading of resources across categories could ideally mean that states have full range of child and family services available to those who are not yet in need of extensive child welfare services those who need such services to ensure that children and their parents can safely live together rather than be separated via foster care placement those for whom the services are needed to ensure short foster care stay and permit early reunification and those for whom the services support successful creation and functioning of permanent adoptive families effectiveness of services congress required hhs to evaluate the effectiveness of programs funded under title ivb subpart 2 as part of its initial approval of funding for family preservation and family support services in the early 1990s hhs used those funds to support three largescale evaluations one looked at overall implementation issues for the program second looked at the effectiveness of two particular models of family preservation services both providing relatively intensive casework and the third looked at the effectiveness of very wide range of family support services findings from these evaluations are discussed below similar largescale evaluations of timelimited reunification services or of adoption promotion and support services have been made however these services may in part be subsets of some kinds of family preservation and family support programs further congress amended the statutory language on evaluations in 2001 pl 107133 to include specific research priorities among these are promising program models in the pssf service categories particularly timelimited reunification services and postadoption services as noted earlier the 2006 amendments pl 109288 require hhs to use some of its setaside funds to fund research evaluation and technical assistance related to supporting improved quality and quantity of caseworker visits of foster children 1 million annually and to providing services or activities to improve the outcome of children affected by their parents or other caretakers abuse of methamphetamine or other substance intensive family preservation services when congress began discussion of funding these services in the early 1990s great deal of optimism existed about the ability of intensive family preservation services to costeffectively reduce the number of placements in foster care since that time multiple program evaluations have not shown that intensive family preservation services lower placement risk for the children and families they serve when compared to children and families receiving standard inhome casework services in addition both children and families who received standard inhome casework services and those receiving intensive family preservation services were found to have similar relatively low levels of maltreatment recurrence after initiation of the services and to exhibit similar levels of family functioning in other words receipt of intensive family preservation services did not reduce outofhome placement or crs44 maltreatment recurrence and did not improve family functioning beyond what normal casework services achieved17 these evaluations did not compare nor were they designed to compare the placement outcomes for families receiving services versus outcomes for those who received services and they should not be understood as proof that the families served did not benefit from or need the services instead the evaluations were designed to test whether particular manner of delivering the same kinds of caseworker activities eg anything from help paying utility bill to counseling about effective and appropriate child discipline could produce better outcomes for children and families the mostscrutinized intensive family preservation services delivery model homebuilders provides that services must be initiated quickly within 72 hours of crisis that precipitated imminent child removal that they must be intensive caseworkers are to be assigned more than two families to work with must be available to those families 24 hours day seven days week and are expected to swiftly offer any or all of full range of material and clinical aids needed and they are to be of short duration 46 weeks as these characteristics suggest the target population for the delivery of services via the homebuilders model is families where children are at imminent risk of removal this is especially critical to the models theory of effectiveness which rests on an aspect of crisis theory and posits that family in crisis is at juncture where it is particularly amenable to change in practice and for variety of reasons providing intensive family preservation services to families and children who are imminent risk of foster care removal has proven difficult in the foursite study contracted by hhs and jointly conducted by westat the chapin hall center for children and james bell associates the evaluators found that even though special precautions were taken to ensure only families at imminent risk were studied very small percentages of the control group children those are children who were randomly assigned to receive regular caseworker services rather than intensive family preservation services were actually placed in foster care within 30 days of their assignment to the study the share of control group children who were not placed in foster care during this time period ranged from 89 to 95 this was very similar to the share of experimental 17 there have been multiple evaluations and synthesis reviews of studies including studies that used the most rigorous evaluation design random assignment not all of these studies made all of the findings mentioned in this paragraph however the finding that intensive family preservation services do not reduce placement when compared to children receiving regular casework services is wellestablished this report discusses findings of the multi site hhsfunded evaluation of family preservation services which was conducted by westat chapin hall center for children and james bell associates the report studied three sites in louisville ky memphis tn and seven counties in new jersey where homebuilders model was applied and fourth philadelphia pa where specialized intensive family preservation services model was used overall the findings were similar across these sites us department of health and human services evaluation of family preservation and reunification programs final report volumes 1 and 2 dec 2002 crs45 group children not placed in foster care during the first 30 days after their assignment to the study 89 to 9918 given that targeting intensive family preservation services on children at imminent risk for removal has been problem for most or all of the evaluations of this service delivery model and that for the multisite hhs study the evaluators developed special tools meant to ensure only families most at risk were included in the study researchers suggest that optimal targeting may never be achieved these evaluators also questioned whether many families coming into contact with child welfare services and referred to family preservation services understand themselves to be at crisis point noting that the lives of families served are often full of difficulties externally imposed and internally generated they suggest that the imminent removal of child might simply be understood as part of set of ongoing problems rather than as crisis for families with chronic problems they suggest short term dose of services matter how intense would be unlikely to resolve all or many of the chronic concerns noting that the intensive family preservation services provided did not harm families the evaluators also made it clear that services for many families whose children are not in foster care are still needed however given the heterogeneity of the child welfare needs of these families child behavioral problems child abuse child neglect suspected child abuse or neglect etc they suggest that single service delivery model providing access to relatively general services is unlikely to work for everyone19 what next for family preservation services the federal statute does not provide that specific family preservation services delivery model must be used by states and hhs explicitly declined to do this when it issued program regulations in addition the discouraging evaluation data on intensive family preservation services is not new some suggestions of the current findings were available even as the program was being federally implemented in the middle 1990s states then have had ample time to adjust or otherwise change their models of service delivery although much remains to be learned about what the most effective services and delivery of those services might be researchers have suggested more study of the effectiveness of specific caseworker activities more effective and more selectively delivered parent training classes which are staple service in both preservation and reunification cases and different service delivery models or activities on behalf of 18 ibid pp 91 through 94 while the low rate of foster care placement strongly suggests that the evaluation did not successfully target families in which children were at imminent risk of removal the evaluators note that even looked at over the 18month period during which the study followed families those that received intensive family preservation services did not have reduced likelihood of placement finally even though placement was not imminent for these families they do appear to have been at greater risk for placement and thus arguably in need of services indeed 18 months after the study was initiated anywhere from about onefifth to more than onethird of the families receiving family preservation services as well as those in the control group who did not receive services had experienced at least one placement 19 ibid pp 911920 crs46 specific subgroups of child welfare clients eg young mothers or families with substance abuse concerns are needed20 need for inhome services apart from the specific way inhome services are delivered to families there remains an apparent need for services to families in which children have not been removed from their homes but have been maltreated in those homes of the estimated 872000 children found to be victims of child maltreatment in fy2004 little more than 40 received inhome services following the investigation that confirmed their maltreatment an additional 19 were removed to foster care while the remaining 41 of these child victims continued to live at home and received postinvestigation services of any kind while some of the children may not have been served because their parents refused assistance offered unlike removal to foster care parents generally must voluntarily participate in services offered to intact families researchers also note that there may not be enough of the kind of services needed or there may be long waiting lists for the services21 20 see for instance julia littell and john r shuerman what works best for whom closer look at intensive family preservation services children and youth services review 24 septoct 2002 910673699 which compared subgroups of service recipients based on characteristics

who reported some difficulty paying bills it found that provision of clothingfurnituresupplies and housing assistance was associated with reduced risk of subsequent maltreatment while participation in an income support program increased risk of maltreatment at the same time provision of cash aid and clothingfurniture supplies were found to decrease the likelihood of outofhome placement richard p

that parenttraining is widely prescribed by child welfare agencies and by judges even when poor parenting is not cited as concern by the child welfare worker but that the training is often made

arguably in need of services who do not receive them caselevel analysis of findings in the initial child and family services review cfsr shows that states were less successful in meeting the needs of children and families served in their own homes than those with children in foster care this analysis found that in the onsite review of cases inhome cases were significantly more likely than foster care cases to receive an area needing improvement rating for number of key indicators related to ensuring the wellbeing of children and families these items in which inhome cases were significantly more likely to receive this rating than foster care cases include those related to assessing child and family needs and providing needed services involving childrenfamilies in case planning adequate faceto face worker visits with children and ensuring that children receive services to meet their educational mental health and physical health needs inhome cases were also significantly more likely to be rated lower on the safety item related to reducing risk of harm to children served than were foster care cases22 this same study also reported on common challenges to better state performance and while these may apply to either foster care or inhome cases number are directly related to the indicators listed above and for which the onsite case reviews revealed specific weakness for inhome cases common challenges23 associated with those indicators and identified for many states include the agency doesnt consistently provide sufficient services to address risk of harm to children particularly in the inhome services cases the agency doesnt consistently monitor families to assess service participation and change in risk factors to protect children in their homes and prevent removal the agency doesnt consistently provide appropriate services to meet the identified needs of children and parents fathers mothers and children age appropriate are not sufficiently involved in case planning 22 general finding from the child and family services review date or author given accessed oct 7 2004 p 30 this analysis required use of unpublished cfsr case files and may have been prepared by james bell associates the full report is online at httpwwwacfdhhsgovprogramscbcwmonitoringresultsgenfindings04genfindings0 4pdf 23 ibid pp 810 the report identified common challenges among the 35 states where the cfsr was conducted in fy2002fy2004 states reviewed in fy2001 were not included because information was extracted using content analysis of state final cfsr reports and the format requirements were somewhat different for reports based on reviews done in that year the report includes any issue found in at least onethird of those 35 states as common challenge however all of the issues listed in this report were noted as challenge for fewer than onehalf of those states crs48 the frequency of facetoface contacts between workers and children isnt consistently sufficient to ensure childrens safety and well being24 the agency is not consistent in providing services to meet childrens identified educationrelated needs the number of dentistsdoctors in the state willing to accept medicaid is not sufficient to meet the need there is lack of mental health services for children and the agency doesnt consistently conduct mental health assessments in sum while children in foster care are much discussed as the barometer of states child welfare performance states inhome case loads are generally more sizeable than their foster care caseloads and the data suggest that not all families are receiving needed services nor are those receiving services having their needs fully met25 family support services where family preservation services may be requested once family has come to the attention of the child welfare agency eg child maltreatment allegation andor finding made family support services seek to reach families that have not reached that threshold the central object of these services is to ensure child never experiences abuse or neglect and to improve the functioning of parents on behalf of their children typically these services have been provided by community agencies or groups rather than by the state or local public child welfare agency and the target family group is much broader than those typically served by the child welfare agency although family support services may be described and implemented as intended for families atrisk of child abuse or neglect in theory they are designed to benefit any family in particular community or neighborhood overall families that receive family support services such as parent training or child development classes would seem much more likely to seek out or volunteer for the service as opposed to families that may be offered these same services or may be ordered by the court to participate in them for family preservation 24 see also us department of health and human services office of the inspector general state standards and capacity to track frequency of caseworker visits with children in foster care oei040300350 dec 2005 this report does not deal with inhome cases however it found that while most states had standards regarding the number of visits child in foster care should receive each month more than half of the states could not produce automated statewide reports of the number of caseworker visits actually received by children and that of 20 states that could produce these reports seven showed that fewer than half of the foster care children were visited monthly on average most but not all of those states had monthly visit standard for children in foster care 25 the child and family services review is intended to comprehensively review states child welfare agency performance on behalf of the children and families it serves an in depth case review of sample of 50 cases generally was looked at as part of each of these reviews of these cases half related to children in foster care and half were related to children served in their homes for more information see crs report rl32968 child welfare state performance on child and family services reviews by emilie stoltzfus crs49 study design citing the vast range of programs that might fall under the family support rubric the abt associates researchers who conducted the hhs funded study opted to conduct metaanalysis of program success26 this evaluation technique required the researchers to identify previously conducted studies of range of family support programs and to organize the data collected in these studies in such way that they could generate findings across these studies for the family support studies the researchers coded information from 665 studies representing 260 different family support programs that were conducted after 1965 in canada the united states or great britain kinds of programs evaluated to be included in the metaanalysis study needed to evaluate program that provided services intended to improve child outcomes by strengthening the capacity of parents to support their childrens development27 accordingly nearly all the programs included in the metaanalysis had goals of improved parenting 98 and child development 91 most services were delivered in the family home 62 but other settings in descending order of frequency included hospital or clinic school community center university college and public or private agency home visits were primary service delivery mode followed in descending order of frequency by parent meetingsclasses groups parentchild classesgroups and group early education for children most programs 87 used at least some staff with degree and formal training finally although the original family support programs were neighborhoodbased and available to all in the community many programs targeted specific populations about 88 of the family support programs included in the metaanalysis targeted families believed to be at certain environmental risk eg poverty risk of abuse or neglect teen parenthood those with certain biological risks eg lowbirth weight baby developmental delay behavior problems or combination of these populations most services were available to families for less than one year and families received relatively small amounts of service measured in number of hours per month findings overall the metaanalysis showed that family support programs have small but consistent and statistically significant positive effects in childrens 26 abt associates national evaluation of family support programs volume the meta analysis us department of health and human services washington dc 2001 27 these studies included both quasiexperimental research findings and experimental research findings separately coded to allow for comparison in addition the researchers coded descriptive information for 167 family support programs where the studies did not have outcome information this was done to ensure the full spectrum of family support programs were included in the metaanalysis however based on this descriptive data the researchers noted that while both evaluated and unevaluated programs had similar goals and types of services there were certain differences between the programs thus they concluded that the full range of family support programs has not been truly evaluated descriptive differences they note are that evaluated programs were more likely to target their services to specific population and to use home visits as their primary mode of service delivery and they were less likely to use centerbased early childhood education as primary mode of service delivery and to use paraprofessionals or nonprofessionals to provide parenting education crs50 cognitive development and their social and emotional development28 programs that had larger positive effects on childrens cognitive outcomes were those that focused on children with special needs either biological or developmental or provided early childhood education directly to children or provided parents with opportunities for peer support programs that used home visiting as primary service had less effect on childrens cognitive outcomes although on an overall basis child safety was not otherwise shown to be meaningfully affected programs that targeted teen parents with young children and combined case management with parentchild activities were more effective in protecting children from accidental injury abuse or neglect finally family support programs were not shown to have meaningful effect on childrens health and physical development with regard to parentfamily outcomes the study showed that overall family support programs have small but consistent and statistically significant positive effects in parenting attitudes and knowledge parenting behavior and family functioning29 programs that used professional staff to help parents to be effective adults and that provide opportunities for parents to meet in support groups were more effective in producing positive outcomes for parents the programs that had greatest effect on parents attitudes towards and knowledge of childrearing and child development were those that work with special needs children and provided opportunities for peer support the metaanalysis found or little meaningful effect of family support programs on parent mental health nor on family economic self sufficiency other services in contrast to the large scale family preservation and family support studies hhs has recently directed the pssf evaluation funds towards generally smaller scale projects that look at one kind of service or program design often at single site in recent years projects funded include those related to strengthening and promoting healthy marriage the meaning of termination of parental rights for older foster children fathers involvement in permanency planning and child welfare casework early head start services provided to child welfare families interventions for substance abusing parents postadoption services and adoption promotion efforts intensive family reunification efforts and provision of crisis nurseryrespite care service research andor evaluation is ongoing for most of these projects30 28 however the researchers caution that in each of these cases small group of programs accounted for the statistically significant positive effect that is more than half of the studies reported an effect size that was considered not statistically significant 29 however the researchers caution that in each of these cases small group of programs accounted for the statistically significant positive effect that is more than half of the studies reported an effect size that was considered not statistically

safe and stable families program 2003 crs51 planning and reporting the 1993 law pl 10366 establishing funding for child and family services under title ivb subpart 2 both encouraged and required states to engage in planning how these services would be delivered the law requires states to consult with appropriate public and nonprofit private agencies with experience in administering services to children and families and to jointly with hhs prepare fiveyear plan which establishes the goals the state intends to accomplish and describes the methods that will be used to measure progress toward accomplishing those goals it further requires states to annually review and report on progress toward achieving these goals and to make any necessary adjustments to the plan that reflect changed circumstances states must continually be engaged in this planning and review process that is every five years the state must establish new fiveyear plan and begin annual progress reviews and reports of that plan beyond these requirements the 1993 legislation encouraged states to take planning seriously by permitting each state to use up to 1 million of its first year grant fy1994 for planning purposes and providing that this spending on planning did not need to be matched with state spending the policy guidance and subsequent regulations from hhs further encouraged and required this extensive planning as ultimately implemented by hhs the regulation consolidated number of child welfare program planning requirements into single child and family services plan states submit this single fiveyear plan the most recent was due in june 2004 for the period fy2005fy2009 and annual progress reports in addition to the requirements related to the pssf programs this plan must include the assurances required for receipt of funds for child welfare services title ivb subpart 1 of the social security act basic state grants section 106 of the child abuse prevention and treatment act and the chafee foster care independence program and related education and training vouchers both in section 477 of the social security act also as part of the annual progress report states must estimate their total child welfare spending for the upcoming fiscal year across the full continuum of services and noting amounts used from all federal funding streams as well as state and local funding finally hhs permits states to use their pssf funds for these planning purposes without having those funds count towards the limit on use of pssf funds which is set at 10 both the notice of proposed rulemaking nprm and the final rule for implementing title ivb subpart 2 emphasized the importance of collaborating broadly when creating this plan to ensure the full continuum of child and family services was considered and planned for and to leverage as many resources as possible for the programs purposes31 studying the implementation of the program james bell associates found that most states engaged in extensive planning and that the focus on collaboration meant increased community and consumer involvement 31 proposed rule 59 federal register 191 oct 4 1994 pp 5064650672 final rule 61 federal register 223 nov 18 1996 pp 5863258633 hhs did not revise these rules following the addition of two new service categories by asfa pl 10589 but has instead issued policy guidance concerning changes necessitated by asfa and subsequent reauthorizations crs52 initially over the 14 states where implementation case studies were conducted most 8 developed statelevel collaborative body that made the decisions about how pssf funds would be used that is to say the locus of decisionmaking was outside the state child welfare agency in part this doubt stems from the inclusion of family support on an equal basis with family preservation in the statute where family preservation has long history of child welfare agency implementation family support was and remains outside the traditional child welfare agency purview following passage of asfa pl 10589 and the addition of two new service categories timelimited family reunification and adoption promotion and support both of which were much more closely aligned with traditional child welfare programs the locus of decisionmaking shifted back toward the state child welfare agency in the majority of the case study sites32 limited information on current program since the bell study which as one part of its implementation study made an analysis of the annual progress reports submitted by states for fy1999fy2002 there has been comparable study of state spending plans that analysis showed that most states were spreading their pssf funding across all four categories at the same time that report noted that the overlap in service categories because family support and family preservation might fund the same service but presumably for different population and because the newest service categories timelimited reunification and adoption promotion and support could be understood as subsets of the initial service categories of family support and family preservation it was not easy to accurately report spending in the statutorily defined categories in addition the consolidated planning and lack of single plan format made it hard to consistently track how funds were being spent across the states33 the researchers suggested that how funds were used or planned to be used might better be understood based on where the service was delivered in the home child welfare office school community center clinic etc andor who the service was targeted on families in process of reunification families with recently reported abuse or neglect teenage parents parents of children with problem behavior etc the report did track the planned use of pssf funds for 17 specific kinds of activities between fy1999fy2002 these included home visiting and family centers information and referral recreation basic needs employment services health services child care prevention services parent support parent skills training mentoring respite care domestic violence drugalcohol assessmenttreatment counselingmental health services family preservation more narrowly defined than the statute timelimited family reunification and adoption promotion and support although the researchers had increasing difficulty in linking pssf funding to specific activities due to consolidation of program planning and reporting they noted 32 us department of health and human services family preservation and family support

descriptions of the family preservation family support time limited family reunification and adoption promotion and support services they intend to provide under the plan in the upcoming year the populations to be served and the geographic areas where the services will be available just prior to the 2006 amendments pl 109288 these plans were sent to hhs regional offices of the administration for children and families acf rather than to the central washington dc office and while they are required to be made available to the public they were for the most part not produced in any standard format and were not necessarily easy to compare or collect further all of the reporting requirements were prospective providing information on what state plans to do with its money rather than what it has actually done with the money pl 109288 amended the reporting requirements so that certain parts of the report must now include information on how the state actually spent pssf and child welfare services funds as well as continuing to provide information on planned spending in addition the law requires hhs to annually compile this information in report for congress crs54 appendix d selected federal programs with related purposes some other federal programs share purposes similar to those of the promoting safe and stable families program communitybased child abuse prevention cbcap authorized by title ii of the child abuse prevention and treatment act capta the community based child abuse prevention cbcap program provides funds to each state including the district of columbia territories and tribes to support community based services to prevent child maltreatment the program purposes most closely match the category of pssf services described as family support however funds under this program are not available for direct use by the state child welfare agency but must be sent to communitybased groups that provide family support and family resource services funds are distributed by formula to lead state agency which may or may not be the state child welfare agency the lead agency is responsible for ensuring coordination of services and for distributing funds to communitybased groups that provide or can refer families to core family resource and support services the statute describes these core services to among other things include parent education mutual support and self help voluntary home visiting and respite care other services which cbcap local grantees may provide access to include referrals to counseling for adoption for those seeking to adopt or to relinquish child for adoption child care early childhood development and intervention services referrals to services and supports to meet special needs of families with children with disabilities referrals to job readiness services referrals to educational services life management skills training and others like title i of capta the senate health education labor and pensions help and the house education and labor committees have generally exercised jurisdiction over this program it was most recently amended and reauthorized in 2003 pl 10836 that legislation raised the programs authorization level to 80 million for fy2004 and such sums as necessary for each of fy2005fy2008 however the program has never received more than the 43 million that was appropriated for it in fy2005 for fy2006 the program received 42 million and under pl 1105 it is expected to receive the same sum in fy2007 child welfare services authorized by title ivb subpart 1 child welfare services is the oldest federal program supporting state child welfare activities and was first authorized as part of the original 1935 social security act34 pl 109288 made number of changes to this program and by changing its funding authorization from indefinite year limit to the same schedule as the pssf program funding authorization will expire with fy2011 appears to promote somewhat closer alignment of the programs child welfare services funds are distributed to states 34 the program was originally authorized in title v part 3 of the social security act and was moved to newly created title ivb by the social security act amendments of 1967 crs55 including the district of columbia territories and tribes the funds may be used to support broad range of services to children and families which are intended to protect children who have been abused or neglected or are at risk of maltreatment and may take various forms ranging from counseling and other supports for parents intended to improve child wellbeing prevent child abuse and neglect and preserve family to removal of the children from their homes and provision of services to parents to enable safe and appropriate return of children to their own homes when efforts to reunite are not appropriate or do not succeed child welfare services may include termination of parental rights placement of the children for adoption and provision of post adoption services states may use child welfare services generally for wider range of activities than are permitted under pssf and 2003 general accounting office gao study found that despite considerable overlap in the purposes states used the bulk of their child welfare services and pssf grants to fund significantly different activities for instance while states reported spending both child welfare services and pssf funds to support family supportprevention family preservation family reunification and adoption support and preservation services they reported using just 11 of their child welfare services funds for these purposes compared to 82 of their pssf funds states expended the largest share of child welfare funds 71 for child welfare worker salaries administration and management child protective services and foster care maintenance payments pssf expenditures for those purposes equaled just 8 of state pssf spending35 the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee have exercised jurisdiction over child welfare services since 1990 the program has had discretionary funding authorization level of 325 million but it has never received more than 295 million in given year for fy2006 the program is funded at 287 million and under pl 1105 it is expected to receive the same level of funding in fy2007 other child welfare and related programs several additional child welfare programs primarily support research or demonstration projects related to adoption as well as to services to help certain families at special risk of child abuse or neglect each of these programs is funded by discretionary appropriations and any appropriated funds are distributed on competitive basis to eligible entities these programs include adoption opportunities abandoned infants assistance and adoption awareness funding authorization for the adoption opportunities fy2007 funding 27 million and abandoned infants assistance act fy2007 funding 12 million was extended through fy2008 by pl 10836 handled in the senate help and house education and workforce committee funding authorization for the adoption awareness programs which were included in

authority36 additional programs that support primarily the family support goals of pssf include early head start head start and the healthy start initiative like family support programs in general the populations served by these programs are much broader than those generally served by the child welfare population and these programs are not further described here37 some nondedicated federal funding used for pssf purposes many states also make use of federal funding streams that are not specifically or exclusively provided for child welfare purposes but for which federal law includes certain child welfare activities as purposes or permissible uses of funds measured by state use of the funds for child welfare purposes the largest of these are the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant the social services block grant ssbg and medicaid an urban insitute survey of state fy2002 spending on child welfare found that in that year state child welfare agencies spent about 47 billion from these federal funding streams of which some 28 13 billion 13 billion was used to support prevention activities eg prevent teenage pregnancy prevent drug use prevent child abuse family reunification efforts and inhome support as well as child protective services screening and investigating reported child maltreatment 38 while state child welfare agencies have in recent years had access to considerable tanf ssbg and medicaid funds because these funds are not appropriated solely for child welfare agencies they cannot necessarily count on their continued availability instead their access to these federal funds is generally conditioned on the funding decisions made by others in the state eg discretion about how funds are used may rest with the state legislature or in different state executive agency and may further be limited by federal legislative and administrative changes to these programs 36 fy2007 funding amounts are estimates based on pl 1105 see crs report

targeted case management tcm on behalf of children in foster care further the ability of state child welfare agencies to use tanf funds may be affected by increased work requirements included in the deficit reduction act which are expected to necessitate greater state spending of tanf on job related costs such as training and child care40 finally congress has greatly reduced the amount of funding for ssbg which includes among its five primary purposes preventing or remedying neglect abuse or exploitation of children and adults unable to protect their own interests or preserving rehabilitating or reuniting families annual funding for ssbg stood at 28 billion when the congress enacted new child welfare services funding now called the promoting safe and stable families program in 1993 in 1996
