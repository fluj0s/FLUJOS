your say in the forum medialaw experts differ over whether the cincinnati enquirer has created bad situation for other news organizations by deciding to turn over subpoenaed notes from its retracted report on the chiquita banana company the records were subpoenaed by special prosecutor investigating the possibility that stolen materials were used for story about the business practices of chiquita brands international inc but experts agree that the subpoena flap is just another strange turn in story that has journalists and nonjournalists alike shaking their heads in confusion the saga started on may 3 when the enquirer published series of stories questioning the cincinnatibased companys practices the company denied the stories and said they were based on voicemail messages of key executives that had been stolen from its phone system at first the newspaper stood by its story but on june 28 in frontpage retraction that ran for three straight days the paper disavowed the reports revealed that it had paid chiquita more than 10 million in settlement and fired the lead reporter on the series michael gallagher since then special prosecutor has been appointed and grand jury has begun looking into the case the fbi and the hamilton county ohio sheriff are also investigating the circumstances surrounding the stories and the retraction this week the newspapers lawyer jack rubenstein said that the enquirer was complying with all subpoenas issued by the special prosecutor and that four newspaper employees also had been subpoenaed and questioned by investigators rubenstein said the employees did not testify before grand jury but neither he nor harry m whipple the enquirers president and publisher would provide any more details about the case or discuss the rationale for complying with the subpoenas did the willingness of the newspaper to comply with the subpoenas without fight set bad precedent for other news organizations two attorneys who specialize in media law jonathan hart of the washington dc firm of dow lohnes albertson and george freeman of the new york times said they doubted there would be much fallout from the enquirers decision newspapers voluntary compliance with subpoena doesnt create bad legal precedent said hart resisting subpoena and losing before judge can just because newspaper doesnt go to court and fight subpoena doesnt mean it cant go to court and fight the next subpoena although its not whats usually done one newspapers decision to comply with subpoena wouldnt necessarily affect another newspaper said freeman because each newspaper will do what it wants to in given situation maybe the facts of this case dictate that this is what should be done but guido stempel retired member of the journalism faculty at ohio university who taught media law for more than 30 years said he thought the enquirers action was absolutely bad precedent other news organizations ought to be concerned about the fact that they didnt fight the subpoena and particularly other news organizations in ohio since presumably whatever is being done is being done under the provisions of ohio law said stempel if youre in cleveland youre long way from cincinnati but this thing potentially could affect you jane kirtley of the reporters committee for freedom of the press said it was unheard of for news organization to comply with subpoena if turning over materials such as notes background research or other materials would reveal confidential sources or would give someone good lead for uncovering confidential sources and even if confidential sources are not at issue she said its unusual for news organization to comply with subpoenas seeking anything but published materials although the newspapers decision is not in the strictest legal sense precedent of any sort kirtley said she expected the action to have ramifications you really only have legal court precedent if you have court ruling and it is binding precedent only if it is rendered by sufficiently upperlevel court kirtley said but in practical sense my experience is that news organizations that have reputation for complying with subpoenas tend to get more of them and that competitors and colleagues tend to get more of them not only does the compliance create an expectation on the part of the subpoenaing party that the news organization will comply whenever challenged kirtley said but it also may make it harder for another news outlet to fight its subpoena the judge might say well wxyz down the road doesnt have problem complying whats your problem she said one thing that all the media law experts agreed on is that questions about the chiquita story and how it has been handled by the newspaper are not likely to go away soon this things odd from beginning to end said kirtley freeman the times inhouse lawyer said the strangest thing that i find frankly is that they the enquirer didnt get release for the reporter gallagher when the newspaper negotiated its payment and settlement with chiquita normally if youre going to pay that much money you would get release for all your employees now it looks as if the case is going to be litigated anyway so the dirty laundry will be aired anyway kirtley said she too found it kind of odd that the newspaper didnt shield gallagher in the agreement from purely pragmatic standpoint you would think that however unhappy with gallaghers conduct they were they wouldnt want to do something to undermine their own interests maybe they thought that by being cooperative they would be able to somehow distance themselves from gallagher she said kirley also said she was puzzled by the papers statement in its retraction that illegal methods were employed in gathering the materials for the story as lawyer i would never say that client of mine had broken the law she said i would wait until jury so adjudicated before i would say that they could have said that he did not comply with their own internal rules and left it at that stempel meanwhile is puzzled over why the enquirer has backed off this so far and so fast all the way along there are people who are saying were not sure how they got the information but its not like the nervegas story that led to the recent cnn retraction where were arguing about the information nobody has really claimed that the story is basically incorrect he said they may have broken the law somehow or other in this whole process but even assuming that they broke the law there are some real questions about how chiquita was operating and thats gotten pushed under the table stempel said reese cleghorn dean of the university of maryland school of journalism said he thought the subpoena flap was just another example of how the newspaper was being excessively furtive about the story they have not been forthcoming in describing what they did and why they reached this agreement and it seems to they have gone well beyond the usual boundaries of caution in denying important information to their readers cleghorn said i dont know whether this is another example where editors have allowed the lawyers to determine what they do with their function as journalists but it may well be he said they are not informing people about things that they should inform the public about cleghorn continued i can imagine if they were the post toasties company that they might follow the lawyers advice to the hilt but they are newspaper kirtley said she was troubled that the enquirer and news organizations in general may be drifting into mode that says legal rules of evidence apply to the journalistic process the standard of proof in court and the standard of proof in journalism are two different things she said even if the enquirer reporter did something wrong and illegal in obtaining the voicemail tapes she said that does not mean the whole story is wrong the exclusionary rule might omit that evidence in courtroom using the fruit of the poisonous tree theory but that is not the case with news story she said thats not journalism thats law kirtley said its very risky to try to import rules of law into the journalistic process journalism is supposed to be pursuit of truth court cases have never been about that ever if they were we wouldnt have the exclusionary rule top contact us who we are search newsstand the forum
