policy analyst resources science and industry division susan r fletcher senior analyst in international environmental policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30594biosafety protocol for genetically modified organisms overview summary the biosafety protocol to the 1992 convention on biological diversity cbd was adopted in january 2000 by the 176 nations that are parties to the cbd not having ratified the cbd the united states participated in the negotiations as an observer but nevertheless was an active participant in the discussions the protocol addresses major area of concern that was not resolved by the parent cbd in 1992 the safe handling transfer and trade of biological organisms in recent years this issue has gained new prominence and controversy as genetically modified organisms gmos have become widely used as agricultural crops and have become the focus of concern by us trading partners and citizens around the world while gmos are widely used in us crops citizens and governments in many countries particularly in europe have questioned the environmental and health safety of such products and have rejected them in the marketplace the biosafety protocol sets forth number of procedures and rules concerning trade in biologic products including agricultural commodities these rules are therefore of key importance to us economic interests including those who develop biotechnology the protocol applies to the transboundary movement transit handling and use of most gmos it incorporates number of principles that are still under development and in the process of being defined these include some controversial concepts such as the precautionary approach popularly known as the precautionary principle which is generally understood to mean that if definitive scientific certainty is lacking it is valid to err on the side of caution this approach is source of concern for critics who worry about the erection of trade restrictions justifi ed by using this concept the protocol also calls for advance informed agreements between exporting and importing countries regarding first shipments of gmo and labeling of subsequent shipments and the establishment of biosafety clearinghouse as means to share scientific technical environme ntal and legal information on gmos issues relating to these provisions are discussed in this report including concerns about trade restrictions that might ensue from the protocol the possibility of burdensome information responsibilities and others given the importance of the protocol to us interests the united states is likely to remain an active participant in refining the elements set forth in it related issue is whether the united states is hampered in this participation by the fact that it has not ratified the parent convention on biological diversity consequently the united states cannot sign the protocol and attends the related negotiations as an observer in general the issues related to gmos and how the biosafety protocol may affect us interests related to them are likely to be of continuing interest to congress in terms of possible economic impacts and trade considerations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30594contents introduction 1 background the convention on biological diversity 2 framing the cbd biosafety protocol 3 biosafety

alternatively as living modified organisms or lmos 5countries become parties after signing and ratifying the cbd currently 12 nations have not ratified the cbd afghanistan andorra bosniaherzegovina brunei iraq kuwait libya malta saudi arabia somalia thailand and the united states biosafety protocol for genetically modified organisms overview introduction in general biosafety refers to efforts to ensure safety in using transporting transferring handling releasing and disposing of biological organisms including geneti cally modified organisms gmoswhen they are considered potentially capable of harming human animal or plant health or the environment currently most developed countries have laws and regulations that ensure the biosafety of potentially hazardous organisms in domestic use and in trade1 however most developing countries lack similar legal biosafety safeguards the cartagena biosafety protocol2 completed in january 2000 is the international agreement that addresses safety concerns related to trade in genetically modified organisms3 the protocol applies to the transboundary movement handling and use of those gmos that may have impacts on human health the environment or biological diversity the protocol is viewed by many as the main mechanism for dealing with biosa fety concerns when gmos cross international borders4 this biosafety agreement is protocol to the 1992 convention for biological diversity cbdalso popularly known as the biodiversity convention global agreement that addre sses major aspects of biological diversity including species conservation genetic resources and ecosystem protection with general goal of reducing species extinctions the cbd entered into force in 1993 and at present 179 nations are parties to this treaty 5 the united states is not party to the cbd the senate has declined to approve the treaty as discussed below and thus could not participate directly in the official proceedings that drafted the biosafety protocol however us observer delegations have attended all cbd meetings since 1992 and have played anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30594crs2 active role in making its positions known and influencing treaty deliberations drafting of the biosafety protocol started in 1996 and in january 2000 the parties to the cbd agreed upon final draft protocol in montreal canada many especially within the clinton administration thought that us actions were key in shaping the draft protocol to protect us interests yet they acknowledged the us capacity to influence cbds deliberative bodies was affected by its nonparty status other analysts think that the protocol will change international trade rules for biotechnology in ways contrary to us interests they have argued that provisions in the protocol are mostly based on controversial concepts such as the precautionary approach popularly known as the precautionary principle see page 6 which they see as veiled threats to fair trade other potentially contro versial protocol provisions still subject to further negotiation will require mandatory labeling of bulk commodities or could call for environmental studies and may establish compulsory product information and disclosure procedures in general provisions in the biosafety protocol are likely to shape market rules and impact us interests in biotechnology trade background the convention on biological diversity as noted above the biosafety protocol is an outgrowth of the convention on biological diversity only parties to the parent treaty the cbd are part of the official negotiations on protocols which are effectively adjunct treaties on specific issues that the parties believe require elaboration or treatment the united states played an active role in the negotiations that produced the cbd even though the congress has declined to approve its ratification similarly because of the importance of the biosafety protocol to us agricultural and biotechnology interests the united states has remained actively involved sending observer delegations to the negotiations on it these delegations actively participated in substantive discussions and formulation of positions that were made part of the official proceedings of the protocol negotiations because the united states is not party to the cbd it is not in position to sign the protocol and thus the history and status of the biodiversity convention is key element in considering the us role in the biosafety protocol the convention on biological diversity cbd dates back to intensive negotiations in the early 1990s in 1992 world leaders came together in rio janeiro brazil to attend the worlds largest summit the united nations conference on environment and development uncedpopularly known as the earth summit to take up the wide array of issues relating to environmentall and economically sustai nable use of the worlds resources one major area of concern was biological diversity the concern that rapid loss of species around the world is occurring and international cooperation was needed to address the problem the cbd was one of two major treaties opened for signature at unced the other was on climate change in 1992 president bush declined to sign the cbd treaty citing concerns including the lack of sufficient protection for intellectual property in 1993 president clinton signed the cbd and sent it to the senate for its advice and consent for ratification the administration accompanied the proposed treaty with statementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30594crs3 6the consensus among us scientists is that strict distinction exists between the health and environmental risks posed by gm plants and those modified by conventional breeding practices opponents counter that risks are potentially irreversible untraceable and uncontrollableof interpretation in order to allay concerns raised by detractors see crs report 95 598 enr biological diversity issues related to the convention on biological diversity in 1994 the senate foreign relations committee reported favorably on ratification but the full senate did not act on the treaty before the end of the 103rd congress since 1995 consideration of the treaty has received little or attention from the us senate currently the treaty remains pending in the senate committee on foreign relations the cbd treaty contains few binding obligations relying instead on largely voluntary measures also the united states is in compliance with the treaty on the basis of current us law so changes in us law would be needed if it should become party there are differences of opinion regarding us ratification of the cbd some observers consider that the treaty is flawed and could be harmful to us trade and national security interests some critics question the need for the united states to become party to the cbd because as the number one producer and exporter of biotechnology the united states is already in position of strength to set market rules some critics are concerned that other nations could use the protocol provisions as disguised protectionism conversely others feel that the cbd is needed to protect biological diversity and that the united states is paying growing price by its refusal to ratify backers of ratification cite growing sense of isolation of the united states from some of its key trading partners and they worry that the united states will have less leverage in future cbd decisions framing the cbd biosafety protocol the use of biotechnology has led to broad changes in medicine industrial processes engineering and agriculture in agriculture biotechnology is being used to improve crops resistance to pests and environmental stresses and to enhance their nutritional content controversies have developed among various nations over whether certain types of gmos constitute potential hazard to human health or to the environment gmos have long been considered the subject of number of biosafety concerns many genetically modified plants for example are produced with techniques that include the dna sequences from common plant pathogens other biosafety concerns commonly cited are the possibility of adverse impacts on nontarget species or ecosystems the potential for enhanced weediness of gm crops ie plant becomes invasive or transfers resistance genes to its wild relatives and the instability of inserted genes ie the possibility that gene will lose its effectiveness6 to date transfer of genes to weedy relatives has been observed and controversial laboratory study has shown potential damage to nontarget specieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30594crs4 7 metz et 1997 the impact on biosafety of phosphinothricintolerance transgene in interspecific b rapa x b napus hybrids and their successive backcr osses

biosafety protocol negotiations the cbd s biosafety working group bswg negotiated the biosafety protocol in six meetings that took place between 1996 and january of 2000 after the earth summit in rio the bswg became the principal forum for deliberations and negotiations for biosafety issues regarded by parties to the cbd as an important area of unfinished business according to observers one difficulty in these negotiations was the fact that the united states as the largest exporter and producer of gmos was not officially part of the proceedings however the united states actively participated as part of the miami group coalition of leading agricultural exporters that also included cbd parties argentina australia canada chile and uruguay this group developed proposals and positions during the drafting of the protocol8 according to the cbd secretariat the protocol will enter into force by august 2000 having met the criterion in article 37 of the protocol at the closing of the 5th meeting of the conference of the parties cop5 in nairobi kenya on may 26 20009 for many parties signature to protocol automatically confers ratification since they have ratified the parent treaty in others like the united states each protocol must be separately considered for ratification after signature the protocol is currently open for signatures by parties and will remain open at the united nations headquarters until june 5 2001 nations that wish to sign onto the protocol after that date would have to do so by accession which includes ratification analysts agree that while the protocol is substantially complete document the pact delays final negotiations on number of controversial issues for up to 4 years after its adoption for example the door has been left open for parties to revise or strengthen rules for contained use gmos discus sed below that are not likely to propagate in the environment ie bulk commodities the miami group is expected to oppose any move to increase documentation and notification requirements for bulk commodities arguing that the cost of segregation and identity preservation ie tracing gmo product from the farm to the consumers table could lead to irreparable harm to biotechnology tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30594crs5 several important aspects of current provisions have been left for future negotiations such as 1 how to apply the precautionary approach to the protocol 2 how to develop rules to integrate the protocol with other trade agreements such as the wto into mutually supportive framework and 3 how to develop rules and procedures based on international law that would establish liability and redress for damages resulting from the movement of gmo these are to be finalized within 4 years the biosafety protocol key provisions and related issues the protocol addresses the major concerns that have arisen in connection with gmos and it bears directly on gmo trade most gmos are covered by the protocol except for those used to produce human pharmaceuticals the key provisions and the issues related to them are briefly summarized below advance informed agreements the protocol establishes the use of advance informed agreements aia between the importing and exporting parties that cover the first transboundary movement of any gmo the purpose of aias is to ensure that recipient countries have the opportunity to assess environmental risks associated with the importation of biotechnology products the biosafety protocol creates the procedure by requiring expor ters to seek consent from importers before the first shipment of gmo is introduced into the environment applies to seeds for planting fish for field release and microor ganisms for environmental bioremediation in addition article 11 also requires that bulk shipments of gmo commodities to be used as food feed or for processing must be accompanied by declarations stating that such shipments may contain gmos and are not intended for intentional introduction into the environment two categories of gmo are recognized according to their intended use gmos for contained or direct use ie food feed or for processing that require minimal biosafety precautions and gmos for intentional introduction to the environment ie agricultural seeds and other propagation materials and live fish which require more stringent biosafety procedures gmos unlikely to cause adverse effects on biological diversity and those intende d for contained use ie feed food or processing can be exempted from the application of aia procedures confidential information received under protocol procedures must be protected by importing and exporting parties further parties are required to cooperate in developing andor strengthening the biosafety capabilities of developing countries key issues the rationale for advance informed agreements aia espoused in 1992 by article 193 of the cbd is the perception that international trade in gmos could adversely affect the environment and that trade should not proceed without the informed agreement of the recipient country while support for some form of aia is widespread differing positions about their scope and breadth were among the principal issues under discussion for example as negotiations progressed it became clear that the gmos intended use should determine the level of risk assessment and risk management needed to attain biosafety similarly negotiators decided that the intended use of gmo should determine the level of information disclosure needed from the exporting party however the issue of labeling and proper documentationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30594crs6 10 for discussion on the precautionary approach see crs report rs20310 science behind the regulation of food safety risk assessment and the precautionary principle by mickey parish 11 internal political disagreements exist within the eu over the use of the precautionary approach eg france is at odds with the eu over frances use of precautionary approach for not admitting british beef into the country after the mad cow disease for bulk commodities will be revisited by the conference of parties cop within 2 years thus opening the door for the introduction of additional restrictions and mandatory requirements precautionary approach the protocol reaffirms the importance of the precautionary approach in its preamble and in articles 10 and 11 which prescribe trading procedures for the importing parties these articles for instance state that even in the case of lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient scientific data analysis or information importers could deny entry to undesired gmos at the same time risk assessments and risk management are prominent features of the protocol the protocol allows the importer to require that the exporter carry out and pay for risk assessments as well as any needed mitigation actions in addition the protocol allows parties to use socioeconomic considerations in reaching decision on importing gmos the precautionary approa ch was established as guiding tenet of the cbd which directly referred to principle 15 of the nonbinding rio declaration principle 15 states that in order to protect the environment the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by states according to their capabilities where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as reason for postponing costeffective measures to prevent environmental degradation key issues in general most interpretations agree that the precautionary approach urges policymakers to err on the side of caution in the face of scientific uncertainty10 environmentalists particularly in europe consider this approach to be valid policy option in the face of incomplete or inadequate scientific knowledge about health or environment impacts defenders of the application of this approach maintain that it is only temporary mechanism that gives time for scientific inquiry policymakers in europe recognize as do those in the united states the need for an assessment of risks based on accepted scientific facts11 however critics worry that elevating the precautionary approach to the level of political principle may create false public expectations for absolute safety and the demand for zero environmental risks at worst some critics maintain the precautionary approach can easily be used as form of disguised protectionism current language in the protocol leaves the development of procedures for trade andor entry decisions subject to further refinement by the cbds conference of parties presently few countries agree on just what the precautionary approach is analysts believe that future refinements may be affected by this lack of acceptedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30594crs7 12oecd deliberations on the precautionary approach can be found at httpwwwoecdorgsubjectbiotechedinburghhtm the european unions

situation has enticed international bodies like the eu the codex alimentarius commission and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to offer comprehensive views on the subject in hopes of setting worlds standard for the application of the principle in gmo trade12 biosafety clearinghouse the protocol establishes the biosafety clearing house bch which will be used as the mechanism to share scientific environmental and legal information on gmos as currently envisioned the bch will be centralized source for information on national laws guidelines and regulations for the implementation of the protocol as well as on other agreements on biotechnology the need for centralized information source on scientific and technical data about gmo trade was also envisioned in 1992 by the cbd articles 183 and 19 to accomplish this article 20 of the protocol establishes an internetbased biosafety clearinghouse to help countries exchange information about gmos currently the bch is housed at the cbds executive secretariat in montreal canada the protocol requires that transboundary movements of gmos between parties and nonparties be consistent with the protocol and encourages nonparties to contribute information through the bch parties are required to notify the bch of unintended or illegal movements of gmos and must adopt measures to prevent and penalize illegal transboundary movements key issues two critical issues were foremost in the minds of negotiators in establishing the bch 1 how to adequately balance the rights of parties to access and use relevant information about traded gmos and 2 how to protect the intellectual property rights of owners of biotechnology products article 203 and article 21 address the protection of confidential and proprietary information by making both trading parties responsible for protecting confidential information received under the protocol under aia requirements however some controversy exists because the protocol does not prescribe explicit liabilities for failures to protect intellectual property some critics would like to see clearcut mechanisms in the protocol to sanction failures to protect confidential information recent proposals by by canada to establish pilot implementation phase and to have each country apply its domestic laws and requirements to information sharing seem to be favored by other miami group members13 formal procedures and measures of intellectual property protection are to be developed by the conference of parties within 2 yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30594crs8 14 this accord establishes disciplines on the use of sanitary and phytosanitary measures in restricting trade for complete discussion on sps see crs report 98254 enr agricultural negotiations in the world trade organization by charles hanrahanrelationship of the protocol with other agreements the savings clause one of the most contentious issues faced by negotiators was to establ ish how the protocols measures would relate to other bilateral or international trade agreements notably those under the world trade organization wto the issue became important after the 1997 biosafety working group meeting in montreal where the miami group insisted on the need for consistency between the protocol and wto agreements such as the sanitary phytosanitarystandards sps accord14 the key question revolved around how to reconcile differing perspectives in envir onmental protection philosophies between advocates of the precautionary approach eg the eu and countries where environmental protection systems stress the use of the best available scientific evidence and risk assessment ie the miami group and the united states compromise position was reached through the inclusion of savings clause in the protocols preamble that states nothing in the protocol implies change in the rights and obligations of governments under the wto or other existing international agreements however the preamble further clarifies that the biosafety protocol will not be subordinated to other international agreements and that they should be mutually supportive key issues the clinton administration and industry analysts interpret the savings clause to mean that trade disputes originating from protocol implementation could be handled through existing mechanisms such as the wto dispute settlement agreements and its appellate review bodies others especially eu policymakers are inclined to stress that the protocol is not subordinated to any agreement and do not necessarily extend the savings clause to future agreements or to existing ones which do not adhere to the protocol notificationlabeling the protocol establishes mandatory entry notifications by exporting countries to the competent national authority in importing countries about trade of nonexempted gmos key feature of the protocol is the requirement for bulk shipments of gmo commodities to be accompanied by documentation stating that such shipments may contain gmos and that they are not intended for intentional introduction into the environment in lieu of formal aia this applies only to gmos intended for food feed or processing eg corn or soybeans other provisions finally parties are allowed to enter into bilateral regional or multilateral agreements provided that such agreements and arrangements do not result in lower level of protection than that provided by the protocol also in the case of unintended or illegal movements the protocol also allows the affected party to request the party of origin to dispose of the gmo in question at the expense of the latter in addition the protocol calls for the elaboration and adoption of liability and redress process for damages resulting from transboundary movements of gmoshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30594crs9 15 the united states through the miami group was key lobbyist for the savings clause and for securing minimal aia procedures for bulk shipments of gmo foods and feed the savings clause establishes the relationship between the protocol and other international trade agreementsimpacts on trade analysts agree that the future impact of the protocol on trade is difficult to gauge because so many key aspects are still to be decided also the current climate of controversy surrounding trade in agricultural gmos in many countries especially in europe further complicates assessments of trade implications the clinton administration and the us biotechnology industry have stated that the new rules will make it easier to harness the promise of biotechnology without unduly disrupting world food trade15 others especially critics in congress have viewed the accord with skepticism and have charged that many of its provisions will harm biotechnology trade by opening potential flood gate to restrictive and costly labeling and documentation requirements for us goods conclusion the united states has pioneered the use of biote chnology and is the worlds leading producer of gmo crops while most us analysts consider that the current protocol language is victory for gmo trade others point to likely future battles and continued friction between the united states and protocol parties over unresolved areas some particularly in congress felt that the clinton administration had gone too far in giving concessions for the inclusion of the precautionary approach and criticize us negotiators for placing the future of gmo trade on slippery slope by allowing even modicum of labeling requirements in bulk commodities others within that administration defended their efforts for keeping human health issues out of the protocol for lobbying to protect existing trade obligations by introducing the savings clause and for insisting upon increased intellectual property protection guarantees they saw these efforts as victories fought and won under the handicap of us nonparty status within the cbd differences in viewpoints on ratification persist with some who feel that ratification of the cbd would give the united states seat at the table and the power to make its full weight be felt and others who feel that the united states can continue to have adequate influence on the process without being party to treaty that they consider to be flawed these issues related to gmos and how the biosafety protocol may affect us interests related to them are likely to be of continuing interest to congress in terms of possible economic impacts and trade considerations
