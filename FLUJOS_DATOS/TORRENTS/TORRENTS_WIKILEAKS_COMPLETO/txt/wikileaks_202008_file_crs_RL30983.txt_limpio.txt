us actions remain matters of debate among us policymakers controversy continues over tibets current political status as part of china the role of the dalai lama and his tibetan governmentinexile and the impact of chinese control on tibetan culture and religious traditions these controversies have prompted recurring us congressional actions in support of tibets status and traditions actions that are routinely denounced by the chinese government in beijing this report briefly reviews tibets historical status discusses current issues within tibet and as components of uschina relations and discusses bush administration views and pending legislation in the 107th congress brief historical background of tibet tibetan history is notable in two particular respects one is the extraordinarily pervasive influence of buddhism in all aspects of daily life at one time sizeable number of tibets male population were monks and lamas and eventually this ecclesiastical group became tibets temporal rulers as well as its spiritual leaders the dalai lama believed to be the reincarnation of tibets patron deity is the highest and most revered among this ruling monastic theocracy the second noteworthy aspect of tibetan history is the ambiguity and disagreement surrounding tibets long political relationship with china tibetans generally view tibet as an historically independent nation that had close relationship with succession of chinese empires succession of chinese governments on the other hand have claimed tibet as political and geographical part of china1 in 19491951 the newly established communist government of the peoples republic of china prc backed up this claim by sending military troops to occupy tibet since then tibet has been under active beijing rule as its westernmost province xizang the tibet autonomous region much of the prcs tenure there has been troubled particularly during the tumultuous cultural revolution 19661976 when most monasteries palaces and other aspects of tibetan buddhism and culture were either damaged or destroyed the international 1 such claims have been made by previous chinese dynasties the republic of china government under chiang kaishek now the government on taiwan and the communist government of the peoples republic of china crs2 campaign for tibet claims that over 1 million tibetans died during the first 30 years of prc rule2 in 1959 at the age of 24 the dalai lama fled tibet and went into exile in india with group of his followers he remains there today along with tibetan refugee community of tens of thousands and he is still widely regarded as the spiritual leader of the tibetan people their foremost advocate and figure of international stature he has steadfastly maintained that tibet is an independent country under illegal occupation by chinese government forces but he has also been willing to negotiate with beijing and has advanced number of fairly moderate proposals regarding tibets future status the chinese government condemns the dalai lamas political activities and his leadership of governmentinexile although it recognizes him as major religious figure tibet and us policy since the 1980s in the late 1980s tibet became recurring issue in congressional consideration of matters relating to china number of factors have contributed to members greater interest these include the dalai lamas and the tibetan communitys ongoing political activities reports of human rights abuses and chinas continuing repressive social and political controls in tibet and the lack of consensus among us policymakers over what us policy should be toward china on matters involving tibet as on many matters involving china congressional views have often been at odds with those of the white house as matter of official policy the us government recognizes tibet as part of china and has always done so although some dispute the historical consistency of this us position3 since normalization of relations with the prc in 1979 succession of both republican and democratic us administrations have favored policies of engagement with china in the process they frequently have sought to minimize areas of potential tension with beijing where chinese leaders have taken strong positions such as on the question of tibets political status 2 there are varying estimates for how many tibetans may have died as direct consequence of chinese rule the figure of 12 million is the figure generally used by the tibetan governmentinexile warren w smith author of the tibetan nation p 607 calculates that the number of deaths is closer to 600000 3 some assert that past us actions which treated tibet as if it were an independent state in effect signaled us recognition michael c van walt van praag for instance in the status of tibet history rights and prospects in international law westview press boulder colorado 1987 states that washington supported tibet and treated it as an independent state even recognizing its facto italics included independence p 139 in the daily press briefing of october 8 1987 responding to question concerning what year the united states formally recognized tibet as part of china the state departments public affairs office issued the following statement we have never recognized tibet as sovereign state independent of china we first made the statement that we considered tibet to be part of china in 1978 however our earlier formulations were not inconsistent with the statement and we have never challenged chinas claim third country recognizes tibet as state independent of china crs3 the dalai lama himself has been the most charismatic and renowned advocate for the tibetan people over the past decade he has number of supporters in the us congress4 the dalai lamas and his exiled communitys efforts to gain international support for tibets cause took major step forward in 19861987 when series of meetings between tibetan and western supporters in new york washington and london launched what has become known as tibets international campaign5 the goal of this campaign was to garner western and principally us support for tibets situation and ultimately to bring this international pressure to bear on beijing to make satisfactory political concessions one result of this new strategy the us congress in 1987 began to put pressure on the white house to protect tibetan culture and accord tibet greater status in us law despite beijings strong objections two events of particular importance occurred in 1987 first on september 21 the dalai lama made his first political speech in the united states at the invitation of the congressional human rights caucus in that speech the dalai lama made fivepoint proposal for resolving the tibet question that was wellreceived in the united states and had significant consequences on congressional attitudes toward tibet second congress put nonbinding measures into place in 1987 declaring that the united states should make tibets situation higher policy priority and should urge china to establish constructive dialogue with the dalai lama6 this language not the first that congress had passed regarding tibet7 nevertheless marked the beginning of significant increase in congressional activity on tibets status8 from this point on congressional supporters sought to mention tibet separately whenever possible in legislation relating to china in 1990 in considering foreign relations authorization legislation that contained the socalled tiananmen sanctions congress singled out tibet for special mention in senseof congress language that closely resembled the five points the dalai lama had proposed two years earlier and in the same legislation mandated the voice of 4 these have included representatives charlie rose ben gilman and tom lantos and the late senator claiborne pell 5 these three cities are all still centers for tibetrelated offices and information networks according to dr melvyn goldstein professor of anthropology at case western reserve university the details of how the international campaign strategy was formed have not yet been documented goldstein melvyn the snow lion and the dragon china tibet and the dalai lama university of california press 1997 pp 76 and 138 6 president reagan signed into law hr 1777 the foreign relations authorization act of fy8889 on december 22 1987 pl 100204 section 1243 contains language on tibet in 1985 91 members of congress reportedly had also sent letter to chinas president li xiannian expressing support for continued talks with the dalai lama 7 congress considered number of nonbinding measures in the 1980s concerning tibet in 1986 congress listed tibet as an independent country in hr 5548 legislation dealing the exportimport bank this bill was approved on october 15 and became pl 99472 8 according to legislative database in the four years prior to 1987 only 6 measures had been introduced in congress concerning tibet whereas the 1987 legislation was one of 14 measures introduced in 19871988 httpthomaslocgov crs4 america to begin broadcasts in the tibetan language9 in 1994 congress enacted number of tibetanrelated provisions in the foreign relations authorization act of fy19941995 including provision mandating that tibet be listed separately in the state departments annual report country reports on human rights and provision mandating the state department to issue report on the state of relations between us and those recognized by congress as the true representatives of the tibetan people the dalai lama his representatives and the tibetan government in exile and on conditions in tibet10 congressional efforts to raise the profile of tibet over the last ten years or more have been resisted or mitigated by successive us administrations but generally in low profile nonconfrontational manner as early as 1986 when congress passed legislation authorizing exportimport bank funding which listed tibet as separate country president reagan signed the legislation into law11 in his remarks however the president said i note that tibet is listed as country in section 8 the united states recognizes tibet as part of the peoples republic of china i interpret tibets inclusion as separate country to be technical oversight12 in other respects however consistent congressional pressure has contributed to us administrations acknowledging however subtly the position of the tibetan communityinexile thus president george bush in 1991 became the first us president to meet with the dalai lama while president bill clinton met with the dalai lama several times in casual dropby meetings although these meetings were deliberately lowkey and informal they nevertheless offended chinese leaders as did the clinton administrations decision after having opposed the special envoy position for four years to compromise by establishing the position of special coordinator for tibet 9 this bill hr 3792 was enacted as pl 101246 and contains the tiananmen sanctions on china that are still largely in effect its provisions on tibet stated that us policy toward china should be explicitly linked with the situation in tibet specifically to include lifting of martial law in lhasa and other parts of tibet opening tibet to foreigners including the press and international human rights organizations release of political prisoners and conduct of negotiations between representatives of the dalai lama and the chinese government 10 established pursuant to section 536 of the foreign relations authorizations act hr 2333 enacted as pl 103236 11 hr 5548 was approved on october 15 and became pl 99472 12 statement on signing the exportimport bank act amendments of 1986 october 15 1986 in public papers of the presidents of the united states ronald reagan book ii june 28 to december 31 1986 pp 13901391 crs5 efforts to create special envoy for tibet during the early years of the clinton administration congress began considering measures to establish the position of us special envoy for tibet with ambassadorial rank in introducing such measure in 1994 senator claiborne pell stated he believed it was necessary to further focus white house attention on issues involving tibet i recall how difficult it was to engage previous administrations in serious knowledgeable discussions on tibeta special envoy for tibet would ensure that this important element of united stateschina relations was continually reflected in policy discussions on senior level13 while legislation to create special envoy for tibet was never enacted provisions similar to those in the 1994 legislation were also introduced as sections of authorization bills in the 104th and the 105th congresses14 in each case the provision called for the special envoy to have ambassadorial rank and to actively promote negotiations between the dalai lama and the chinese government clinton administration officials opposed these provisions primarily because of concerns about the creation of an ambassadorial rank position for an entity tibet that the united states recognizes as part of china rather than as an independent country in its own right on october 31 1997 in move seen as compromise to appeal to proponents of the special envoy position secretary of state madeleine albright designated special coordinator for tibetan issues within the state department and named gregory craig to serve in the position concurrently with his job as director of policy planning although the new special coordinator position did not come with ambassadorial rank its creation nevertheless suggested there would be higher level of official attention on issues involving tibet consequently the 105th congress dropped the special envoy provision from subsequent legislation15 13 statement by senator pell congressional record october 7 1994 p s14878 senator pells bill s 2554 was not enacted nor was hr 5254 similar bill introduced in the house on october 7 1994 by representative howard berman 14 in the 104th congress that legislation was the american overseas interests act of 1995 hr 1561gilman and s 908helms president clinton vetoed this legislation on april 12 1996 the house override vote on april 301996 failed to achieve the twothirds necessary for passage 234188 similar legislation in the 105th congress hr 1486 was replaced by three separate bills after consideration by the house rules committee on june 3 1997 hr 1757 authorizing appropriations for the state department for fy19981999 and containing the tibet special envoy provision hr 1758 the european security act nato enlargement and hr 1759 foreign aid authorization and reform bill the special envoy provision was dropped from this separate legislation before final passage 15 on january 20 1999 the position of special coordinator for tibet was assumed by julia taft us assistant secretary of state for population refugees and migration she stepped down on january 19 2001 on may 17 2001 secretary of state colin powell announced that paula dobriansky undersecretary of state for global affairs would serve as the next special coordinator for tibet crs6 current issues on tibet implications for the united states the bush administration appears to have taken somewhat higher profile on tibet than its predecessors and one less mindful of beijings views on may 17 2001 secretary of state colin powell appointed paula dobriansky undersecretary of state for global affairs as the next us special coordinator for tibet as undersecretary ms dobriansky is the highestranking of the three us officials who have held the coordinator position in further higher profile move secretary of state powell met personally with the dalai lama during the latters visit to washington on may 22 2001 reportedly to discuss human nature religious values and the situation in tibet this was followed by personal meeting on may 23 2001 between president bush and the dalai lama but there remain longstanding difficulties over basic issues involving tibet including tibets geographic area the number of tibetans living there and the number of ethnic han chinese residents there are ethnic frictions between tibetans and chinese living in close proximity with all the burdens of social discrimination and economic disparity that often accompany such frictions and the still deep rooted influence of religion in tibet as way of life cultural identity and an institutional force clashes continually with the secular traditions and bureaucratic requirements of the chinese communist government system among these entrenched tensions number of issues in particular have us policy implications status of the dalai lamas negotiations with china although specific mission of the us special coordinator on tibet is to promote talks between the prc and the dalai lama there has been progress on this front and negotiations are currently scheduled or being planned in the past both the prc and the dalai lama maintained that they were willing to hold discussions about tibets future the dalai lama himself whose views on the subject are more cautious and diplomatic than those of many of his followers generally speaks of tibetan interests within the context of rule by china he has spoken of future tibet that is part of china but which also has cultural autonomy within the chinese system but the dalai lama also has insisted that there should be preconditions for any discussions he has with beijing instead the negotiators should be able to address every issue in contention the prc continues to insist that discussions with the dalai lama should have several preconditions including an absolute ban on the subject of independence for tibet and the dalai lamas public acknowledgment that tibet and taiwan are both part of china some speculate that the dalai lama may have grown increasingly pessimistic about his ability to achieve solution to tibets situation he has implied that the moderate approach he has been pursuing has failed because of chinas unwillingness to hold freeranging talks and has hinted that time may be running out for negotiated settlement some are concerned that traditional tibetan culture and values increasingly are being overwhelmed by the growing chinese presence in tibet they worry about some of the educated and bilingual tibetan elite trained by the chinese communists who are now serving in government positions in tibet and who therefore have more of vested interest in the status quo and they worry that continued delay in achieving negotiated settlement increases the possibility that frustrated tibetans may resort to violence crs7 economic development in tibet chinese government policies on economic development in tibet appear to have helped raise the living standards of tibet generally but at high cost to tibets traditions and cultural identity these policies reportedly have disrupted traditional living patterns and contributed to tensions between tibetans and chinese immigrants in an apparent effort to assuage tibetan resentment beijing has spent substantial sums restoring buddhist temples in tibet at large conference conducted on tibet in 1994 chinese officials adopted plans to increase economic activity in tibet by 10 per year and continue substantial economic subsidies to help tibets backward economy since then the prc has moved ahead with number of major economic development and infrastructure projects the dalai lama and other tibetans are concerned that chinese economic activity in tibet disrupts cultural identity in part by encouraging large migrations of nontibetans into the region both technical personnel to work on the projects themselves and entrepreneurs seeking new economic opportunities some have even suggested that beijing has consciously pursued an economic development strategy in tibet as way to solve its tibet problem by ensuring that the tibetan economy is tied more tightly into that of chinas eastern provinces the tensions inherent in balancing economic development priorities and cultural preservation concerns will continue to influence how american policymakers view chinas tibet policies world bank project loan controversy arose in 1999 over world bank loan that was approved for china on june 24 1999 one portion of the 160 million western poverty reduction loan totaling 40 million would have financed construction of dam irrigation system and poverty alleviation activities in an area of qinghai province which many tibetans consider part of historical tibet according to the banks estimates this portion of the project also involved resettlement of approximately 58000 people most of whom are nontibetan into this area of qinghai critics of the loan maintained that the resettlement plans would reduce the overall share of the population that ethnic tibetans now have in this region faced with strong criticism the bank suspended its final commitment on the qinghai portion of the loan pending completion of an investigation by an independent inspection panel that panel found that although the bank had violated some of its own rules in making the loan china nevertheless should take remedial steps to address some valid criticisms on july 7 2000 china withdrew its application for the loan and since then has used its own funds to carry out the project chinas patriotic education and other campaigns in 1991 two years after the tiananmen square crackdown china launched patriotic education campaign in an effort to promote loyalty to the communist regime in the mid1990s the campaign became government tool in efforts to control monastic activity in tibet and discredit the dalai lama among tibetans under the guise of patriotic education teams of chinese officials visit tibetan monasteries and subject tibetan monks to education and training the campaign requires monks to sign declaration attesting to number of patriotic statements including rejection and denunciation of the dalai lama acceptance of chinas choice for the panchen lama see next section recognition that tibet is part of china and promise not to listen to voice crs8 of america broadcasts reportedly there has been widespread and intensive resistance to this campaign in addition to this campaign in january 1999 chinese officials began three year campaign to foster atheism in tibet according to us government report chinese propaganda official in tibet described the new campaign in television interview saying intensifying propaganda on atheism plays an extremely significant role in promoting economic constructionand to help peasants and herdsmen free themselves from the negative influence of religion16 finally there are reports that the chinese government has initiated new campaign to target and undermine the dalai lama according to hong kong newspaper report in late may 2001 at the fourth tibet work forum prc authorities discussed how to cope with what they referred to as the convergence and collaboration of five evil forces defined as tibetan independence xinjiang independence taiwan independence the falun gong movement and the pro democracy movement17 according to reports the goal of the campaign is to lessen the dalai lamas influence in tibet by defining him as loyal tool of the western antichinese forces18 the panchen lama succession in 1995 controversy arose over the selection of the successor to the panchen lama the second most important spiritual leader among tibetans when the dalai lama fled to india in 1959 the 10th panchen lama remained behind living in china until his death in 1989 tibetans believe that when highranking spiritual leader dies his soul is then reincarnated to await rediscovery by special search committees in may 1995 the dalai lama announced that after years of searching using search committees sanctioned by the chinese government gendhun choekyi nyima 6yearold boy living in tibet had been found to be the legitimate reincarnation of the deceased panchen lama beijing officials reportedly were furious that the dalai lama made his announcement unilaterally they regarded it as challenge to beijings authority to have final say in this important decision prc officials responded by maintaining that only they had the authority to name this spiritual leader consequently in november 1995 chinese leaders rejected the dalai lamas choice and announced they had discovered the real panchen lama 5yearold gyaltsen norbu of communist yak herder on november 29 1995 he was officially enthroned as the 11th panchen lama in ceremony attended by tibetan monks and senior chinese communist leaders immediately thereafter both boys and their families were taken into custody by chinese authorities and held in undisclosed locations in china in june 1999 gyaltsen norbu the boy recognized by beijing returned to tibet for the first time reportedly under heavy military protection gendhun choekyi nyima the boy recognized by the dalai lama apparently remains under house arrest and has not been seen since the monk who headed the official search party chadrel rinpoche 16 annual report on international religious freedom for 1999 tibet september 9 1999 17 hong kong ming bao in chinese may 19 2001 translated in fbis online 18 ibid crs9 was arrested and sentenced to six years in jail for collaborating with the dalai lama he reportedly was released from prison just prior to president bushs february 2002 visit to beijing and placed under house arrest tibet and the 107th congress several members of the 107th congress appear to be continuing and expanding upon their efforts to focus more us attention on tibet on march 7 2002 the house international relations committee held hearings on us policy considerations in tibet at that hearing the us special coordinator for tibet under secretary of state paula dobriansky testified about the us agenda with respect to tibet and her progress to date including her accompaniment of president bush during his visits to china in 2001 and 200219 in addition provisions on tibet have been included in the following legislation hr 1646s 1401 authorizing appropriations for state justice and commerce although freestanding legislation has been introduced in the 107th congress on tibet it is likely that the state department authorization act will be the vehicle for passage of tibetrelated legislation both hr 1646 hrept 107 57 and s 1401 srept 10760 provide number of the same provisions contained in the freestanding tibetan policy act described below hr 1779s 852 including opening us consular office in lhasa tibetan language training for us foreign service officers us support for economic development on the tibetan plateau and separate entries for tibet in various mandated reporting requirements in addition both the authorizing bills provide for 500000 in each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003 for the ngawang choephel exchange programs the former programs of educational and cultural exchange between the united states and the people of tibet the authorizing bills also differ in certain other respects such as in the type of reporting requirement they impose semiannually for s 1646 annually for s 1401 or the 2000000 in funding that hr 1646 alone provides for migration and refugee assistance for tibetan refugees hr 1779s 852 the tibetan policy act of 2001 this legislation was introduced in both the house and senate on may 9 2001 hr 1779 by representative tom lantos and s 852 by senator dianne feinstein the bills introduce number of senseofcongress proposals including that the united states should initiate steps to encourage negotiated agreement between beijing and the dalai lama that the united stateseuropean parliamentary group should encourage sinotibetan dialogue that the united states should seek unconditional release for political prisoners in tibet and that the united states should oppose any efforts in the united nations either to prevent consideration of issues involving tibet or to prevent the participation of the dalai lama or his

tibetrelated interest groups international campaign for tibet ict apart from the dalai lama number of interest groups established both in the united states and abroad since the mid1980s have worked to bring the tibetan cause to the attention of the administration the international community and members of congress these groups remain important forces of influence on the political scene in 2001 among the most visible advocates for the tibetan cause is the usbased international campaign for tibet ict formed in 1988 although the ict pursues broad human rights issues involving tibet its primary goals concern tibets political and international status specifically to help tibet regain independence from china which the itc regards as an illegal occupying power through its work the itc hopes to create sufficient international support for tibet to force china to begin serious talks with the dalai lama about tibets future status the itc has offices in washington and amsterdam although it occasionally receives small grants for instance from the national endowment for democracy the itc is largely dependent on donations from private individuals international campaign for tibet 1825 k st
