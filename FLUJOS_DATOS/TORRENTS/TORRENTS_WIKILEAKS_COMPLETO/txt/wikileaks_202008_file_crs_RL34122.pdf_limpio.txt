growth rates for service categories medicare pays for services of physicians and certain nonphysician practitioners on the basis of fee schedule with few exceptions most physicians services are considered together in the calculation of the fee schedules related expenditure targets and annual updates in some instances special rules apply to the calculation of medicare fees for some services including anesthesia radiology and nuclear medi cine the medicare physician fee schedule assigns relative values to services that reflect physician work ie the time skill and intensity it takes to provide the service practice expenses and malpractice costs the relative values are adjusted for geographic variations in costs the adjusted relative values are then converted into dollar payment amount by conversion factor the single conversion factor for 2007 is 378975 the same level as in 2005 and 2006 the physician fee schedule places limit on payment per service but not on overall volume of services the formula for calculating the annual update to the conversion factor responds to changes in volume if the overall volume of services increases the update is lower if the overa ll volume is reduced the update is higher the intent of the formula is to place restraint on overall increases in medicare spending for physicians services several factors enter into the current calculation of the annual update and increase or decrease of medicare physician fees these include 1 the medicare economic index mei which measures infl ation in the inputs needed to produce physicians services 2 the sustainable growth rate sgr which is essentially target for medicare spending growth for physicians services and 3 an adjustment that modifies the update which would othe rwise be allowed by the mei to bring spending in line with the sgr target the sgr target is not limit on expenditures rather the fee schedule update reflects the success or failure in meeting the target if expenditures exceed the target the update fo r future year is reduced this is what occurred for 2002 fee reductions were also slated to occur in subsequent years however legislation has prevented this from occurring through 2007 most recently the tax relief and health care act of 2006 trhca pl109432 kept the 2007 conversion factor at the 2006 level httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34122crs24 the performance adjustment factor sets th conversion factor at level so that projected spending for the year will meet allowed spending by the end of the year current law restrictions prevent the adjustment factor from being less than minus 7 or more than plus 3 under the cu rrent update formula reduction in the conversion factor will occur for the next seve ral years in the absence of legislation payment rates will be redu ced by about 10 in 2008 and around 5 annually for at least several years thereafter the 2008 estimate reflects the fact that trhca specified that the 2007 override of the statutory formula was to be treated as if it did not occur therefore the starting base for the calculation is 5 below the actual 2007 c onversion factor further for the sixmonth period from july 1 2007 to december 31 2007 physicians who voluntarily report certain quality measures that meet the reporting criteria can receive bonus payments of 15 the provision would create si x new categories of physicians services beginning january 1 2008 1 evaluation and manageme nt services for primary care and for preventive services 2 evaluation and manage ment services not included in 1 3 imaging services and diagnostic tests other than clinical diagnostic laboratory tests 4 major procedures 5 anesthesia servi ces and 6 minor procedures and any other physicians services not described above the provision would eliminate the single conversion factor currently pplied to all physician servi ces and establish separate conversion factor for each of the si x newly created service categories beginning with 2008 the conversion fact ors would be computed and updated separately for each of the six service categories as would be the target growth rate and the allocation of the cumulative adju stment component or overhang however in the calculation of the target growth rate the rate would be increased by 25 for the primary and preventive health care cat egory the provision would establish floor for updates equal to 05 for 2008 nd 2009 however the restriction on the update adjustment factor for 2010 and 2011 would be changed from 7 to 14 and for 2013 and each succeeding year the upda conversion factor for each of the service categories would be 0 section 302 improving accuracy of relative values under the medicare physician fee schedule medicare pays for services of physicians and certain nonphysician practitioners on the ba sis of fee schedule the fee schedule assigns relative values to services that reflect physician work ie the time skill and intensity it takes to provide the service practice expenses and malpractice costs the work relative value units rvus incorporated in the initial fee schedule were developed after extensive input from th physician community refinements in existing values and establishment of values for new services have been included in the annual fee schedule updates this refinement and update process is based in part on recommendations made by the american medical association specialty society relative value update committee ruc which receives input from over 100 specialty societies traditionally the fiveyear review has led to more increases in work rvus than decreases medpac and other observers have stated that more attention needs to be given to overvalued services in order to maintain the integrity of the fee schedule the most recent fiveyear review resulted in significant increases in values forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34122crs25 evaluation and management services howev er the impact was reduced by the budget neutrality adjustment this provision would require the secret ary to establish an expert panel to identify misvalued physicians services the panel would conduc t data analysis to identify physicians services for which the relative value is potentially misvalued particularly those which are overvalued nd assess whether those misvalued services warrant review through existing processes the panel would also advise the secretary as part of the periodic review not less than every five years and adjustments in relative values the secretary would consult with the ex pert panel and would also perform the following 1 in conjunction with the ruc fiveyear review conduct fiveyear review of physicians services that have experienced substantial changes in length of stay site of service volume practice ex pense or other fact ors that may indicate changes in physician work 2 identify new services to determine if they are likely to experience reduction in value over time and forward list of the services identified to the ruc for review in the ne xt fiveyear review cycle and 3 for physicians services that are otherwise unreviewed by the ruc periodically review sample of relative value units within different types of services to ensure the accuracy of the relative values contained in the medicare physician fee schedule the provision would give the secretary the authority to reduce the work component for services w ith accelerated volume growth without using the ruc process beginning january 1 2009 in consu ltation with the expe rt panel described above the secretary would be able to re duce the work value units for particular physicians service if the annual rate of growth in expenditures for the service provided under medicare for 2006 or subse quent year exceeds the average annual rate of growth in expenditures for all medicare physicians services by more than 10 percentage points the secretary woul d take into account clinical evidence supporting or refuting the merits of such accelerated growth the secretary would also be granted the authority to adjust payments for efficiency gains for new procedures the secretary may apply methodology based on supporting evidence under which there is imposed reduction ove r period of years in specified value units in the case of new or newer procedure to take into account inherent efficiencies that are typically or likely to be gained during the period of initial increased application of the procedure section 303 physician feedback mechanism on practice patterns both medpac and gao have recently recommended providing information to physicians on their resource us medpac asserts that phy sicians would be able to assess their practice styles evaluate whether they tend to use more resources than their peers or what evidencebased research if available recommends and revise practice styles as appropriate medpac notes that in certain instances the private sector use of feedback has led to small downward trend in resource use according to medpac medicare has the potential to be more successful since it is the single largest purchaser of health care and therefore its reports should command more attention medpac states that using th results for physician education would provide cms and physicians with experien ce with the measurement tool and allow for refinements with more experience and confidence in the approach physicianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34122crs26 feedback on resource use could be used for payment purposes or to create other incentives in an april 2007 report focus on ph ysician practice pa tterns can lead to greater program efficiency gao explor ed linking physician compensation to efficiency defined as provi ding and ordering level of services sufficient to meet patients needs but not excessive given patients health status the analysis focused on generalists namely physicians who defined their specialty as general practice internal medicine or family practice the report categorized physicians who treated disproportionate share of overly expensive patients as outlier generalists the report found outlier genera list physicians in ll twelve metropolitan areas studied gao found that medicare pa tients who saw outlie r generalists were more likely to have been hospitalized more likely to have been hospitalized multiple times and more likely to have used home health services they were however less likely to have been admitted to skilled nursing home the gao report noted that certain public and private health care purchasers routinely evaluate physicians in their networ ks using measures of efficiency and other factors it noted that the purchasers it studied linked their evaluation results to range of incentives from steering patients toward the most efficient providers to excluding physicians from the providers network because of inefficient practice patterns gao noted that while cms has th tools available to evaluate physician practices it may not have the flexibility that other purchasers have to link physician profiling results to range of incentives to encourage efficiency the provision would require the secretar of health and human services to develop and implement mechanism to m easure resource use on per capita and an episode basis by june 1 2008 this activ ity is meant to provide feedback to physicians who participate in the medicar program on how their practice patterns compare to physicians generally both in the same locality as well as nationally this feedback would not be subject to disclo sure under the freedom of information act section 304 payments for efficient physicians mma provided for an additional 5 in payments for certain physicians in scarcity areas for the period january 1 2005 through december 31 2007 the secretary was required to calculate separately for practicing primary care physicians and specialists the ratios of such physicians to medicare benefici aries in the county rank each county or equivalent area according to its ratio for primary care and specialists separately and then identify those scarcity areas with the lowest ratios which collectively represented 20 of the total medicare beneficiary popula tion in those areas the list of counties was to be revised less of ten than once every three years unless there were new data the listing of counties appeared in appendix i and appendix j of the 2005 physician fee schedule update this provision would create incentive payments under the medicare program for physicians practicing in areas identified as an efficient area from january 1 2009 through december 31 2010 physicians pr acticing in countie s or equivalent areas that are in the lowest fifth percentile based on per capita spending for medicare part and part b standardized to eliminate the effect of geographic adjustments in payment rates would receive an amount equal to 5 of the medicare paymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34122crs27 amount for each year the secretary w ould identify and post low volume areas as part of the proposed and final rule to implement the annual phy sician fee schedule the secretary would post the list of counties identified on the cms website section 305 recommendations on refining the physician fee schedule the provision would modify the physi cian fee schedule by requiring the secretary to analyze and recommend ways to consolidate coding for procedures and to increase use of bundled payments later than december 31 2008 the secretary of health and human services would be re quired to complete an analysis of those procedures under the medicare physician f ee schedule for which there is global payment met hodology being applied for which bundled payment methodology would be appropriate and submit report on such analysis and recommendations on increasing the use of bundled payments under the medicare physician fee schedule section 306 improved and expanded medical home demonstration project advocates of the advanced medical home concept propose vision of health care focused on physicianguided patientcentered care through the promotion of continuous care relationships and the livery of care in variety of settings according to the needs of the patient and skills of the medical provider in theory the advanced medical home model emphasize s patientcentered physicianguided costefficient longitudinal care over episodic illnessoriented complaintbased care the personal physician would coordinate and facilitate care and provide guidance insight and advice to help the patients in most cases primary care physicians with their office care team would be best ited to provide principal care and be patients care coordinator or personal physician in the advanced medical home model however medical specialist with his or her office care team could also fulfill the role of personal phy sician proponents of this model claim that personal physician would be able to coordinate and facilitate the care of patients and would be directly accountable to each patient in contrast to gatekeeper who is sometimes viewed as an impediment re stricting patient access to services section 204 of the tax relief and h ealth care act of 2006 mandated medicare medical home demonstration pr oject the demonstration is to be conducted in up to 8 states to provide targeted accessible continuous and coordinated familycentered care to medicare beneficiaries who are deemed to be high need with multiple chronic or prolonged illnesses that require regular medical monitoring advising or trea tment cms anticipates selecting contractor to provide assistance in the design of the medical home demonstrati on by september 2007 implementation is expected by late september 2008 the provision would require the secret ary to establish an expanded medical home medicare demonstration project expanded project which would supersede the project initiated under section 204 of th tax relief and hea lth care act of 2006 the expanded projects purposes would be as follows 1 to guide the redesign of the health care delivery system to provi accessible continuous comprehensive and coordinated care to medicare beneficiar ies and 2 to pr ovide care management fees to personal physicians deliverin g continuous and comprehensive care in qualified medical homeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34122crs28 under the expanded medicare medical home project the secretary would provide monthly medical home care management fee payment to the personal physician of each participatin g beneficiary in determining the amount of the fee the secretary would consider the operating ex penses the added value services risk adjustment hit adjustment and performancebased payment the expanded project would be funded through monies for the original demonstration as well as 500000000 of additional funds from the federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund part b this would include the payments of the monthly medical home care management fees described above reductions in coinsurance for participating beneficiaries and funds for the design implementation and evaluation of the ex panded project the secretary would monitor the expenditures under the expanded project and could terminate the project early so that expenditures would not exceed the amount of funding provided for the project the secretary woul d provide and submit to cong ress an annual report on the project and an evaluation of the project by date specified by the secretary the secretary would also provide for an eval uation of the expanded project and would submit to congress not later than 18 months after the date of completion of the project report on the project and on the evaluation of the project section 307 repeal of physician assistance and quality initiative fund the provision would repeal the physician assistance and quality initiative fund established by trhca trhca authorized 135 billion for 2008 for the fund which is to be available to the secretary for physician payment and quality improvement initiatives section 308 adjustment to medicare payment localities medicare payments to physicians vary according to geographic areas called medicare payment localities or fee schedule geographic areas there are currently 89 localities some are statewide while others are substate areas medicare makes separate geographic adjustment to each component of the physi cian fee schedule work adjustment practice expense adjustment and malprac tice adjustment these adjustments are intended to reflect the variation in the cost s of providing services in different parts of the country these three components ar weighted and then added together to produce an indexed relative value unit for the service for the locality the payment locality structure for the current medicares physician fee schedule was established in 1996 and took effect janua ry 1 1997 the objective wa s to ensure that the localities had relatively homoge nous resource costs currently there are 89 separate payment localities of which 34 are statewide mma made temporary changes to the geographic adjusters from 2004 2006 the geographic adjustment for the work co mponent of the fee schedule was increased to 1000 in any area where the multiplier woul d otherwise be less the tax relief and health care act of 2006 extended the provision for an additional year through 2007 mma further directed the gao to conduct study of the geographic adjusters gao report issued in march 2005 concluded that all three adjusters were valid in their fundamental design and appropriately reflect ed broad patterns of geographic differences in running practice the report made several recommendations for improving the data nd methods used to construct the data cms has stated that any changes must be made in budgetneutral fashion for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34122crs29 state thus if higher geographic prac tice cost indices and thus payments are applied in one part of the state they must be offset by lower indices and payments in other parts of the state two counties in california santa cruz and sonoma are assigned to larger payment locality rest of california but in the years since the payment localities were initially established the cost and expenditure measures used to calculate geographic adjusters for medicare physician payment have increased more quickly in those areas than in the rest of calif ornia payment locality in the july 12 2007 proposed rule for the 2008 physician fee schedule 72 federal register 38122 july 12 2007 cms proposed three options for addressing the situation the provision would require the secretary to revise the fee schedule areas for california using the countybased geographic ad justment factor as specified in option 3 table 9 in the proposed rule for dicare physician services beginning january 1 2008 this approach would group counties within state into localities based on similarity of gafs even if the counties were not geographically contiguous and would reduce the number of payment localitie s in california from 9 to 6 each based on counties or aggregates of counties with the resulting localities reflecting similar geographic adjustment factors gafs cm s claims that this option would be the most administratively burdensome option to implement because of the significant systems changes and provider education that would be required to reconfigure the california localities in this manner it would also place greater burden on practicing physicians who are more likely to experience change in his or her practices locality the countybycounty impact of this option is detailed in table 9 72 federal register 38141 july 12 2007 in the transition from the existing payment localities to the new payment localities for services provided january 1 2009 through december 31 2010 the new gaf would apply unless there is loss in which case the old gaf would apply in other words the higher of the two gafs as calculated under the existing or the new methodology would apply later than january 1 2011 the secret ary would review and make revisions to fee schedule areas in all states where there is more than one medicare physician payment fee schedule area the secretary may revise the fee schedule areas in these states using the same methodology used fo r california any such revisions would be made effective concurrently with the application of the pe riodic 3year review of geographic adjustment f actors required by law for 2011 section 309 payment for imaging services the provision would establish an accreditation process for f acilities that provide diagnostic imaging services the process would be modeled on that used for mammography facilities under section 354 of the public health service act effective january 1 2010 imaging services could only be paid for if provided in accredited facilities except that this limitation would not apply with re spect to the technical component if the imaging equipment meets certification sta ndards and the profe ssional component of diagnostic imaging service that is furn ished by physician the provision would apply to ultrasound services on january 1 2012 effective january 1 2008 the provision would require separate billing for the technical component and professional component of imaging services it woul d require cms to increase the assumption regarding the time equipment is in use from 50 to 75 it would also require cmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34122crs30 to assume the interest rate for capital purchases reflects the prevailing rate but in case higher than 11 section 310 reducing frequency of meetings of the practicing physicians advisory council the provision would modify the frequency of meetings of the physicians advisory council as established under section 1868a of the social security act from quarterly to once each year and at such other times as the secretary may specify the councils duties are to discuss certain proposed changes in regulations and carrier manual instructions related to physician services identified by the secretary the council members are appointed by
