information will be extremely helpful in responding to reviewer 2 i really do feel that the reviewer is getting overly exercised about relatively minor technical point as you note the key issue is that in terms of the statistical significance testing we are making it easier to get douglasslike result by using an ar1 model for calculating the adjusted standard errors im concerned that going down the road proposed by reviewer 2 could leave us open to unjustified criticism it would be shame if douglass et argued erroneously that our failure to find significant differences between modelled and observed trends was spurious and arose primarily from use of higherorder autoregressive models for calculating the adjusted standard errors would it be ok to share your email with glenn mcgregor and with my other coauthors on the paper since youve looked at these issues in detail in your previous papers with thiebaux and with hans your comments would be very useful background information for glenn with best regards ben zwiersfrancis ontario wrote hi ben sorry the 2nd reviewer is being pain as you say there is already quite bit of literature on dealing with dependence in tests of the mean and this referree would have been critical if this paper had gone over that ground again regardless you might be interested in the attached papers both contain relevant information and might help to formulate response to the editor thiebaux and zwiers show that the equivalent sample size is hard to estimate well particularly from small samples the approach proposed by the reviewer is what we termed the arma method and it produces equivalent sample size estimates that have unacceptably large rmses when the sample is small even when the time series in question is not very persistent see table 6 zwiers and von storch show the performance of an estimator of equivalent sample size using the approach you use ie assume the data are ar1 they show that the equivalent sample size tends to be overestimated table 1 particularly when samples are small and that the corresponding ttest tends to operate at significance levels above the nominal level ie rejects too frequently table 2 so using such test in effect gives those who would like to reject the null hypothesis small leg up directly comparable results are not shown in the two papers but you can infer from the comparison between equivalent sample size results table 6 in tz table 2 in zvs that the arma approach for estimating equivalent sample size would be much less reliable than the approach that you are using and thus the sampled series would have to be very far from being ar1 for the arma approach to be beneficial the absolute key is to keep things as parsimonius as possible there is simply not enough data to entertain complex models of the autocovariance structure cheers francis francis zwiers director climate research division environment canada 4905 dufferin st toronto ont m3h 5t4 phone 416 739 4767 fax

trip to australia i had great time there now sadly its back to the reality of douglass et im forwarding the second set of comments from the two reviewers as youll see reviewer 1 was very happy with the revisions weve made to the paper reviewer 2 was somewhat crankier the good news is that the editor glenn mcgregor will not send the paper back to reviewer 2 and is requesting only minor changes in response to the reviewers comments once again reviewer 2 gets hung up on the issue of fitting higherorder autoregressive models to the temperature time series used in our paper as noted in our response to the reviewer this is relatively minor technical point the main point is that we include an estimate of the standard error of the observed trend dcps07 do not which is the main error in their analysis in calculating modeled and observed standard errors we assume an ar1 model of the regression residuals this assumption is not unreasonable for many meteorological time series we and others have made it in number of previous studies reviewer 2 would have liked us to fit higherorder autoregressive models to the t2 t2lt and tst2lt time series this is difficult business particularly given the relatively short length of the time series available here there is easy way to reliably estimate the parameters of higherorder ar models from 20 to 30 years of data the same applies to reliable estimation of the spectral density at frequency zero since we have only 23 independent samples for estimating the spectral density at frequency zero reviewer 2s comments are not particularly relevant to the specific problem we are dealing with here its also worth mentioning that use of higherorder ar models for estimating trend standard errors would likely lead to smaller effective sample sizes and larger standard errors thus making it even more difficult to find significant differences between modelled and observed trends our use of an ar1 model makes it easier for us to obtain dcps07like results and to find significant differences between modelled and observed trends dcps cannot claim therefore that our test somehow stacks the deck in favor of obtaining nonsignificance trend difference which they might claim if we used poorlyconstrained higherorder ar model for estimating standard errors the reviewer does not want to see the method proposed in this paper become established as the default method of estimating standard errors in climatological time series we do not claim universal applicability of our approach there may well be circumstances in which it is more appropriate to use higherorder ar models in estimating standard errors id be happy to make statement to this effect in the revised paper i have to confess that i was little ticked off by reviewer 2s comments the bit about wilfully ignoring time series literature was uncalled for together with my former mpi colleague wolfgang brueggemann ive fooled around with lot of different methods of estimating standard errors in both the time domain and frequency domain one could write whole paper on this subject alone such paper would not help us to expose the statistical deficiencies in dcps07 nor would indepth exploration of this issue lead to the shorter paper requested by the reviewer it should take few days to revise the paper and draft response to reviewer 2s comments ill send you the revised paper and draft response early next week slowly but surely we are getting there with best regards ben benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence
