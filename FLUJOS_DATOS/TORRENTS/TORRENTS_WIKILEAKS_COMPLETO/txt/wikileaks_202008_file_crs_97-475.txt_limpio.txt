discuss administration policy and congressional action on sfor the report will be updated as events warrant bosnia stabilization force sfor and us policy summary in december 1995 natoled implementation force ifor was deployed to bosnia to enforce the military aspects of the bosnian peace agreement president clinton said the deployment would last about one year ifor successfully completed its main military tasks but implementation of the civilian aspects of the accord for which ifor did not have direct responsibility was at best mixed success faced with the possible collapse of the peace agreement if ifor pulled out on november 15 1996 president clinton pledged to keep us troops in bosnia as part of natoled stabilization force sfor until june 1998 similar state of affairs little over year later led the president to announce on december 18 1997 that he had agreed in principle that us forces should participate in bosnia peacekeeping force after the mandate of the current sfor expired in june 1998 in march 1998 certification to congress the president proposed that sfor not be assigned fixed enddate but asserted that the deployment will not be open ended he outlined ten conditions to be met in bosnia in order for the natoled force to be withdrawn continuation of the ceasefire restructured retrained and reintegrated police effective judicial reform dissolution of illegal predayton institutions democratically regulated media and access to independent media free and democratic elections with implemented results freemarket reforms with an economic program worked out with the international monetary fund phased and orderly minority refugee returns functioning multiethnic administration in brcko and full cooperation by the parties with the war crimes tribunal the composition of sfor has varied little since the renewal of its mandate in june 1998 as operation joint forge as of july 1998 it comprises forces from 34 countries totaling approximately 35000 troops the us contingent in bosnia remains at about 8300 but by october 1998 it will be reduced to 6900 one notable change in the sfor force structure has been the addition of 600man multinational specialized unit msu to deal with outbreaks of civil violence sfors main mission remains enforcing the military aspects of the dayton peace accords but over the last year nato has become increasingly willing to devote resources to supporting key civil implementation tasks after fierce debate the house and senate passed separate resolutions in december 1995 expressing support for the us troops in bosnia although not necessarily for the mission itself legislative efforts to bar funds for the deployment of us troops to bosnia were narrowly rejected in the 105th congress similar efforts to bar us deployment after june 1998 were also rejected although the fy 1998 defense authorization and appropriations laws contain reporting requirements that must be fulfilled before an extended deployment may take place during its debate on the fy 1999 defense authorization and appropriations bills the senate rejected attempts to force gradual reduction in us forces in bosnia but approved senseofthesenate amendment that called for the withdrawal of us forces within reasonable period of time contents background 1 sfor overview 2 sfor mission clarity and mission creep 7 sfor costs 10 administration

background after three years of war in bosnia on november 21 1995 the presidents of serbiamontenegro croatia and bosniahercegovina as well as representatives of the muslimcroat federation of bosniahercegovina and the bosnian serb republika srpska initialed largely usmediated peace agreement for bosnia at wright patterson air force base near dayton ohio the final peace agreement was signed by the parties in paris on december 14 1995 in order to enforce the military aspects of the agreement the agreement called for natoled implementation force ifor to be deployed to bosnia in nationally televised address on november 27 1995 president clinton justified dispatching us troops to bosnia as part of ifor by saying us engagement was needed to stop the great suffering caused by the war to bring stability in europe region vital to us interests and to maintain us leadership in nato president clinton said the deployment would last about one year subsequent statements by administration officials asserted that us forces would be out of bosnia by the end of 1996 the united states contributed about 19000 troops to the approximately 54000man force on december 15 1995 the security council authorized the deployment of ifor on the next day natos north atlantic council approved the ifor deployment activating the deployment of the main body of troops on december 20 1995 the force in bosnia unprofor transferred its authority to ifor starting the process of implementing the military aspects of the peace agreement over the next year ifor successfully completed its main military tasks which were to separate the forces on the ground and oversee their demobilization however implementation of the civilian aspects of the accord for which ifor did not have direct responsibility was at best mixed success civilian aspects of the accord were coordinated by high representative carl bildt while various international bodies were charged with helping to implement aspects of the accord it should be noted that the chief responsibility for peace implementation rested with the bosnian parties who showed intransigence on many issues freedom of movement remained limited and very few refugees returned to their homes indicted war criminals remained at large elections were held for most levels of government on september 14 1996 without violence or other serious incidents however many observers charged that the election campaign was less than free and fair and some alleged possible fraud in the vote count the results consolidated the strength of the main nationalist parties municipal elections which were to have been held on september 14 1996 were postponed by the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce until september 1314 1997 due to fraud and crs2 manipulation of registration procedures primarily by the bosnian serbs and other problems key bosnian government institutions were created only in january 1997 internationally funded reconstruction efforts began to show some results in rebuilding infrastructure albeit almost entirely in the federation but had not touched off self sustaining economic recovery although ifors primary responsibility was to assure the implementation of the military aspects of the peace accord and by doing so provide secure environment in which civilian implementation could take place it also aided some civilian implementation efforts directly on casebycase basis on november 15 1996 president clinton announced that the administration had agreed in principle to keep us troops to bosnia as part of new natoled peacekeeping force for bosnia clinton said the force would remain there until june 1998 he said the mission of the stabilization force sfor would be to prevent resumption of hostilities so that economic reconstruction and political reconciliation can accelerate nato ministers approved the sfor plan on december 10 1996 and the security council authorized the force on december 12 for an 18month period sfor formally took over command from ifor on december 20 1996 in late 1997 the united states and other countries participating in sfor found themselves in much the same dilemma that they faced one year earlier either pull out and face the possibility of resumption of fighting or remain in bosnia and continue seemingly openended commitment on december 18 1997 president clinton announced that he had agreed in principle that us forces should participate in bosnia peacekeeping force after the mandate of the current sfor expires in june 1998 he did not set new departure deadline but said the force would leave only when the bosnian peace process was selfsustaining in march 1998 certification required by the fy 1998 defense authorization and appropriations acts pl 10585 and 10556 president clinton laid out ten benchmarks to measure progress toward that goal including continued ceasefire police restructuring an effective judicial reform program dismantling of predayton institutions freer media environment free and fair elections free market reforms an orderly refugee return process functioning multiethnic administration in brcko and cooperation with the war crimes tribunal on june 11 1998 nato defense ministers formally approved the extension of sfors mandate on june 15 1998 the security council approved resolution 1171 which extended sfors mandate until june 21 1999 on june 20 1998 sfor began to operate under its new mandate sfor overview the composition of sfor has varied little since the renewal of its mandate in june 1998 as operation joint forge as of july 1998 it comprises forces from 34 countries totaling approximately 35000 troops the us contingent in bosnia remains at about 8300 but by october 1998 it will be reduced to 6900 this reduction was agreed to by the nato allies to try to assuage domestic us political pressures critical of us ground force participation there are currently an additional 3000 us personnel in hungary croatia and italy providing support functions for sfor this includes air force navy and marine corps pilots flying air support crs3 missions from italy though not officially part of sfor the us sixth fleet is on routine station in the mediterranean should its resources be required both natos supreme allied commander saceur gen wesley clark and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen hugh shelton have argued against troop reductions below 6900 at this time maintaining that greater reductions could erode effectiveness and place remaining troops at greater risk nato military officials believe robust and obvious military presence is the most effective way to forestall resumption of intrabosnia hostilities or attacks on sfor sfor force requirements will be reviewed every six months in conjunction with evaluations of progress in implementing the dayton accords and troop levels may be reduced depending upon the stability of the region an independent factor which may influence nato decisions on troop levels in bosnia is the ongoing conflict in the serbian province of kosovo though kosovo is not contiguous to bosnia and effect has been yet seen on events in bosnia the conflict nevertheless raises tensions in the region sfor air units have already been used in the nato airpower demonstration exercise vigilant falcon carried out around kosovo in june 15 1998 were nato to decide to take more forceful action in kosovo it is unclear what if any role sfor would play it is likely however that at least the sfordedicated air units based in italy would be involved congress remains concerned about the us troop levels in bosnia as indicated by several amendments offered to the dod fy1999 authorizing and appropriating legislation see congressional concerns the senate adopted an amendment sponsored by senators thurmond and mccain to s 2057 the fy1999 dod authorizing legislation requiring by september 30 1998 detailed presidential report on the impact of phased us reduction of forces to 2500 by february 2 20001 the us sfor contingent is called task force eagle and has command of the multinational division north sector headquartered near tuzla for the first two years of bosnia operations units stationed in germany 1st armored division and 1st mechanized infantry division provided the core of the us contingent from september 1997 to july 1998 the 2nd armored cavalry regiment ft polk was the command unit command was then returned to the 1st armored division which will be replaced in october by brigade of the 1st cavalry division ft hood the 1 st cavalry will remain in bosnia for at least one year rotating brigades every six months given the openended nature of operation joint forge it has become necessary to involve stateside army units to reduce the burden on europeanbased units other units scheduled to deploy to bosnia this fall include elements of 35th armor regiment 40th engineer battalion 4th air defense artillery regiment and the 11th aviation brigade in addition to these heavy units there are considerable military police civil affairs psychological operations and logistical support units in the us contingent the proportion of these types of units has increased steadily since the initial nato deployment which consisted primarily of heavy armor and mechanized forces this reflects the almost complete lack of armed resistance 1 s 2057 was subsequently inserted in hr 3616 the house version of the dod fy1999 authorizing legislation which is currently in housesenate conference crs4 nato forces have encountered and an increasing involvement in the civil implementation objectives reserve forces and the national guard continue to play significant role in bosnia particularly in the army and the air force about 16000 army reservists and 10000 air force reservists have participated in or supported bosnia operations while most of the army personnel have been involuntarily activated under the presidential reserve callup authority 10 usc sec 12304 most of the air force personnel have been volunteers one notable change in the sfor force structure has been the addition of the multinational specialized unit msu created in response to us initiative the msu is composed of about 600 paramilitary police they are to serve as two battalion rapid response force to deal with outbreaks of civil violence thereby relieving sfor combat troops of the responsibility of dealing with relatively low level crowd violence unlike the existing international police task force an unarmed trainingobserver group the msu is armed with automatic weapons and light armored vehicles they are under nato command and are authorized to deploy throughout bosnia tactical command of their activities will fall to the nato sector headquarters in which they are operating currently italy and argentina are contributing personnel to the msu and talks are underway with spain poland the czech republic hungary and the netherlands concerning their participation in early 1999 the united states is unlikely to contribute to this unit because it has comparable paramilitary police forces perhaps the most critical role for the msu will be working to assist the safe return of refugees to their former homes they may also become involved detaining suspected war criminals table 1 shows the troop and combat aircraft contributions of

mission clarity and mission creep nato has delineated the following tasks in the sfor mission they have been endorsed by the administration and forwarded to congress in the presidents report on bosnia operations as required by the fy1998 defense authorization act house document 105223 they are divided into two categories key military tasks and key supporting tasks with latter to be undertaken depending upon available means and capabilities key military tasks maintaining deterrence of renewed hostilities preventing removal of weapons from cantonment maintaining the operation of the joint military commissions ensuring force protection freedom of movement and continued compliance with the ceasefire and zones of separation monitoring the military components of the dayton accords and if required enforcing compliance controlling the airspace over bosnia contributing within means and capabilities and in manner similar to sfors previous approach to secure environment within which civil implementation can continue key supporting tasks supporting the high representative supporting phased and orderly returns of refugees by contributing to safe and secure environment but not forcible returning of refugees or undertaking to guard individual locations supporting the conduct of elections and the installation of elected officials supporting the international police task force in assisting local police by providing backup support and secure operating environment but without undertaking civil police tasks supporting the high representative and the osce in media reform efforts supporting the international war crimes tribunal and efforts against war criminals supporting the osce on casebycase basis in implementing the regional arms control regime contained in the dayton accords supporting the implementation of the brcko decisions presently in effect contributing to the continued improvement of freedom of movement through out bosnia and herzegovina the military tasks remain sfor s primary mission but over the last year nato has become increasingly willing to devote resources to the key supporting tasks noted above recently issued mission statement from us task force eagle headquarters announced it would coordinate civilmilitary activities in the following areas rule of law resettlement of refugees enhanced democratization improvement of public security economic recovery infrastructure repair and media reform2 this indicates potentially much broader sweep of activities than natos commanders were willing to undertake for the early years of 2 task force eagle home page httpwwwtfeaglearmymilmissionhtm september 1 1998 crs8 bosnia operations basing refusal to become involved in incidents of civil violence or the pursuit of war crimes suspects on what often appeared to some observers as very conservative interpretation of their mission nato commanders focused almost exclusively on separating and disarming the ethnic faction armies with these tasks accomplished and facing increasing pressure to acknowledge that the dayton accords civil implementation efforts required greater level of nato military support sfor commanders began to play more active role in 1997 upon assuming command nato saceur gen wesley clark played leading role in increasing sfors participation in nonmilitary stabilization activities this trend was reinforced when it began to be evident that nato would not withdraw its forces with the expiration of the original sfor mandate in june 1998 in considering the extension of the deployment the question of mission duration was paramount there had been considerable criticism of ifor and sfors fixed deadlines noting that those in bosnia who opposed the accords were encouraged by these withdrawal deadlines to simply wait it out rather than cooperate even strong critics of us openended commitments who had supported fixed dates for withdrawal objected to politically palatable deadlines that then came and were facto ignored as operations continued under new mandates and names in response to these and other criticisms nato political leaders decided in june 1998 that sfor should have date certain for withdrawal rather its withdrawal would depend upon the extent of progress made in implementing the dayton accords with specific benchmarks of progress outlined and semiannual force requirement evaluations mandated the nato allies formally approved these benchmarks see p 12 and the sfor operation plan call for sfor to develop in coordination with international civilian agencies criteria to evaluate progress in addition sfor headquarters is also preparing estimates of how long it will take to achieve each benchmark nato saceur gen wes clark expects sfor to report the criteria and timelines in september the administration has affirmed that it will in turn provide this report to congress3 with the decision to tie length of deployment to the civil implementation of the dayton accords it has become incumbent upon nato military commanders to pay greater attention to the supporting tasks the sooner these are accomplished the sooner sfor forces will be reduced or withdrawn this change has however heightened concerns that tying sfor s duration to successful civil implementation could result in very lengthy deployment given the continued animosity among ethnic groups and while casualties have been extremely low4 the financial costs for bosniarelated operations since 1992 have totaled an estimated 94 billion through fy19995 presenting significant challenges to both lawmakers and dod officials in period of budgetary restraint the concept of mission creep is one that has attracted much attention the term is generally accepted to refer to the incremental broadening of mission objectives and the addition of mission tasks to point where they move beyond the original purpose of the operation or deployment this concern comes to the fore primarily when costs either in dollars or us casualties are significant or when an operation is judged failure often cited is the experience in somalia in 1993 where what began as humanitarian aid escort mission escalated over time into combat search and capture raids against local faction 3 goals of the dayton agreement message from the president of the united states house document 105292 4 us forces have had only one fatal casualty attributed to hostile action senior enlisted man who was killed when he picked up landmine 5 department of defense office of the comptroller this figure also includes us air and sea operations conducted in support of united nations peacekeeping missions prior to natos iforsfor operations crs9 leaders the highly publicized failure of one of these raids in which us forces sustained 18 combat fatalities brought strong criticism of the administration for allowing such mission creep to occur and led to the withdrawal of us troops the issue was of less concern during recent us operations in haiti where armed opposition was encountered and costs were relatively lower while the last two and half years of nato operations in bosnia have seen escalation to combat indeed iforsfor have been remarkable for the lack of casualties attributable to hostile action the emphasis of sfor activities has undeniably changed it can be argued that sfor has not experienced mission creep but has simply shifted its focus from primary to secondary tasks of the original mission statement nevertheless the types of activities sfor troops are undertaking and the level of resources dedicated to them have altered over the last year perhaps the most notable change has been the increased efforts to detain war crimes suspects though approximately 30 suspects remain at large out of 67 as of april 1998 british dutch and us troops have been noticeably more active in detaining or capturing individuals for transfer to the international war crimes tribunal and this activity has been credited with in turn encouraging other suspects to surrender voluntarily on july 29th however press reports indicated that usbritish plans to seize the two most important war crimes indictees former bosnia serb president karadzic and military leader gen mladic have been suspended owing to lack of cooperation by french military commanders and us commanders concerns about potential civilian and military casualties6 there appears therefore to be some continued selflimiting by nato commanders in this area of activity one of the more challenging mission areas for both civil and military authorities is the safe resettlement of refugees in regions of continued ethnic tension yet this task is critical to the overall success of the dayton accords even the new mission statement of sfor notes limits to the extent to which sfor will become involved see key supporting tasks above to assist in this task nato has created and placed under sfor command the paramilitary police multinational special unit msu this unit is expected to serve as rapid reaction force to deal with incidents of lowlevel violence and crowd disturbances thereby freeing sfor combat troops from these responsibilities though the creation of the msu was us initiative the united states has paramilitary police to contribute to the unit consequently any escalation of msu activities that occur will not involve us personnel in general it appears that nato officials and us officials in particular while accepting some greater responsibilities in civil activities are remaining sensitive to the issue of mission creep they are likely to have to continue to balance the desire to accelerate implementation of the dayton accords with concerns over increased combat troop involvement in noncombat roles particularly within the us

on sfor part of the clinton administrations early strategy on the nato force in bosnia was to focus on the force completing its mission within set time frame until the implementation forces 12month mission was nearly completed the administration avoided making any firm pronouncements on possible successor missions to ifor or possible us participation in such mission emphasizing rather ifors scheduled completion and full withdrawal by the end of 1996 throughout that year administration officials had reiterated the presidents pledge to keep the us troop commitment to ifor to about one year administration officials acknowledged the probable need for some sort of international military presence to remain in bosnia after ifor but would not commit to position on us participation on november 15 1996 president clinton announced that the united states would take part in nato followon force in bosnia he estimated that the us troop contribution to the successor sfor would amount to about 8500 troops or less than half the number of us troops in the original ifor he recommended an 18month mandate for the nato force with further reductions envisaged at sixmonth review intervals natos later decisions formally establishing sfor upheld these principles the principal rationale for continued us military engagement in bosnia developed by the administration was that notwithstanding the many achievements of ifor peace efforts in bosnia still needed additional time to consolidate an outside security force would be able to provide the stability for economic reconstruction and political reconciliation to continue administration analysts assessed that hostilities were likely to resume in bosnia after full withdrawal of international forces at the same time the administration rejected simple extension of ifors mandate instead it emphasized that ifor had indeed completed its mission within 12 months and that the stabilization force and its mission were distinct from ifor the administration differentiated sfor from ifor in response to charges that it had broken its promise of completing ifors mission in 12 months president clinton also made the claim that the sfor mission was far more limited than ifors thus requiring fewer troops plans to steadily reduce the forces size indicated that sfor was expected to do less rather than more than ifor as it turned out nato refrained from drawing down sfor force levels during its 18month tenure already in early 1997 some administration officials began to offer predictions that another successor force may well be required to follow sfor after june 1998 in contrast defense secretary william cohen strenuously emphasized the firmness of the administrations commitment of us troops to sfor for 18 months only secretary cohen stated that he would pursue the possibility of having the europeans develop postsfor operation7 many observers expressed skepticism about this strategy since european power had demonstrated any inclination to lead or even participate in postsfor force 7 us senate committee on armed services hearing on the fiscal year 1998 defense budget february 13 1997 crs11 without the united states in late 1997 top administration officials began to lay the groundwork for an extended us military commitment to bosnia in september national security advisor samuel berger reiterated that the united states maintained significant stake in daytons success and left open the possibility of longerterm engagement in bosnia on november 4 president clinton met with congressional leaders to discuss progress in bosnia and the possibility of us participation in future multilateral force on december 18 1997 in statement before the press president clinton announced his agreement in principle that us forces would participate in nato peacekeeping force in bosnia after sfors mandate expired in june 1998 as justification president clinton said that while progress in bosnia was unmistakable it was not yet irreversible followon force was needed in order to preserve the gains made in the past two years by us and allied peacekeepers in bosnia and to allow further progress toward selfsustaining peace to continue in major departure from earlier us policy clinton stated that the deadline approach of the earlier forces was wrong and emphasized that the new mission must be tied to concrete benchmarks not to deadline on march 4 1998 president clinton certified to congress8 that the presence us armed forces was required after june 30 1998 in order to meet us security interests in the certification the president asserted that the united states had major national interests in peace in bosnia that it was in the us interest to see the dayton agreement implemented rapidly and that us forces should continue to participate in the natoled force he called for the level of us participation to be reduced from 8500 troops in bosnia to 6900 troops while he proposed that the force not be assigned fixed enddate or arbitrary deadline he asserted that the deployment will not be openended answering the question of what the exit strategy for us forces was the presidents certification outlined ten conditions to be met in bosnia in order for the natoled force to be withdrawn continuation of the ceasefire restructured retrained and reintegrated police effective judicial reform dissolution of

out with the international monetary fund phased and orderly minority refugee returns functioning multiethnic administration in brcko and full cooperation by the parties with the war crimes tribunal on the same day the president submitted to congress request for emergency supplemental appropriations that included costs for the bosnia operation 4869 million for fiscal year 1998 and 186 billion for fiscal year 1999 see following section for further details in testimony before congress in june 19989 us envoy robert gelbard testified that sfors presence in bosnia and role in providing secure environment remained critical according to gelbard the secure environment provided by nato has allowed for accelerated implementation of many aspects of the peace agreement it has supported the ascendance to power of the moderate bosnian serb leadership it has permitted many more refugees to cross entity lines in order to return to their homes at the same time 8 certification of us armed

session us senate committee on armed services hearing on nato operations in bosnia june 4 1998 reuters transcript crs12 administration officials contend that sfor is not itself assigned or involved to any greater extent with nationbuilding tasks or police work defense secretary cohen and other administration officials have refrained from giving any target dates or time schedules for deployment of the natoled force instead progress in achieving the benchmarks outlined above are to be reviewed by nato in order to focus efforts measure progress and permit steady reduction in force levels10 in response to questions from members of congress administration officials have also refrained from publicly assigning target dates for the fulfillment of each of the benchmarks congressional role president clintons decision to deploy us forces to the nato implementation force touched off heated debate in congress in late 1995 at the time many members of congress were concerned about the potential for large numbers of us casualties in quagmire many also doubted whether vital us interests were at stake in bosnia president clinton requested an expression of support from the congress for the bosnia deployment in december 1995 the house of representatives and the senate passed separate resolutions expressing support for us troops being sent to bosnia legislative efforts to reject the presidents decision by barring funds for the deployment of us troops to bosnia were narrowly rejected11 in 1996 as it became clearer to most observers that followon mission to ifor would be required both houses of congress held numerous hearings on the future of us forces in bosnia while all praised the performance of us troops in ifor some members charged that the administration was breaking its promise to keep us troops in bosnia for one year only many members also criticized the administration for not consulting with congress in forthright manner on the realistic prospects for followon mission this time the administration did not request an explicit expression of support from congress for sfor in the end however the 104th congress adjourned before final decisions were made on sfor and without any vote on the subject legislation in the 105th congress in march 1997 the administration submitted request for about 2 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations and rescissions for fy1997 to cover dod costs of contingency operations in bosnia and elsewhere and emergency disaster relief in the united states the senate version of the bill hr 1469 barred funding for us ground

in bosnia except for training or to prevent imminent loss of life to conduct or provide support to any activity that would jeopardize the primary military mission of the natoled force in bosnia to resettle refugees if the resettlement effort is part of an effort to gain control of territory allotted to the other entity or exposes us forces to substantial risk or to implement any change in the legal status of bosnian territory without the agreement of all parties the senate approved an amendment by senator hutchison expressing the sense of congress that declining defense budgets and expanded missions including the ongoing openended commitment of us forces to bosnia have eroded the readiness of us forces to execute the national security strategy of the united states congressional debate president clintons announcement in december 1997 that us troops would stay in bosnia until selfsustaining peace takes hold has sparked congressional debate many members have expressed concern that us troops are engaged in an openended deployment to bosnia with an everexpanding mandate they say that the benchmarks laid out by the administration are very broad in scope and will take many years to achieve if they can be achieved at all many members favor pullout of us ground troops from bosnia in the relatively near future turning the bosnia mission over to the uss european nato allies with the united states providing logistical intelligence and other support many members have also expressed concern that the bosnia mission was absorbing limited dod funds that should go toward such areas as research and development readiness and weapons procurement while most members have expressed strong desire to have us ground troops leave bosnia in the near future there is more controversy on how to achieve this goal senator carl levin senator john warner and other members have pushed the administration to provide timelines for the achievement of the benchmarks laid out by the crs16 administration and have stressed the need for the administration to press the europeans to take over the bosnia mission within reasonable amount of time these ideas were incorporated in s 1768 which provided fy 1998 supplemental appropriations for the bosnia operation and s 2057 the fy 1999 defense authorization bill other members while supporting these efforts express great skepticism about the concept of the benchmarks saying it is unlikely that it is unwise to tie the withdrawal of us troops to benchmarks that cannot be achieved in the foreseeable future if at all they favor stronger measures to compel us troop reductions these arguments were made by senator byrd and senator hutchison during senate debate on the fy 1999 defense authorization and appropriations bills however during the debate on the fy 1999 defense authorization bill senator cain said that while he shared the frustration of many members with the openended nature of the us presence in bosnia he believed that it was the role of the president as commanderinchief and military commanders in the field to set troop levels in bosnia not congress in addition to concerns about the wisdom of administration policy in bosnia some members have expressed constitutional objections to the bosnia mission saying that it was started without explicit congressional authorization and should be terminated unless congress passes legislation giving specific approval to the bosnia deployment this viewpoint was reflected in h res 227 and the craig amendment to the ratification of protocols to the north atlantic treaty while many members emphasize their desire to see pullout of us troops from bosnia in the relatively near future some members stress the need for continued us military presence on the ground to ensure that progress continues during debate on s 2057 senator joseph biden said that while he favored pressure on the uss european allies on the issue of the bosnia mission it would be mistake to push for the withdrawal of us ground troops from bosnia as long as natoled peacekeeping force remained in the country because such move could undermine us leadership in nato crs17 for other versions of this
