from michael mann mannvirginiaedu to dr nanne weber weberknminl subject re workshop report date mon 18 jun 2001 115015 0400 cc michael mann mannvirginiaedu julia cole jcolegeoarizonaedu rbradleygeoumassedu jtouarizonaedu storchgkssde wannergiubunibech tom crowley tomoceantamuedu kbriffaueaacuk xflowed hi nanne thanks for your comments ive asked julie cole who is attempting revised draft to incorporate your suggestions hans or you should also provide revised paragraph 7 that is more to your liking than what i wrote im requesting that julie wait until the end of this week friday jun 22 to give the others time to get their comments in also then after julie provides w her revised draft ill try to make few more small changes and sent that onto the group for suggested final changes i hope this sounds acceptable to all concerned thanks mike at 0322 pm 61801 0000 dr nanne weber wrote hi mike and others below follow some comments on the draft report for eos that you send around the general outline is fine for responding to julies comment on the largescaleregional reconstruction issue i guess that the three different approaches mentioned are not necessarily restricted to largescale especially 1 can be for all scales 2 will work better for large scales but 3 could be very well applied to regional scales like african monssoon or nao however i do think that this scales issue should be addressed explicitly in the text as indicated in my comments we can not cover all of the workshop in small eos report but i do think that there should be more emphasis on the different model strategies presented processbased proxy modeling and some more mention of historical documentary data i am willing to take my share in the rewriting task just let know what is most convenient for you one practical point the netherlands funding agency is called national research program nrp of the netherlands knmi is my affiliation but it did not pay the bill thanks nanne first first sentence name all boundary conditions relevant for geological timescales astronomical forcing orography ghg concentrations or none first fifth sentence three distinct approaches have in reconstructing the largescale and regional climate history of past centuries and millenia first point 3 the assimilation of paleoclimatic proxy data directly into leave out forced climate model integrations using statistical models to upscale the proxy data to largescale climatic patterns in manner conceptually etc second can be written in more condense manner one ore two sentences discussing the largescale versus regional climate issue should be added for example i add after the second sentence the first method this holds for spatial scales ranging from local in the case of sitebysite calibration to large scale in the case of pattern calibration eg enso and nao and up to hemisphericglobal ii add just before it was our belief that meeting the second and third approaches are more suitable for reconstructing the actual largescale climatic state as the local climate is inherently noisy and only to limited amount determined by external forcing or related to largescale patterns like eg the nao second modify the description of the third approach as follows the third approach can be thought of but it is nudged toward the actual observed largescale climatic state at the time resolution provided by the proxy data this method is more resistant to the potential biasesmodelbased approaches but it is relatively untested to the application of proxy data fourth leave out second sentence frequencydomain too much technical detail in too condensed form to be understandable to general reader of eos fifth very much biased toward the modeling of largescale forced signal my go at modelling paragraphs three types of modelling experiments were distinguished free simulations without any external forcing giving insight into the patterns and timescales of internallygenerated variability forced simulations and simulations constrained by the assimilation of proxy data examples were presented where models used ranged from an energy balance model ebm an intermediatecomplexity climate model emic to atmospheric and coupled general circulation models gcm simulations with an ebm as well as gcm appear to explain variations over centurytodecadal timescales in proxybased reconstructions of the northern hemisphere temperature over the past millenium using estimated changes in radiative forcing solar irradiance changes volcanic activity ghg and aerosol concentrations discrepancies however etc bit long as it is now processbased models of glaciers and sea level were used to generate synthetic records of these lowfrequency proxies on the basis of emic and gcm simulations using unforced runs as well as orbital and solarforced runs over longer timescales simulated glacier lengths and sea level variations can be used to validate the models response in climatic parameters which are not well constrained by existing proxy data like the hydrological cycle in addition modeldata intercomparisons can be carried out on the level of the proxy itself rather than on the level of reconstructed climatic variables such processbased models require an understanding of local meteorological processes as well as the complicated physical biological or chemical processes determining the proxy itself promising new model of treering growth was presented new dataassimilation approach to paleoclimatic reconstruction datun was discussed at length this paragraph is not very clear as it is i can have go at it but maybe hans should seven this could be much shorter several points are mentioned here for the first time move up earlier paragraphs as indicated above currently emphasized highresolution proxies such as tree rings historical documentary data corals and ice cores in addition lowfrequency climate variability may be reconstructed from lowresolution proxies such as borehole records glaciers foraminifera in marsh cores indicative of sea level as well as lake and ocean sediments which are not necessarily laminated processbased proxy models would enable to better exploit the information contained in proxy records and help to resolve the origin of apparent discrepancies between the different data sources it is also important to better constrain the histories of radiative forcings prior to ad 1600 it was strongly felt that there should be an emphasis on developing projects
