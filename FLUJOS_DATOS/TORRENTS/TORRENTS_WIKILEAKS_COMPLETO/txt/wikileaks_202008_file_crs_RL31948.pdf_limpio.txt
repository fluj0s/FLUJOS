concerns of its members on nominations firs t is the custom of senatorial courtesy whereby senators from the same party as the president might influence nomination or kill it by objecting to it this custom has not always been observed absolutely but it has allowed senators to play fairly large role particularly in the selection of nominees within senators home state ch as for district court

states that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate sha ll appoint ambassadors other public ministers and counsels judg of the supreme court and all other

constitutional convention and the phrase tting up the process for the nomination and confirmation of fe deral officials members of th supreme court and others clearly meant different things to different framers of the constitution and those who have followed the participation of both the president and the senate in the process was compromise between two factions at the convention who were concerned about the allocation of power on the one side were men such as elbridge gerry of massachusetts and benjamin franklin of pennsylvania who worried most about vesting too much power in the hands of sing individual frank lin said that he was concerned that the executive will always be increasing here as elsewhere til it end in monarchy1 their counterparts men like james ma dison of virginia james wilson of pennsylvania and alexander hamilton of new york wanted strong executive with ultimate responsibility for choosing member s of his administration and who would not be as indebted to factions as they believed senators might good laws are of effect without good executive and th ere can be good ex ecutive without responsible appointment of officers to ex ecute said

september 7 17873 hamilton believed that the clause gave the senate negative power that of withholding its approval which mbers would use only infrequently it will be the office of the president to nominate and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint there will of course be exertion of choice on the part of the senators they may defeat one choice of the executive and oblige him to make another but they cannot themselves choose they can only ratify or reject the choice of the president4 john adams however thought the senate would play far bigger role in letter to thomas jefferson in 1787 adams wrote that you are apprehensive of monarchy i of aristocracy i would therefore have given more power to the president and less to the senate the nomination and appointment to all offices i would have given to the president assisted only by privy council of his own cr eation but not vote or voice would i have given the senate or any senator unless he were of the privy council faction and distraction are the sure and certain consequences of giving to senate vote on the distribution of offices5 with such varied interpretations of th meaning of the phrase at its creation it is wonder that the proper role of the senate in the nomina tion and confirmation process has been much disputed ever ce while the appointments clause clearly vests in the president the power to identify individuals he wishes to place in confirmable offices wrote political scientist michael j gerhardt the senates official functions or duties in the appointments process are not so clear6 the senate has played large role in the process during some administrations and lesser role in others which has been largely function of the presidents ability to translate his power into influence with congress some presidents such as thomas jefferson were able to both win confirmation of most of their nominees while largely retaining control over the choice of nominee others such as president abraham lincoln decided to share the power with the senate retaining sufficient influence over the positions to reap the rewa rds of patronage while giving the senate enough authority to

mistaken wrote congressional scholar sarah binder most presidential nominees emerge from the senate confirmation proce ss and are eventually confirmed8 traditionally the senate s exerted the most influence over the appointment of federal judges members of the suprem court and independent agencies the senate has usually given president wider latitude in selecting members of his cabinet generally the senate defers far more to presidents nominees to executive offices than to his nominees to judicial offices particularly to the supreme court according to gerhardt9 since 1789 of the 158 nominations to th supreme court 114 were confirmed and served seven of the remaining 44 were confirme d but refused the position one died before he could take office and 36 nominations we re not

ained in senate rules but all of which have been adhered to and recognized by the chamber at one time or another these traditions emanate from desire on the part of senato rs to be involved not only in passing judgment on nominations but so in the actual selection of the nominee in the first place particularly for federa l judges while hamilton and others did not foresee this as the way the senate would operate it nevertheless became the norm for the senate in the course of time the practice of consulting members of the senate about appointments in their states was transf ormed into the

occurs the attorney general usually through his deputies undertakes search for possible nominees at this early stage the senators of the presidents party are usually brought into the process13 individual senators exercised their role in this process in different ways they may have their own nominee or slate of nominees or they may elect at this point to reserve judgement preferring to react to the deputy attorney generals nominees in any case their role is cruc ial some say determinative through the custom of senatorial courtesy the senato rs may exercise virtual veto over the presidents choice the extent and natu re of this exercise of power varies considerably with the senator some pref er wide consultation with state and local interests giving those interests in effect the power of choice in return of course for favors rendered others jealously figh t for this power to virtually dictate the choice of particular nominee14 much of the process is informal nd takes place behind closed doors and not much has been written about it from what has been written it is clear that each states process differs as does each pres idents policy about consulting senators some state delegations have agreements among officeholders bout how the judicial selection process is to work in others there are commissions which are involved in the selection process while in some states there is agreement at all15 since the first congress when senators felt their desires we re not being taken into account by the president they devel oped institutional proce sses to make their displeasure known and protect what they saw as their role in the process first there developed the tradition of s enatorial courtesy by wh ich senators could block confirmation of the confirma tion of individuals from thei r home states along the same lines is the blue slip tradition emanating from the judiciary committee which can allow homestate senator to bl ock judicial nomination also senators have used the informal tradition of holds to prevent or delay the senate from acting on nomination senators also have used the tool of extended debate known as filibuster to delay or prevent nominee from being confirmed there are other tools that the senate has used less frequently such as changing the qualifications needed to do job or doing away with position entirely some scholars have suggested that congress liberately reduced the number of positions on the supreme court to prevent president andrew johnson from winning confirmation of his mination of henry stanbery to be an

increased back to eight within two months of new president taking office16 finally it is within the discretion of the chair of committee whether to hold hearing on nomination one of the key ways nomination dies is with public action in 1997 president clinton withdrew the nomination of former massachusetts governor william weld to be ambassador to mexico after senator jesse helms r nc chairman of the senate foreign relations committee refused to hold hearing on the nomination17 the development of these practices is in keeping with what some senators believe is the proper role of the senate in the nomination and confirmation process thensenate majority leader geor ge mitchell dme said in 1992 the american constitution does not assign different weights to the presidents nominating power and the senates decisi on as to whether it shall advise and consent to the confirmation of nominations instead it establishes process whereby the principal positions in our government can only be filled when the president and the senate act jointly thus from the time of our founders the senate has been vital partner in the process of evaluating candidates for service in high government positions18 senator robert p griffin rmi noted in 1968 that early in its history the senate rejected president george wash ingtons nomination of john rutledge to be chief justice of the supreme court and he continued that action in 1795 said to the president th in office and to future presidents dont expect the senate to be rubberstamp we have an independent coequal responsibility in the appointing proce ss and we intend to exercise that responsibility as those who drafted the constitution so clearly intended19 but senate majority l eader mike mansfield dmt during the same 1968 debate urged senators to allow vote on supreme court nomination clearly then our responsibility is merely to evaluate the qualifications of the nominee and to record our pleasure or displeasure to give our

indefinite holds filibusters and special procedures provides individual senators with substantial means to impede presidents nominating authority21 senatorial courtesy three months into the first senate ssion senators rebuffe d president george washington on his nomination of benjamin fishbourn to be naval officer of the port of savannah georgia senators had objection to the individual washington had selected rather they were responding to the two senators from georgia who had wanted to give the job to someone else after fishbourn was rejected washington submitted the individual preferred by the georgia senators who was promptly confirmed22 that was the first example of something that has come to be called senatorial courtesy this unwritten tradition has meant that senators from the home state of nominee and also of the party of the pres ident can block nomination to federal office within their state merely by objecting to it senators have also used the concept of courtesy to block nominee of president from another party if the concerned senator was in the majority in the chamber23 and the objections of senator from the minority party have also stopped nominations on numerous occasions24 though an unwritten tradition senatorial courtesy has been honored to some degree or another by most presidents every president since madison has paid at least lip service to senatorial courtesy wrote gerhardt much more often than not presidents have paid dearly for ignoring or failing to give adequate respect to senatorial courtesy25 the strength of the tradition comes from the idea that courtesy means one senator will honor the objections of anothe r to nomination in the first senators home state the courtesy of the senate soon became cherished

the nomin ation was personally obnoxious to him frequently that pronouncement was sufficien t to kill the nomination president franklin delano roosevelt nominated floy d h roberts to be district judge

of f roy yoke to be collector of internal revenue in west virginia the senate conf irmed him over holts objections31 still the courtesy tradition became so in grained with judicial nominations to district courts that senato r griffin wrote about the prac tice in 1969 it is fact though sometimes deplored by political scientists that judges of the lower federal courts are actually nominated by senators while the president exercises nothing more than veto authority32 in 2003 senator orrin hatch noted that the custom of senatorial courtesy continues to be followed nator hatch who was chairman of the senate judiciary committee during the last six years of the pr esidency of bill clinton was explaining what had happened to judges nominated by clinton who were not confirmed seventeen of thos

sena torial courtesy we afford to home state senators in the nominations process 33 the objections hatch referre d to were made before the nomination ever made it to the floor for vote senators longer stand on the floor and declare candidates to be p ersonally obnoxious the role of courtesy has strengthened the hand of individual senators in the process according to gerhardt there is rich history of individual senators who have been successful either by manipulating senate rules or by building coalitions at thwarting or delaying nominations in situations in which the nominating president failed to consult with them before making nominations or failed to accept their recommendations for offices in the senato rs field of intere st or home states34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31948crs9 35 in

device used by the senate judiciary committee to communicate with the homestat senators about nomination to the us courts of appeal or district courts or to be us marshal or us attorney when nominee is referred to the committee the committee sends letter typically on light blue paper asking the two homestate senators to take position on the nomination the senators check off the appropriate box on

kinds of nominations the practice of using blue slips dates back to at least 191736 it is matter of some debate how impor tant blue slips are in the confirmation process the blue slip practice is not formal part of the judiciary committees rules and the determination of just how much weight to give to senators opposition to nomination is left largely up to the chair of the committee among other issues the chair will decide whet her to honor the objections voiced through blueslips from all homestate senators or just those who belong to the same party as the president37 when james eastland dms chaired the judiciary committee from 1956 to 1978 his policy stated that if he did not get back two blue slips endorsing the nominee the nomination would not move furt her in the process other chairs have said they would give blue slips strong c onsideration but that negative blue slip or one not returned by senator would not necessarily kill nomination38 some senators have declined to return completed blue slip to the committee in an effort to delay action on the nomination some analysts have said that the blue slip process developed because the senate needed to create process by which

the matter in question whethe r to grant that request is decision of the leaders nowhere in the written senate rules is the tradition of holds to be found and it is not clear when the practice began the very nature of the holds process gives the majority and minority leaders great deal of discretion in deciding whether to honor request for hold and if so for how l ong however implicit in request for hold is the ability of senator to use par liamentary tools to filibuster or to delay consideration of the nomination or legislation at issue also implicit in request for hold is the desire of the

to an nd there have also been filibusters where there was cloture vote so looking at cloture votes provides only partial picture the senate adopted the cloture rule in 1917 which then for the first time provided members with way of ending debate after lengthy debate in 1949 the senate adopted change to its rules that in addition to many other things allowed the senate to vote cloture on items of executive business such as treaties and nominations while proponents of the 1949 cl oture change talked about the need to get to final vote on treaties they did not mention nominations or any situations they might have had in mind concerni ng filibusters of nominations46 also the two most comprehensive historical analyses of the senates role in dvice and consent one published in 1938 and the other in 1953 do not mention the word filibuster in conjunction with nominations47 one reason could be that the other devices in place the blue slip and senatorial courtesy allowed senators to prevent confirmation by the full senate when they were concerned about partic ular nomination anot her interpretation is that senators did not previously use filibus ters against nominations or when they did the senate used other methods other than clot ure to try to bring the debate to close such as enforcing the senate rule which prohibits members from making more than two speeches on the same subject on any day one historian found that president w oodrow wilsons nominee to be director of the census was blocked veral times in executive clo sed sessions in 1913 once it became clear that full filibuster of the nomination was possibility supporters of the nomination agreed to postpone cons ideration of the nomination until the end of the fiscal year48 there are also several examples of par ties in the senate blocking action on group of nominations toward the end of pr esidents term particularly when new administration from different party was poi sed to take power at the end of the

judgement of th national interest and the prestige and character of the senate those who ch arged that the president should not have acted with respect to the appointment at all notwithstanding his constitutional duties as president have perfect opportun ity to test out their case after debating it by motion to table the nomination or by voting against the motion to take it up but the senate has the right to vote on the nomination on the merits after reasonable debate51 michigan democrat philip hart so spoke in opposition to the filibuster to reject the nomination with all of its implications for the future of the supreme court is so serious that th matter should be proceeded with on its merits if we for the first time in our history permit supreme court nomination to be lost in fog of filibuster i think we would be setting precedent which would come back to haunt our successors we tend to overstate the importance of anything in which we are involved here i have lingering suspicion that history will record this to have been one of the most significant actions and i hope it will be action that the senate will be confronted with in the period that many of us have been permitted to sit here i do hope we willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31948crs14 52 sen phillip hart supreme court of the united states congressional record vol 114 september 26 1968 p 28252 53 sen howard baker supreme

beth and betsy palmerbe permitted to discharge our constitutional responsibility to advise and consent or not consent52 opponents of the fortas nomination said they believed it was their constitutional duty to advice and consent which gave them the right to talk about the nomination as long as they felt necessary under rule xx ii of the senate rules which sets out the process for cloture tennessee republican howard baker said and so mr president i am also not ov erly taken with charges which are made from time to time in the press and elsewhere and from time to time on the floor of this body that dilatory tactics sometimes characterized as filibusters otherwise extended debate frequently as obstructionism but which are clearly within the framework and scope of the rules of procedure in the senate and particularly rule xxii are permitting wilful minority as one distinguished daily newspaper characterized it to obstr uct the will of the majority it occurs to further that it is basic and fundamental to the governing process in democracy and consonant with the traditi ons of this nation that at any given moment the majority is not always right all of the time and it is clear and predictable that the people of america in their compassionate wisdom require the protection of the rights of the minority as well as the implementation of the will of the majority53 north carolina democrat sam ervin w ho opposed the fortas nomination and voted not to end debate on the motion to proceed defended the use of the filibuster and cloture procedure mr president i think that rule xxii is perfectly constitutional the constitution provides that each house may determine the rules of its proceedings the senate adopted rule xxii in pursuance of that constitutional authority i think rule xxii is very wise it protects minority which thinks it is right against the tyranny of the majority that is very desirable majorities need protection it is only minorities which need protection rule xxii is needed it tends to expand the ability of the minority to convert an erroneous majority to its views it is wise and enlightened process and should be treated with great veneration by all men54 including the fortas nomination clot ure has been sought on 35 judicial nominations and 36 executive branch nominations between 1968 and 200655 for 17 of those 71 nominations

nomination of dr henry foster to be surgeon general there has been significant debate about whether filibustering nominations is violation of the constitutions requirement that the senate advise and consent to nomination56 opponents of using filibusters against nominations say that the constitution requires the full senate to act on nominations sent to it by the president and that the need to win 60 votes to invoke cloture is an unconstitutional super majority57 those who defend the use of filibusters ag ainst nominations note that one of the dominant themes during debates on the constitution was how to protect the rights of the minority something extended debate has the effect of doing and they note that the senate is empowered by the constitution to set its own rules of procedures58 in

regarding bate on presidential nominations his resolution sres 138 would have changed rule xxii by imposing on succeeding cloture votes an everdecreasing threshold for invoking cloture on nomination

about whethe r senate rules on cloture for nominations should be change d and if so how they could be changed majority leader frist said he might consider using complicated set of parliamentary steps to allow majority of senators to change senate rules over the objections of the minority an option called the nuclear option by opponents and the constitutional option by its supporters
