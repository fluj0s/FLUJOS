principles underlie current us policy on permanent immigration the reunification of families the admission of immigrants with needed skills the protection of refugees and the diversity of admissions by country of origin each of these four principle constitutes its own stream or column of immigrants thus for example the queue for familybased immigrants generally functions independently of the queue for employmentbased admissions the immigration and nationality act ina specifies complex set of numerical limits and preference categories that give priorities for permanent immigration reflecting these principles prospective immigrants must first meet the eligibility requirements for the specific visa category and then form queue based upon numerical limits set by visa category and country of origin these preference categories are detailed in appendix current us legal immigration preference system under the ina immigrants are legal permanent residents lprs who are foreign nationals living lawfully and permanently in the united states during fy2005 total of 11 million aliens became lprs in the united states of this total 578 entered on the basis of family ties other major categories in fy2005 were employmentbased lprs including spouses and children at 220 and refugeesasylees adjusting to lpr status at 127 5

certain value or range those qualities in an applicant which are valued more highly or are more sought after are given higher point value in order to qualify or pass an applicant must receive predetermined number of points or fall within the top end of the point distribution the scope and complexity of point systems offer range of possibilities three elements are central to devising point system the factorscriteria the scoringscaling dimensions and the possible use of tiers g8g138g140g157g152g155g156g561 as noted above points systems are based upon list of criteria or factors most often the factors are based upon the prospective immigrants educational attainment work experience language proficiency occupation and age other factors that arise albeit less frequently link prospective immigrant to the destination country such as offers of employment close family ties prior work or educational experience in the destination country these factors are typically focused on criteria that predict economic success but also might include factors that are geared toward adaptability social acculturation or assimilation

scaled according to the years of schooling eg 2 points for each year of schooling beyond high school or scored according to specific number of points given to the 5 crs report rl32235 us immigration

the educational requirements eg 25 points for an advanced degree g22g146g142g155g156g561 tiered approach to points systems organizes the factors into separate streams for example there might be tier for shortage occupations tier for recent graduates in science technology engineering and mathematics and tier for extended family of us citizens within each of these tiers there might be separate scoring mechanisms that assign points for example according to age work experience or language proficiency

elements that is within tier there may be factors and subfactors given differing weights or some factors may be scaled and other factors may be scored within the same tier or overall point system

and these theories particularly arise in the context of point systems there are variety of economic social and public policy theories that often shape the discussion by adjusting the point values to favor admissions of immigrants with skill sets that are in highest demand the point systems rooted in classical economic theory might aim to maximize the probability that the migrant will be net contri butor to the countrys economyboth in the short and long term6 moreover by keeping the immigrant labor force supply at or slightly below market demand point system based upon economic theory might attempt to approximate labor market equilibrium without the potential for severe adjustment costs eg overheating housing market or exogenous shocks to the labor market eg large influx of foreign nationals classical economists would note that despite such governmental efforts at pinning down labor market demand for skill sets the use of government agency to determine market forces will incur the loss of efficiency the most efficient outcome classical economists argue is always going to be achieved through the free flow of individuals in an open market and thus by having open borders yet scholars will also note that such inefficiency may serve as incentives in the marketplace for desirable economic change such as technological innovation and wage growth 7 the objective to maximize the likelihood of immigrant assimilation might lead to point system which values those social factors correlated to acculturation family ties and relatives residing in the united states might be highly valued for the community and social linkages they provide to 6 testimony of queens university professor of economics charles m b each in us congress senate committee on health education labor and

being within certain age range higher levels of education and language skills might be chosen for social assimilation as well as economic reasons if the societal goal is to increase the ethnic and racial diversity of the immigrant stream then point system might add credits for immigrants coming from countries that are traditionally under represented in the migrant flow8 finally point system might be designed with public policy underpinning to maximize public support in theory an immigrant selection system might be more efficacious with the public if it is one in which elected officials rather than individual employers or families are establishing priorities at the national level to choose new immigrants one strand of recent research characterizes point systems as potentially inspiring public confidence by appearing to use universal datadriven and objective selection criteria that convey to the public that the government is being proactive in ways that put national economic interests first 9 g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g18g152g146g151g157g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g156g561 among the countries that currently employ meritbased point system the four highest profile systems are those of canada australia new zeal and and the united kingdom generally such merit based criteria are referred to by these countries as skilled immigration each of these countries employs point system in assessing candidates for skilled immigration in the four different systems those skilled immigration applicants with the most points according to various characteristics would immigrate ahead of applicants with lower point totals in addition each of these four countries employs preference system for familybased immigration they also employ quotas to determine levels of family and humanitarian immigration these family and humanitarian immigrants are thus placed in separate immigration queues although the categories vary for each country each of these countries generally requires that the potential applicant demonstrate some sort of official language competence educational qualifications and be within certain age range although failing to meet one of these qualifications may automatically disqualify applicants in some countries these criteria are not basic requirements in every country while the united kingdom for example requires basic knowledge of english for every applicant skilled immigrants to canada can technically qualify without knowledge of either of the countrys offi cial languages english or french generally an applicant who receives passing mark in any of the four countries discussed below is believed to possess skills that are in sufficient demand to ensure ample employment opportunities if such an

country considered in this section that does not require certain competence level applicants that are fluent in both official languages may receive up to 24 points for their language skills but even those without any language qualifications are still eligible to qualify however because of the way in which the points are distributed an individual with competence in either official language would have to have confirmed permanent job offer in order to qualify additionally this individual would have to receive some adaptability points to receive passing mark thus while jure prerequisite for official language skills does not exist achieving passing point score without these skills would be difficult for most applicants 23 for those potential migrants who wish to settle in quebec there are

passing mark will also affect the ability of these categories to determine immigrant eligibility for example skilled immigration to australia requires that an applicant accumulate between 73380 of the available points such high passing mark ensures that applicants must receive high qualifying marks in most categories new zealand requires that an individual accumulates 482 of all available points yet because the country offers large number of bonus points for employment in rural and targeted areas achieving passing mark becomes more difficult for individuals who wish to settle outside these areas the canadian point system requires an applicant to accumulate 67 of available points thereby ensuring that an individual must score points in at least thre categories for the united kingdom

policy scirp which congress established in 1978 did not endorse point system as part of its comprehensive package of immigration reform recommendations in 1981 the scirp offered this explanation for its position despite considerable support for point system it became clear that it would be difficult for commissioners not to mention congress to decide on criteria and the specific value of points to be awarded for each fundamental value questions are at issue for example if points are given for englishlanguage ability certain countries would clearly be favored administration of point system

these criteria are permitted entry without the labor market tests required of most other employmentbased lprs and the law allocates up to 286 of the 140000 employment based lprs for these priority

points systems such as those discussed above typically seek to tailor the selection process to recruit immigrants most likely to invigorate their economies the stated objectives are generally to encourage migration that complements shortfalls and skill mismatches in their labor forces coupled with other factors that are thought to correlate with success the challenge for policy makers is adapting point systema method that is typically used to encourage migrationto manage the highdemand migration context of the united states in this debate passing marks and percountry ceilings will

the current preference system for selecting lprs to the united states is largely based upon relationships that are personal more specifically prospective lprs qualify either through marriage and close

whether point system or any new mechanism for selecting immigrants is augmenting an existing selection system or replacing an existing selection system it affects the debate establishing new stream of immigrants is lik ely to spark objections among those who oppose increasing immigration levels if alternatively point system replaces an existing set of immigration preference categories then stakeholders in the current system are likely to oppose it if point system creates an independent stream of immigrants it might reduce the control of employers over the selection process and bypass the labor market protections for us workers given that many policy makers as well as observers view immigration policy as zerosum game this aspect may be the most contentious of all

the difficulty in many countries is designing system that effectively operationalizes these specific values priorities and needs into immigration policy point systems are appealing to some because they may be structured to provide parsimonious and transparent tool defining meritbased immigrant eligibility yet paradoxically these same attributes of point systems also make them more likely to be politically charged instrument the objective quantification of merit itself provokes debate over what human capital personal traits and values prospective immigrants should bring to country
