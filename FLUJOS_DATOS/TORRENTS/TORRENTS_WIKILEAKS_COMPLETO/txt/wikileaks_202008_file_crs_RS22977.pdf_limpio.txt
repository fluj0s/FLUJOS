level of poverty in the country other accomplishments included the completion of oil and gas pipeline export routes to the west although aliyev has pledged to mainta in his existing policy course an armenian politician has suggested that aliyevs clear electoral mandate may give him increased power to make unpopular decisions to resolv the conflict in the breakaway nagorno karabakh region11 those who take more pessimistic view of developments during aliyevs first term and prospects for the future point to the re portedly increased level of corruption during his rule and his failure thus far to resolve the nk conflict they warn that aliyev may face decreasing economic growth during his second term arising from the fall in world oil prices and global economic problems that may jeopardize his support among critical constituencies and set back his efforts to improve living conditions in the country many observers argue that aliyev easily would have won the election even if the boycotting opposition party leaders had decided to run these opposition party leaders had failed in the past to gain many votes and are hence discredited they argue12 the apparent insignificance of the election boy cott further indicates just how much their parties have been marginalized these observers maintain critics of this view argue that without free media the popularity of the pres ident is not based
