are record counts different from other tools like asdf and whats on cover 12 why is the tool noforn is there releasable version 13 how do you compile your record counts for each country note this document is workinprogress and will be updated frequently as additional questions and guidance are provided 1 u what is boundlessinformant what is its purpose ufouo boundlessinformant is gao prototype tool for selfdocumenting sigint system the purpose of the tool is to fundamentally shift the manner in which gao describes its collection posture boundlessinformant provides the ability to dynamically describe gaos collection capabilities through metadata record counts with human intervention and graphically display the information in map view bar chart or simple table prior to boundlessinformant the method for understanding the collection capabilities of gaos assets involved ad hoc surveying of repositories sites developers andor programs and offices by extracting information from every dni and dnr metadata record the tool is able to create near realtime snapshot of gaos collection capability at any given moment the tool allows users to select country on map and view the metadata volume and select details about the collection against that country the tool also allows users to view high level metrics by organization and then drill down to more actionable level down to the program and cover term sample use cases ufouo how many records are collected for an organizational unit eg fornsat ufouo how many records and what type are collected against particular country ufouo are there any visible trends for the collection ufouo what assets collect against specific country what type of collection ufouo what is the field of view for specific site what countriees does it collect against what type of 2 u who are the intended users of the tool ufouo mission and collection managers seeking to understand output characteristics of site based on what is being ingested into downstream repositories ufouo strategic managers seeking to understand top level metrics at the organizationoffice level or seeking to answer data calls on nsa collection capability ufouo analysts looking for additional sites to task for coverage of particular technology within specific country 3 what are the different views ufouo map view the map view is designed to allow users to view overall dni dnr or aggregated collection posture of the agency or site clicking on country will show the collection posture record counts type of collection and contributing sigads or sites against that particular country in addition to providing graphical display of record count collection boundlessinformant faq page 1 of 3 unclas sifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only boundlessinformant frequently asked questions 09062012 trends in order to bin the records into country normalized phone number dnr or an administrative region atom dni must be populated within the record clicking on site within the site specific view will show the viewshed for that site what countries the site collects against ufouo org view the organization view is designed to allow users to view the metadata record counts by organizational structure ie gao sso rama spinneret all the way down to the cover term since its not necessary to have normalized number or administrative region populated the numbers in the org view will be higher than the numbers in the map view ufouo similarity view the similarity view is currently placeholder view for an upcoming feature that will graphically display sites that are similar in nature this can be used to identify areas for deduplication effort or to inform analysts of additional sigads to task for queries similar to amazons if you like this item youll also like these feature 4 u where do you get your data ufouo boundlessinformant extracts metadata records from gmplace postfallout dni ingest processor and posttuskattire dnr ingest processor the records are enriched with organization information eg sso fornsat and cover term every valid dni and dnr metadata record is aggregated to provide count at the appropriate level see the different views question above for additional information 5 u do you have all the data what data is missing ufouo the tool resides on gmplace which is only accredited up to tssinoforn therefore the tool does not contain eci or fisa data ufouo the map view only shows counts for records with valid normalized number dnr or administrative region atom dni ufouo only metadata records that are sent back to nsaw through fascia or fallout are counted therefore programs with distributed data distribution system eg muscular and terrestrial rf are not currently counted ufouo only sigint records are currently counted there are elint or other int records included 6 u why are you showing metadata record counts versus content ufouo 7 u do you distinguish between sustained collect and survey collect ufouo the tool currently makes distinction between sustained collect and survey collect this feature is on the roadmap 8 what is the technical architecture for the tool click here for graphical view of the tools architecture ufouo dni metadata asdf dnr metadata fascia delivered to hadoop distributed file system hdfs on gmplace ufouo use java mapreduce job to transformfilter and enrich fasciaasdf data with business logic to assign organization rules to data ufouo bulk import of dnidnr data serialized google protobuf objects into cloudbase enabled by custom aggregators ufouo use java web app hosted via tomcat on machineshop formerly turkeytower to query cloudbase ufouo gui triggers queries to cloudbase gxt extgwt 9 what are some upcoming featuresenhancements boundlessinformant faq page 2 of 3 unclas sifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only boundlessinformant frequently asked questions 09062012 ufouo add technology type eg juggernaut loper to provide additional granularity in the numbers ufouo add additional details to the differential view ufouo refine the site specific view ufouo include casn information ufouo add ability to export data behind any view pddgsigadsysidcasntechcount ufouo add in selected vs unselected data indicators ufouo include filter for sustained versus survey collection 10 how are new features or views requested and prioritized ufouo the team uses flawmill to accept user requests for additional functionality or enhancements users are also allowed to vote on which functionality or enhancements are most important to them as well as add comments the boundlessinformant team will periodically review all requests and triage according to level of effort easy medium hard and mission impact high medium low the team will review the queue with the project champion and government steering committee to be added onto the boundlessinformant roadmap 11 why are record counts different from other tools like asdf and whats on cover ufouo there are number of reasons why record counts may vary the purpose of the tool is to provide boundlessinformant faq unclas sifiedfor official use only page 3 of 3
