science and industry division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22496 energy prices faced by consumers have risen steeply in the last few years and it is likely that spending on energy substituted at least to some extent for spending on other goods and services it is widely believed that increases in energy prices particularly gasoline negatively affect tourism the data presented provide partial and preliminary support on an aggregate level on the other hand there is anecdotal evidence that the effect may not be large in addition only part of any slowdown in tourism should be attributed to energy prices this report will be updated when warranted by events energy prices and consumer spending consumers have faced sharply rising energy prices in the last few years most recently they increased 28 between the first quarter of 2005 and the second quarter of 2006 table 1 motor gasoline prices which rose 39 during the period had increased 31 from their 2002 average to the average for the first half of 2005 prices paid by households for natural gas in the second quarter of 2006 were 13 higher than in the first quarter of 2005 but had been 34 and 28 higher in the fourth quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006 similar to gasoline heating oil prices rose 33 between the first quarter of 2005 and the second quarter of 2006 and had already increased substantially from their 2002 average inasmuch as the price elasticity of demand for purchases of energy in the short run is low1 higher energy prices have led to noticeably increased aggregate spending on energy in absolute terms and also as percentage of total personal consumption 1 demand price elasticity is measure of buyers responsiveness to change in price the large number of estimates of the demand price elasticity of gasoline for example based upon empirical studies average about 025 for the short run demand price elasticity of 025 means that the quantity purchased will decrease 25 in response to 10 price increase the short run is period in which consumer has insufficient time to change equipment or significantly alter behavior congressional research service the library of congress crs2 expenditures thus energy

viewed on august 10 and 14 2006 note spending for natural gas and heating oil as percent of total personal consumption expenditures is not shown because household use of natural gas and heating oil tends to be concentrated in the midwest and northeast respectively national percentages would understate the effect of gas and oil price increases on households in those regions quarterly data are averages of monthly figures b personal expenditures on energy as percent of total personal consumption expenditures c includes energy forms not shown separately d utility piped gas service crs3 higher natural gas and heating oil prices probably resulted in much higher aggregate spending on those energy forms in the midwest and northeast where those energy forms respectively are used very widely aggregate spending for natural gas and heating oil as percentages of total personal consumption expenditures in those regions cannot be obtained however as the bea data are on national level and percentages calculated on that level would understate the effect of gas and oil price increases on households in those regions other things being equal the increase in energys percentage of total personal consumption expenditures from 53 in 2002 to 72 in the second quarter of 2006 means shift in spending of 150 billion at an annual rate2 to energy unless the increase in personal income in current dollars between 2002 and the second quarter of 2006 annual rate3 was sufficient to fully accommodate the increased spending on energy it is likely that such spending replaced spending on other goods and services at least to some extent effects on tourism httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22496 it is widely believed that increases in energy prices particularly gasoline prices have negative effect on tourism the data presented above and below provide preliminary and not unanimous support of this on an aggregate level anecdotal evidence also mixed tends to indicate little effect of energy price increases on tourism in any event as noted below not all of any decline in tourism should be attributed to energy prices some data suggest that there has been some slowdown in tourism in the first half of 2006 there were 09 fewer air passenger enplanements4 than in the first half of 2005 the number of air passenger miles was only 13 greater and motor gasoline consumption was only 06 greater table 2 these relative changes are less than the increases of 19 in constant dollar gross domestic product gdp and 25 in constant dollar aggregate personal income the secondquarter 2006 profits recorded by the airline industry seem to contradict the above evidence of slowdown in air travel these however are the results of the industrys cost cutting through capacity reductions efficiency improvements including fuel conservation and fare increases rather than big gains in air travel volume in any case because travel is major component of tourism and considerable travel is done for reasons other than tourism the total volume of travel per may reflect factors other than energy price increases this is especially true of gasoline consumption only 2 total marketbased personal consumption expenditures in the second quarter of 2006 were 7847 billion at an annual rate 72 of that is 566 billion 53 of that is 416 billion see table 1 for source of data 3 bea survey of current business august 2006 current dollar data not shown in table 2 4 one farepaying passenger originating or connecting boarding an aircraft with unique flight coupon crs4 40 of vehicle miles traveled by households were for social and recreational purposes in 2001 according to the national household travel survey5 not indicative of slowdown in tourism is the 24 increase between the first half of 2005 and 2006 in the number of hotel and motel rooms sold table 2 versus the 19 rise in gdp and 25 increase in personal income average daily room rates were up 68 resulting in gain of 90 in average revenue

years which found that gasoline price increases depress overall lodging demand with the biggest effect on demand for economy hotel rooms moreover the study found that resorts were not harmed7 supportive of the hypothesis that people will travel despite higher gasoline prices but tend to economize was late june 2006 pkf hospitality research report that there is migration toward more economical accommodations in the form of limited service hotels and motels8 perhaps contributing to this is the emergence and growth of travel websites that make it easier to compare room rates and book hotel and motel rooms perhaps clearer suggestion of slowdown in tourism is the decrease in the number of overnight stays at national parks which began in 2004 table 2 many of the most popular parks are in the western part of the country distant from the highly populated regions of the country and requiring long trips the decrease in overnight park stays at the same time that the number of hotel and motel rooms sold increase appears to be consistent with the observation by many that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22496 people still take trips when gasoline prices rise but travel shorter distances anecdotal evidence of the effect of increased energy prices on tourism tends to be mixed appearing in articles with titles such as cant stop guzzling and holiday travelers hit the road but scrimped bit9 travel and tourism employment the number of people employed in industries related to travel and tourism shown in table 3 could indicate effects of higher energy prices on tourism but this evidence is mixed as well employment at establishments providing travel arrangement and reservation services while down from 2002 actually was higher in the first half of 2006 than in the first half of 2005 despite the greater ease of self booking available on the internet noted earlier with steep rises in jet fuel providing an additional incentive airlines are still striving to economize the decline in the number of people employed by airlines at least since 2003 has continued into 2006 hotel and motel employment having recovered somewhat from 911 slipped back in the first half of

increased energy prices on tourism key economic and other factors have not improved prospects for lower crude oil prices and lower gasoline prices have not improved stricter security measures may well over time dampen airline travel at least for while and the middle east remains generator of uncertainty despite the recently established cease fire between israel and hezbollah
