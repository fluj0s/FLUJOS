agricultural policy resources science and industry division crop insurance and disaster assistance in the 2008 farm bill summary the federal government has relied primarily on two policy tools in recent years to help mitigate the financial losses experienced by crop farmers as result of natural disasters federal crop insurance program and congressionally mandated adhoc crop disaster payments congress has made several modifications to the crop insurance program since the 1980s in an effort to forestall the demand for supplemental disaster payments although the scope of the crop insurance program has widened significantly over the past 25 years the anticipated goal of crop insurance replacing disaster payments has not been achieved although the federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized and hence does not require periodic reauthorization modifications to the crop insurance program were made in the context of the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill some policymakers viewed the crop insurance program as potential target for program cost reductions and proposed using these savings to fund new initiatives in various titles of the farm bill consequently many of the crop insurance provisions are costsaving measures according to congressional budget office estimates the crop insurance provisions title xii in the 2008 farm bill will reduce program outlays by 39 billion over the fiveyear period of the bill fy2008fy2012 much of the savings 28 billion is achieved through change in the timing of crop insurance payments and receipts that will not directly affect the final monetary amounts for participating farmers or insurance companies the rest of the savings is generated through increased fees paid by farmers for catastrophic coverage and reduction in reimbursements to the participating insurance companies for their operating expenses among many other provisions to address concerns about program waste fraud and abuse the farm bill also authorizes up to 4 million annually for data mining activities beginning in fy2009 separately title xv of the 2008 farm bill authorizes new 38 billion trust fund to cover the cost of making agricultural disaster assistance available on an ongoing basis over the next four years through five new programs the largest program is supplemental revenue assistance payment program for crop producers that is designed to compensate eligible producers for portion of crop losses that are not eligible for an indemnity payment under the crop insurance program to be eligible for payment producer must be either in or contiguous to county that has been declared disaster area by either the president or the secretary of agriculture an eligible producer also is required to have purchased crop insurance in advance of disaster however the statute makes an exception for the 2008 crop year by allowing uninsured producers to be eligible as long as they pay the equivalent

previous law and house and senatepassed bills 9 crop insurance and disaster assistance in the 2008 farm bill agriculture is generally viewed as an inherently risky enterprise farm production levels can vary significantly from year to year and by location primarily because farmers operate at the mercy of nature and frequently are subjected to weatherrelated and other natural disasters since the great depression policymakers have decided that the federal government should absorb some portion of the weatherrelated production losses that otherwise would depress farm income and could alter farmers decisions about what to produce in some highrisk locations federal crop insurance is the primary ongoing crop loss assistance program it is permanently authorized by the federal crop insurance act as amended 7 usc 1501 et seq and is administered by the us department of agricultures risk management agency rma this is complemented with the noninsured assistance program administered by the farm service agency fsa which is available to producers not offered insurance coverage lack of insurance availability occurs in locations where there is insufficient production history to determine actuarial risks of crop or in regions where production of specific commodity is relatively small following widespread and severe drought in 1988 congress approved large ad hoc disaster assistance program to supplement the ongoing disaster programs such ad hoc assistance subsequently has became routine for more information on currently available agricultural disaster assistance see crs report rs21212 agricultural disaster assistance since the federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized it does not require periodic reauthorization in an omnibus farm bill however during the 2007 2008 farm bill debate some policymakers expressed interest in revising the crop insurance program in the context of the farm bill andor supplementing it with permanent disaster payment program crop insurance background federal crop insurance policies are marketed and serviced by private insurance companies in purchasing policy producer growing an insurable crop may select level of crop yield and price coverage and pay portion of the premium which increases as the levels of yield and price coverage rise the remainder of the premium is covered by the federal government coverage is made available through various insurance products including revenue insurance which allows participating producer to insure target level of farm revenue rather than just production levels according to the usda the federal crop insurance program provided coverage in 2007 to over 100 crops covering more than threefourths of planted acreage in the country although the list of covered commodities has grown in recent years 80 of total policy premiums and federal subsidies are accounted for by just four commodities corn soybeans wheat and cotton crs2 table 1 government cost of federal crop insurance

research and development initiatives mandated by arpa of 2000 pl 106 224 crs3 because the program is not subject to periodic reauthorization major changes to the crop insurance program usually are not addressed in the context of an omnibus farm bill over the past 25 years the program has been subject to three major legislative enhancements in 1980 1994 and 20001 each of which has pumped additional federal dollars into the program in order to enhance farmer participation levels in anticipation of precluding the demand for ad hoc disaster payments since the last major modification in 2000 the federal subsidy to the crop insurance program has averaged about 325 billion per year up from an annual average of 11 billion in the 1990s and about 500 million in the 1980s nearly twothirds of the current federal spending is used to subsidize insurance policy premiums and the balance primarily covers the government share of program losses and reimburses participating private insurance companies for their administrative and operating expenses see table 1 although the scope of the program has widened significantly over the past 25 years the anticipated goal of crop insurance replacing disaster payments has not been achieved in virtually every crop year since 1988 congress has provided ad hoc disaster payments to farmers with significant weatherrelated crop losses these have been made available primarily through emergency supplemental appropriations and until recently regardless of whether producer had an active crop insurance policy the exception to the historical pattern is the fy2007 supplemental appropriations act pl 11028 as amended by the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act which is expected to provide an estimated 24 billion in crop disaster payments for 2005 2006 or 2007 crop losses but only to those producers who held an active crop insurance policy or enrolled in the noninsured assistance program in the year of the crop loss2 since fy1989 total disaster payments have amounted to more than 20 billion or just over 1 billion per year over the past six years fy2001fy2006 the federal cost of the crop insurance program combined with ad hoc supplemental disaster payments has averaged 45 billion per year see figure 1 for summary of all agricultural disaster assistance provided by congress since 1988 see crs report rl31095 emergency funding for

and disaster assistance provisions of the enacted 2008 farm bill pl 110246 and the major issues that shaped the debate see appendix below for comparison of the crop insurance and disaster assistance provisions in the enacted 2008 farm bill with the house and senatepassed versions of the farm bill and previous law reducing crop insurance program costs because of the rising cost of the crop insurance program many policymakers viewed the program as potential target for spending reductions whereby savings could be used to fund new initiatives in various other titles of the farm bill consequently title xii of the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill contains several revisions to the crop insurance program most of which are designed to reduce program costs for all crop insurance provisions in title xii the congressional budget office cbo estimates net budget outlay savings of 39 billion over 5 years fy2008fy2012 or 56 billion over 10 years fy2008fy2017 relative to the march 2007 baseline which was the official budget scoring benchmark for the bill crs5 timing of crop insurance payments approximately 28 billion of this estimated fiveyear savings is attributable to changes in the timing of premium receipts from farmers and payments to the participating insurance companies none of these revisions would directly affect the final monetary amounts for participating farmers or insurers but would still be scored as savings within the fiveyear horizon of the bill essentially these 2008 farm bill provisions will allow usda to collect two crop years of premiums in 2012 and delay the 2012 payment of reimbursements and underwriting gains into the next fiscal year insurance company reimbursements and loss sharing although crop insurance is sold and serviced by private insurance companies the federal government absorbs large portion of program losses and reimburses the companies for their administrative and operating ao expenses loss sharing and ao reimbursements currently are spelled out in standard reinsurance agreement sra between usda and the private companies3 under the sra the reimbursement rate for ao expenses currently averages 22 to 24 of total premiums the 2008 farm bill reduces the ao reimbursement rate by 23 percentage points beginning with the 2009 reinsurance year july 1 2008 this reduction can be restored in any state that experiences loss ratio of 12 or greater ie when total indemnity payments to farmers are more than 20 greater than total premiums the farm bill also reduces the ao reimbursement rate to 12 for any plan of insurance that is based on areawide losses cbo estimates that these provisions will save 618 million over five years house provision to require the insurance companies to share more of their underwriting gains with the federal government was not included in the final version of the bill the conferees did adopt provision that allows usda to renegotiate the sra once every five years beginning with the 20102011 reinsurance year during the farm bill debate the administration and others contended that the private insurance companies should be required to absorb more of the program losses and that the reimbursement rate for company ao expenses needed to be reduced as means of reducing federal costs proponents for change point out that ao reimbursements to the companies have doubled over the last seven years see table 1 mainly because farmers have been buying up to higher levels of insurance coverage causing total premiums to rise since ao reimbursements are based on percentage of total premiums and premiums have been rising significantly in tandem with crop prices the administration contends that the companies are being overcompensated for their expenses the private crop insurance companies contend that any reductions in the ao reimbursement will negatively impact the financial health of the crop insurance industry and possibly jeopardize the delivery of crop insurance particularly in highrisk areas farmer subsidy and costs under the crop insurance program farmers pay premium for cat coverage which is 100 subsidized by the government and are encouraged to purchase higher levels of coverage on average about 50 3 for more background and for the text of the sra see httpwwwrmausdagovpubsra crs6 of the premium is subsidized by the government for this buyup coverage for farmers whose crops are not covered by crop insurance they are offered the equivalent of cat coverage under separate noninsured assistance program nap and pay an administrative fee for this coverage number of provisions are included in the 2008 farm bill that require participating farmers to share more in program costs including 1 an increase in the fee paid by farmers for both catastrophic cat coverage and nap to 300 per crop per county from the previous 100 fee and 2 4 percentage point reduction in the rate of premium subsidy received by farmers for policies based on areawide losses the 2008 farm bill also requires usda to operate the crop insurance program so that the anticipated loss ratio is 10 ie total indemnity payments equal to total premiums compared with the thencurrent statutory loss ratio requirement of 1075 to achieve the new lower ratio could mean somewhat higher premiums for farmers waste fraud and abuse for many years policymakers have been concerned about waste fraud and abuse within the federal crop insurance program the agricultural risk protection act arpa of 2000 pl 106224 contained several provisions designed to enhance usdas recognition of and response to challenges to program compliance and integrity in response to the arpa requirements usda used data mining techniques to compile an annual list of producers who either exhibit high loss ratios ie high indemnity payments relative to total premiums exhibit high frequency and severity of losses or are suspected of poor farming practices that might contribute to production losses usda estimates that the use of the spotcheck list has prevented between 70 million and 110 million each year in improper payments mandatory funding authorized by arpa for data mining and other arparelated program integrity activities expired at the end of fy2005 general provision in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 allows usda to use up to 11166 billion in mandatory funds in fy2008 to strengthen its ability to reduce waste fraud and abuse within the crop insurance program however future funding for this activity was uncertain the 2008 farm bill authorizes up to 4 million annually for data mining activities beginning in fy2009 and authorizes 15 million annually for four years fy2009fy2013 to upgrade usdas computer technology for crop insurance agricultural disaster assistance during the 20072008 farm bill debate some policymakers wanted to make permanent in the farm bill some level of disaster payments to supplement the crop insurance program supporters say that ongoing farm disaster programs do not adequately address emergency needs when major disaster strikes and that usda should have at its disposal permanent source of disaster funds in the same manner as the federal emergency management administration fema questions in the debate included how such program would be funded given current budget constraints and whether the permanent availability of disaster payments would adversely affect participation in the crop insurance program and possibly encourage production on highrisk lands crs7 supplemental crop revenue assistance program title xv of the 2008 farm bill authorizes series of new disaster programs through september 30 2011 the largest of which is supplemental revenue assistance payment program for crop producers the program is designed to compensate eligible producers for portion of crop losses that are not eligible for an indemnity payment under the crop insurance program ie the portion of losses that is part of the deductible on the policy an eligible producer can receive payment equal to 60 of the difference between target level of revenue and the actual total farm revenue for the entire farm the target level of revenue would be based on the level of crop insurance coverage selected by the farmer thus increasing if farmer opts for higher levels of coverage see the box in this report for description of how the guarantee level and total farm revenue are defined by the statute to be eligible for payment producer must be either in or contiguous to county that has been declared disaster area by either the president or the secretary of agriculture payments are limited so that the disaster program guarantee level cannot exceed 90 of what income likely would have been in the absence of natural disaster the producer also must have at least the minimum level of crop insurance cat coverage for insurable crops and participate in the nap program for non insurable crops the statute makes an exception for the 2008 crop year by allowing producers who did not purchase crop insurance or nap coverage in advance to be eligible for the program as long as they pay the equivalent administrative fee for coverage within 90 days of enactment other authorized disaster programs in addition to the supplemental crop revenue assistance payment program described above the 2008 farm bill also authorizes and funds four smaller disaster programs 1 livestock indemnity payments which compensate ranchers at rate of 75 of market value for livestock mortality caused by disaster 2 livestock forage disaster program to assist ranchers who graze livestock on droughtaffected pastureland or grazing land 3 emergency assistance for livestock honey bess and farm raised fish which will provide up to 50 million to compensate these producers for disaster losses not covered under other disaster programs and 4 tree assistance program for orchardists and nursery growers who can receive payment to cover 70 of the cost of replanting trees or nursery stock following disaster up to 100000 per year per producer disaster program funding all five of these farm bill disaster programs will receive funding through newly authorized agricultural disaster relief trust fund within the us treasury the trust fund will receive the equivalent of 308 of the amount received each year fy20082011 in us customs receipts collected on certain goods the congressional budget office cbo estimates the combined total costs to be 38 billion over the fouryear life of the programs relative to the march 2007 budget baseline of this total cbo estimates that supplemental crop revenue assistance will cost 17 billion over the four years or an average of 425 million per year another 16 billion would cover increased crop insurance and nap costs associated with the crop insurance and nap purchase requirement the balance of 500 million would cover the combined estimated cost of the other four disaster programs if the cost of the programs exceeds the level of funding provided through customs receipts the 2008 farm bill gives the trust fund the authority to borrow from the treasury such sums as necessary to meet its obligations crs8 supplemental agricultural disaster assistance payment mechanism in the 2008 farm bill title xv of the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 authorizes new crop disaster
