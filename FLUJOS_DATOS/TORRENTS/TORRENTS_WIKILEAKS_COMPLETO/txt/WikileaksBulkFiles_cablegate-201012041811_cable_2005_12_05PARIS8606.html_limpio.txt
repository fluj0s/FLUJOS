na tags prel pgov pinr soci fr eun subject ambassador meets with key sarkozy advisor francois fillon 1 sbu summary sarkozy advisor and former education minister francois fillon told the ambassador december 20 that sarkozy had chance to buck the french predisposition to vote against the ruling party in 2007 by focusing his presidential campaign on the electorates deepseated desire for real change fillon argued that the victor in 2007 would need to make the presidency more personally accountable and involved in explaining government policy to the populace the eu in fillons opinion is struggling under the weight of new members and it was time to bring the uk into the francogerman union in order to move the body forward fillon believed transatlantic relations would be more cordial under sarkozy presidency although disagreements would certainly arise they would be handled in more nuanced manner fillon elaborated on sarkozys plan to improve the french economy through welfare reform and greater flexibility for businesses and offered his own views on needed changes for the french education system end summary 2007 elections 2 sbu the ambassador met december 20 with francois fillon former minister of education 20042005 and social affairs labor and solidarity 20022004 in the raffarin government who was named in july 2005 to be the political counselor to nicolas sarkozy in his role as president of the union for popular movement ump fillon noted the instability of the french fifth republic compared to the governments of germany and the uk and commented that the french electorate always voted for change this suggested that the socialist party ps should logically win in 2007 but sarkozy had chance because he was strong proponent for change whereas the ps had turned into party of restoration of the status quo he insisted that most french voters really do want change although he conceded that they are also afraid of losing what they have chirac always erred on the side of french fears rather than desire for change and villepins big liability would be that he is seen as continuation of chirac sarkozy by contrast was betting that people really wanted reform 3 sbu fillon believed that sarkozy would remain in the government until january of 2007 when the ump would officially nominate its presidential candidate at which time he would break with chiracvillepin to run for the presidency he said that chirac and villepin would do everything possible in the meantime to trip him up the recent unrest in the suburbs had not hurt sarkozy fillon noted because he was seen as taking action on the issue fillon did not foresee cohabitation government saying the people will choose president and give him majority in parliament institutional reform 4 sbu elaborating on his statement that the french fifth republic is inherently unstable fillon said there was need to move to presidential system in which the president would have to take more active role in explaining the governments actions to the people and the parliament the only such public appearance by chirac was his disastrous town hallstyle appearance in early may in favor of the eu constitution while there were also arguments in favor of more parliamentary system fillon said that it would be impossible to convince the french electorate to abandon the election of president by universal suffrage nor was in possible any longer for the president to remain above the fray he said then blame everything on the pm the move to fiveyear presidential term of office had reinforced this trend he characterized what he said was ps plan to weaken the powers of the presidency in favor of the prime minister as unrealistic the eu 5 sbu the eu currently suffered from lack of direction and leadership fillon said he explained that enlargement was the main problem which made it difficult to take decisions efficiently we can hardly express ourselves in meetings with 25 members he lamented since there was time to take the floor more than once in order to move the eu forward fillon saw need to expand the francogerman couple into francogermanobritish menage trois his basic point was that it was hollow to think that europe could progress without the uk he saw the emergence of angela merkel as positive while commenting that chirac was trying to make his relationship with her appear closer than it was in the vane of the mythical francogerman tandem returning to his analysis of the french electorate fillon argued that the may 29 french referendum vote was not rejection of change or europe but in fact vote for more radical overhaul of the system this coincided with the tendency of the french to vote against the current government which had backed the eu constitution however fillon conceded this was his interpretation and that it was difficult at the moment to accurately draw conclusions from the referendum vote usfrench relations 6 sbu fillon thought sarkozy government would better be able to work together with the us and be less overtly critical and more nuanced in its public statements under sarkozy he continued disagreements would not as easily lead to blowups with close and vital allies at the same time he cautioned this would not change the very real antiamerican sentiments of some parts of the french populace in response to the ambassadors comment that france is perceived as an obstacle to us ambitions for nato fillon noted that there needed to be better balance in nato between europe and the us first however he said that europeans themselves needed to be clearer about their priorities separately fillon noted that sarkozy did not necessarily see the need for high levels of defense spending economy 7 sbu on economic issues fillon called for fusing welfare with unemployment so that the unemployed would be more compelled to take jobs they were offered he noted that sarkozy economic system would push for more flexibility for businesses and simplification of the work codes he also advocated breaking the power of unions including requiring that elections be held every several years with open candidacies education 8 sbu fillon spoke at length about giving schools more autonomy citing this as yet another area where europe was falling behind but stopped short of recommending decentralization he criticized the burdensome bureaucracy of the education system and lamented that the short time that leaders remain in power limited their ability to effect change increasing immigration required adaptation of the system but france had avoided such adjustments he thought universities should become independent and that communes should assume more responsibility for early education he talked about using limited resources for overtime pay for those teachers willing and most able comment 9 sbu fillon came across as seasoned nondogmatic and serious political figure he appeared pragmatic forthcoming accessible and open to continued dialogue he has commented publicly on his disappointment at not being included in the villepin government because of his support of sarkozy fillon is among sarkozys closest advisors and is considered potential prime ministerial candidate should sarkozy be elected president in 2007 end comment please visit paris classified website at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexc fm stapleton
