from richard baker rbakercslgovuk to mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk subject re finalising praproc 21st november 1997 date mon 17 nov 1997 165956 0800 replyto rbakercslgovuk mike i hope you had my comments from few weeks ago yes sorry ive taken so long to reply 1 overheads we charge eu projects 20 overheads and these are totally acceptable yes you are quite right 2 budget i will need to redraft our budget please tell estimated start data and for how long the project will run i envisage our budget remaining in the bracket 6070k ecu i guess we are looking to april 1998 at the very earliest i heard that some smt projects take up to 2 years to get going even after theyve been approved due to wrangles over the budget we have 1 million ecu for 3 yearsso some project budgets will have to be cut yours looks fine 3 workplan i am assuming the basic climate tasks remain pretty much as before namely 10 gridded monthly climate data for europe for 196190 linked to weather generator that will yield daily data key variables precip tmin tmax vapour pressure sunshineradiation wind wet days frost days yes thatll do nicely b for the world 05deg gridded dataset for 196190 at monthly timesteps excellent c what was decided about very high resolution climate surfaces for 12 regions this was in the original proposal but got dropped i think adding this back to our work plan would involve extra time and hence resources how important are these test 1km resolution datasets weve had problem contacting the spaniards which is bit of blow because they gave nice geospatial feel to the project the norwegians are proposing to conduct high resolution study near osloi think theyll be interpolating locally collected data ill send you their proposal as soon as i can get it into little better shape but in principle i think it would be best if you could at this stage just stick to the low resolution work 4 other eu projects i suggest you mention my involement in clivara which is funded through the environmentclimate programme of dgxii this is running from 19961999 and is concerned with mapping and modelling agriculture across the eu under 196190 conditions and also under future climate change coordinated by environmental change unit at university of oxford let know if you want more info on this brief update to your partner information would be great can you confirm for which forms i need to get completed do you have copies to send or should i get them from here im putting some in the post for you i shall not be able to be with you in york on friday but i am here all this week if there are questions many thanksthere are sure to be some all the very best richard
