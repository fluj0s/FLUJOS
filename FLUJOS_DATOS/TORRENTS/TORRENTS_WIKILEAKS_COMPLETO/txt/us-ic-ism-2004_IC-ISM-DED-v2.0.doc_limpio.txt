intelligence community metadata standards for information assurance information security marking data element dictionary pic intelligence community metadata working group release 20 30 april 2004 preface this data element dictionary ded is part of the documentation set for the intelligence community ic metadata standard for information security marking ism the other part of the set is an implementation guide appendix b reference 3 this ded provides managers and developers formal definitions of the data elements that comprise ic ism ic ism is an implementation of the world wide web consortiums specification of the extensible markup language xml it consists of set of xml attributes that may be used to associate security related metadata with xml elements in documents webservice transactions or data streams it is distributed as both an xml entity set and w3c xml schema wxs so that the xml attributes defined in the standard can be incorporated into any xml document type definition dtd or schema made available along with the ic ism entity set and wxs are controlled vocabularies of terms that are used as the sources for the values of the ic ism attributes the primary focus of this ded is an implementationagnostic definition of the data elements that ic ism implements as xml attributes in the ded the data elements are defined in terms of the descriptors and attributes specified by international standard iso 111793 consequently the ded is applicable to both xml and non xml implementations ic ism is product of the ic metadata working group mwg an activity of the ic chief information officer cio with oversight by the ic cio executive council the development work that resulted in ic ism was performed by panel under the ic mwg comments and suggestions pertaining to this ded should be sent by email to the ic mwg secretariat listed in appendix table of contents preface i table of contents ii 1 introduction 1 11 purpose 1 12 scope 1 13 applicability 1

references b1 appendix c attributes of the data elements c1 appendix d change history d1 introduction ic ism consists of vocabulary of agreedupon data elements that were developed by panel of the ic metadata working group ic mwg to support use of the controlled access program coordination office capco guidelines for security markings references 1 and 2 although the intent of ic ism is for use in xml applications this data element dictionary ded is implementation neutral this guide should be used in conjunction with the ic ism implementation guide version 20 reference 3 1 purpose this ded defines the ic ism standard data elements the purpose is to establish the name semantics data type data representation domain value set andor permissible values for each of the 18 ic ism data elements the framework for these definitions is international standard iso 111793 reference 7 2 scope ic ism refers to the classification and control markings defined by the capco register maintained by the controlled access program coordination office capco ic ism is intended to provide standard set of data elements for incorporating classification and controls metadata into data sets it is not intended to address business rules associated with using classification and controls metadata and is therefore not replacement for capco specifications users of ic ism may develop specific but separate programming interfaces to implement their required business rules around this model business rules were not incorporated into ic ism for several reasons the capco business rules cannot be modeled in simple set of data elements except at the very highest level such as classification business rules regarding security metadata are constantly under revision updates can be incorporated more easily in the model by omitting business rules the model can support the various requirements of each organization it will be the organizations responsibility to understand and incorporate the required business practices for security metadata within the ic this document provides definitions for the data elements that specify the information needed to generate information security markingsportion marks banners and classification authority and declassification information refer to the companion implementation guide to see how the data elements are implemented for xml applications and to see usage examples this document refers to several controlled vocabularies also known as domain value sets the vocabularies are defined elsewhere and are not part of this specification 3 applicability this ded applies to intelligence documents soap envelops and payloads or serialized data streams created in xml format for interchange within the community via the ic system for information sharing icsis community organizational and collateral shared spaces the intent is to provide common set of classification and controls xml attributes for use throughout the community that may be associated with any xml data elements and used for categorization and selection as well as formatting of portion marks security banners and classificationdeclassification blocks ic ism is not intended to address business rules associated with using security metadata and is therefore not replacement for capco requirements or the understanding of those requirements users of ic ism may develop specific but separate programming interfaces to implement their required business rules for populating and using the ic ism attributes 4 the target audience this ded is intended for use by developers and it support personnelnot analysts and other users the ded provides details that should be transparent to authors editors reviewers and dissemination personnel 5 where to submit questions and comments points of contact for this ded the ic msp models and the ic mwg are listed in appendix data element definitions this section contains the standard definitions of the 18 ic ism data elements 1 terminology the data elements are described in terms of 16 properties defined by international standard iso 1117932003 the descriptive properties are explained in appendix c not all properties apply to any given data

in the generic sense prescribed in isoiec 11179 the isoiec 11179 definition of data element encompasses both xml elements and xml attributes as well as rdb and other forms of elements this ded uses the characteristics name definition et to provide an isoiec 11179compliant definition of each of the xml attributes prescribed by the ic ism standard iso 11179 prescribes some of these characteristics to be mandatory the mandatory characteristics are identified in the attributes section below additional optional and mwgdefined characteristics have been included to further describe or clarify each

required attribute for entity securityattributes and as an optional attribute for entity securityattributesoption purpose is to provide single method for specification of us nonus and joint classifications changed the enumerated list for the classification attribute to include nonus values added optional attribute saridentifier as separate container for doddoe specialaccessrequired nicknames codewords or trigraphdigraph to support elevation of sar to the same level as sci controls added optional attributes classifiedby and classificationreason to support generation of eo 12958 classificationdeclassification blocks changed the declared value of derivedfrom to cdata to allow the titles and dates of source documents or classification guides to be specified replaced the single attribute declassification with distinct attributes for datedetermined and eventdetermined declassification and for the 25x declassification exceptions added attributes typeofexemptedsource and dateofexemptedsource for use in specifying that one or more sources was marked oadr x1 through x8 added attribute declassmanualreview for use in forcing mr to appear in header and footer banners regardless of whether any caveats in the portions would necessitate manual review removed entity downgradeattributes reflecting the configuration management panels decision to allow portion mark
