u ask zelda watching every word in snitch city from zelda dispenser of advice for siginters on workplace issues run date 09092011 u note the question has been edited for brevitys sake the below column is unclassified in its entirety dear zelda heres the scenario when the boss sees coworkers having quiet conversation he wants to know what is being said its mostly work related he has his designated snitches and expects them to keep him apprised of all the office gossip even calling them at home and expecting rundown this puts the designees in really awkward position plus were all afraid any offhand comment or anything said in confidence might be either repeated or misrepresented needless to say this creates certain amount of tension between team members who normally would get along well and adds stress in an already stressful atmosphere there is also an unspoken belief that he will move people to different desks to break up what he perceives as people becoming too chummy its been done under the guise of creating teams we used to be able to joke around little or talk about our favorite idol contestant to break the tension but now were getting more and more skittish about even the most mundane general conversations did you have good weekend this was once very open cooperative group who worked well together now were more suspicious of each other and teamwork is becoming harder do you think this was the goal silenced in sid dear silenced wow that takes intelligence collection in whole new and inappropriate direction its lonely at the top first let say that i do not think this managers intent is to discourage teamwork what it sounds like to is that he ill call him michael feels like an outsider and wants to be in the know it can be lonely being the boss you sit closed off in an office and miss the easy camaraderie with your co workers while at the same time feeling the need to police their behavior maybe someone told michael there was too much chitchat in his organization or that some specific problem existed and resorting to snitches is his misguided way of ferreting out the culprits either that or hes been watching too much law and order why dont you try this go overboard communicating with him call him over when hes wandering around spying on people and fill him in on things give him details of work projects and ask his opinion about mission matters so he feels like hes in the loop get others to drop by his desk periodically just to say hello hope you had good weekend or how bout them i bet that will satisfy his need to know whats going on and hell back off with the nosiness nsano secrets allowed we work in an agency of secrets but this kind of secrecy begets more secrecy and it becomes downward spiral that destroys teamwork what if you put an end to all the secrecy by bringing it out into the open you and your coworkers could ask michael for team meeting and lay out the issue as you see it we feel like you dont trust us and we arent comfortable making small talk anymore for fear of having our desks moved if were seen as being too chummy leave out the part about the snitches tell him how this is hampering collaboration and affecting the work ask him if he has problem with the teams behavior and see what he says encourage him to come directly to the employee in question if he has concern rather than ask third party to gather intel for him in any case the meeting will clear the air stick to the facts and how you feel rather than making it about him were uncomfortable vs youre spying on us if after your attempts to bring things out in the open it becomes clear that michael is simply evil some people live to stir up trouble your best recourse may be to approach michaels boss with the problem and perhaps michael can be reassigned be sure to focus on the effect its having on the teams work when you talk to his manager one likes tattletale silenced implied that in this situation the snitches were unwilling accomplices for michael the reluctant snitches feel like theyre damned if they do and damned if they dont and everyone else is walking on eggshells if you are bothered by snitches in your office whether of the unwilling or voluntary variety the best solution is to keep your behavior above reproach be good performer watch what you say and do lock your screen when you step away from your workstation and keep fodder for wagging tongues your viagra stash photos of your wildandcrazy girls weekend in atlantic city at home or out of sight if you are put in the unwilling snitch position i would advise telling your boss that youre not comfortable with the role and to please not ask that of you trust is hard to rebuild once it has been broken your work center may take time to heal after this deplorable practice is discontinued but give it time and hopefully the open cooperation you once enjoyed will return zelda ufouo editors note have thoughts on this topic post them on the
