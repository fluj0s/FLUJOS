imperfectly understood based on several searches of lexisnexis and westlaw legal databa ses and variety of search strategies the compilation reflects our effort to be as comprehensive as possible given the disparate policy objectives and wording of the various provisions however some editorial judgme nt was called for and the final product may be viewed as over or underinclusive depending on

related laws that place nondiscrimination requi rements upon recipients of federal financial assistance without mandating racial et hnic or gender preferences per nor are regulations of the various fe

discrimination or otherwise they do not explicitly define the obligation in terms of goals or set asides or other forms of preference for minorities or women1 also beyond the scope of this study are the remedy provisions in federal laws like title vii of the 1964 civil rights act2 or the fair housing act3 which authorize affirmative relief by the courts in discrimination actions and have been the

programs operated by the bureau of indian affairs bia for the benefit of american indians living on or near reservation such programs have been upheld by the supreme court under the constitution based on the governments historical trust relationship with the tribes and the unique legal status of indians in matters relating to tribal affairs on or near the reservation4 according to the accepted legal view such special treatment is sui generis and constitutes neither racial discrimination nor even racial preference it is based instead on criterion reasonably designed to further the cause of indian selfgovernment which as applied is granted to indians not as discrete racial group but rather as mbers of quasisovereign tribal entities whose lives and activities are governed by the bia in unique fashion5 by way of background and to fac ilitate understanding operation of the numerous listed federal laws and regulations more exte nsive discussion is devoted at various points of this report to the development of major affirmative action programs in federal grant contract and employment law federal grant and procurement law federal efforts to increase minority and female participation in contracting federally assisted programs and employment have been major aspect of civil rights enforcement for more than three decades congress and the executive branch have crafted wide range of federa l laws and regulations authorizing either directly or by judicial or administrative interpretati on race or gender conscious strategies in relation to jobs housing education votin g rights and governmental contracting the historical model for federal laws and regulations establishing minority participation goals may be found in executive orders which since the early 1960s have imposed affirmative minority hiring and employment re quirements on federally financed construction project s and in connection with ot her large federal contracts presently executive order 11246 as administe red by the office of federal contract compliance programs ofccp requires that all employers with federal contracts in excess of 5000000 must file written affirmative action plans with the government these are to include minority and female hiring goals and timetables to which the contractor must commit its good faith efforts similar affirmative action measures relating to federal governme nt employment were enacted as part of the equal employment opport unity act amendment of 19726 and the 1978 civil service reform act7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32565crs3 815 usc 637a 915 usc

individual not member of one of these groups must prove social disadvantage by preponderance of evidence in order to qualify for 8a certification the 8a applicant must in addition show that economic disadvantage has diminished its capital and credit opportunities thereby limiting its ability to compete with other firms in the open market11 the minority small business subcont racting program

adopt their own goals comp atible with the governmentwide goals in an effort to create maximum practicable opportunity for small disadvantaged businesses to sell their goods and services to the government the goals may be waived where not practicable due to unavailability of disadvantaged business enterprises dbes in the relevant area and other factors15 while the statutory definition of dbe
