programs that develop dualuse technologies and dods dualuse technology development programs fact sheet john d moteff specialist in science and technology science policy research division this fact sheet makes distinction between dod programs that develop dualuse technologies and dods dualuse technology development programs the distinction is more than semantic and is worth noting as congress considers nondefense expenditures in dods budget many of the technologies and much of the knowledge generated by dods traditional science and technology st programs could be considered dualuse eg programs in the sciences materials electronics computers design methods manufacturing methods software engineering dod has been supporting many of these programs for decades dualuse programs on the other hand are those st programs that explicitly attempt to leverage the commercial sectors investment in those same technologies these programs are relatively new initiated at the behest of congress program that develops dualuse technologies is not necessarily dualuse program even if they develop the same technology dualuse technology programs typically involve consortia that include commercially oriented firms the research agenda is negotiated with industry and aims to address the common needs of both the commercial and military sector industry costshares the project the agreements are negotiated outside the federal regulations for grants or contracts this is particularly important because it frees firms from having to provide specified costandaccounting data and allows more flexibility in negotiating technical data rights both of which have discouraged some commercially oriented firms from doing business with dod in the past the projects also tend to address technologies and technical issues with relatively near term application there is less commercial interest in long term exploratory research in traditional dodsupported st programs dod defines the research to be done based solely on dods needs data rights etc are specifically spelled out in regulations if dod pays for all of the research it gains unlimited rights to the data participants tend to be organizations dedicated to military production or small startup firms whose first customer is likely to be dod or defense laboratories the push for dualuse technology development programs came from congress citing the relative decline in dods share of the nations research effort from over 50 following world war ii to 25 today the apparent lead that commercial markets have congressional research service the library of congress crs2 attained in certain technologies eg electronics communications and the prospect of longterm decline in defense spending congress sought to encourage dod to leverage the commercial sectors investment in those area of mutual interest in the fy1989 defense authorization act pl 100456 congress required dod to begin submitting critical technologies plans the plans were to include discussion of how dod intended to leverage commercial investment in those technologies in the fy1990 defense authorization act pl 101189 congress granted the advanced research projects agency and later the services the authority to enter into other transactions or partnerships with commercially oriented firms and consortia to encourage dod to leverage commercial investment it is this partnering authority that was used to establish numerous dualuse programs eg advanced materials partnerships advanced manufacturing partnerships manufacturing extension1 the confusion between dualuse technology development programs and programs that develop dualuse technologies began in 1992 when congress passed the defense conversion reinvestment and transition assistance act the act identified number of dualuse programs mentioned above and couple new ones ie dualuse extension assistance commercialmilitary integration programs as core of programs available to help assist firms convert from military to commercial production dod managed these disparate programs via the technology reinvestment project trp2 the appropriations bill that year suggested that conversion funds be used to support other programs that develop dualuse technologies these included programs developing high performance computing infrared focal plane arrays high temperature superconductors for electronics multichip modules optics batteries totaling at the time about 305 million many of which were traditional dod technology programs the next year the clinton administrations budget for conversion included some of the same traditional programs mentioned by the appropriators totaling 353 million the fy1994 authorization act included such programs as dods software initiative computing systems and communications experimental evaluation of major innovative technology materials and electronics defense research raising its stated conversion investment 22 billion the fy1994 appropriations act included yet different list including advanced simulation intelligence systems software and high definition systems raising its stated conversion investment 12 billion however these programs were still managed as traditional programs as result of their association with the more controversial dualuse programs and with conversion number of dods traditional programs that develop dualuse technologies became vulnerable to budget cuts 1 the partnership model was fashioned after the semiconductor manufacturing technology sematech consortium begun in 1987 although sematech could be viewed more as an effort by dod to save segment of the commercial electronics industry rather than way to leverage commercial investment the program became model for the generation of dualuse programs that followed 2 for more information on the trp and the issues surrounding it see dods technology reinvestment project trp friend or foe crs report 9586spr by john d moteff jan 6 1995 6p for
