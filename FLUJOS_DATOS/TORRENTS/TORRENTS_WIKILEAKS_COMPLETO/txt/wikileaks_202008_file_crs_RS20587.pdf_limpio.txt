of 1950 50 usc appx 2061 et seq as amended confers upon the president authority to force pr ivate industry to give priority to defense and homeland security contracts and to allocate the resources needed the original act was inspired by message sent to congress by president harry s truman at the outbreak of war in korea in mid1950 in his message pres ident truman stated that the united states and the united nations were responding to military invasion of th republic of korea by forces from north of the 38th parallel that the nation urgently needed additional military manpower supplies nd equipment and that th nations military and economic preparedness were inseparabl he urged congress to pa ss legislation that would guarantee the prompt supply of adequate qua ntities of needed military and civilian goods including measures to help compensate for manufacturing demand growth caused by military expansion number of factors encouraged president truman to propose such legislation both the armed services and the defense indus try supporting the nations war effort had demobilized at the end of world war ii with the return of peace the administration cut back military expenditures significantly pr esident truman accentuated these cuts by placing heavy reliance on atomic weapons to provide for the nations defense thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20587crs2 perceived power of the atomic arsenal permitted the administration to cut expensive manpowerintensive conventiona l capabilities this enabled the president to propose and congress to pass muchreduced defense ppropriations throughout the late 1940s in addition the nation had r ecently experienced substantial ec onomic and production turmoil demand for housing and consumer products unleas hed by the expiration of wartime economic controls preci pitated series of postwar labor strikes these reached their height in 1946 in nationwide shutdow n of passenger and freight rail service leading president truman to threaten to seize control of the railways and draft striking rail workers into the armed forces placing them under military discipline though the presidential threats were neve r carried out

industrial crisis across number of supply and manufacturing sectors of the nations economy congress terminated severa l major portions of the dpa including title iv in 1953 application of title vii the general provisions of title vii support number of programs and commercial activities for example one section immunizes companies against liability for legal damages or penalties as result of complying with any rule or regulation authorized by the dpa such as giving priority to fulfilling government contracts even if that rule or regulation is later held to be invalid another protects companies that take part in voluntary agreements for preparedness programs and expansion of production capability nd supply against antitrust litigation it is this latter provision 50 usc appx 2158 for example that enables us flag commercial carriers to join the voluntary intermodal sealift agreement visa visa provides an opportunity for operators of militarily useful coastal and seagoing

1988 amendment empowered the president ac ting through cfius to review certain corporate mergers acquisitions and takeovers and to take actions needed to protect the national security of the united

2157 company immunity from liability for complying with dpa authorized regulations or granting priority to government contracts 2158 immunity from antitrust liability for participation in voluntary arrangements for preparedness pr ograms or expansion of production capacity and supply such as visa and craf and 2170 exonflorio giving the pres ident and cfius review authority over certain corporate acquisition activities conclusion the continued use of dpa authorities testif to their utility in support of defense activities and capabilities the upcoming termination of much of the existing authority may provide an opportunity to examine whet her dpa authority would remain useful as both uss economic policies nd the nations defense industr ial base adapt to changing strategic defense secur ity and industr ial realities the dpa was originally crafted as co mprehensive economic and industrial policy approach to an immediate wartime emergency over time the statutes scope has narrowed considerably while the nature of the threat to national security the organization of the military services and the supporting i ndustrial have fundame ntally transformed assessing the future efficacy of the dpa in its current or some amended form would be difficult and complex undertaking so could take position that the domestic industrial base the act supports longer ex ists having become part of globalized system of trade and international relationships particularly with political allies aligned with the united states others might argu that international trade and technology partners matter how closely allied with the united states might prove unreliable in crises and that the dpa represents the best means to ensure that domestic resources are available when needed most
