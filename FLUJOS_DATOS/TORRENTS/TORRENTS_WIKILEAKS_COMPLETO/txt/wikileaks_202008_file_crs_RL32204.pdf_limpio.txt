comprehensive energy legislation in more than 10 years on november 18 the house approved the conference report by vote of 246180 but on november 21 cloture motion to limit debate in the nate failed 5740 on februa ry 12 2004 senator domenici introduced revised version of the bill s 2095 with lower estimated cost and without controversial provision on the fuel additive mtbe including tax provisions s 2095 is estimated by its s upporters to cost less than 14 billion in contrast to the 31 billion estimated for the hr 6 conference report the two bills contain identical provisions to change the regulatory requirements for the wholesale electric market including repeal of the public utility holding company act puhca they would also mandate increasing levels of ethanol production through 2012 but allow regions to opt out under certain conditions use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe as domestic gasoline additive would be banned by the end of 2014 but the presiden t could void the ban and state could authorize continued use under the hr 6 conference report producers of mtbe and renewable fuels would be granted pr otection safe harbor from product liability lawsuits but that provision was dropped in s 2095 both bills would provide 18 billion in loan guarantees for construction of natural gas pipeline from alaska to alberta where it would connect to the existing midwestern pipeline system royalty reduc tions would be provided for marginal oil and gas wells on federal lands and the outer continental shelf provisions are also included to increase access by energy projects to federal lands several new statutory efficiency standa rds would be established for consumer and commercial products and appliances and other st andards could be set by the

electricity regulation historically electric utilities have been regarded as natural monopolies requiring regulation at the state and federal levels the energy policy act of 1992 epact pl 102486 re moved number of regulatory barriers to electricity generation in an effort to increase supply and introduce competition but further legislation has been introduced and debated to resolve remaining issues affecting transmission reliability and other re structuring concerns in part the electricity section of th conference report and s 2095 would repeal the public utility holding company act puhca and establish mandatory reliability standards standa rd market design smd proposed system to provide uniform market procedures for wholesale electric power transactions would be remanded to the

raised that this requirement could significantly raise the pump price for gasoline in some areas because of concerns over drinking wa ter contamination by mtbe major competitor with ethanol the bills would ban the use of mtbe in motor vehicle fuel except in states that speci fically authorize its use not later than december 31 2014 the ban has two possible exceptions first epa may allow mtbe in motor fuel up to 05 percent by volume in cases that the administrator determines to be appropriate and s econd the president may make termination not later than june 30 2014 that the restrictions on the use of mtbe shall not take place the bills would also authorize 20 billion to assi st the conversion of merchant mtbe production facilities to th production of other fuel additives further the bills would preserve the reductions in emissions of toxic substances achieved by the rfg program one of the most controversial provisions in the hr 6 conference report is the establishment of safe harbor from product liability lawsuits for producers of mtbe and renewable fuels the safe harbor provision which was excluded from s 2095 would protect anyone in th product chain from manufacturers down to retailers from liability for cleanup of mtbe and renewable fuels or for personal injury or property damage based on the na ture of the product that legal approach has been used in california to require refiners to shoulder liability for mtbe cleanup the safe harbor w ould be retroactive to ptember 5 2003 prior to that date five lawsuits had been filed after that date at least 150 suits

1996 it established time line for appeals to the secretary of commerce on consistency determinations when state and federal agency are unable to reach agreement the consistency provisions set forth in section 307 of the czma require fe deral activities in or affecting the coastal zone to be consistent with the policies of federally approved and stateadministered coastal zone management plan federal activities include activities and development projects performed by federal agency or by contractor on behalf of federal agency and federal financial assistance proposal to modify the appeals time line with deadlines very similar to this legi slation was included in proposed rule on federal consistency pub lished in the june 11 2003 federal register final rule has not been issued the consistency provision creates an unus ual relationship where states can halt most federal actions that are incompatible with state interests when enacted the consistency requirement wa s viewed as main reason why states would pursue development and implementa tion of coastal plans since the other incentive to participate federal financial grants always has been modest this view appears to have some validity as 34 or the 35 eligible states and territories are now administering federally approved coastal mana gement programs current law the consistency provisions in section 307 of the czma guides state consideration of whethe r proposed federal activity will be compatible with federally approved and state administered coastal zone management plan since the first state plan was approved in the mid 1970s there has been considerable friction between states and federal agencies over the reach of the consistency provisions states have sought broader pplication to have strong role in decisions about the largest possible array of proposed federal ac tivities while the fede ral government has sought narrower interpretations especially relating to offshore energy development determining an exact boundary separating ac tions on which the state is to have primary role in halting proposal from acti ons on which the state does not have such powers has been subject of federal appeal s and litigation including decisions by the us supreme court notably secretary of the interior v california 464 us 312 1984 in which the court dete rmined that the sale of oil and gas leases on the outer continental shelf was not an act affecting the coastal zone when state and federal agency cannot reach an agreement on consistency determination the law and regu lations lay out an elaborate process for resolving that disagreement most disagreements are resolved through this process but if agreement can be reached the final step is an appeal to the secretary of commerce to make decision appeals to the secr etary have not been common according to citations of appeals posted on the website of the office of ocean and coastalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs22 resource management in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa as of december 30 2003 38 consistenc determinations were appealed to the secretary between 1984 and 1999 and 19 of them involved proposed activities by oil companies the appeals process like all other aspects of consistency is currently covered under final rule i ssued by noaa in the december 8 2000 federal register section 319 in current law has less detail than the proposed amendment it states that the secretary will either issu final decision on the appeal or publish notice in the federal register stating why decision cannot be reached within 90 days after the record has closed if the secretary publishes notice that decision has not been made that decision must be issued within 45 days of the date of publication of that notice conference agreement the conference agreement would replace the current section 319 of the czma with ne w set of provisions that would stipulate three sequential deadlines and thereby limit the overall length of this appeals process to total of 270 days from the date when an appeal is filed the first deadline would be for the secretary of commerce to publish an initial notice of an appeal in the federal register within 30 days of the appeals filing the second deadline would be that the administrative record would be open for more than 120 days during that time period the secretary could receive filings related to the appeal the final deadline would give the secretary up to 120 days to issue decision after the administrative record had been closed the second and third deadlines would also apply to all pending appeals not resolved pr ior to the date of enactment also any appeals in which the record is open on the da of enactment woul d have to be closed within 120 days of that date policy context consistency appeals have been contentious and in some instances the appeals process has dra gged on for long time periods the 1996 amendments in section 319 were meant to ddress those delays by establishing some time limits this has proved unsatisfactory to some who seek additional statutory language that would remove decisions bout deadlines from the unpredictable rule making process by defining the length of component steps in law and therefore the overall process after an appeal to the secretary has been filed section 326 reimbursement for costs of nepa analysis documentation and studies the minerals leasing act would be amended to provide reimbursement for costs of neparelated studies under certain circumstances this provision would not ta ke effect until october 1 2008 section 327 hydraulic fracturing this section would amend the safe drinking water act sdwa 42 usc 300h d to specify that the definition of underground injection exclude s the injection

underground sources of drinki ng water and to determine whether regulation was necessary the senate bill also directed the national academy of sciences to study the effects of co albed methane production on surface and ground water resources current law the sdwa required epa to pr omulgate regulations for state underground injection control uic progra ms that included minimum requirements for programs to prevent underground injec tion that endangers sources of drinking water the act specifies that uic program regulations may not prescribe requirements that interfere with any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas unless such requirements are essential to assure that underground sources of drinking water w ill not be endangered by such injection sdwa 1421b2 policy context epa reports that before 1997 it had not considered regulating hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas development because the agency did not view this wellproduction process as an activity subject to regulation under sdwas uic program in 1997 the 11th circuit court of appeals rule d that the injection of fluids for the purpose of hydraulic fracturing c onstituted underground injection as defined under the sdwa that all underground inj ection must be regulated and that hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane we lls in alabama should be regulated under the states uic program leaf v epa 118 f 3d 1467 in 1999 epa approved revision to alabamas uic program to in clude regulations for hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells following the courts decision epa deci ded it needed more information before making further decisions regarding the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and undertook study to evaluate impacts on drinking water sources from hydraulic fracturing practices used in coalbed meth ane production in 2002 epa issued draft report that identified water quality and quantity problems attributed to hydraulic fracturing in several states in the west nd southeast but tentatively concluded that the overall impact was small5 epa is expected to issued final report in early 2004 in 2003 epas national

currently under that act the operation of facilities involved in oil and gas exploration production processing transmission or treatment is generally exempt from compliance with stormwater runoff regulations but the construction of associated facilities is not the amendment would modify the cwa to specifically include construction activities in the types of oil and gas facilities that are covered by the laws statutory exemption from stormwater rules the issue arises from stormwaterpermitting rules for small construction sites and municipal separate storm sewer systems that were issued by the environmental protection agency epa in 1999 and which became effective march 10 2003 those rules known as phase ii of the clean water act stormwater program require most small construction sites disturbing one to five acres nd municipal separate storm sewer systems serving populations of up to 100000 people to have cwa discharge permit the permits require pollutionprevention plans describing practices for curbing sediment and other pollutants from being washed by stormwater runoff into local water bodies phase i of the stormwater program required construction sites larger than five acres including oil and gas facilities and larger municipal separate storm sewer systems to obtain discharge permits beginning in 19916 as the march 2003 compliance deadline approached epa proposed twoyear extension of the phase ii rules for small oil and gas construction sites to allow the agency to assess the economic impact of the ru on that industry epa said the delay was needed to comply with president bushs executive order 13211 which directed agencies to consider the effects of their actions on energyrelated production activities epa had initially assumed that most oil and gas facilities would be smaller than one acre and thus excluded from the phase ii rules but recent department of energy data indicate that several thousa nd new sites per year would be of sizes subject to the rule the pos tponement did not aff ect other industries or small cities covere d by the 1999 rule conference agreement the provision in the conference bill is similar to one in housepassed hr 6 it makes epas twoyear delay permanent and makes it applicable to constructi on activities at all oil and ga s development and production sites regardless of size including thos covered by phase i of the stormwater program the senate version include d similar provision industry officials contended that the epa stormwater rule created costly permitting requirements even though the short construction period for drilling sites carried little potential for stormwater runoff pollution supporters sa id the provision was intended to clarify existing cwa language opponents argued th at the provision did not belong in the energy legislation and that there was evidence that construction at oil and gas sites caused less pollution than other construction activities however they

nating environmental reviews rather than having each federal agency with jurisdiction over an aspect of the project proceed separately with th review process the commission would be responsible for consolidating the environmen tal reviews of all ot her federal agencies into one environmental impact statemen t eis which would satisfy all nepa requirements for the project the section would require ferc to issue draft eis within one year after project application date and final eis within 180 days after issuing the draft unless there were delays for good cause section 375 pipeline expansion this section would provide ferc with authority to order the capacity of the pr oject to be expanded after holding hearing on the basis of one or more re quests for additional capacity the applicant would have to make firm commitment for transport services the hearing would determine that tariffs were nondiscriminatory the expa nsion would not adversely impact other shippers and that adequate downstream facilities existed that would deal with additional throughput section 376 federal coordinator an independent executive branch office of the federal coordinator for aska natural gas tr

state jurisdiction over instate delivery of natural gas were the alaska pipeline project to be constructed the st ate could benefit by using it as backbone system for distribu ting gas this section would provide that the state hold jurisdiction over intrastate di stribution pipelines that might be supplied by the transportation project ensuring that state pipelines and natural gas would not fall under ferc jurisdiction sec 338 notes that ferc would have tariff jurisdiction of the transportation project and that the state should coordinate regarding rates for instate consumers section 379 study of alternative means of construction were application for transportati on project construction to be filed within 18 months of the enactment of this act the secretary of energy w ould be

training program this section would authorize grants to recruit nd train adult workers in alaska to work on the gas transport project it would call fo r the governor of alaska to request funds after certifying that the constructions work was reasonably expected to begin within two years section 384 sense of congress concerning natural gas demand this section would express congressional concern that the demand for natural gas will outstrip supplies from north ameri can producing areas that already have pipeline connections it would express th belief that both alaskan and canadian resources are needed to m eet future demand and that such demand would be strong enough that historic canadian and lowe r 48 us producers would not be displaced in the marketplace section 385 sense of congress concerning alaskan ownership this section would convey the sense of c ongress that it is in the economic interest of alaska to have local ownership of shar of the pipeline and that project sponsors would be encouraged to work with interested local parties seeking to participate section 386 loan guarantees the bill would grant authority to the secretary of energy to issue federal guarantee instruments providing loan guaranties to pipeline certificate holders the instruments would expire two years after the certificate had been issued meanin g that the project sponsor would have to be in the project financing stage by that time the loan or debt obligation would have to be issued by qualified lender the loan could not be for more than 30 years and the total amount of the guaranteed debt obligations would be limited to 18 billion adjusted for inflation from the date of enactment the guaranteed loan could cover all legitimate components of the transport system the bill also would authorize the secretary to extend these loan guarantees to the canadian segment of the aska gas transportation project current law the basic law addressing the certification of pipelines is the natural gas act which give s ferc broadbased authority to certificate pipelines facilitating their construction and ensuring that their rates and tariffs are just and reasonable in addition to the nga the alaska natural gas transportation act of 1976 was enacted specifically to pave the wa for the project visualized in hr 6 under angta presidential finding specifi ed the pipeline route that is the focal point of subtitle d policy context significant amounts of proven ans gas reserves lie in and around the prudhoe bay field and remain ther because transportation system has not been developed despite enactment of angta in 1976 demand for natural gas in the lower 48 states has grown in the recent past and s upply has become tight resulting in steadily increasing average prices and disruptive price volatility during highdemand winter months while an askan gas pipeline is many years off httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs32 even if construction began today the current supplydemand situation has become source of longerterm concern among policymakers proponents of the loan guarantees contend that the inherent risk is so high in building an alaska pipeline at an estima ted cost of 20 billion that it could not be financed by conventional means the conf erence bills loan guarantees would offer those providing the projects capital some assurance that certain amount of their investment would be repai d although exposing the federa l government to potential losses other proposals have utilized commod ity price guarantees or combination of loan and price guarantees title iv

601611 priceanderson nuclear liability coverage the priceanderson act8 which addresses lia bility for damages to the general public from nuclear incidents would be ex tended through 2023 the priceanderson liability system was up for reauthoriza tion on august 1 2002 and it was extended for commercial nuclear reactors th rough december 31 2003 by the fy2003 omnibus continuing resolution pl 1087 even without an extension existing reactors will continue to ope rate under the current pri ceanderson liability systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs36 but any new reactors would not be co vered priceanderson coverage for doe nuclear contractors was extended through december 31 2 004 by the national defense authorization ac t for fy2003 pl 107314 current law under priceanderson the owne rs of commercial reactors must assume all liability for nucl ear damages awarded to the public by the court system and they must waive most of their legal defenses following severe radioactive release extraordinary nuclear occurre nce to pay any such damages each licensed reactor must carry financial pr otection in the amount of the maximum liability insurance available which was increased by the insurance industry from 200 million to 300 million on january 1 2003 any damages exceeding that amount are to be assessed equally agains t all covered commerc ial reactors up to 958 million per reactor most recently adju sted for inflation on august 20 2003 those assessments called retrospective pr emiums would be paid at an annual rate of more than 10 million per react or to limit the potentia l financial burden on reactor owners following major accident including two that are not operating 105 commercial reactors are cu rrently covered by the pr iceanderson retrospective premium requirement funding for public compensation following major nuclear incident therefore would include the 300 million in insurance coverage carried by the reactor that suffered the incident plus the 958 million in retrospective premiums from each of the 105 currently covered reactors totalin g 104 billion on top of those payments 5 surcharge may also be imposed raising the total perreactor retrospective premium to 1006 million and the total poten tial compensation for each incident to about 109 billion under priceanderson the nuclear industrys liability for an incident is capped at that amount which varies depending on th number of covered reactors the amount of availa ble insurance and an inflation adjustment that is made every five years payment of any da mages above that liability limit would require congressional approval under speci procedures in the act the priceanderson act also covers contractors who ope rate hazardous doe nuclear facilities the liability limit for doe contractors is the same as for commercial reactors excluding the 5 surcharge except when the limit for commercial reactors drops because of d ecline in the number of covere d reactors because the most recent adjustments have raised the commerc ial reactor liability limit to record high the liability limit for doe contractors is currently the same as the commercial limit minus the surcha rge or 104 billion priceanderson authorizes doe to indemnify its contract ors for the entire amount so that damage payments for nuclear incidents at doe facilities would ultimately come from the us treasury however the law also allo ws doe to fine its contractors for safety violations and contractor employees nd directors can face criminal pe nalties for knowingly and willfully viol ating nuclear safety rules however section 234a of the atomic energy act specifically exem pts seven nonprofit doe contractors and their subcontractors under the same s ection doe automatically remits any civil penalties imposed on nonprofit educational institutions rving as doe contractors conference agreement priceanderson liability coverage for commercial reactors and for doe contractors would be extended through december 31 2023 sec 602 the total retrospective premium for each reactor would be set at thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs37 current level of 958 million and the limit on perreactor annual payments raised to 15 million sec 603 with both to be adjusted for inflation every five years sec 607 for the purposes of those payment limits nuclear plant consisting of multiple small reactors 100300 megawatts up to total of 1300 megawatts would be considered single reactor sec 608 therefore power plant with six 120 megawatt modular reactors woul d be liable for retrospec tive premiums of up to 958 million rather than 5748 million the liab ility limit on doe contractors would be set at 10 billion per accident also to be adjusted for inflation under the conference agreement sec 604 the liability limit and maximum indemnification for doe contractors for nuclear incidents outside the united st ates would be raised from 100 million to 500 million sec 605 however priceanders on indemnification would be prohibited for contracts related to nuclear facilities in c ountries found to sponsor terrorism sec 610 none of the increased liability limits would apply to nuclear incidents taking place before the amendments are enacted sec 609 the nuclear regulatory commission nrc and doe woul d have to report to congress by the end of 2019 on the need for further pri ceanderson extensions and modifications sec 606 for future contracts the conference agreement would eliminate the civil penalty exemption for nuclear safety violations by the seven nonprofit contr actors listed in current law does authority to auto matically remit penaltie s imposed on all non profit educational institutions serving as contractors would also be repealed however the bill would limit the civil penaltie s against nonprofit contractor to the amount of management fees received under that contract sec 611 the housepassed version of hr 6 would have authorized the federal government to sue doe contractors to recover at least some of the compensation that the government had paid for any accident caused by intentional doe contractor management misconduct such cost rec overy would have been limited to the amount of the contractors profit under the cont ract involved and recovery would have been allowed from nonprofit contractors however the conference agreement does not include that provision most of the ma jor provisions in the conference agreement are similar to provisions in both the house and senate versions policy context the priceanderson acts limits on liability were crucial in establishing the commercial nuclear power industry in th 1950s supporters of the priceanderson system contend that it has worked well since that time in ensuring that nuclear accident vic tims would have secure source of compensati on at little cost to the taxpayer however opponents contend that priceanderson subsidizes the nuclear power industry by protecting it from some of the fi nancial consequences of the most severe conceivable accidents because new us reactors ar currently planned missing the deadline for extension would have little shortterm effect on th nuclear power industry however any new doe contracts signed during priceanderson expiration would have to use alternate i ndemnification authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs38 subtitle b general nuclear

protections for employees of nuclear pow er plants and other nrc licensees and employees of doe contractors would be ex tended to employees of nrc contractors an employee whose whistleblower retaliation complaint did not receive final decision by the secretary of labor within 540 days could take the case to federal court the house bill would have further extended whistleblower protection to doe and nrc employees and given the secretar of labor 180 days for decision the senate bill had related provision section 633 uranium exports for medical isotope production highly enriched uranium heu could be exported to canada belgium france germany and the netherlands for production of medical isotopes in nuclear reactors those countries would be exempt from existing requirements under section 134 of the atomic energy act that they agree to switch to lowenriched uranium leu as soon as possible and that leu fuel for their reactors be under active development instead those countries would have to agr ee to convert to suitable leu fuel when it became available the exemption in the conference bill would terminate upon certification by the secretary of energy that us medical isotope demand could be reliably and economically t with production facilities that do not use heu the conference provision is based on language in the house bill which would have allowed nrc to exempt add itional countries from the he u export restrictions and did not include the terminati on procedure the current heu export restrictions are intended to spur foreign coope ration with us efforts to convert all heu reactors to leu but supporters of the exemption conte nd that the restrictions could disrupt the supply of medical isotopes produced in foreign heu reactors section 634 fernald byproduct material doemanaged material in the concrete silos at the fernald uranium processing facility would be considered byproduct material as define d by section 11 e2 of the atomic energy act of

the conference report would authorize up to 5 million annually to the commission during fy2005 fy2011 for the power cost equalization program the legislation also would make available up to 50 million annually during the period fy2004fy2013 drawing upon federal royalties rents and bonuses from oil and gas leases in the national petroleum reserve in alaska npra this funding must be appropriated these funds would be used among other purposes for energy generation and development ranging from alternative sources to fossil fuels httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs71 section 1402 rural and remote community assistance this section encourages grants and loans to help rural communities where the electricity cost per kilowatthour is 150 of the national aver age grants and loans to the denali commission for similar purposes and grants fo r areas where fuel cannot be shipped by surface transportation subtitle b coastal programs section 1411 royalty payments under certain leases the lessee of covered lease tract off the coast of louisiana would be allowed to withhold royalties due to the united states if it paid the state of louisiana 44 cents for every dollar of the federal royalty withheld this royalty relief would end when certain drainage claims were satisfied this provision was taken from the house bill the date that this section takes effect is changed from 2004 to 2008 section 1412 domestic offshore energy reinvestment this would add new section 32 at the end of the ou ter continental shelf lands act 43 usc 1331 et seq to return portion of th federal revenues from offshore energy activities to affected coastal states to f und specified activities representatives of states with offshore energy development ve been seeking to return significant portion of the federal revenues generated to these states and particularly the coastal areas within these states that may be more affected by onshore and nearshore activities that support that development proponents of these proposals look to the rates at which funds are given to jurisd ictions where energy development occurs within those jurisdictions on federal lands and seek revenues that will help coastal states respond to adverse onshore effects of offshore energy development coastal destruction has received more attention in louisiana where many square miles of wetlands are being lost to the ocean each year federal program to address the impacts of coastal energy development was enacted during the energy crisis of the 1970s called the coastal energy impact assistance program it operated briefly providing loans and grants to states through the federal coastal zone management program current law there is comparable prog ram operating under in current law conference agreement the conference agreement would create new domestic offshore energy re investment program th program would be funded from new secure energy reinvestment fund the fund would receive deposits of all qualified revenues from energy activities on the outer continental shelf ocs all spending from the fund would be subject to appropriation these revenues would include 35 million in royalty income each year plus all royalty income above specified amount that would generally increase annually starting at 3455 billion in fy2004 and ending at 5120 billion in fy2013 bonus bid income above 1 billion each year interest income earned by the fund authorized appropriations of up to 500 million annually and repa yments made because recipient did not follow an approved plan when spending the money if the royalty income were inadequate deposits into this fund and two other fede ral funds that already receive money from this source land and water conservati on fund and historic preservation fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs72 would be reduced by the same proporti on the congressional budget office has reportedly estimated that the fund would to tal about 1 b illion and that louisiana would receive almost 50 of this amount however any changes in assumptions could make the estimate vary greatly coastal states where energy activities occur offshore and coastal political subdivisions in those states would be eligible to receive money from the fund eligible states and political subdivisions ar defined in the legislation allocations among eligible states would be determin ed by formula th at accounts for energy revenues generated offshore in federal waters that lie between outward extensions of the states lateral boundaries ove r the past 10 years each coastal state is to pass along 35 of the total it receives to eligib coastal political subdivisions with the allocation among these subdivisions in each state to be based on formula that considers population length of coastline distance from leased tracts and amount of outer continental shelf support ac tivities within that subdivision each state could use these funds to imp lement plan it develops that would improve environmental quality and address the impacts of offshore energy activities all plans must be approved by the secretary of the interior before states could receive funds plans must describe how recipients will evaluate the effectiveness of their implementation efforts each eligible state with an approved plan would receive at least 5 of the total available amount each ear authorized uses of the funds would be limited to 1 conserving protecting or restoring coastal areas including wetlands 2 mitigating damage to or protecting fish wildlife or natural resources 3 paying reasonable planning assistance and administrative costs 4 implementing federally approved plans or programs to minimize the effects of natural disasters and 5 funding onshore infrastructure and public service projects that mitigate impacts of outer continental shelf activities revisions and amendments to plans would have to be approved by the secretary in additi on new coastal restor ation program would be established using 2 of the funds av ailable each year to assess the effects of coastal habitat restorati on techniques and develop ne w technologies develop improved models to predict ecosystem change and identify economic options to address socioeconomic conse quences of coastal degrada tion this program would be administered by the secretaries of the interior and commerce in addition to the 2 funding an appropriation of 10 million annually would be authorized policy context this is the most recent of repeated efforts to allocate portion of federal offshore oil and gas revenues to coastal states to assist them in addressing the impacts of these activities recent congresses starting with the 105th considered numerous similar legislative proposals these proposals came to be known as cara or the conservation nd reinvestment act in the 106th congress the house passed version of cara on may 11 2000 hr 701 some of these proposals were also reflected in the clinton administrations lands legacy initiative proposal in 2000 and also one time 150 million appropriation provided in the fy2001 commerce appropriati ons legislation pl 106553 for coastal impact assistance support for the cara proposals which w ould also have f unded many related federal natural resource protec tion programs grew as the ficit of the early and mid 1990s was replaced by forecasts of surplu s as protecting natural resources came tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs73 be viewed as part of the effort to addre ss sprawl and as efforts and support to secure federal funding for coastal re source protection and restorati on efforts grew with the replacement of the surplus forecast with deficit forecasts and changing national priorities since the 911 terrorist attacks broad support for wide ranging legislation like cara has declined but interest has remained in returning portion of the money currently paid to the federal government by private companies leasing offshore areas to those locations most affected by the offshore activity subtitle c reforms to the board of directors of tva sections 14311434 changes to board of directors and staff appointments currently three people are appointed by the president to serve on the tennessee valley authority tva board for nineyear terms the president also designates the chairman historically th board members have been involved in the daytoday operation of tva the conference bill would establish chief operating officer ceo who would have the authority to offer competitive salaries to top executives the number of presidential appointments to the tva board would expand to nine however the term length w ould be shortened to five years and board members would meet quarterly to serve pr incipally in an oversight function the board members would designate the chairman subtitle d other provisions section 1441 continuation of transmission security order on august 28 2003 the secretary of energy issued order 202032 allowing the cross sound cable between connecticut and long island to begin transmitting electric power the conference bill would require the order to remain in effect unless rescinded by federal statute section 1442 review of agency determinations on gas projects this section would amend the natural gas act giving the dc circuit court of appeals exclusive jurisdiction over disput involving unreasonable delay of natural gas pipeline project certificated by ferc unreasonable delay would mean the failure of permitting agency to take action within year after the date of filing for the permit in question or within 60 da ys after the issuance of ferc certificate there is explicit timeline in existing law for issuance of ancillary permits and licenses and that would consolidate author ity in one court this fasttracking measure would address delays occurring after ferc had issued certificate giving pipeline project the goahead the provision is directed at delays by other agencies in issuing environmental permits and other approvals needed to begin construction of certificated project section 1443 attainment dates for downwind ozone nonattainment areas this section which was not in the house or senate versions of the bill but was added during the conference would extend clean air act deadlines for areas that have not attained ozone air quality standards if upwind areas significantly contribute to their nonatta inment under the 1990 clean air act amendments pl 101549 oz one nonattainment areas were classified in one of five categories marginal moderate serious vere or extreme areas with higherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs74 concentrations of the polluta nt were given more time to reach attainment in return for the additional time they were required to implement more stringent controls on emissions failure to reach attainment by the specified deadline was to result in reclassification of an area to the next higher category and the imposition of more stringent controls areas such as dallasfort worth for example classified as serious were required to reach attainment by 1999 if they did not do so the law required that they be recla ssified or bumped up to the severe category with new deadline of 2005 and more stringent controls for variety of reasons epa has generally not reclassified areas when they failed to reach attainment by the statutory deadlines in several cases the agency granted additional time to r each attainment on the grounds that significant cause of the areas continued nonattain ment was pollution genera ted outside the area and transported into it by prevailing winds epa was sued over its failure to bump up five of these areas in the first three cases decided was hington dc st louis and beaumontport arthur texas the agency st as result epa has taken steps to reclassify the three areas the conference bill would roll back these reclassifications and extend attainment deadlines in areas affected by upwind pollution to the date on which the last reductions in pollution necessary for attainment in the downwind area are required to be achieved in the upwind area while this date might vary it would appear to be 2004 2005 or 2007 in most areas affected by the current standard the language in the conference bill may give epa flexibility to extend the deadlines beyond those dates however and it would so apply to the agencys new standard for average ozone levels during an eighthour period deadlines for attainment of the 8hour ozone standard have not yet been tablished so it is difficult to say how this section might affect them section 1444 energy production incentives congress may regulate interstate commerce under ar ticle 1 section 8 clause 3 the commerce clause of the constitution the states may not unduly burden interstate commerce even in the absence of federal regulati on however congress may expressly authorize the states to take an action that would otherwise be an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce state tax incentives that offer benefits solely to energy produced within the state may depending on their design raise constitutional concerns the conference bill would expressly authorize the states to offer certain tax incentives that may otherwise be an impermissible burden on interstate commerce under the bill the states would be allowed to provi tax incentives for the instate production of 1 electricity from instate coal burned at power plant using clean coal technology 2 electricity from re newable sources and 2 ethanol section 1445 use of granular mine tailings this section which was added in conference amends the solid waste disposal act swda 42 usc 6961 et seq and affects only the tar creek mining district located in northeastern oklahoma tar creek is former lead and zinc mining area of approximately 40 square miles and is one of the largest superfund hazardous waste cleanup sites the mine tailings residue referred to as chat are deposited in hundreds of piles and ponds in the area and contain lead and ot her heavy metals re sidential communities are located among the piles some of which are nearly 200 feet high andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs75 14 us epa region 6 fiveyear review tar creek superfund site ottawa c ounty oklahoma march 2000 p 6approximately 25 of the children living on the site have elevated lead concentration levels in their blood according to march 2000 epa report14 the conference bill would direct the epa administrator to establish criteria for the safe and environmentally protective use of the granular mine tailings for cement or concrete projects and for federally funded highway construction projects the criteria would include an evaluation of whet her to establish numerical standards for the concentration of lead and other haza rdous substances in the tailings and epa would be required to consider their current and past use as an aggregate for asphalt as well as the environmental and public health risks and benefits of their use in transportation projects title xv ethanol and motor fuels subtitle general provisions section 1501 renewable content of motor vehicle fuel section 1501 would require the use of renewable fuel in gasoline renewable fuels include ethanol biodiesel and natural gas produced from landfills and sewage treatment plants the conference report would re quire the use of 31 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2005 increasing to 50 billion gallons in 2012 after 2012 the percentage of renewable fuel in gasoline would be required to equal the percentage in 2012 the environmental protection ag ency would be required to promulgate regulations for the generation and trading of credits between entities in this manner refiners and blenders who c ould not meet the requirement would be able to purchase credits from those refiners or blenders who exceeded their requirement this provision is similar to provisions in the house and senate versions of hr 6 the house version however would have required only 27 billion gallons in 2005 increasing to 50 billion gallons in 2015 th senate version w ould have required 23 billion gallons in 2004 increasing to 50 billion gallons in 2012 ethanol production was approximately 21 billion gallons in 2002 policy context the clean air act amendments of 1990 established the reformulated gasoline rfg program am ong its provisions is requirement that rfg contain oxygen the two main ways to meet the requirement are the use of mtbe and ethanol however mtbe met hyl tertiary butyl ether has been found to contaminate groundwater and there is in terest in banning th substance see sec 1504 because some states have acted to limit the use of mtbe and because of the potential federal ban there is interest in eliminating the oxygen standard as well see sec 1506 the ethanol industry has be nefitted significantly from the oxygen requirement and some are concerned about the future of ethanol in the absence of the requirement further proponents of the fuel see et hanol use as way to limit petroleumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs76 consumption and dependence on foreign oil thus the interest in establishing renewable fuels standard however opponents of ethanol have raised concerns that the fuel is too costly that the efficiency of the ethanol fuel cycle is questionable and that the potential for groundwater conta mination by ethanolblended fuels has not been fully studied section 1502 fuels safe harbor this section would provide safe harbor for renewable fuels and fuels cont aining mtbe ie such fuels could not be deemed defective in design or manufacture by virtue of the fa ct that they contain renewables or mtbe the eff ect of this provision would be to protect anyone in the product chain from manufactu rers to retailers from li ability for cleanup of mtbe and renewable fuels or for personal injury or property damage based on the nature of the product legal approach that has been used in california to require refiners to shoulder liability for mtbe cleanup we re liability for manufacturing and design defects ruled out plaintiffs would need to demonstrate negligence in the handling of such fuels to establish liability more difficult legal standard to meet the conference version provides safe harbor for renewable fuels mtbe and fuels containing them as did the house bill the senate bill did not include mtbe or fuels containing it in the safe harbor the conference version also differs from the house and senatepassed bills in setting an effective date of september 5 2003 for the safe harbor rather than the date of nactment this effec tive date would protect oil and chemical industry defendants from defective product claims in about 150 lawsuits that were filed in 15 states after that date section 1502 1503 mtbe transition assistance this section would amend the clean air act to authorize 2 billion 250 million in each of fy2005 fy2012 for grants to assist merchant us producers of mtbe in converting to the production of other fuel additives i ncluding renewable fuels unless epa determines that such fuel additives may reasonably be anticipat ed to endanger public health or the environment both the hous and senate versions of the bill authorized smaller program 750 milli on appropriations would remain available until expended sections 15031504 15041505 ban on the use of mtbe the use of mtbe in motor vehicle fuel would be prohibited after december 31 2014 except in states that specifically authorize its use in the senate version of the bill ban would have been implemented four years after the date of enactment there was ban in the house bill epa could allow mtbe in motor vehicle fuel in quantities up to 05 in cases the administrator determines to be appropriate sec 1503 1504 the bill would also allow the president to make determination not later than june 30 2014 that the restrictions on the use of mtbe s hould not take pl ace the national academy of sciences would conduc t review of mtbes beneficial and detrimental effects on environmental quality or public health or welfare including costs and benefits by may 31 2014 sec 1504 1505 section 1505 1506 elimination of oxygen requirement and maintenance of toxic emission reductions this section would amend the clean air act to eliminate the requirement that reformulated gasoline contain at least 2 oxygen this requirement has been major stimulus to the use of mtbe thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs77 15 volatile organic compoundsprovision would take effect 270 days after enactment excep t in california where it would take effect imme diately upon enactment the section would also amend the clean air act to require that each refinery or importer of gasoline maintain the averag annual reductions in emissions of toxic air pollutants achieved by the reformulated gasolin it produced or distributed in 1999 and 2000 this provision is intended to prevent backsliding since the reductions actually achieved in those years exceeded the regulatory requirements credit trading program would be establis hed among refiners and importers for emissions of toxic air pollutants in addition the section would require ep to promulgate final regulations to control hazardous air pollutants from motor vehicles and their fuels by july 1 2004 it would also eliminate the less stringent requirements for volatility applicable to reformulated gasoline sold in northern st ates by applying the more stringent standards of voc15 control region 1 southern states sections 15061507 15071508 analyses and data collection epa would be required to publish an analys is of the effects of the fuels provisions in the clean air act on air pollutant emissions and air quality within five years of enactment sec 1506 1507 doe would be required to collect and publish monthly survey data on the production bl ending importing demand and price of renewable fuels both on national and re gional basis sec 1507 1508 section 1508 1509 reducing the prolifer ation of state fuel controls section 211 of the clean air act allo ws states to establish their own fuel standards with approval from epa th conference report would bar the epa administrator from approving state fuel restriction unless the administrator after consultation with the secretary of energy determined that the fuel standard would not cause fuel supply disruptions or advers ely affect the ability to produce fuel for nearby areas in other states section 1509 1510 fuel system require ments harmonization study the epa administrator and the secr etary of energy would be required to study all federal state and local motor fu els requirements they would be required to analyze the effects of various standards on consumer prices fuel availability domestic suppliers air quality and vehicle emissions further they would be required to study the feasibility of developing national or regional fuel standards this provision is similar to provisions in the house and senate versions of the bill section 1510 1511 commercial byproducts from municipal solid waste and cellulosic biomass loan guarantee program the secretary of energy would be required to estab lish loan guarantee program for the construction of fac ilities to produce fuel ethanol and other comme rcial byproducts from municipal solid waste and cellulosic biomass this provision is similar to provisions in the house and senate vers ions except that the house and senate versions applied only to municipal so lid waste not cellulosic biomasshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32204crs78 section 1511 1512 bioconversion resource center subsection b would authorize 4 million annually for fy2004 throug h fy2006 for the development of resource center at the university of mississippi and the university of oklahoma the center would focu

waste or agricultu ral byproducts total of 750 million would be authorized for fy2004 through fy2006 neither the house nor the senate version contained any similar provision section 1513 1514 blending of comp liant reformulated gasolines this provision would allow reform ulated gasoline rfg retailers to blend batches with nd without ethanol as long as both batches were compliant with the clean air act in given year retailers would be permitted to blend batches over any two 10day periods in the summer months currently retailers must drain their tanks before switching from ethanolb lended rfg to nonethanol rfg or vice versa the house and senate versions contained similar provision subtitle b underground storage tank compliance sections 15211533 underground storage tank provisions title xv subtitle b would make extensive amendments to subtitle i of the solid waste disposal act to enhance the leak prev ention and enforcement provisions of the federal underground storage tank regulatory program and to broaden the allowable uses of the leaking underground storag tank lust trust fund the conference report essentially incorporat the language of hr 3335 the underground storage tank compliance act of 2003 which shares many similarities w ith senatepassed s 195 the provisions would add new tank inspection sec 1523 and operator training requirements sec 1524 prohibit fuel delivery to ineligible tanks sec 1527 expand underground storage tank ust compliance requirements for federal facilities sec 1528 and require epa with indian tribes to develop and implement strategy to address

leaks containing methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe or other oxygenated fuel additives eg ethanol other mtberelated provisions are discussed bove in subtitle conforming and technical amendments are also included secs 15321533 the house version of hr 6 would have authorized the use of 850 million from the lust trust fund for cleaning up underground storage tank leaks of fuels containing oxygenates eg mtbe and ethanol the senate version of hr 6 proposed to authorize the appropriati on of 200 million from the trust fund for cleaning up mtbe and other ether fuel contamination from tanks and other sources the senate bill also would have authorized the use of lust funds for enforcing the ust leak prevention program and authorized new research and technical assistance programs title xvi studies section 1601 study on inventory of petroleum and natural gas storage the secretary of energy would have to report to congress within year of enactment on the amount of storage capac ity for petroleum and natural gas while the oil and gas industry is subject to br oad reporting requireme nts under variety of laws this language would call for comp rehensive study of the nations storage capability
