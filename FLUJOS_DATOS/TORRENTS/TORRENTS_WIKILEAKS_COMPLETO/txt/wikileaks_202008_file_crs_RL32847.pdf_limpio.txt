government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32847tsunamis and earthquakes is federal disaster insurance in our future summary recent earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004 and 2006 have led some members of congress to question whether the fede ral government s hould be i nvolved in providing disaster insurance against megacatastrophes on october 15 2006 magnitude 67 earthquake struck the hawa iian island of oahu causing widespread disruption in electrical power and co mmunications landslides sinkholes and damaged buildings and roads there were fatalities according to the us geological survey usgs this recent eart hquake was the stronges t to strike hawaii since another magnitude 67 struck in 1983 aftershocks were still bein g felt as late as march 2005 following the december 26 2004 earthquake that struck six miles be low the surface of the indian ocean on the northern tip of the indonesian island of sumatra the 2004 earthquake spawned massive tsunami that smashed the coastlines of 12 countries in south asia and east africa resulting in over 280000 people dead or missing and significant economic and noneconomic damages in sured losses were relatively low compared to the tens of billions of dollars of economic and noneconomic losse s because few residential and commercial buildings were insured although tsunamis pose some risk to coastal communities around the world they occur infrequently in the united states the communities at risk are along the us west coast alaska and the pacific region hawaii america samoa guam the republic of palau the federated states of micr onesia and the republic of marshall islands in contrast most amer icans live in areas considered seismically active although the degree of earthquake ri sk varies greatly and the areas with the potential for the most seismic activities are the pacific coast the mississippi valley around new madrid in missouri alaska utah s outh carolina and the new england region centered around boston in the aftermath of th 2004 i ndonesian tsunami and americas continued vulnerability to seismic zards including the 2006 waiian earthquake members of congress might elect to focus attention on the vulnerability of the us coastlines to offshore earthquakes and tsunamis and the potential ffects of major earthquake on both the homeowners insurance market and the overall us economy congress has debated the vulnerability of ameri cas coastlines to earthquake and tsunami hazard risks leading to legislative action following the april 1992 california earthquaketsunami and the 1964 earthquaketsunami at askas prince william sound although federal flood insurance program was eventually enacted in 1968 in response to the 1964 earthquake it took congress another decade to address the nations exposure to earthquake hazards with the enactment of the earthquake hazard reduction act of 1977 congress did not create an explicit federal earthquake insurance program albeit the national tsunami hazard mitigation program was established in 1992 some insurance and disaster policy experts suggest the time has come to implement federal insurance or reinsurance program for earthquakes and other seis mic risks conversely ot her experts question the need for such program this report will be updated as events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32847contents introduction 1

accordingly federal relief and recovery assistance has been provided to the affected area according to the us geological surv ey usgs the earthquake was the most powerful to hit hawaii since 1983 when magnitude 67 event damaged 35 commercial buildings along with 317 houses that suffered minor damage and 39 houses that incurred major damages3 prior to the 1983 earthquake the strongest earthquake to strike hawa ii in more than century since april 2 1868 was magnitude 72 earthquake in 1975 that inju red several and cau sed an estimated 41 billion in property damages4 by comparison the 1868 earthquake caused 77 deaths tsunami 46 landslide 31 but limited property damages5 hawaii is vulnerable to significant losses from not only earthquakes and volcanic eruptions but also hurricanes given that the probable maximum loss pml for downtown honolulu the center of business activity in hawaii is approximately 50 billion hawaii does face significant catastrophe exposure to largescale natural disasters but to the extent there has been an insurance crisis in hawaii in recent decades it has been with respect to the availability and affordability of insurance against hurricanes particul arly after hurricane iniki struck in 1992 residential insurance coverage against earthquake risk has been widely available at reasonable rates from private insurers operating in hawaii the full extent of economic losses from the 2006 earthquake is not known but early reports suggest that damage to homes businesses and infrastructure will be modest perhaps in the 100150 million dollar range with insured property losses under 25 million the threshold for being considered an industrydefined catastrophe6 the insurance does not include pub lic buildings and infrastructure in its estimates of total insured losses this earthquake is not considered catastrophe because of the low dollar value of total in sured losses by way of comparison loss estimates from the 2006 hawaii earthquake are modest compared to the most costly earthquake in the united states the magnitude 67 northridge earthquake that struck angeles in 1994 and caused an estimated 20 billion in total property damage including 125 billion insured losses there are three possible reasons for the relatively low level of insured losses from the 2006 hawaiian earthquake 1 the insurance penetration is relatively low hawaii ranks 33rd in direct premium written fo r earthquake coverage with 44 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32847crs3 7 janis l magin and maria ne wman strong earthquake ra ttles hawa ii reports of injuries and power failures throughout the islands the new york times oct 16 2006 p a12written according to am best co an insurance rating company based in new jersey this earthqua ke coverage figure could be low because property owners could also purchase coverage through excess and surplus line broke rs and the actual premium volume is unknown by regulators at this time 2 the relatively high deductibles generally associated with earthquake insurance coverage mean s that property owners typically will have to pay to repair the minor property damages if the insured pay then the insurers do not have to 3 hawaiis seismic risks are we ll known and the state has prepared for events of this magnitude by adopting building codes appropriate for earthquakeprone areas the insured losses from the 2006 hawaiia n earthquake could exceed the early estimated losses of 100150 million when cap ital losses are known capital losses include such items as repairs to or repl acement of buildings contents and inventory and loss of income including business inte rruption rental income and wage losses the full extent of subtle damage to inte rior structures foundations walls ceilings and roofs of houses and bus inesses in the impacted ar eas will be known only after inspection by engineers7 public policy response to the 2006 hawa ii earthquake will lik ely be debated in the broader context of increasing demand for insurance and reinsurance following the 2004 and 2005 catastrophic hurrican seasons along with calls for the federal government to create financial backstop in response to the growing scarcity of catastrophic reinsurance in disasterprone areas lthough earthquake insurance coverage was readily available in hawaii prior to the recent event most insurance analysts believe this situation will change as insurers revise their expectations of future losses after catastrophe such as the 2006 hawaiian earthquake the cost of reinsurance could rise due to increased mand for coverage this forces the primary insurers to pass their higher costs in the form of higher premium rates on to their customers as rates go up access to cove rage oftentimes becomes more difficult or impossible to obtain at any price lessons learned from hurricane katrina the relatively low percentage of homeowners in the gulf coast who had federally required flood insurance when hurricane katrina struck in august 2005 demonstrated to policymakers the need to strengthen mandatory insurance purchase requirements and take steps to get residents and busine ss owners in hazardprone areas to protect their property against natura l disasters some industry observers have called katrina the us gulf coast tsunami reinforcing the realization that the united states has some exposure to ear thquake and

magnitude 85 earthqua ke struck near the same place as the december 26 2004 indian ocean tsunami some six miles below the surface of the indian ocean on the northern tip of the indonesian island of sumatra10 the indonesian earthquaketsunami is one of the worst natural di sasters in human history not only because of the number of casualties but also because of the combination of the unprecedented geographical scope of the devastation and degree of economic loss the 2004 earthquake spawned massi ve tsunami that smashed the coastlines of 12 countries in south asia and east africa resulting in over 280000 people dead or missing and significant ec onomic and nonec onomic damages11 insured losses were relatively low compared to the tens of billions of dollars of economic and non economic losses because few residential nd commercial buildings were insured the magnitude of the 2004 indonesian ts unami in terms of deaths and economic damages has prompted government offici als from around the world to call for greater international cooperation on em ergency disaster relief pla nning and assistance and the establishment of tsunami earlywarning system in the indian ocean similar to that already functioning in the pacific ocean even relatively inexpensive tsunami detection and warning system in the indian ocean that warned people of an imminent tsunami hazard and the arrival time at selected coastal communities in south asian and east african countries w ould have almost certainly saved tens of thousands of lives httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32847crs5 12 for more information see crs

of mitigation and preparedness strategies for which governments in the region must assume primary responsibility for this reason the us geological survey along with noaa fema and the coastal comm unities in alaska california hawaii oregon and washin gton maintain the national tsunami hazard mitigation program nthmp to address tsunami hazard assessment warning and mitigation the nthmp hosts the center for tsunami i nundation mapping effort time which develops maps of potential tsunami flooding in addition each participating state has tsunami mitigation resource center that provides tsunami education material to the public the nthmp was created following the april 1992 california earthquaketsunami when c ongress passed legislation to instruct noaa to work with the pacific states to

insurance programs at the country level risk management perspective in catastrophe risk and re insurance country risk management perspective london risk books 2004 p15 insurance and catastrophe risk management the indonesian tsunami of 2004 is remi nder of the role of insurance in financing catastrophe losses nd what happens when little of the total direct damage is covered by insurance the funds to rebuild in asia and africa after the 2004 tsunami came from foreign donors32 because of the low level of insured losses caused by the 2006 hawaiian earthquake much of the property da mages will be paid by individuals and not private insurers or the federal gove rnment insurance however has long played major role in developed societies as risk reduction and risk spreading tool that enables activities to take place that might not otherwise occur if an individual or business was forced to individually bear the risks associated with the activity33 insurance is thus an important and indispensable source of funds for compensating disaster victims it provides financial protection to those living in disasterprone areas furnishes victims with rebuilding assistance and emergency living expenses and reduces income losses in the event of disaster some economists assert that natural disasters can in some instances promote an economic stimulus because of the efficient funding and mitigation mechanism in place and the opportunity to replace aged infrastructure and facilities34 catastrophic and noncatastrophic insurance risks there are distinct diffe rences between catastrophi c versus noncatastrophic insurance risk and these differences are im portant as congress considers what role if any to pursue in covering the cost of catastrophes insu rance coverage for non catastrophe losses is offered in the private market when insurers and reinsurers are confident that they can predict the frequency of claims over time and set prices at level that allows them to cover expected losses and expenses that achieve an adequate rate of return on capital commensurate with the risk they assume actuarial analysis of noncatastrophic losses require fficient recent histor ical claims 510 years and exposure data to calculate the expected average incurred loss per future exposure insurers will then develop ra structures and underwriting guidelines that spread their risks broadly

prohibits companies from accruing catastrophic reserves unless it was probable that the loss had already occurred under the current federal tax provision premiums collected by insurers that are put in reserve fund for catastrophes are treated like excess profits and hence taxed the irs tax codes currently permit loss carryback of three years and loss carryforward of seven years so that insurers can write off losses against taxes paid from three years back and seven years in the future for more information on the fasb statement of financial accounting standard 5 see httpwwwfasborgpdffas5pdf 36

press 1999 p 149 37 ibid p 152 38 property insurance policies that cover households and businesses do not cover damage resulting from earthquakes land shock waves or tremors and loss from tidal wave caused by an earthquake ie tsunami coverage for earthquake damage is usually provided by an endorsement to homeowners and business insurance policy 39 policyholders surplus is insurance terminology designating what in other industries is termed companies net worth or owners equity it is measure of the capacity of insurers to underwrite policies and it must increase to meet the demands of growing us economy and claims from hurricanes and other natural hazardsfrom an historical perspective th ere have always been two fundamental earthquake insurance probl ems 1 the limited number of people who purchase earthquake insurance and 2 the limited capac ity of the insurance industry to handle the huge losses caused by earthquakes the capacity to insure catastrophe risk is limited because of the potential magnitude of losses the sporad ic and unpredictable nature of earthquakes and the existing regu latory system that discourages insurers from accumulating loss reserves for catastrophes by taxing such reserves as profits35 most economists and regulators would agree that far too few property owners in earthquake zones purchase earthquake insu rance these owners rely instead on good fortune or federal emergency disaster relief assistance36 homeowners typically decide not to purchase insurance or adopt lossmitigation measures to reduce deaths injuries and property damage homeowners may decide that disasters will not affect them utilize short time horizons in determinin g the expected benefits relative to the upfront costs rates and deduc tibles or compare costs with potential benefits and conclude that loss reduction meas ures are not good investments37 the second problem with insuring agai nst catastrophes is that the potential magnitude of natural disasters relative to insurers surplus can be so large and indeterminate that the insurance markets are unable to provide sufficient capacity at acceptable prices review of the us insurance industry reveals that its capacity to handle large catastrophic losses may be s ubstantially less than aggregate figures suggests38 repeat of the 1906 san francisco earthquake or the 1964 alaska earthquake in heavily populated area for example could cost insurers up to 500 billion in damages the policyholders surplus of the entire property and casualty insurance industry stood at about 4271 billion as of december

insurers encountered difficulty in obtaining layers of reinsurance coverage at prices that they considered affordable as result insu rers were forced to find new sources to assume catastrophe risk and

catastrophic risk management by providing early warning emergency assistance and resources to help longterm recovery should the federal g overnment expand its role into both the assessment of the financial risks associated with tsunamis and the management of such risk with federal disaster insurance it has been suggested that federal role in this area could be justified as necessary to 1 ensure the adequate capacity and solvency of the insurance industry to meet the growing consumer demand for protection against natural hazard risks and 2 minimize uninsured losses and hence reduce

federal focus on seismic hazard risks54 prompted in part by the 197576 predictions of earthquake s in china and california and the realization that 70 million americans had ttled in highrisk earthquake regions on both coasts there was doubling of federa l spending on earthqua ke preparedness and research into both the physical processes triggering earthquakes and the social and scientific aspects of risk communi cation and hazard mitigation adoption55 the federal insurance administration fia report issued pursuant to section 5 of the southeast hurri cane disaster relief act of 1965 concluded that earthquake insurance is readily available on onetofourfamily residential dwellings throughout the united states th at earthquake insurance premiums are neither excessive nor unreasonable that the availability of earthquake insurance on commercial and industrial properties is limited on the basis of the enormous exposure in these areas that the presen t deficient state of knowledge and data concerning earthquake occurrences and th inadequacy or absence of land use and control measures designed to reduc earthquake losses precludes program of greater breadth than that offered at present by the private insurance industry therefore we find that direct invo lvement of the federal government in earthquake insurance was unnecessary as to residential properties and infeasible or undesirable as to commercial and industrial properties56 in essence the fia recommended that the federal government not implement national residential earthqua ke insurance program for three reasons 1 there was adequate private earthquake insurance to meet public demand 2 local communities facing the earthquake hazard had not taken the necessary steps to adopt and enforce land use restrictions and building code measures designed to reduce potential earthquake losses and 3 ear thquake rate maps were inadequate for calculating sound actuarial rates on properties located in

attention involved changing federal tax policy to authorize taxdeferred treatment of private insurers catastrophe reserves allowing private in surers to build up catastrophe reserves to pay natural disasterre lated claims that have low probability of occurrence it is argued would lower insurers costs of holding capital and in turn lower the premiums they must charge for given leve l of disaster

93policy issues congress has been reluctant to enact federal disaster insurance legislation because of lack of consensus on what will work and concerns about adequate provisions for mitigation and avoidance of unnecessary government intrusion into markets being served by private sector entities congressional reluctance to establish federal natural hazard insurance program has also been based on the recognition that such program would conflict w ith sociological economic and actuarial principles that emphasize the true cost of government programs the opportunity cost of the funds the forgone benefits of competitive insurance marketplace eg cost efficiency and rate competition and the absence of consumer choice the ability to decide whether to purchase coverage62 the federal government has historically played an important role in the economy by assuming risks that the private sector ither will not undertake at any price or will accept but at price so high that most potential beneficiaries will not purchase the coverage for example government ri skbearing now occurs in environmental disaster nuclearplant accide nts toxic waste dumps and flooding establishing an explicit federal disaster insurance system to ameliorate the potential damages to homes and commercial buildings stemming from natural disasters would represent another government riskbearing progra m one that could expose taxpayers to funding demands if program revenues fail to cover costs or returns are lower than expected nevertheless supporters of fe deral disaster insurance program argue that it would be justified by the national scope of the disaster problem and the inability of the private insurance industry to handl high payouts without federal government involvement concluding observations the 2004 indonesian earthquake and ts unami which left over 280000 people dead or missing and the 2006 hawaii ear thquake may cause some members of congress to assess disaster policy and mo re specifically the efficacy of federal disaster insurancereinsurance program economic reasoning holds that there are some situations in which insurance s hould not be available or should be so expensive that individuals will not want to buy it as society however we may consider it too harsh to permit people to suffer the consequences of financial ruin from having built without either the ability or the foresight to insure their property consequently the ultimate choice arguably may not be the optimal level of insurance to produce economic efficiency instead it may be to minimize the costs of disaster relief if accepted the perspective summarized bove could well shape the legislative approach we know that disa sterprone states have f illed the gap by establishing statesponsored insurance m echanisms for insuring th uninsurable catastrophic risk given that the states have acted to provide catas trophe funding for the smallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32847crs23 to moderatesized hurricane and earthqua ke congress might consider strict economic approach that calls for fairly mild reforms of the insurance industry that still allows the possibility of people being uninsured and not getting relief and thereby uses that outcome to encourage the public to engage in lossprevention measures alternatively congress might consider potentially economically less efficient approach that calls for the creation of federal disaster insurance system at the higher layers of coverage such legislation might however result in over investment in hazardprone areas in pursuing this potentially less efficient solution the approach might be one of finding the least expensive way of making sure everyone is protected from major economic losses from natural disaster
