islands guam american samoa and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi implem entation has been gradual though the ultimate objective has been consistently to raise wages to the highest level that is economically feasible without subs tantially curtailing employment in 1937 and 1938 when congress crafted th flsa there appears to have been little concern about its impact upon the us territories and possessions in 1940 the act was amended to permit special industr committees sics to visit puerto rico and the virgin islands to assess their economies and to make recommendations for subminimum wage in certain industrie s in 1956 the same procedure was instituted for american samoa guam d always been under the act though it may not have been implemented the cnmi in setting forth

procedures and come fully under the flsa two territories remained to be accounted for american samoa nd in different context the cnmi it was generally assumed that the mainland minimum wage applied to american samoa though it had not been implemented during the early 1950s the department of the interior moved to attract new industry to the island group namely tuna canning the first company van camp sea foods asked congress to grant an exception from the flsa and in 1956 the pu erto rican model was adopted the exception remained in place until 2007 whe n under the flsa amendments of that year the sic system was abolished and the federal minimum wage in steps would be applied the cnmi was acquired by the united states in the aftermath of world war ii when in the mid1970s it became commonw ealth in association with the united states the cnmi retained control over its minimum wage and certain aspects of immigration and trade policy decade ter in the 1980s congressional hearings uncovered what

application of the fair labor standards act introduction when congress crafted the fair labor standards act flsa during 1937 and 19381 there appears to have been little cern about how its provisions might affect the territories and possessions of the ited states gradually through various procedures and over different time periods the federal minimum wage has come to be applied in most of these jurisdictions in puerto rico and the virgin islands implementation was gradual utilizing special industry committees sics parallel sic was created for american samoa durin g the middle 1950s by the late 1980s or early 1990s the sics for puerto rico and the virgin islands had been phased out for samoa the sics seem to have had little effect in raising wage rates though the procedure remained in place intermitte ntly until the summer of 2007 when it was abolished the flsa was immediately pplicable to guam though it was only enforced about two decades later in 19591960 the case of the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands the cnmi is somewhat different the cnmi was acquire d by the united states in the wake of world war ii with the creation of the united nations the island group was assigned to the united states as part of the trust territory of the pacific islands by the mid1970s the islands had entered into covenant of association with the united states under their current commonwealth status in doing so they retained responsibility for the insular minimum wage and exercised control over aspects of insular immigration policy as cond itions developed goods produced in the cnmi were to be marketed as made in america combining the advantages of low wages lower than those required in most other us jurisdictions the availability of alien contract labor from china and elsewhere and the right to use made in america label for marketing purposes the relatively small cnmi veloped substantial produc tion industry this was especially notable in garments over time the alien labor force came to equal the natives of the cnmi and allegations of s weatshop conditions began to surface at the same time there were affi rmations that entrepreneur s of the cnmi had

an introductory sketch of the role of the minimum wage in the territories and possessions of the united states omitted are nuances of policy that might rightly deserve more extended study the fair labor standards act of 1938 as adopted in 1938 the flsa pl 75718 defined state as any state of the united states or the district of columbia or any territory or possession of the united states3 distinctions were made between the states and the other jurisdictions where flsa wagehour policy was concerned the general concept of the flsa appears to have evolved from experience under the national industria l recovery act the ra 19331935 the nira was basically voluntary depending for mu ch of its even limited success upon the goodwill of the several par ties though the nira encountered problems dealing with the territories notably with puerto rico there was built into the act flexibility which initially the flsa did not seem to enjoy4 the nira was declared unconstitutional in 1935 but still it was ve ry much on the minds of the members of congress in 1937 nd 1938 nd framed much of the context of the wagehour debates of that period in 1938 the flsa set minimum wage of 25 cents per hour for covered workers with step increases to 30 cents per hour one year after enactment and to 40 cents per hour seven years after enactment however the act also provided for system of special industry committees sics for each industry engaged inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30235crs3 5 section 5 of pl 75718 june 25 1938 6 section 8 of pl 75718 7 ibid apprentices and similarly disposed pers ons were provided with special option but in the general workforce youth subminimum wage was not agreed to 8 here again the special committee was to elevate wages above the minimum and potentially to do so by grade of work but the minimum wage per was not stratified by age nor by gender commerce or in the production of goods fo r commerce the administrator of the wage and hour division at the departme nt of labor dol was thus permitted to examine the several covered industries and as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employme nt to increase the federal minimum wage for particular industries thr ough administrative processes5 such administratively set minima were not to exceed 40 cents per hour nor were they to fall below the level fixed by the statute for each statutory step increase the administrator could reject sic recommendations andor remand the matter to the committee or to another committee these administratively determined wage rates were to have effect only through sevenyear period thereafter the 40cent minimum would become applicable6 congress did not seem to anticipate immediate appointment of industry committees and indeed they came into be ing only gradually section 8 mandated that the administrator shall from time to time convene the industry committee for each such industry and the industry committee shall from time to time recommend the appropriate wage ra tes taking into account economic and competitive conditions it directed that such rates not give competitive advantage to any group in the industry but rather that th ey should take into account transportation living and production costs nor was the ag of the worker to be part of the equation7 in general the industry committee was vehicle for upward movement of wage rates its disc retion involved only the interim area between the statutory floor 25 cents an hour and an upper level of 40 cents per hour several factors came into play under th special industry committee procedures congress sought to provide for the blishment of the highest minimum wage rate consistent with the statute however it was equally determined that institution of the minimum rate should not substantia lly curtail employment and finally it provided that any committeeestablished subminimum rates would not give competitive advantage to any group in the industry each of these issues was discussed at some length during the initial debates on the flsa8 the provision for industry committees under section 5 and section 8 has provided through the years context for minimum wage treatment of some insular jurisdictions though that was not it appears initially its purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30235crs4 9 dietz james l economic history of puerto rico

1940 and 1996 it was afforded special treatment through sy stem of specially industry co mmittees sics now the minimum wage treatment of puerto rico is on par with the several states puerto rico with its capital at san juan was acquired by the united states as result of the spanishamerican war 1898 although its ultimate status would remain somewhat ambiguous the island developed institutions that closely paralleled those of the states just as several states had experimented with minimum wage laws early in the century so did the puerto rican legislature which adopted such requirement in 19199 insular wage rates however remained far below those for most mainland workers through the 1930s when with the enactment of the flsa in 1938 puerto rico was mandated to increas its wage floor interests on the island argued that it would be hard pressed to do so without serious economic dislocation the upward flexibility permitted through the special industry committee structure may have been useful for the mainland but for puerto rico some argued that even the 25 cent floor may have been too high10 during 19391940 various industry groups pressed for r emedial legislation for puer to rico on the matter of wagesandhours law claiming that failure to secure re lief means the total collapse of industries vital to our economic structure and unemployment for thousands of wage earners dependent thereon11 in 1940 congress enacted new legislation designed specifically for puerto rico and the virgin islands it allowed the flsa minimum wage requirements to be set aside and replaced with special industry wage floors these minima to be developed by industry committees operating in coopera tion with the usdol were intended to reflect insular economic realities deviation from the national minimum wage under the flsa was allowable only for so long as and insofar as such employee is covered by wage order issued by the ad ministrator of the wage and hour division within the usdol pursuant to the r ecommendations of special industry committee12 the intent of this special arrangement for puerto rico and the virgin islands was to bring the two jurisdictions up to the standards observed by th states as rapidly as might be economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment at the same time the committees were pr ohibited from recommending

increasing wage parity with the mainland continued through more than halfacentury during c onsideration of the 1989 flsa amendments congress revisited the case of puerto rico as it had through the years it was found that in most areas of production the insular employers we re meeting national standards the 1989 enactments thus eliminated the speci industry committee system for puerto rico and mandated through series of step increases in the insular wage structure under the flsa that all covered workers be pa id not less than the applicable federal minimu m wage after april 1 199614 the virgin islands under the flsa of 1938 the virgin isla nds were covered in the same manner as the several states however dur ing the period 1940 to 1989 there was time when wage rates were fixed by special industry committees as had been the case with puerto rico since the mid1990s the minimum wage for the virgin islands has been set at the national level the virgin islands were acquired by th united states in 1917 through purchase from denmark there are about 68 islands in the american virgin chain with only about three actually populated collectively the islands have population of slightly less than 150000 people15 charlotte amalie is the capital the relationship between the islands nd the mainland evolved slowly through the decades following their acquisition by th united states like puerto rico the virgin islands were covered under the or iginal flsa enactment of 1938 but if hearings and floor debates are any indica tion their inclusion may have been more nearly pro forma rather than the result of direct legislative intent during consideration of th flsa in 1937 and 1938 very little attention appears to have been focused upon either the virgin islands or puerto rico however with enactment of the wagehour legislation industry becam concerned about its impact and through 1939 and 1940 puerto rican in terests appealed to congress for an amendment to the statute on behalf of the islands though the focus of congressional debate appears to have b een upon puerto rico the 1940 flsa amendment applied to the virgin islands as well16 where the federal minimum wage could be met it was applied where significant unemployment might have resulted from imposition of mainland wage rates the minima were set by industry committees with the approval of the usdol wage and

7576 as in puerto rico flsa coverage was gradually expanded for the virgin islands together with the rest of the na tion in 1989 the government of the virgin islands indicated that for all the covered

since 1938 just as it has applied to the states of the union however it has only been enforced there since about 19591960 guam like puerto rico was acquired by the united states in 1898 as result of the spanishamerican war for 50 year s it remained under the jurisdiction of the united states navy then in 1949 presid ent truman transferred administration of the island to the department of the inte rior in 1950 congress established system of civil government for the island of pe rhaps slightly less than 200000 people its capital is agana in 1968 the island was llowed to elect its own governor in 1972 to elect nonvoting delegate to the us congress18 prior to world war ii socioeconomic and cultural conditions in guam were quite different from those of the united st ates or other industrialized countries19 through the years the insular labor force and wage structure appear to have remained multitiered with separate rates for alien workers imported from the philippines for native guamanians for americans recruited on guam and for american workers recruited from the states20 when the civil government was estab lished 1950 colonial administration appears to have been somewhat chaotic one observer stated for example existing laws represented hodgepodge of rules regula tions laws naval expressions of policy and tters and other documents havi ng the force and effect of law21 as territory or possession of the united states guam was covered under the original flsa but it seems that the statute was not enforced there thus for these several reasons guamanian employers do not appear to have been involved in discussions during 1939 and 1940 which led cong ress to alter the act with respect to puerto rico and the virgin islands guam of that period was simply too far removed from

connell et 335 us 377 1948 although at issue was the application of the flsa to employees of american contractors engaged in the construction of military facility for the united states in bermuda part

in vermilyabrown further justice jackson suggested that the situation of us facility in bermuda was of character different from that of our possessions as numerated by the courts majority24 in addition with adoption of an organic act for guam in 1950 commission established to review the pplication of federal laws to the island found that flsa applicability to guam was indisputable par

through the course of hearings in 1957 it was clear that the flsa applied to guam though there was some question about coverage for the filipino workers following from the hearings the 85th congress

governed from the insular capital of pago pago there had been an american presence in samoa through the latter 19th century but with the spanishamerican war there developed series of treaties and

the industries of the island thus following period of adjustment until april 1988 the samoan minimum wage would have become the same as that for the mainland32 as result the special industry committee system would have been disbanded with samoa achieving the same status in wagehour matters as guam that is equality with the states before the recommendations of the committee were given effect dol

determination is very much up to each employer39 with the adoption of the covenant 19751976 res ponsibility for labor standards was divided between the cnmi and the united states the united states

same time unemployment was said to be about 71 overall but w ith significant differences between alien workers lower rate and resident islanders suggesting that jobs were either too poorly paid to attract local workers or conversely that guest workers were outbidding natives for the available work anticipating reform some suggested the need for special industr committee as was utilized in
