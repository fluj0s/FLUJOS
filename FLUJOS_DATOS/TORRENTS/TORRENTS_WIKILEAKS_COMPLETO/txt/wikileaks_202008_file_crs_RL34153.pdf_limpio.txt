school55 billion trips each yearare made on school buses nationwide an average of seven school bus passengers die each year in crashes buses have the lowest death rate of any mode of transporting children to school in the united states federal safety standards for school buses established in 1977 require seat belts only on buses whose fully loaded weight is less than 10000 pounds type ii but not on buses whose fully loaded weight is more than 10000 pounds type i the vast majority of type i school buses weigh 24000 pounds or more when fully loaded in addition to their greater mass and structural safety features these large school buses employ compartmentalizationa passive protection system that uses padded highbacked seats spaced closely together in rowsto protect passengers compartmentalization has been found to be an effective system in protecting passengers in front and rearend crashes provided the passengers are properly seated but it is less effective in protecting them in sideimpact and rollover crashes when they may be thrown out of the compartments the occupant protection value of seat belts on large school buses has been debated for decades advocates contend that seat belts would reduce injuries to and deaths of passengers in part through keeping them within their compartments in sideimpact and rollover crashes these advocates who include the american academy of pediatrics the national coalition for school bus safety and the national pta also contend that seat belts would provide other benefits including improving student behavior on buses and reducing distractions to drivers as well as reinforcing use of seat belts that might increase seat belt use in other vehicles others including the national association of state directors of pupil transportation services and the national association of school transportation caution ag ainst requiring that seat belts be installed on large school buses they note that studies have f ound that adding seat belts to large school buses is not costeffective safety improvement these studies indicate that lap belts may provide net safety benefit and lapshoulder belts might save one or two lives and prevent several serious injuries each year at an annual cost of hundreds of millions of dollars for adding the belts also since adding lapshoulder belts can reduce the seating capacity of large school buses some students might be displaced from school buses to more dangerous forms of transportation unless additional buses have been purchased to maintain existing seating capacity further increasing the cost of the requirement given the relatively small number of deaths to school bus passengers these observers contend that other measures could have greater safety benefits for school children several states have passed laws requiring that large school buses be equipped with lap belts with the result that perhaps as much as 35 of the nations school bus fleet is already required to have some form of seat belts only california currently requires the safer and more expensive lapshoulder belts federal funding is generally not available to help communities purchase school buses this

and light trucks be equipped with seat belts since 1970 the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa has estimated that seat belts in passenger vehicles have saved tens of thousands of lives in crashes during that time given the safety benefit provided by seat belts in passenger vehicles some observers contend that seat belts should be required on school buses as well some school busesthose with vanlike body structures whose fully loaded weight is under 10000 poundsare required by federal regulations to be equipped with safety belts those whose fully loaded weight is more than 10000 pounds are not though some states and individual school districts require seat belts in those vehicles this report examines the issue of adding seat belts to large school buses it begins by looking at the number of children who use school buses to get to school each year the number who are killed while riding in school buses and the relative risk of school bus travel compared with other

transportation research board reports that school buses transport an estimated 25 of the nations k12 studentssome 125 million students 1to school and schoolrelated events each year this produces an estimated 55 billion student trips annually2 between 1995 and 2005 there were total of 1368 fatal crashes involving school transportation vehicles3 school buses are larger and heavier than most other vehicles on the road so most fatalities in school transportation related crashes are not to school bus occupants but to occupants of other vehicles or pedestrians only 97 7 of those crashes resulted in fatality to an occupant of the school transportation vehicle in those 97 crashes total of 119 occupants of the school transportation vehicles were killed45 school vehicle drivers and 74 school vehicle passengers thus during that 11year period there were an average of 88 school transportation vehicle crashes and 67 school vehicle passenger deaths each year 4 1 transportation research board

school bus thus vehicles not meeting federal regulations for school bus design but being used as school buses would be included in this statistic 4 of the 119 total fatalities 20 17 were riding in vehicles being used as school buses but not meeting federal requirements for school buses the nhtsa report does not indicate how many of the 20 were passengers versus drivers all school buses are required to have seat belts for the driver so the driver deaths are omitted for the purpose of considering the impact of seat belts for passengers f

question of whether seat belts should be required on school buses has been of interest to congress for many years in the motor vehicle and school bus safety amendments of 1974 pl 93492 congress directed nhtsa to promulgate regulations for school bus safety including the protection of occupants when nhtsa decided not to require seat belts on large school buses congress asked nhtsa to report on the extent to which seat belts and other occupant restraint systems could reduce injuries to school bus occupants pl 94 346 in the surface transportation and uniform relocation assistance act of 1987 pl 10017 5 transportation research board national research council special report 269 the relative risks of school travel 2002 6 injuries to school bus occupants are another measure of the effectiveness of occupant protection strategies but problems with the injury data limit their usefulness nhtsa estimates that only about 4 of crashrelated injuries to school bus occupants are incapacitating injuries category that encompasses nonfatal injuries ranging from severe lacerations to quadraplegia the national transportation safety board has concluded that school bus crash injury data are incomplete and therefore injuries cannot be reliably estimated national transportation safety board bus crashworthiness issues highway special investigation report ntsbsir9904 1999 p 69 7

basic types of school buses used in the united states type and b are similar in design and are smaller in size than the other two types more like vans type c is traditional school bus with the engine mounted in front of the windshield and type d is transit type bus with the windshield flush with the front of the bus federal regulations divide school buses into two categories type i those with gross vehicle weight rating gvwr 8 of more than 10000 pounds and type ii those with gvwr of less than 10000 pounds type ii buses are required to have seat belts type i buses do not have to have seat belts type and b buses may have gvwr greater or less than 10000 pounds thus may be either type i or type ii types c and d buses are type i an estimated 8085 of the nations 482000 school buses are type i buses9 the largest school buses types c and d have gvwrs of 24000 pounds or more10 type c school buses are the most common of the four types making up about 57 of school bus purchases during the period 1993200511 type d buses represented about 23 of purchases during that period thus the largest and heaviest types of school buses make up about 80 of the school bus fleet in addition to the crash protection afforded to school bus occupants by the mass of these vehicles which reduces the crash forces on occupants compared to those experienced in smaller passenger vehicles these bus bodies also have energyabsorbing designs for frontend crashes and their occupants are positioned above the level of most other vehicles on the road providing protection from sideimpact crashes except those involving similarsized vehicles despite the general absence of seat belts ejections of passengers from large school buses during crashes are extremely rare 12 8 gross vehicle weight rating refers to the maximum loadcarrying capacity of the vehicle in the case of school buses it would be the weight of the bus when loaded with passengers 9 school bus number from school transportation news buyers

197613 in the course of that rulemaking consideration was given to requiring seat belts on school buses nhtsa decided that passive approach compartmentalization would provide the most reliable protection14 compartmentalization refers to system of protecting the passengers by using highbacked padded seats designed to absorb energy from impacts placed in relatively closelyspaced rows in addition to protecting passengers without requiring any action on their part compartmentalization allows for quicker and easier loading and unloading of occupants than an active restraint system compartmentalization has been found to be effective in protecting school bus passengers in head on collisions it is less effective at protecting passengers in sidecollisions or rollover accidents when occupants may be thrown out of their compartments or at protecting passengers when they are not properly seated in 1999 study of school bus crashes the national transportation safety board ntsb termed compartmentalization very effective yet incomplete system of occupant protection and called on nhtsa to develop performance standards for occupant protection systems that protect passengers in frontal impact collisions side impact collisions rear impact collisions and rollovers 15 nhtsa has announced that it is planning to propose standardized test procedures for voluntary installed lapshoulder belts an increase in the required school bus seat back height from the current standard of 20 inches above the level of the seat to 24 inches to reduce the risk of passenger striking the passenger in the seat ahead and that smaller type ii school buses currently required to have lap belts be required to have lapshoulder belts 16

several studies have examined the potential safety benefits of seat belts in large school buses in general the studies have found that lap belts are of uncertain benefit but that lapshoulder belt systems do provide safety benefit to occupants provided that they are properly used if misused they have the potential to cause injuries 1989 study by the national transportation safety board ntsb of 43 serious school bus crashes concluded that seat belts lap belts probably would not have reduced the total number of deaths in the crashes studied 17 1989 study of school bus safety by the transportation research board trb estimated that if all large school buses were equipped with seat belts one life might be saved and several dozen serious injuries averted each year 18 the study suggested that lapshoulder belt systems might provide greater safety improvement than lap belts but that the necessity of stiffening the seat back to support the lapshoulder belt might increase the risk to students who did not wear the belts since the increased rigidity of the seat backs would exacerbate injuries to unrestrained passengers striking them the study concluded that the estimated benefit of requiring seat belts on large school buses did not justify federal mandate 13 federal motor vehicle standard fmvs 222 school bus passenger seating and crash protection 14 nhtsa chose to also require seat belts on school buses with gvwrs under 10000 pounds b ecause their lighter mass and lower position offered less protection to occupants 15 national transportation safety board bus

produce greater improvement in safety for school bus passengers 1999 ntsb study of sideimpact crashes school bus crashes found that while laps belts and lapshoulder belts might have prevented or mitigated some of the injuries in the crashes studied they might have caused or exacerbated other injuries however while ntsb was not able to determine whether current restraint systems would have reduced injuries in the study crashes it concluded that the potential exists for an occupant crash protection system to be developed that would protect school bus passengers by retaining the passengers within the seating compartment in most accident scenarios 19 2002 nhtsa study used crash testing to study the effects of compartmentalization lap belts and lapshoulder belt systems20 lap belts were found to help keep passengers within their seat compartment which added measure of protection but also to increase the risk of neck injury the lapshoulder belt system was found to offer the greatest degree of safety when used properly if misused eg if used as laps belts they could also increase the risk of injury to occupants nhtsa estimated that out of the two average annu deaths from frontal crashes in large school buses between 19902000 one life might be saved each year by lapshoulder seat belts if they were universally used also nhtsa found that lapshoulder belts have the potential to be effective in reducing fatalities and injuries in nonfrontal crashes21

proponents of requiring seat belts on large school buses include the american academy of pediatrics the national coalition for school bus safety the national pta and others they note that compartmentalization is designed primarily to protect occupants in front and rearend collisions and provides limited protection in sideimpact collisions and rollover accidents as well as limited protection even in front and rearend collisions to students who are not properly seated they contend that requiring students to wear seat belts on school buses will increase the safety of school bus occupants in case of accident they also contend that requiring students to wear seat belts will reduce injuries from children sticking their arms and heads out the bus windows improve student behavior on buses reduce opportunities for bullying and limit behavior that might distract the bus drivers attention from driving thus reducing the risk of crashes proponents also contend that requiring students to wear seat belts on school buses will send consistent message to students regarding the importance of wearing seat belts that will promote their use of seat belts in other vehicles 22 others including the national association of stat directors of pupil transportation services and the national school transportation association caution against requiring that school buses be equipped with seat belts their concerns are that such requirement would involve significant 19 national transportation safety board bus crashworthiness issues highway special investigation report ntsbsir9904 p

low number of school bus passenger fatalities might produce little or improvement in safety for the occupants of school buses at the same time the resulting reduction in school bus seating capacity might increase the risk to students who were displaced from school buses to more dangerous forms of transportation unless significant additional resources were made available to maintain the overall bus fleet seating capacity some of these organizations such as the national school transportation association do not oppose requiring lapshoulder belts on type i school buses if sufficient funding is also provided so that students are displaced due to loss of seating capacity opponents of seat belts on school buses have also expressed concern about the ability to rapidly evacuate bus after crash if students are belted in and that lap belts and misuse of lapshoulder belts may cause additional injuries in crashes however nhtsa notes that lap belts have been present on some large school buses for more than 30 years without any documented serious injuries resulting from their use 23

all school buses be equipped with seat belts lapshoulder seat belt systems did not become available as an option for type c and d school buses until the early 2000s 24 as result most type i school buses that are equipped with seat belts have lap belts the additional cost of equipping type i school bus with lap belts is relatively modest around 1000 and installing lap belts does not reduce the seating capacity of bus there is insufficient data from states that require lap belts on school buses with which to judge their impact on safety25 several studies based on analysis of actual crashes andor simulated crashes have failed to find net safety benefit for lap belts due to the potential for lap belts to cause or exacerbate certain types of injuries in school bus crashes 26 nhtsa is considering requiring that the smaller type ii school buses which are currently required to have lap belts be equipped with lapshoulder belts27 only one state california requires that school buses be equipped with lapshoulder belts adding lapshoulder belts to school bus is much more costly than lap belts and may result in reduction of seating capacity studies have suggested that lapshoulder belts could improve safety for school bus occupants if they are widely used and used correctly they are more complicated to fit correctly than are lap belts given the wide range of physical sizes of school bus passengers which could reduce the extent of their usage by passengers given the uncertain safety benefit of lap belts the focus of the rest of this analysis is on lapshoulder belts 23 72 federal

cost of equipping large school bus with 3point lapshoulder seat belts range from 8000 to 15000 1020 increase29 based on estimated annual sales of roughly 31000 new large school buses30 the annual additional capital cost of equipping the nations fleet of large school buses with lapshoulder belts could be in the range of 250 million to 465 million31 this would represent an increase of roughly 10 20 in total annual spending on large school buses one concern of opponents of requiring seat belts on large school buses is that the additional expense of the seat belts might lead states and school districts to purchase fewer buses thus reducing the availability of school bus transportation any change that results in fewer students riding school buses is likely to increase the overall risk of death and injury to students since every other form of school transportation is more dangerous than riding large bus adding lapshoulder belts may reduce the seating capacity of school buses discussed in more detail below so in order not to increase the risks to some students by displacing them to more dangerous modes of school transportation additional school buses might need to be purchased in order to maintain the overall seating capacity of the school bus fleet these additional costs would be faced by school districts and states that have already seen the costs of their most widely used buses jump by 20 from 2006 to 2007 due to increases associated with federal mandate for reducing emissions from diesel engines and rising costs of commodities such as steel according to the national school transportation association32 the emissions standards are expected to bring new round of price increases when the standards rise in 2010 in addition nhtsa is proposing to amend the standard for type ii buses to require that they be equipped with lapshoulder belts rather than lap belts if adopted that requirement may increase the cost of type ii buses as well proponents of requiring seat belts on school buses contend that estimates of the cost of adding seat belts to school buses should take into account the costs of not having seat belts on school buses these include the medical costs of school bus injuries and the costs to school districts and school bus companies whose costs are passed on to school bus purchasers of lawsuits filed by parents whose children have been killed or seriously injured in school bus crashes data on these costs are not available 28 ken hedgecock vicepresident of sales marketing and service for thomas built buse s inc presentation at nhtsa public

type c and d buses typically have seating capacities of 6084 elementaryage students based on 10 or more rows of seats that are 39 inches across seating three students to seat and six to row 33 seating lapshoulder belt systems cannot accommodate three students in 39inch seat35 the bus body could be made wider to retain the existing seating capacity but opponents contend this would make such buses more dangerous on narrow roads and more difficult to maneuver on neighborhood streets buses with lapshoulder belt systems either have 32 seating making one seat on row wide enough to accommodate three lapshoulder belts and reducing the other to accommodate two such belts or 22 seating that is the elementary school student seating capacity of large school bus is typically reduced by 1633 when lapshoulder belts are added however not all school buses operate at maximum seating capacity also most school districts use the same buses for k12 students 36 the seating capacity of large bus is lower for middle and highschool students than for elementary school students since older students take up more than 13 inches of seat space consequently the reduction in seating capacity resulting from adding lapshoulder belts to large school bus may range from zero to 30 depending on ridership characteristics as an indication of the potential cost impact if 10 increase in the number of large school buses purchased nationwide was needed to prevent students from being displaced that would represent an additional annual capital expense of perhaps 260 to 290 million 37 other potential capital costs could include increasing the storage area to accommodate increased fleet sizes there would also be increa sed operating costs for additional drivers fuel and maintenance for the extra buses38

lapshoulder belts on school buses and that requirement applies only to buses purchased after 2004 for type ii buses and 2005 for type i buses fitting lapshoulder belts to the wide range of physical sizes of k12 students is more complicated than fitting lap belts so the rate of usage might be lower all else being equal evidence indicates that usage of lap belts varies by age group with higher rates of usage by elementary age students and progressively lower rates of usage by middle and high school age students new york requires all school buses to be equipped with lap belts but does not mandate their use leaving that decision to each school district only around 4550 of new yorks 720 school districts require students to use the belts 40 nationwide for areas where school buses are equipped with lap belts estimates of overall usage are around 5041 where usage is required another issue is how to effectively enforce that requirement stationing adults on each bus to monitor and enforce the use of seat belts might result in higher rates of usage but could increase the districts personnel costs g21g157g138g157g142g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 federal bus safety

purchased since 2001 and requires students to use them and louisiana requires that an occupant restraint system be installed on every school bus though this requirement does not take effect unless funding for this purpose is provided by the state 43 texas passed similar law in 2007 requiring lapshoulder belts on school buses purchased as of 2010 but school districts do not have to purchase buses equipped with seat belts until the state legislature has arranged to reimburse them for the additional cost of the belts the texas law will require students to use the belts states that have required seat belt usage have also typically protected the bus drivers and school districts from criminal liability in the event students do not use the belts 40 peter f mannella executive director

maintain the status quo regarding federal requirements for seat belts on school buses congress might focus instead on further improving the crashworthiness of school buses experts who have looked at the issue at congress direction have repeatedly concluded that lap belts offer little or additional safety benefit and that the benefits of lapshoulder belts do not justify their considerable costs and potential unintended consequences nhtsa is in the process of issuing regulations that will provide an improved performance standard for occupant protection systems in school buses between the federal mandate for seat belts on type ii school buses and the actions of individual school districts and some states already as much as 35 of the nations total school bus fleet is required to have some form of seat belt though the percentage actually equipped with seat belts is less than that since california and florida have not fully equipped their fleets yet if texas implements its seat belt law that ratio could rise to over 40 without any additional federal action 44 most of these buses are required to have lap belts but nhtsa is considering requiring that the smaller type ii school buses which are currently required to have lap belt be required to have lapshoulder belt if nhtsa does make that change some 20 of the nations school bus fleet would be required to have lapshoulder belts including the impact of californias requirement that all its school buses be equipped with lap shoulder belts that ratio could rise to almost 30 if texas implements its law other states may follow if their assessments of the costs and benefits justify the change

nhtsa must evaluate any regulation to require seat belts on school buses against the significant costs and the relatively small apparent benefits it appears unlikely that seat belts will be required on large school buses through the regulatory process congress could mandate that lapshoulder belts be available on all school buses nhtsa has estimated that such requirement could potentially save an average of one life and prevent some proportion of serious injuries each year in frontal crashes assuming 100 proper usage and could also reduce fatalities and injuries in nonfrontal crashes however if improperly used eg for any students who slipped the shoulder strap behind them using only the lap portion of the lapshoulder belt they could increase rather than decrease the risk of injury states have had the option of requiring the additional protection of seat belts and few have done so but so far only california has required the considerably more expensive yet safer lapshoulder belt restraints 45 requiring lapshoulder belts on type i school buses would increase their cost by 1020 and could reduce the seating capacity of the buses necessitating the purchase of additional buses to maintain the student ridership levels 44 all type ii buses are required to have seat belts they represent an estimated 1520 of the total fleet new york california new jersey and florida have the nations first third fourth and fifthlargest state school bus fleets representing 235 of the total fleet texas has the secondlargest state school bus fleet 75 of the total fleet data is not available

to offset the additional costs of maintaining the existing ridership of the nations school bus fleet congress could also choose to provide funding to states and school districts to offset the additional costs of maintaining existing ridership it is more expensive to retrofit existing buses whose seats and floors were not designed to support the loads that may be exerted on lapshoulder belts so this requirement could be phased in by applying it to buses manufactured and purchased after certain date states and school districts usually replace large school buses on 1215 year cycle so it could take that long to equip the nations school bus fleet with lapshoulder belts the full extent of the additional costs is not known but the capital costs could exceed 500 million annually there would be additional operating costs as well

equipped with lapshoulder belts such grants could be conditioned on the states or school districts having requirement that the belts be used congress could also encourage usage of the belts perhaps by

school travel hours occur in modes other than school buses there are other options that could have greater impact on increasing the safety of school children than requiring that seat belts be installed on large school buses for example shifting students from relatively more dangerous modes of transport to school such as bicycling walking and passenger vehicles driven by teens to relatively safer modes such as school buses is one way of making school children safer 46 while federal funding is generally not provided for purchasing large school buses grant program to encourage school districts to increase the percentage of students who travel to school by bus could promote safety congress also recently created new program to make the most dangerous modes of school transportationwalking and bicyclingsafer 47 other options include making school bus and passenger vehicle pickup and dropoff locations safer and implementing and enforcing graduated licensing programs for teen drivers48 the ntsb has recommended that school buses be equipped with onboard data recorders both to provide additional information about crashes that could lead to improved occupant protection practices and also because experience has shown that the mere presence and presumably knowledge on the part of drivers of onboard data recorders on vehicles has often led to reductions in the number of crashes experienced by those vehicles49 46 transportation research board national research council special report 269 the relative risks of school travel 2002 47 the safe routes to
