performance at the polls benefitted from growing economy and boost in social services provided by the government his pledge of greater effo rts to alleviate poverty also may have helped ease some grievances against his rule according to many observers the fractiousness of some of the opposition wh ich could not agree on single candidate was major factor in the results preliminary report by

that its exit polling at 400 precincts appeared to indicate that saakashvili may have won enough votes to avoid runoff even if there were voting irregularities5 us analyst charles fairbanks however argued on january 16 2008 that the balloting reported for saakashvili was inflated so that it was unlikely that he won in the first round6 although russian election obs ervers were invited the russian foreign ministry asserted on january 6 2008 that the election could hardly be called free and fair including because the campaign was accompanied with the extensive use of administrative resources unconcealed pressure on opposition ca ndidates and rigid limits on their access to financ ial and media resources7 implications for georgia and saakashvili many observers regarded the relative peacefulness of the election campaign compared to the november 2007 violence as positive sign that at least fitful democratization might be pres erved in georgia among ot her possible signs of progress toward democratization and stability saakashvili in his inaugural address on january 20 2008 pledged to facilitate greater opposition pa rticipation in political decisionmaking some analysts also suggest that opposition pa rties and politic ians might ve benefitted from the campaign by becoming better known and might gain votes in upcoming legislative elections thereby enhancing political pluralism these observers suggest that opposition parties and politicians w ill soon shift from protesting the results of the presidential race to campaigning for prosp ective may 2008 legislative election in the economic realm these observers suggest th at saakashvilis reelection reassured international investors that georgia has stable inves tment climate although boosted social spending

against what they considered fraudulent election gachechiladz and other leaders of the national council asserted that saakashvili did not win enough votes to avoid runoff where he would have faced single opponent gachechiladze many observers argue that saakashvilis electoral victory with 53 of the vote contrasts sharply with the 96 of the vote he won in 2004 and illustra tes that public trust in his governance has declined one geor gian analyst has suggested however that despite this decline in public trust many citizens remembered the disorder of past months and years and were fearful of voting fo r opposition candidates who promised radical political and economic changes if elected the risk of disorder could greatly increase if public trust further declines as the result of tainted prospec tive may 2008 legislative election10 saakashvilis win appeared to be furthe r blow to russias hopes of restoring its influence in georgia according to many obser vers these observers also raise concerns that saakashvilis campaign pledge to soon unify georgia although he called for peaceful measures could contribute to further tensions with russia in his inaugural address however saakashvili attempted to reassure russia that georgia was intent on repairing bilateral ties one tajik analyst has suggested that saakashvilis reelection provides positive example to reformminded politicians in russia and other s oviet successor states and threatens nonreformist governments in these states11 implications for us interests on november 8 2007 the us state depar tment welcomed president saakashvilis call for early presidential elections and plebiscite on the timing of legislative elections at the same time it urged saakashvili to reli nquish emergency power and to restore

issue for the us government is democracy he held extensive talks with government and opposition politicians to urge them to mode rate their mutual accusations and to make compromises necessary for
