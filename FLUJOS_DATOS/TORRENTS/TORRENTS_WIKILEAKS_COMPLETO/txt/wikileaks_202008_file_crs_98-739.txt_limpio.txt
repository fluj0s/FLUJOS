future august 24 1998 william c boesman specialist in science and technology science technology and medicine division congressional research service the library of congress abstract the russian government reduced its research and development rd funding by about 76 in real dollars from 1990 to 1996 as part of the restructuring and downsizing of russias rd system and its reorientation toward civilian research and development following the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 the report assesses number of recent changes in the russian rd system including the large funding and personnel decreases the evolving structure of new russian rd system and russian rd priorities under the new system the report identifies issues for congress including whether us cooperative rd programs recently established to assist russias peaceful transition to market economy are contributing to that goal and whether such programs should be continued in light of russias uncertain future and possible us national security concerns this report will be updated as circumstances warrant research and development in russia an important factor for the future summary if the us government had reduced its research and development rd funding by about 76 in real dollars from 1990 to 1996 the us national rd system would be in crisis but even then the situation in the united states probably would not have been as severe as is now the case in russia where that percentage of reduction in governmental rd funding has occurred because the united states has large privatesector rd system the leadership under president yeltsin continues to move russia from the sovietera command economy toward freemarket system this involves restructuring and downsizing of russias rd system and its reorientation toward civilian rd this restructuring however also has been driven to significant extent by the nations deep economic recession although large decreases in rd funding and personnel and deterioration of rd facilities have occurred since 1991 recent rd budget figures questioned by some experts might indicate reversal of this trend the most recent changes in the governments toplevel rd policy leaders also suggest that rd despite its budget decreases still is considered important in yeltsins reform government among several recent important rd reforms was the establishment of the russian foundation for basic research in 1993 an important innovation in russian rd policy because it funds individual researchers directly rather than their research institutes on the model of the us national science foundation number of international financing schemes and structures to bolster the russian rd system also have been created us policy issues parallel ongoing us and international programs to more fully integrate russia peacefully into the community of nations thereby reducing the potential for future conflict and increasing russias contribution to world economic development major federal programs in support of russian rd accounted for about 15 billion during the period from 1992 through 1998 with nasa contributing over 900 million and dod doe and other federal agencies the rest one of the several new organizations established to cooperate with russia in rd activities by providing research grants to russian scientists is the us civilian research and development foundation created by congress in 1992 supporting all us cooperative rd programs with russia is the usrussian joint commission on economic and technological cooperation established in april 1993 it appears that the us cooperative rd programs are contributing to russias peaceful transition to market economy and are successfully addressing scientific and technological problems and opportunities of mutual concern to the united states russia and other countries several years of experience with usrussia cooperative rd programs suggest that it is both worthwhile and practicable for the united states to identify and promote cooperative rd programs which are mutually beneficial to the two nations while carefully restricting rd and dualuse technologies that may contribute to nearterm or longterm military threats to

development in russia an important factor for the future introduction healthy research and development rd establishment is important for the future of russias economy and national security research and development has the potential to contribute just as significantly to russias economic strength in the long term as it does in the united states other western industrialized nations and the newly industrialized countries of asia the asian tigers singapore south korea and taiwan the russian economy however is undergoing great upheaval during its transition from centrally planned to market economy an important aspect of that economic transition is the proposed conversion of much of its defense industry to civilian goods production russias economic problems in general and its defense industry conversion in particular have resulted in large decreases in the governments funding of research and development before 1991 about threefourths of russias rd funding was supported by the defense ministries1 some estimates indicate that by 1992 russian defense spending had dropped by onethird to twothirds of its 1991 level2 by now it may have fallen to onetenth of its 1991 level3 that large loss of financial support for the russian rd establishment beginning in 1991 and continuing to the present has not been replaced by other rd funding sources to any significant extent4 if the us government had reduced its research and development funding by about 76 in real dollars from 1990 to 1996 the us national rd system would be in crisis but even then the situation in the united states probably would not have been as severe as is now the case in russia where that percentage of reduction in governmental rd funding has occurred about 58 of russias internal rd funding in 1996 came from the government in the united states in 1996 by contrast only about 34 of national rd funding came from the federal government and that decreased to about 31 in 19975 the remaining us rd 1 carol

russian rd funding problem has caused number of structural changes in the russian rd system and the creation of number of international financing schemes and structures to bolster the russian rd system the soviet rd establishment contributed significantly to the status of the soviet union as military super power before 1991 after 1991 in spite of the many negative aspects of downsizing the russian rd establishment such as the loss of many scientific jobs and some rd capabilities several positive developments may be occurring the soviet rd establishment then the largest in the world and respected for high achievements in some areas particularly military rd was bloated and wasteful according to many accounts smaller more efficient rd system focused on developing commercial products would be of more benefit to the evolving russian market economy than the old rd system even with the large decrease in rd personnel since 1991 the russian rd establishment still may not have reached such an optimal size in addition decrease in military rd as russia converts its defense industry to civilian goods production could contribute to russia being less of military threat to the national security of the united states in the years ahead than it has been in the past the period of transition from the wellfinanced but inefficient soviet rd system to significantly changed russian rd system probably will continue for another 10 to 15 years according to many experts on russian science and technology st policy the united states may have an important role to play during this period it along with other nations could continue to contribute in major ways to the stabilization of smaller more efficient russian rd system geared more to civilian market goals than to the predominantly military orientation of the past alternatively the united states could reduce its support of and cooperation with some russian rd projects if this is determined to be in longterm us interests background the russian academy of sciences was created by peter the great in 1725 following the establishment of the soviet union in 1922 it became the soviet academy of sciences in november 1991 it was reestablished as the russian academy of sciences during the soviet era it was the central scientific organization of the soviet union with rd capabilities in russia and the other 14 soviet republics its mission was to conduct research in support of the technoeconomic and later military needs of the state the prestigious research institutes of the academy were responsible mainly for conducting fundamental research the rd organizations of the governments military and industrial branch ministries were responsible mainly for applied research and development related to the missions of those ministries the institutes of higher education were responsible mainly for the 5 continued arlington va 1996 78 and steven payson rd exceeds expectations again growing faster than the us economy during the last three years nsf data brief 5 november 1997 2 crs3 education of future scientists although they also conducted limited research during the cold war the majority of these large rd capabilities were devoted to military rd even today about onehalf may be devoted to military rd6 toward the end of the soviet era and the cold war the soviet union particularly russia was comparable to the united states in some areas of science especially in several areas of theoretical science and few areas of experimental science it was weaker than the united states in most other scientific areas including most areas of experimental science this was due largely to the prestige historically associated with theoretical science and mathematics in the soviet union but also because of the lack of adequate scientific equipment the soviet union also was competitive with the united states in several areas of military research an elite area of its rd establishment7 this elite status was achieved however not because of separate system but because of higher standards and the higher standards were achieved through massive inspection system at enormous cost civilian consumer could afford the real costs of the products produced by and for the soviet military8 the russian rd system in its economically inefficient soviet configuration has not contributed significantly to the market system reforms instituted in the postsoviet era under president boris yeltsin in contrast in the united states and other industrialized nations civilian applied research has contributed significantly to economic development one factor in russias favor however is that most of the rd capabilities of the former soviet union at the time of dissolution were in russia russia had about two thirds of the researchers and major research institutes and almost 60 of all research organizations of the former soviet union these rd capabilities are concentrated in moscow st petersburg and novosibirsk9 post1991 changes in russia many of the current problems in russian research and development especially its financial problems were caused by the dissolution of the soviet union in december 1991 at the end of the cold war russia underwent many changes it began movement toward democratization of its political structure and the communist party lost control of the government russia now is governed under 6 see the section

services although reorganized and renamed have retained much of their secret police powers10 some of the old power structure formerly called the nomenklatura also appears to have been retained11 however while the government still has more control over the nations science and technology and other sectors than do governments of other industrialized countries it has much less control than previously this is due in part to rd funding difficulties and the related decentralization of rd and the establishment of alternatives to governmental rd support including foreign partners and nongovernmental commercial organizations the russian leadership under president yeltsin especially after the governments organizational reforms of early 1998 continues to move toward freemarket system for russia this involves considerable degree of demilitarization of the nation in 1996 for example production of major weapons systems was about 13 of the 1991 level according to russian statistics12 during the soviet period the military was the major funder of research and development because military rd often was the best rd performed in russia defense budget cuts have affected adversely some of russias best rd capabilities even if they were inefficient in economic terms another goal of the transition to market economy is the conversion of much defense industry production to civilian production but apparently very little defense conversion has occurred thus far this limits the amount of existing top quality defenserelated rd that might otherwise be converted to civilian ends there also are concerns about reconversion to military ends and that some cases of conversion may be only diversification13 the shift from the sovietera command economy toward freemarket system requires restructuring and downsizing of russias rd system and its reorientation toward civilian rd process that began in the early 1990s14 this restructuring of the russian rd system however has been driven to significant extent by the nations deep economic recession financial support for russian rd the majority of which is still funded by the government has fallen dramatically since 1991 this 10 amy

even though the former soviet rd model did not have great deal to contribute to the evolving market economy the rd establishment then was held in high esteem and received many perquisites the current rd establishment has suffered loss of national prestige mainly because of the decreases in rd funding personnel and capabilities since 1991 recent toplevel changes in the governments rd policy structure however discussed below indicate that rd still is considered to be important by the leadership although there appears to be unified view on national st goals research and development in russia political and economic problems such as those discussed above have caused significant changes in russias civilian and military rd funding personnel structure and priorities reportedly the processes of transition threaten the very survival of the russian st system15 rd funding the major problem aside perhaps from the nonquantifiable loss of prestige of russian rd is decreasing funding since the government provides large portion of rd funding this decrease has significant impact on st activities in 1995 about 74 of russias internal rd funding came from the government this decreased to about 58 in 199616 table 1 shows russian rd funding and personnel since 1990 although some analysts knowledgeable about russian rd and rd statistics question the accuracy of the official statistics especially in regard to military rd large decreases in both rd funding and personnel since 1991 are apparent the decrease in rd funding was due to decreasing percentages of gross domestic product gdp being devoted to research and development at the same time that gdp itself was decreasing given these caveats about the data table 1 indicates that from 1990 to 1996 gross domestic expenditures on civilian and military rd decreased about 76 in constant 1989 rubles and about 57 as percentage of gross domestic product the latter indicates not only decrease in real rd funding but trend of overall national financial resources away from research and development since 1990 the small increases in these figures in 1996 might indicate reversal of this trend 15 science technology and innovation

allocated due to sequestrations which have occurred because government revenues have failed to meet budget targets moreover not all russia rd organizations share equally in the actual allocations of the rd budget in 1996 for example the russian academy of sciences received about 78 and the russian federation for basic research about 37 of their budget allocations many other rd organizations received significantly less than their allocations17 the ministry of science and technology for example received about 50 of its budget18 the russian space agency received about 8019 in addition to the amounts shown in table 1 large amounts of rd funds were received from foreign nations including the united states it is unclear however how much of the foreign funds actually went into the russian rd system in 1993 for example oecd estimated that about 200300 million reached russia from oecd countries but russian official thought that this was an inflated figure20 during the worst years of the russian rd funding crisis 1994 to 1996 foreign support might have reached 30 to 50 of total russian civilian basic research funding21 table 1 indicates the extreme inflation that occurred in russia from 1990 through 1996 gross domestic expenditures on rd gerd was about 194 trillion rubles current prices in 1996 most of russias gerd still is provided by the government in 1996 and 1997 the federal

portion was slashed about 55 to 22 billion because of the governments large deficit24 total rd funding for 1997 thus was roughly onehalf civilian and onehalf military25 for 1998 the planned civilian rd budget is about 22 billion the same as the actual funding level in 199726 if military rd funding for 1998 also is about the same as last year total rd funding would remain about onehalf military and onehalf civilian the rd funding difficulties of the past several years could have been made significantly worse by draft tax code approved by the russian cabinet in february 1997 and planned to be submitted to the duma in april 1997 the thenexisting tax laws were in need of reform because they were contradictory and confiscatory the draft code although it would have increased governmental revenues which russia desperately needs also would have eliminated almost all of the tax exemptions and concessions that applied to the russian rd establishment including universities it was estimated that it would have deprived russian rd of funds amounting to about onehalf of the 1997 budget27 this threat to rd funding was eliminated in 199728 the new tax code passed by the duma in july 1998 favors enterprises including rd organizations by reducing their tax burdens while increasing the tax burden on consumers through increased sales value added and personal income taxes rd personnel related to the significant decreases in rd funding are similar decreases in the number of rd personnel and scientific degrees awarded table 1 shows that from 1990 to 1996 the number of scientific degrees awarded decreased about 57 and the number of researchers and technicians fell about 53 although endangered mathematics and scientific education in russia is still world class the dramatic decreases in the numbers of scientific degrees awarded and rd personnel may not be entirely unfortunate because it is generally conceded that the russian scientific and engineering work force was

engineers rse in fulltime equivalent fte for an economy which in real terms seemed three times bigger than russias japan whose science system is more labourintensive employed some 450000 rse for an economy which seemed equivalent in real terms to russias these data give some benchmarks for the size that seems reasonable for russia the latter still employed 950000 rse in head count in 1991 the corresponding number in fte would be somewhat smaller the reduction that has already occurred concerns possibly 200000 to 300000 persons so that large cuts are still to come29 table 1 shows that the number of russian researchers and technicians decreased to about 573000 in 1996 allowing for some differences in statistics from different sources the russian rd work force still might not have reached its optimal size given the evolving russian rd structure and priorities aside from the personal hardships imposed on the unemployed scientists and engineers involved and the ripple effect of reduced wages throughout the economy the reduction in the work force has caused several other problems but also opportunities for russia external brain drain the first and greatest wave of expatriates in 1992 and 1993 included many of russias scientific and engineering elite however some of these persons may return brain drain of nuclear weapons scientists potentially dangerous situation probably is minimal because of laws restricting the travel of such scientists and because of international programs to encourage them to stay the overall external brain drain has been relatively small30 in addition many russian students studying abroad probably will return although not until after they are 28 years old in order to avoid the military draft internal brain drain of the approximately 500000 to 600000 scientists and engineers who left their professions from 1990 to 1995 possibly more than half of them have found new careers in russia many in the emerging market economy in nonscientific and nonengineering capacities31 these intelligent welleducated and motivated individuals probably have contributed significantly to the evolving market economy banking for instance has recently become

best russian scientists and engineers have retained their jobs in the institutes of the academy of sciences and other elite institutions the average age of these remaining rd personnel has been increasing this has negative implications for the future of russian rd the decrease in rd funding has not only caused decrease in rd employment but deterioration of rd facilities old equipment cannot be maintained or replaced new equipment and supplies cannot be purchased and many facilities are closed part of the time because utility bills longer subsidized cannot be paid parts of some facilities have been rented for nonscientific use to raise funds other facilities have been closed entirely rd funding decreases also have caused some problems in maintaining russias international st commitments perhaps most importantly for the united states russia may not be able to fulfill its financial commitments in support of the international space station iss33 according to rep sensenbrenner chairman of the house committee on science this raises serious concerns about russias continued participation in the project34 in letter to president clinton on june 24 1998 rep sensenbrenner and rep brown ranking minority member of the house science committee requested plan from the president within thirty days detailing how the administration expects to resolve the dire problems surrounding the international space station35 the letter requested the presidents personal intervention with president yeltsin to ensure russias full compliance with its iss commitments the recent troubles with the mir space station also may lead to russia scaling back its planned experiments on that station36 russia also plans to decrease its contribution to the international thermonuclear experimental reactor

added importance to russias technology development programs conducted in support of its market reform policies if such programs are successful the still small nongovernmental st sector may contribute more to the nations research and technology development activities than it has in the past loss of prestige of russian rd is both cause and an effect of the rd funding and personnel problems discussed above russian rd is not as valued in the evolving market economy as it was in the soviet era38 in addition scientists and engineers have lost much of the leadership role that they had in that era this perhaps more than the continuous decreases in rd funds which might ultimately level off and maybe even turn into increases and the loss of rd personnel which has some positive as well as negative aspects might be the most serious factors in the longterm health of russian rd rd structure the russian rd structure also has undergone number of changes since the end of the soviet era in the soviet era the state committee for science and technology in conjunction with the soviet academy of sciences had principal responsibility for formulating policy for and conducting basic research the ministry of higher and specialized secondary education was responsible for the institutes of higher education immediately after the soviet era the ministry of science higher education and technology policy headed by boris saltykov was established as the principal rd organization responsible for policy direction and the funding of much rd and science education in early 1993 it lost its responsibility for higher education policy and became the ministry of science and technology policy in august 1996 it became the state committee on science and technology headed by vladmir fortov who also was vice premier on march 10 1997 it became again the ministry of science and technology now science and technologies under fortov but he longer was vice premier the new deputy prime minister with responsibility for science and technology was vladmir bulgak seasoned bureaucrat who was the former minister of communications39 in cabinet reshuffle in april 1998 bulgak was appointed minister of science and technologies to replace fortov40 although he lost his position as deputy prime minister bulgak subsequently was appointed to seat in the newly created presidium select subset of the cabinet this was an indication of the importance placed on science and technology in the reformminded government of president yeltsin and the new prime minister sergei kiriyenko after about five months in office kiriyenko was fired on august 23 1998 and replaced by the former prime minister viktor chernomyrdin these changes are an indication of the governmental uncertainty that still affects the russian rd system 38 salaries of scientists for example have fallen from about 110 to about 80 of other salaries according to boris g saltykov 39 information on these recent developments was obtained in personal communication with dr irina dezhina on 28 march 1997 40 carl levin russian reshuffle places bulgak at helm nature v 393 7 may 1998 3 crs12 those changes indicate continuing rivalry among the current russian st policy leadership as to the proper level and focus of research and development that rivalry includes continuing competition for scarce rd funds between for example the ministry of science and technology and the russian academy of sciences in some ways though the rd structure has not changed much since the breakup of the soviet union the russian academy of sciences is basically the same organization as the former soviet academy of sciences and is still the most influential and prestigious rd organization in russia it remains hostile to rd reform the ministry of science and technology especially under former minister saltykov has been the principal agent of reform in russian st policy saltykov for example attempted to identify russias best research institutes and fund them on priority basis as federal research centers also referred to as state science centers these centers now numbering about 60 about twice the number originally envisioned are particularly favored in the rd budget the program however has been seriously diluted by the inclusion of the additional institutes given the governments limited financial resources after he was appointed deputy prime minister bulgak promoted reform of russian science including radical restructuring of the russian academy of sciences and substantial reduction in the number of statesupported research institutions his reform plan was published in october 1997 because it lacked detail time schedule and deadlines however it has been criticized by other reformminded individuals as being too vague41 another important rd reform was the establishment of the russian foundation for basic research rfbr in 1993 headed until recently by the former minister of science and technology vladmir fortov it has provided westernstyle meritbased peerreviewed grants for about 54000 research scientists although the foundation accounted for only about 4 to 6 of the federal budget allocation in 199597 and actually received only about onethird of that42 it may have contributed roughly one third to onehalf of salary support for russian scientists conducting basic research43 this is mainly because the much larger budget of the russian academy of sciences has been going principally for maintenance of its physical plant rather than for salaries or scientific equipment the rfbr is an important innovation in russian rd policy with potentially longreaching ramifications because it funds individual researchers directly rather than their research institutes on the model of the us national science foundation other important postsoviet rd organizations include the russian space agency and the ministry of atomic energy which are responsible for the military and civilian nuclear complex the ministry of defense continues to be responsible for much military rd russian rd also is becoming more decentralized and diversified significant amount of science policy is being formulated

effectively use scientifictechnical potential to enlarge the contribution of science and technology to development of the states economy and to attainment of the most important social objectives to provide for progressive structural transformations in materials production to raise its effectiveness and the competitiveness of its products to improve the ecological situation and protection of the

education like much else in russia today however the mediumrange and longrange directions of state st policy shall be determined by the president article 13 states that the president shall make his determination on the basis of special report to be prepared by the government while these activities might seem and probably are somewhat chaotic they have contributed to number of positive changes in russian rd more flexibility in the rd system including increased local regional international and industrial participation implementation of competitive peerreviewed research grants by the new foundation for basic research selective support of science for example of the new federal research centers support of leading scientific schools and increased cooperation between academic research and teaching45 current russian rd priorities are mix of soviet and postsoviet priorities as reflected in the nations 42 federal st programs most of which are from the soviet period these programs fall into four major categories military conversion programs new technologies life sciences and sociooriented programs most of the rd funding in 1995 and 1996 however went to such programs as the conversion of the defense industry the federal space program and the program of development of civil aviation at least in those years according to russian analyst familiar with russian rd programs the hidden priority still was defenserelated research46 although russia is attempting to develop new commercial technologies about onehalf of current russian rd funding as noted above might be for military rd senior russian officials have stated that because of budgetary constraints the 44 on science and state science and technology policy 45 personal communication with dr irina dezhina on 28

since 199347 in addition to the facto priorities reflected in the governments rd programs there exist several other lists of rd priorities one governmental list includes basic research and seven critical technologies information technologies and electronics production technologies new materials and chemical products technologies of living systems transport fuel and energy and ecology and rational use of nature the priorities of the russian academy of sciences coincide to large extent with this list other rd priority lists include that of the national technology basis program and separate priority list involving dualuse technologies the establishment and funding of the new federal research centers also is an important priority48 this abundance of rd priorities some of which may be inconsistent with others reflects continuing uncertainty as to the relative importance of the various components of russian science policy as do the structural changes in the rd system noted above military and space rd historically have been two of the most important russian rd priorities although cloaked in secrecy russia presumably is maintaining its rd capability to service some of its large nuclear weapons force in addition selected areas of military rd appear to be well funded and world class including advanced fighter aircraft and nuclear submarines49 there is however crisis in military funding salaries of military officers for example have been months in arrears for several years50 space rd however in which russia has long played leading role internationally especially in areas such as human spaceflight has suffered several reverses the loss of its mars 96 spacecraft serious blow to the russian space program51 and the governments problems with funding the international space station noted above are symptoms of program in financial and technical trouble issues for congress the policy issues involve mainly problems and opportunities in us and international support of and cooperation with the russian rd establishment overall these issues parallel ongoing us and international programs to more fully integrate russia peacefully into the community of nations thereby

in general the policy issues can be defined as whether us rd cooperation with russia should be increased or decreased in the four major areas of us government support for russian science and technology support of russian efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials and the defection of nuclear weapons scientists support of russian economic reforms support of us scientists in establishing research partnerships with russian scientists and promotion of technical commercialization by assisting us companies gain access to advanced russian technologies and highly skilled technicians52 major federal programs in support of russian rd are shown in table 2 it is estimated that these programs accounted for about 15 billion during the 19921997 period of which over 900 million was for nasas human space flight programs and number of other nasa rd projects the us private sector also contributed about 300 million in rd funding during this period about 200 million of which was provided by george soros nasas cooperative effort the largest among the federal programs draws on russian knowhow to reduce costs in the us manned space program nasa provided about 662 million to russia for the shuttlemir program and the international space station project from 1994 through 1998 of which 190 million was funded through contract between the boeing corporation and russias khrunichev company second major nasa cooperative program is research on global climate change there also are number of cooperative efforts in other areas including aeronautical research and development the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction ctr program of the department of defense dod53 promotes the national security of the united states by facilitating the reduction of weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons in the former soviet union expediting their destruction establishing proliferation safeguards including the prevention of an external brain drain of weapons scientists and engineers and expanding defense contacts between the united states and soviet successor states very little of this involves research and development the program provided about 50 million in direct support of russian scientists through the international science and technology center istc and about 5 million through the us civilian research and development foundation crdf

providing research grants to russian scientists the first the international science foundation isf was established by george soros in 1992 it expended about 100 million on longterm basic research grants for russian researchers before it ceased operations by 199655 the second organization the international science and technology center is joint cooperative effort of russia the united states japan the european union and few other nations the istc was established in march 1994 after extended negotiations between the parties56 the center has committed about 135 million57 to encourage russian nuclear weapons scientists who might otherwise wish to emigrate to stay in russia and reorient their research to nonmilitary ends the third organization is the us civilian research and development foundation for the independent states of the former soviet union established under the freedom support act58 it began funding in 1996 and has committed about 16 million for russia by 1998 to strengthen civilian rd collaboration defense conversion and the emerging market economies of russia and other former soviet states59 recent initiative is the program for basic research and higher education brhe joint effort of the us civilian research and development foundation and the russian ministry of education its purpose is to eliminate the historical separation between the approximately 325 research institutes of the russian academy of sciences and russian universities which have never conducted much research the initiative would create cadre of elite research centers at universities that can help attract and train the next generation of scientists60 this initiative apparently has the support of the leadership of the russian academy of sciences if successful the initiative would dramatically change the structure of russian science by creating research instituteuniversity link with similarities to those existing in france and germany supporting the cooperative rd programs with

technology ventures is important to both the us private sector and russia at its february 1997 meeting the commission agreed to design an initiative to improve the commercialization of russian technologies the us government has identified four potential areas of activity that could contribute significantly to overcoming existing difficulties in commercial cooperation between the two countries resolution of at least some of russias systemic legal and regulatory impediments to technology commercialization increased availability of information for us companies on russian research institutes scientists and specializations education and training in host of transaction areas importexport regulations partnering arrangements etc and intellectual property rights relevant to doing

cooperation in applied rd through the support of projects designed to facilitate and expedite the commercial utilization of research results62 even with all these us and other cooperative rd programs and activities however the nearterm future of russia and russian rd still appears to be perilous some observers though believe that the longerterm future following the transition period may be rather bright for russian rd if smaller but more efficient rd system is adequately funded now is time of both danger and opportunity for usrussian rd cooperation the russian economy still is in financial crisis63 foreign direct investment in russia which would ameliorate this situation is small in comparison to global and even eastern european investment patterns64 foreign direct investment in major technological projects which generally includes both funding and foreign corporate management of research and development might be crucial to increased rd funding in russia because the government probably will continue to find it difficult to allocate more of its constrained budgets for research and development in 61 richard j brody usrussian initiative on commercializing russian technologies

near future russia particularly needs additional foreign direct investment in energy and telecommunications which typically involve significant rd components privatization and foreign and domestic purchase of ownership shares of for example the russian telecommunications giant sviazizvest and major russian energy companies are important for sustaining much of russias rd and for increasing its technological competitiveness fortunately prospects for this are good the economic downward trend was arrested in 1997 although it recurred with sudden severity in 1998 optimistic forecasts project small increases in growth but only if and when the financial crisis coincident with the governmental changes of august 1998 is resolved an open question at this moment if the russian economic situation including foreign direct investment and the tax collection process does not improve there likely will be continuing serious ramifications for russian rd because adequate rd funding depends upon an improved economy more productive tax base and direct foreign investments65 if the russian economy does begin to revive and grow the russian rd system although smaller may be stronger after the transition period perhaps 10 to 15 years than it was in the soviet era especially if it continues to receive outside help us and other cooperative rd programs are enhancing russias peaceful transition to market economy and are successfully addressing scientific and technological problems and opportunities of mutual concern to the united states russia and other countries us rd cooperation with russia also is one of the few areas in current usrussia relations in which both countries can promote mutual goals in constructive way involving many us government agencies some may argue that the contributions already made by these efforts support the case for increased us and international rd cooperation with russia others may caution that with increased cooperation and relaxation of international tensions much us and foreign rd and many dualuse technologies including computers and telecommunications may ultimately find their way into russias military efforts and be counterproductive in regard to us national security this cold war issue surfaced again in early 1997 with the sale of powerful us computers to two russian nuclear weapons laboratories66 another security issue came to light recently when the us government imposed sanctions against seven russian entities suspected of contributing to irans missile program67 65 personal communication with john p
