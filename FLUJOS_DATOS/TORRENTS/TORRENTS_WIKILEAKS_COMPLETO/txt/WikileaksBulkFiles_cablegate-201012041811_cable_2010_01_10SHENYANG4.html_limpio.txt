xxxxxxxxxxxx 167 classified by consul general stephen b wickman for reasons 14 b and d 1 snf summary on december 15 eap das xxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxx staff met with xxxxxxxxxxxx major player here in chinesenorth korean economic exchanges xxxxxxxxxxxx attributed the dprks recent currency reform to several factors controlling rampant inflation preventing hot money flows leveling the wealth gap between workers and traders controlling domestic currency and most importantly uncovering potential political opposition as result of the reform commerce has come to halt the leadership as part of an ambitious 2012 development strategy hopes for the restoration of relations with the united states xxxxxxxxxxxx also believes that current plans assume kim jongil will be around for some time and that kim jongun will be his successor the recent recall of dprk scholars students and scientists from china following the defection of north korean exchange student for example suggests increasing levels of paranoia end summary give good reason 2 snf on december 15 eap das david shear and consulate shenyang staff met with xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx visits pyongyang frequently admitting he is unsure of the exact value of chinese investment into north korea xxxxxxxxxxxx believes the number to be many billions of renminbi chinese companies like their rok counterparts use north korea as processing zone primarily in the mining and seafood industries according to xxxxxxxxxxxx the dprk leaderships 2012 target for achieving strongcountry status should form the principal basis for analyzing recent political developments including the currency reform measure 3 snf the most important reason for the recent dprk currency reform according to xxxxxxxxxxxx is to uncover political opposition particularly against kim jongils younger controlling inflation leveling the wealth gap controlling domestic currency and access to foreign currency are all part of this strategy xxxxxxxxxxxx believes that the third kim jongun favored the currency revaluation and that going forward kim jongun leans toward vietnamesestyle of economic reform opposition to the currency exchange according to xxxxxxxxxxxx might reveal who opposes the ascension of kim jongun to leadership according to xxxxxxxxxxxx kim jongils support of the currency reform points to his favoring the third those opposing the revaluation also oppose the third xxxxxxxxxxxx drew parallels to the 2009 nuclear tests which he said were also influenced by succession plans xxxxxxxxxxxx said that the first kim jongnam opposes his younger brothers reform plans and favors chinesestyle of economic opening 4 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx said that the number of factions competing for kim jongils attention have made it increasingly difficult for kim jongil to listen to anyone as sign of kim jongils paranoia he recently recalled all students scholars and scientists in china following the defection of an exchange student in northeast china he did this despite the need for chinese knowledge production skills and technology to achieve the countrys goals for 2012 however xxxxxxxxxxxx believes that current instability will settle and the government will move ahead with reform fully expecting kim jongil to be around for sometime to come the reform according to xxxxxxxxxxxx may not be toward more open economy rather with currency reform giving the regime the ability to control domestic currency reforms will lead to tighter control over the economy 5 s prior to revaluation one dollar equaled 3500 won to put that in perspective the average worker in pyongyang earns 30004000 won per month xxxxxxxxxxxx reported that according to the dprk embassy the official exchange rate following reform is now one dollar equals 129 won for the common person shenyang 00000004 002 of 002 besides suffering from significant cut in wonbased savings supermarkets and department stores that deal in won have suspended activity as they wait to see what impact currency reform will have on commodity prices thus it has become difficult to purchase daytoday needs xxxxxxxxxxxx pointed out if commodity prices rise the economy will be ruined however if prices settle as result of reform and assuming constant wages the economy will be okay as workers once earning one dollar month will now earn nearly 20 dollars 6 s traders who earn many times more than the average wageearner have been unaffected by the reform in monetary terms as savings are held mostly in euro and dollars since the revaluation only stores dealing with foreign exchange have been open and prices in these stores have increased 400500 percent for example tv that cost rmb 4000 now costs rmb 20000 many of these stores raised prices in anticipation of the reform with the expectation that prices would then fall however prices have not fallen many of the stores that raised prices prior to reform have since been closed by the government their goods confiscated thus even traders who have not lost money from revaluation now have nothing to buy chinese traders along the north korean border have also been affected by currency reform even though most trade is done in euros and dollars as is the case within north korea people are waiting and watching to see what will happen to prices in the meantime nobody wants to sell anything not crisis yet but close 7 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx does not believe the dprk is in crisis mode at this time as he said the people are used to this sort of thing he saw the currency reform as being part of broader conflict within the government as it moves forward in the next several years since 2002 the dprk has allowed some economic reform without expressing strong support or opposition as he put it the government has been waiting and watching to see what would happen china the us and everything 8 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx said many in the dprk believe the chinese do not understand their country while neither the chinese nor the dprk are likely to criticize the other in public xxxxxxxxxxxx said that in private the dprk has disparaged the chinese for not including north korea on its list of 147 tourist destinations or 137 investment destinations these omissions and the disparate chinese actions on regional development projects clearly indicate that north korea is not priority for the chinese for instance while china recently elevated the longbeleaguered changchunjilintumen river development plan to national level project the dprk left the tumen river development plan as it sees benefit reftel relations between the two countries were getting so bad in fact premier wen jiabao visited pyongyang two months ahead of schedule 9 snf according to xxxxxxxxxxxx north korea has set an ambitious target of developing strong country by 2012 as part of this project it is planning to build 100000 residential apartments in pyongyang by 2012 in order to encourage chinese investment the dprk is offering chinese investors mining and ocean rights for their injection of cash into the project former consul general of the north korean consulate in shenyang recently spent two weeks in beijing attracting about rmb 12 billion for this project and planned to come to shenyang following his time in beijing 10 s restoration of relations with the united states is another important part of the dprks reform plans he said however that north korea looks forward to an ongoing cycle of ups and downs in negotiations and that it counts on the to be slow in implementing sanctions as he said he believes that once things settle down north korea will show china and the us its bottom card wickman
