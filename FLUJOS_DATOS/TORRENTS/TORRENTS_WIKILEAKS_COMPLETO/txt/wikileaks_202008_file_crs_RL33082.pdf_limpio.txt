background chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code governs liquidation of individual and business assets and is used most frequently by indivi duals liquidation involves marshaling the debtors assets as of the bankruptcy filing reducing them to cash distributing the proceeds to creditors and forgiving ie discharging the debtor from most debts that predate the filing bankruptcy reorganization under chapter 13 allows debtor to discharg indebtedness by using future income to pay past debt in return the debtor may be able to retain some assets that would have to be surrendered in liquidation the us bankruptcy code has historically and continues to make limited distinctions between types of debtors by occupation i wage earners farmers family farmers fishermen railroads commodity brokers etc while there are many different provisions addressing various debtor and creditor groups there are far fewer instances of chapters or subchapters ta ilored to discrete debtor groups needs1 in addition to providing different procedures for reorganizi ng specified debtor groups some potential debtors specified businesses such as domestic insurance companies and banks are not permitted to file in bankruptcy2 business entities that are not permitted to file generally have other regulatory regimes to deal with their insolvency httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33082crs2 3 11 usc 507 the majority of

bankruptcy and natural disasters vol xxiii 10 mer bankr inst j 20 dec 2004jan 2005despite its complexity the code establishes general rules for the treatment of debtor and his or her indebtedness in terms of debt the primary distinction for bankruptcy purposes is between secured nd unsecured debt secured indebtedness such as home mortgages and automobile lie ns are treated differently under the us bankruptcy code and commercia l law in general they ca nnot be fully discharged unsecured claims which are essentially c ontractual obligations to repay without pledge of collateral may be discharged chapter 7 is utilized by debtors to discharge unsecured debts such as credit card debts defining debtor and creditor needs the ultimate goal of bankruptcy proceedin g is twofold to give the deserving debtor an economic fresh start by fo rgiving ie discharging debt and to maximize the debtors estate for the benefit of creditors and distribute it to them equitably as stated above bankruptcy w like the law in general treats secured and unsecured claims differently two majo r bankruptcy distinctions in the treatment of unsecured debt are that if there are sufficient assets some unsecured claims will be paid to creditors before others which means that some of lower priority may not be paid at all3 and some may not be discharged in bankruptcy which means that the creditor can continue to attempt to collect from the debtor after the bankruptcy proceeding4 but bankruptcy law does not and neve r has made major substantive or procedural distinctions based on why the debtor files although there have been many studies of the reasons that people file in bankruptcy most of necessity extrapolate from limited data nonetheless regardless of the integrity of such studies it may not be clear how general survey of bankruptcy schedules and filings and debtor interviews will account for the aftermath of catastrophic though geographically limited natural disasters an informal review by bankruptcy law professor suggests that there may be strong statistical link between hurricanes and bankruptcy filings5 yet accepting common sense assumption that economic catastrophe results in more bankruptcy filings still does not teach exactly what kind of bankruptcy law changes ma be desirable to accommoda the affected population for example during debate over the bapcpa researchers released report suggesting that many individuals file in bankruptcy to deal with unmanageablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33082crs3 6 for more background on this issue see crs report rs22096 treatment of

were in response to economic hardship see eg 2 stat 19 april 4 1800 5 stat 440 august 19 1841 14 stat 517 march 2 1867 8 pl 98598 as amended 9 see hrept 10931 part i 109th cong 1st sess 2 2005 bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005medical expenses6 some argued that debtor who has incurred high medical expenses should receive diffe rent treatment under the bankr uptcy law but pre and postbapcpa bankruptcy law remains neutral with respect to why the debtor is filing the law sets forth program that specifies the manner and extent to which debts are to be paid or discharged indeed there are many challenges to determining what particular needs may or may not be unique to hurricane victims some assume that filings will occur shortly after the crisis when homes are destroyed and jobs lost others believe that filings will peak after several years when individua ls try to rebuild their lives and encounter obstacles such as lower paying jobs or chronic medical problem s many victims may not return to their homes in the stricken areas but will start their lives over in new locales and for many others the obstacle may not be complete lack of resources some individuals will have adequate insurance to cover their property losses and jobs to return to but the length and scope of the disruption to their lives may present their own unique financial hardships tailoring bankruptcy law to the underlyi ng causes of bankruptcy is perhaps not achievable because individual finances ar so factspecific bankruptcy law deals only with process but historically in times in financial crisis like the depression economic relief was facilitated by legislation permitting some manner of bankruptcy filings7 and under the 1978 law financial reha bilitation of individuals was effected by expeditious access to chapters 7 and 13 the goals of the bapcpa under the bankruptcy reform act of 19788 congress created streamlined system for individuals to file under chapte r 7 over the years millions did the high number of individuals filing in bankruptcy led congress to perceive that bankruptcy relief was too easy to obtain and that debtors were abusing the process9 t h amendments effected by the bapcpa are signed to reverse that trend the law implements rules and procedur which are designed to reverse the perceived ease of filing to require that bankruptcy re lief be conditioned upon debtors dedicating portion of their postbankruptcy income to pay off their prebankruptcy debts and to limit the amount of debt that may be forgiv however the approach the new law takes is without precedent in the administra tion of the bankruptcy laws of the united states because there is empirical or experiential data to evaluate this new approach to debt repayment many have questioned whet her it is flexible enough tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33082crs4 10 11 usc 523a2cii this provision is amended by the bapcpa to be more favorable to creditors

of hurricane katrina indeed all natural disasters may find themselves some believe that it may be desirable to adapt many preexisting and new substantive and procedural requirements to disaster victims identifiable needs the bapcpa is an extremely lengthy complicated and technical overhaul of bankruptcy practice many of its provi sions will undoubtedly be of assistance to debtors such as the clarification of the treatment of retiremen t funds in individual retirement accounts or th treatment of money in educational savings accounts which are protected from creditors loans that debtor may ta ke from his or her pension plan may be repaid despite bankruptcy filing others may pose challenges sampling of these issues and their implications for katrina victims are considered below burden of proof in furtherance of the policy of making chapter 7 filings more difficult to obtain the bapcpa imposes significantly higher burden of legal and ev identiary proof for prospective debtors in numerous contexts basic example of this shift is the amendment of 11 usc 707 governing dismi ssal of chapter 7 case under the law which went into effect on october 17 2005 when bankruptcy judges considers whether to dismiss chapter 7 case for abuse there shall be presumption in favor of granting the relief requested by the debtor that presumption is omitted in the bapcpa and is replaced by the presumpti on embodied in the means test that debtor who can theoretically pay 100 m onth towards unsecured debts is abusing chapter 7 and must reorganize under chapter 13 burdens of proof and legal presumpti ons are important elements of the bankruptcy process additional examples of presumptions are those involved in the dischargeability of debt use of credit card to obtain cash advances totaling more that 750 obtained within 70 days of the bankruptcy filing is presumed fraudulent and nondischargeable10 likewise under prebapcpa and current law all student loans are nondischargeable unless btor can prove undue hardship11 these presumptions and burdens do not preclude debtor from receiving bankruptcy relief but they increase the costs evidentiary proof necessary and in many instances the uncertainty of obtaining debt forgiveness it is conceivable that standards on presumed abuse prospective income an d hardship may be difficult to apply to persons unexpectedly displaced for extended periods limitations on debt forgiveness as stated above bankruptcy deals with two types of debts secured and unsecured with respect to unsecured debt those that cannot be forgiven arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33082crs5 12 for more background on features of the ba pcpa including nondischargeable debt see crs report rl32765 the bankruptcy abuse preventi on and consumer protection

charge for property of that kind considering th age and condition of the property at the time value is determined 16 id at 1325nondischargeable the bapcpa broadens the categories of nondischargeable debt12 another example of nondischargeable debt that may have special impact on hurricane victims is that governing condo minium andor cooperative fees13 under pre bapcpa law condominium fee due after the bankruptcy filing was nondischargeable so long as the debtor c ontinued to physically occupy the dwelling under the new law such fees are nondischarg eable for as long as the debtor has legal equitable or possessory ownership in the property the new law also makes major limitations to the debt forgiveness permitted for secured debt to simplify the process in order for debtor to keep possession of collateral secured creditor must receive an amount that represents its value secured creditor is secured only to the va lue of the collateral and unsecured for any amount which may be owed but is gr eater than the collaterals value valuing collateral however is quite co mplicated although the yardstick for the collaterals value is generally market value determining what that standard actually means has been subject to litigation and judicial interpretation over the years different courts have allo wed debtors to value collateral hence what they owe secured creditors by such standards as w holesale value foreclosure value market value minus the costs to the creditor of foreclosing on the property and reselling it and replacement value14 the bapcpa however amends the code by requiring debtors to pay the highest possible amount to secured creditors for property acquired for personal family or househol d use that is retail value15 in some cases under chapter 13 the debtor will have to pay th purchase price for car or other item regardless of its replacement or retail value16 usually the debtor who repays secured creditor continues to enjoy use of the collateral it is not clear how these changes may apply in case of debtor whose personal property has been destroyed in whole or in part and whose insurance c overage if any may not be soon resolved the new law how flexible is it the means test is intended to ensure that those who can pay their debts from future income do so it sets forth co mplicated formula to measure income versus expenses if the formula indicates that the debtor can pay 100 month towards unsecured debts the presumption of abuse may still be rebutted by demonstratinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33082crs6 17 11 usc 707b2bi provides in pa rtthe presumption of abuse may only be rebutted by demonstrating special circumstance s such as serious medical condition or call or order to active duty in the armed forces to the extent such special circumstances that justify additional expenses or adjustment s of current monthly income for which there is reasonable alternative 18 see geri dreiling bankruptcy law may add to katri na victims woes

11 usc 109hspecial circumstances17 however to demonstrate the circumstances and indeed the destruction wrought by hurricane katrina would seem to be unique circumstance debtor shall be requi red to itemize each additional expense or adjustment of income and provide documentation and tailed explanations therefore under oath because the statutor language is mandato ry it is unclear to what extent if any the court will have discretion to waive that requirement for individuals whose financial r ecords have been destroyed18 and it may be problematic to predict future income and expenses for persons uprooted for an undetermined period the only category of debtor who is exempted entirely from the rigors of the means test on basis other than income are disabled veterans whose bankruptcy indebtedness occurs primarily during period when he or she was on active duty or performing homeland defense activity19 although not explicit this exemption suggests that presumption of abuse will apply to all debtors other than specified disabled veterans veterans may benefit implicitly from the presumption in favor of relief that was omitted by the bapcpa another provision that may appear to lack flexibility involves prebankruptcy credit counseling in orde r to file debtor must undergo credit counseling within 180 days before filing many may argue th at such jurisdictional requirement should not apply when the need for financial relief is the result of natu ral disaster although others may feel that it is beneficial regardless of the reason for filing debtor may plead exigent circumstances that merit waiver of the counseling requirement but in case may the waiver extend be yond 45 days after filing complete exemption from the counseling requireme nt will only exist for those unable to receive counseling because of incapacity disability or active military duty in military combat zone20 new and complicated domiciliary requirements for bankruptcy exemptions are

new responsibilities of the court th department of justice and trustees under the means test and other provisions of the law23 second and far more importa ntly bankruptcy attorneys have new investigatory responsibilities under the law under the ba pcpa signature by an attorney on bankruptcy petition constitutes certification that the attorney has performed reasonable investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to the filing and has determined that the information provided is well grounded in fact and warranted by existing law24 attorneys who fail to perform th is new responsibility risk sanctions the duty to verify the accuracy of client information will add time and expense to the task of debtor representation25 this task may be complicated by the hurricane disaster scenario many debtors may have little to documenta tion to support their financ ial hardship assertions and unfortunately disaster can be acco mpanied by those who attempt to take wrongful advantage of it26 therefore just as the timing and locale of future filings by disaster victims is unknown so to is th extent to which bankruptcy attorneys will be willing and able to ta ke

increase because bankruptcy judg trustees attorneys and professionals have body of law to guide them in interpreting the new legal requirements scholars attempting to explain the new w to practitioners acknowledge that many issues need to be fleshed out one exampl is the interaction between chapters 7 and 13 indeed the greatest impact of the new law will be not on those who will continue to qualify under the means test as asset chapter 7 btors but on those who are subject to mandatory chapter 13 reorgani zation will debtors who do not qualify for chapter 7 be able to complete chapter 13 reorganization the question is posed there are as many factual scenarios as there are potential debtors and how the means test plays out in actual practice rema ins to be seen but its results clearly do not equate to what may be required of the same debtor in chapter 13 plan it is entirely possible that debtor may be forced into chapter 13 plan due to failing the means test and then be ble to obtain confir mation of plan27 the confluence of new stricter bankruptcy regime being implemented simultaneously with nati onal economic disaster may be unprecedented it may complicate the task of reconciling new bankruptcy procedures designed to limit access to chapter 7 with the new and as yet unidentified particularized needs of the hurricane victims small business reorganization small business entrepreneur s often use credit card loans to fund their business activities as individuals they coul d reorganize under chapter 13 if their indebtedness fell within the chapters jurisdictional limits28 it is increasingly unlikely that they will be able to do so under chapter 13 as amended by the bapcpa because of the new schedules for determining disposable income29 congress has amended chapter 11 dea ling with business reorganization to implement special streamlined provisions for small business defined as one with indebtedness under 200000030 although new more flexible confirmation procedures for small business exist31 there are also new more onerous reporting requirements debtor mu st provide reasonable approx imations of projected cash receipts and disbursements

that access to chapter 7 debt forgiveness has been widely abused to the extent that the congress has rejected the notion of easy access for all to chapter 7 some may advocate new approach to ba
