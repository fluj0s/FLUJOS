communities or norcs are generally defined as communities with large proportion of older persons residing within specified geographic area norcs differ from purposebuilt housing for the elderly such as assisted living facilities or board and care homes in that norc residences were not desi gned with the provision of services to older persons in mind as result seniors and community providers in some norcs have sought opportunities to make recreational health and social services more widely available to older residents in doing so partnerships between these providers and with housing managers have resulted in alternative models of health and social services delivery through norc supportive services programs ssps the goal of norcssp is to provide coordinated array of services and programs that meet both the needs and preferences of the older residents in the norc services may include case management health care management and prevention activities recreational activities transportation and volunteer opportunities for older residents among other things in theory norcssps allow health and social service providers to take advantage of economies of scale within the community in order to target hom and communitybased services toward older individuals in need of assistance and potentially at risk for institutional placement congressional interest in norcssps began in 2002 when house and senate appropriations legislation included committee recommendations for number of projects to provide supportive services programs to older individuals residing in norcs between fy2002 and fy2005 the administration on aging aoa provided combined 214 million in grant funding from older americans act oaa title iv research and dem onstration appropriations these funds assisted in financing total of 41 norc supportive services projects across 25 states given that the demographic pressure of an aging population is likely to continue to increase demand for health and social services among the older population congress will face decision as to whether to expand the role of the federal government in funding these services to older adults policymakers may want to consider funding alternative models of health and social services delivery that target services to older residents in home and communitybased settings such as norcssps in order to assist congress in policy considerations

naturally occurring retirement communities norcscommunities with large proportion of older people residing within defined geographic areaare becoming increasingly identifiable as the us population ages while research shows that individuals prefer to remain in their own homes as they age often they need additional assistance to maintain their independence1 and as the risk of accidentrelated injury such as falls or chronic illness increases with advancing age some older residents may require disabilityrelated services and supports to assist them in their homes with longterm care needs norcs differ from purposebuilt housing for the elderly eg assisted living facilities or board and care homes in that they were not designed with the provision of services to older persons in mind rather these communities have large proportion of older residents due to aginginplace and migration the term aginginplace refers to individuals who have resided in their homes independently for several decades and now may need variety of supportive services to assist them to continue to do so migration may lead to an older resident demographic as result of older persons moving into the community or younger residents leaving the community in many of these communities older residents and health and social services providers have sought opportunities to make social recreational and preventive health services more widely available as result partnerships between these entities as well as with housing managers have resulted in alternative models of health and social services delivery through socalled norc supportive services programs ssps research conducted by brandeis university found that interest in programs supporting norcs is increasi ng findings from the same study indicated that norcssps may provide opportunities for costefficient health and supportive services delivery increased service availability health promotion and crisis intervention and community improvement activities 2 the federal government through the administrati on on aging aoa first provided funding for norcssps in fy2002 however since fy2005 the aoa has provided grant funding with the reauthorization of the older americans act oaa in 2006 pl 109365 congress required the assistant secretary of aging to award funds to carry out model aginginplace projects including norcssps under the community innovations for aging in place initiative funding for norcssps under this broader initiative is contingent on future appropriations the demographic pressure of an aging population is likely to increase demand for health and social services among the elderly as result policymakers may want to consider expanding the federal governments role in funding alternative models for delivering home and communitybased services such as norcssps that target health and social services to older residents in communitybased settings with regard to future funding of norcssps congress may wish to consider several issues including determining whether or not services should be targeted at the frail or those with lowincome or available to all older norc residents establishing program 1 aarp the

ecology university of wisconsinmadison in the mid1980s3 the norc concept refers to geographically defined community with large proportion of older persons norcs are distinguished from planned housing communities with high concentrations of older residents such as senior retirement communities or assisted living communities in that they are naturally occurring that is norcs were not designed specifically as community for older residents but rather evolved that way over time norcs have large proportion of older reside nts for variety of reasons norcs may have older longterm residents that have lived in their own homes independently for many years some norcs may have developed as younger residents left while older residents remained resulting in an older resident demographic other norcs ma have developed through an influx of older residents migrating to the community norcs possess range of geographic and demographic characteristics they may be concentrated in one or more buildings within close proximity to each other eg an apartment or condominium complex or comprised of housing that is more widely dispersed eg neighborhood of singlefamily homes or rural community norc residents may live alone or they may live with others such as spouse other family members or friends while norcs are identified by large proportion of older residents these communities include residents of all ages some older norc residents are active and healthy while others face the challenges of declining health and mobility and while researchers agree that norcs have significant proportion of older people residing in specific geographic area there is agreement on what constitutes significant proportion or the age criteria for inclusion ie age 55 and older 60 and older or 65 and older 4 under federal statute the oaa amendments of 2006 pl 109365 included language defining the term naturally occurring retirement community to mean 3 michael hunt and gail gunterhunt naturally

individuals which may include residential building housing complex an area including rural area of single family residences or neighborhood composed of ageintegrated housingwhere 40 percent of the heads of households are older individuals or critical mass of older individuals exists based on local factors that taken in total allow an organization to achieve efficiencies in the provision of health and social services to older individuals living in the community and that is not an institutional care or assisted living setting 5 for purposes of the oaa older individual is defined as person age 60 and older however oaas norc definition does not clarify who decides whether there is critical mass of older individuals and whether the decision is driven by data or general observation the lack of uniform definition and vague criteria for determining norc geographic boundaries makes it difficult for researchers to estimat how many norcs exist and how many older residents live in these communities across the united states one survey conducted by aarp asked respondents living in nonage restricted co mmunities whether most individuals age 50 and older had lived in their community for many years and whether the majority of neighbors were age 55 and older the survey reported that 36 of seniors indicated they live in such communities which could be defined as norcs 6 however according to aarp this is much higher estimate than other surveys aarp analysis of the 2003 american housing survey estimated that 17 of households with indivi duals 55 and older were in nonage restricted community where most neighbors were also age 55 and older7

program ssp m odel developed in the mid1980s through collaborative effort between new york city residents living in the penn south houses cooperative housing developing with about 3000 units and over 6000 residents and the uja federation of new york at the time more than 75 of penn south residents were age 60 and older and many were experiencing the financial housing and healthrelated challenges often associated with advancing age 8 as result the cooperative formed committee which partnered with several public and nonprofit agencies to provide social services to penn south residents thus the experiences of penn south houses became model for other norcs in the mid1990s the new york state legislature approved an initiative to finance and support norcssps similar legislation was also passed in new york city with the introduction of state and local funding number of new norcssps in new york state and new york city were created in 2002 the norcssp model was expanded to five sites across the country in part due to efforts by the united jewish communities which established the norcs aging in place initiative and grants funded through the us department of health and human services hhs

and city funding and 41 norcssps in 25 states that received federal funding through aoa10 embedded in the philosophy of the norcssp model of service delivery is community empowerment and engagement the goal of the nor cssp is to create communities where older individuals can maintain their independence and lead healthy and productive quality of life as they age in place that is as residents grow older in the community and as their needs evolve over time the types of communitybased supports and services change in response to individuals needs norcssps promote independence and healthy aging through engaging older residents before crisis by responding to residents needs unlike other publicly financed programs participation in the norcssp is based on resident status rather than functional or economic criteria11 norcssps typically are collaborative partnerships between public and private entities including residents government housing managers and owners local health and social services organizations and philanthropies these public and private entities come together to create coordinated array of services and programs that meet both the needs and preferences of the residents in the norc according to the unit ed jewish communities there are four main categories of potential norcssp services case management case assistance and social work services health care management and health care assistance including disease prevention and health promotion education socialization and recreational activities and v olunteer opportunities for project participants and other interested community members12 other services that norcssps may offer include assessment and referral services nutrition education or meals programs and transportation among other things in theory norcssps allow health and social service providers to take advantage of economies of scale within the community in order to efficiently target home and communitybased services toward older individuals in need of

the next few decades the older population is expected to grow dramatically between 2005 and 2010 the population age 65 and older is expected to increase 10 from 37 million to 40 million and then by an additional 36 to 55 million by 2020 the us census bureau projects that in 2030 the us population will have an estimated 72 million older americans more than twice as many as the number estimated in 2000 17 this increase is in part due to longer life expectancies and the aging of the baby boom generation not surprisingly most older americans desire to remain in their homes for as long as possible according to survey conducted by aarp the va st majority 84 of individuals age 50 and over want to remain in their current residences this desire increases substantially by age with 91 of persons 65 to 74 and 95 of persons 75 and older expressing the desire to remain living in their own homes 18 as the older population continues to increase both in size and as proportion of the total us population and as individuals continue to live long er postretirement the demographic pressure of an aging population is likely to increase demand for health and social services congress will face decision as to whether to expand the role of the federal government in funding these services to older adults living in home and communitybased settings if congress chooses to expand the federal governments role one program model they might consider is norcssps this section briefly describes some issues for congress to consider with respect to expanding federal funding of norcssps these issues include program eligibility sustainable program funding implementing program standards and outcomes measures and areas for further research 17 federal interagency forum on agingrelated

eligible for benefits or services based on certain demographic income andor functional criteria often measured as one or more limitations with activities of daily living adls19 unlike these types of programs services within norcssps are available to all older residents living in the community not just those who are aged frail or economically disadvantaged one issue for congress is whether or not federal funding to norcssps should assist more affluent communities or individuals while some believe that eligibility for federal funds should be targeted to needy individuals others believe there are public benefits derived from targeting funds more broadly at the local level whereby communities can best address individual need through partnerships with key stakeholders eg residents housing managers and health and social service providers these partnerships in turn can address issues affecting norc residents at the local and community levels many of these initiatives may also benefit the public atlarge by fostering economic development building accessible and affordable housing for the frail elderly and other persons with disabilities and improving public transportation services including active older adults in norcssps provides opportunities for civic engagement and community leadership as well as increasing awareness of available community services moreover offering services and supports to those who are lowincome but not necessarily eligible for public assistance may prevent or delay individuals from spending down their own assets to qualify for public programs or benefits thus potentially reducing demand for public assistance or forestalling unnecessary institutionalization

developing program standards so that all programs meet certain identified goals or specified outcomes measures program outcomes may take into account both the shortterm and longterm outcomes of norcssps for example supportive services programs may meet residents immediate needs by addressing social isolation depression or assistance with personal care transportation or housework over the longterm the norcssps will ideally become trusted resource for residents and families to turn to in crisis in addition to building awareness about what community services are available to help residents live independently outcomes measurement may need to look beyond tracking program participation to better understand reasons for non participation data on nonparticipation may be an indicator of vulnerable older adult population experiencing social isolation establishing specific program standards and outcome measures may also assist congress in ensuring that funding for norcssps is targeted to specific groups for specific purposes and outcomes can be measured over time such standards may also ensure norc program services are not duplicative at the federal level several programs exist to provide social and healthrelated services to individuals in home and communitybased settings they include separate 19 activities of daily living generally refer to the following activities

relation to other public and private financing according to research on norc ssps for the hhs assistant secretary for planning and evaluation aspe the challenge as with many supportive services programs is finding the right privatepublicphilanthropic resource mix and the right balance among individual community and societal obligations 20 while congress has shown interest in funding norcssps funding has been limited to oaa title iv grants which fund temporary research nd demonstration initiatives local dollars were also used to supplement the federal grants each site that received norcssp federal grant provided match of 1 local dollar for every 3 federal dollars 21 however since fy2005 aoa has not awarded grants for these programs one challenge for norcssps has been sustaining funding over time some norcssps have relied on other public and private funding sources such as state and local governments residents housing management community organizations and philanthropies many of these funding sources may also be temporary other norcs unable to financially sustain their programs have ceased to provide services 22 norcssps are continuing to experiment with generating internal sources of funding through membership fees resident activity fees building management fees and cooperative fees while internal funding may be necessary source for program sustainability norcssps may want to ensure services remain available to all residents so that fees dont place an undue financial burden on those with limited means

best practices for implementing norcssp or to offer technical assistance to grantees research might focus on efforts to apply the norcssp model to hardtoserve areas such as rural communities and other lessdensely populated areas further research could explore the geographic characteristics necessary for successful norcssp implementation in terms of community identity and size population density and local infrastructure research that utilizes data sources such as the us census to define norcs geographic boundary and characteristics of its resident population may assist in establishing more uniform definition of norcs along with the ability to target federal funds toward vulnerable populations 20 ormond et supportive service programs 2004 21 ibid 22 testimony of joyce garver keller in us
