auditing skills for r3r lecture given on 10 july 1963 thank you well this is what audience the 10th the 9th the 10th this is the 10th of july ad 13 saint hill special briefing course i have lecture today on r3r and 3n but before we get onto thesethese technical matters its remarkable world were living in very remarkable world how can anything be as idiotic at some lines and places as they can be is quite marvelous i have banker today who is arguing with and the only thing i could make out of ithes just arguing with vociferously not to reduce any loans i have with the bank or reduce overdrafts and hes trying to make realize that hesi dont need any overdraft account since hes perfectly willing to extend all the overdrafts that i possibly want anyplace and notplease not reduce my loan account you see it was quite remarkable this is scientology creditwise apparently has arrived marvelous never had it happen to before please owe us money dr hubbard its very funny you know at the times when you need this money theyre never in that frame of mind you know never in that frame of mind but when you get to point where you dont need any money you see youve got everything taped in all directions and so forth they couldnt be so liberal marvelous isnt it its the law of supply and demanddemand and supply anyway you are confronting some horrible facts today talking about r3r youre confronting some horrible facts i have some very bad news for you very difficult for to impart this to you and so on but we have the exact number of skills necessary to make an ot thatsim sorry to have to tell you thatthis because they are not simple skills and that is the bad news that is the bad news they are not simple skills and they are numerous now i brought the bulletin out yesterday which is being run off today in order to talk to you from my notes but following in my tradition of having notes and so forthi brought the bulletins i dont need today and the ones that i had yesterday which i should have today you seethats being run off so i dont have it today the number of skillsthe number of skills which you have to master in order to make an ot are numerous and im not going to go into list of these because youll shortly have it in hcob i think 8 july or 9 july but these skills are going to make you gasp little bit when you first look at them unless i give you good piece of news and that is that they break down to about five skills which you have been taught for long time and which unfortunately you have to have perfect and those skills are the ability to follow an auditing cyclecan you give an auditing cycle that auditing cycle is quite important and the next one is can you give it repetitively can you repeat yourself thats quite important too thats special skill you see you could sit down and give one auditing cycle but can you give the next auditing cycle and the next auditing cycle and the next auditing cycle now you say that isnt very hard years ago we had to master that one so weve got that one taped got that one taped and the next one is to read meter and i do mean read meter you have to be able to read meterand do very well with meter next one is you have to be able to read understand and follow the procedure of bulletin that is training skill all by itself the last one is somewhat debatable and i dont know what i said in the bulletin on the last one but its something on the order of keep pc in session handle model session and those actually are the basic skillsthose are the basic skills that we go down to and any time now hear hear now any time that you find an auditor unable to handle one of these upper procedures you look back at those five i just gave you and there is something wrong with those five this character just cant seem to run something like r3r or 3n just cant seem to handle it cant seem to handle 2h cant seem to cut it you know just cant seem to do anything with the pc in cchs just cant seem to and you look back at that small list i have just given you and you will find that the fault lies there the fault does not lie in the complexity of the skill now i give you this with great great margin of warning on this because this is whether you can train people or not train people this is whether you personally as an auditing supervisor can get auditing done or not get it done completely aside from getting result on the case that you are doing when you see an auditor who is getting results and youve told him to run technique z and he just cant seem to cut it youre just going to break your heart if you then get ahold of technique z and wrap it around his head and expostulate and scream and pound the desk and shove technique z at him and technique z at him and technique z at him and then send him back into an auditing room to audit technique z and youre going to get hash and then youre going to conclude that technique z doesnt work but you have followed the wrong procedure i dont say dont teach him technique zbut if you have to get very extreme in teaching him technique z or if theres anything hard about teaching him technique z it isnt technique z that you are up against you are up against the five i just gave you one or more of those is as wrong as khrushchev thats awry it is awry man now do you understand what i mean when i tell you that amount of persuasion is going to take an auditor who cant do these basic skills and make him do complicated skill now amount of persuasion on an upper level or complex technologyno amount of persuasion is going to overcome these basic technologies the difficulties which youre up against are the difficulties of basic skills now you like to think sometime that youre up against case level to some degree that is true but all case level does is make it harder for you to teach the basic skills it does not make it impossible for you to teach the basic skills and if you ever proceed on the basis that case level makes it impossible for you to teach the basic skills then you are going to lose youre not going to lose on just one person youre going to start losing on pc after pc after pc after pc ive had the most remarkable people audit my belief in their ability to audit amounted to more than their case level ive had girl who was mostly throbbing away at the lower lip as she gazed out the windowpane fixedly most of her life headed at pc and now you can do this see and so on oh can i maybe i can and they go ahead and ive had her go ahead and turn in job oh yeah you had to keep your eye on it that gives you slightly different look at training you see you get so involved with q and on training that you cant train and the q and is this the guy is saying i cant and so you q anda and say okay you cant thats q and on the part of an instructor look if he cant hes awful wrong if you make him do it you make him right and this is one of the few instances where that is the case he becomes right if he can do this and its only his aberration that youre qingandaing with if you say he cant i know this is very extreme view but i have recently begun to look on it not as an extreme view of just because we couldnt do otherwise which is what ive said beforeive become to look at it as fact its fact i dont care what the case level is discount it as far as the auditor is concerned the lower the case level the more horrible time hell have all right but he can get auditing done the more brutal itll be to face up to session the more horrible it is to face up to the arc breaks the more worry there is between sessionoh my god what am i doing ive already ruined him look at there hes got cold and and hes all caved oh oh ho and oh oh all right thatsaspect of auditing multipliesbut it doesnt forbid it now the moment you let the door open on aberration forbids it youve let the door open on auditing must occur oh yes because look at the reductio ad absurdum of all this only ots can audit where does that leave you it leaves you with ots to audit every once in while you get it going in an academy do you know that you darentyou darent let d of p or d of t either one d of p of course can say we cant audit this person because the person has an insane history or is illegal or something like that but we cant let them get too extreme on who they accept for processing or training but particularly the d of t the d of t honest must never be permitted to refuse student aw that lets some awful things occur in academies it makes the job an awful headache but immediately that you say this student cant be admitted to the academy then we upgrade our classification of who can study scientology and then we upgrade our classification casewise seeand only this case level and then only this case level can study and wuuhh and theres all of sudden nobody in the academy and nobody learning how to do anything and look ive seen it happen ive sat right there and watched it happen and ive taken the very people that they said couldnt auditsometimes with malice aforethought and made them turn in an auditing session oh brother it takes some doing as your instructors can sometimes tell you here they probably could expound on this at some rate but the truth of the matter is its q and this guys aberrations are saying you cant so the moment that the instructor says all right you cant the instructor is then qingandaing with the reactive bank of the student and the students ability deteriorates at square the like of which id hate to see its quite remarkable how fast this will occur now one time i remember one memorable accin the last week and half i decided that results had taken place in this acc to amount to anything so i just went around and all the auditors sitting there and auditing pcs and so forth each unit as they flipflopped and so onand i said do soandso and soand so and i said you can do it all right and gave them very complex technology to go ahead and do but i told them they could do it i didnt tell them they couldnt do it and they brought off some remarkable results and all the auditing results that occurred in that acc occurred in the last week and half it was on the basis of you can do it and the guy said oh i cant do it it worries so much and so forth but youre standing here youre not auditing now go on back and audit its quite remarkable you see i myself know all about your qualms and horrors and jitters on the subject of taking apart somebodys head i know all about these things ive held my breath more often than you ever will and i can sympathize with you but its something you can get over and i have seen auditors who couldnt audit at all couldnt follow an auditing cycle just had to qand and so forthtook while but they eventually got to point said you know hey i mustnt qanda this way nearly all of my trouble is in this auditing cycle nearly all of my trouble is right here in this auditing cycle every time the pc opens his face why i do what he says in some particular fashion or i question his answer or something like this and im just going from bad to worse i never stick to procedure you know crash great big exclamation point occurs in the sky like they do over comic strip characters you know you know hey you know i shouldnt do that and he wakes up to it and he starts right on the situation therefore it takes some little longer to get these basics down than others now all the training that has been given in recent years is pointed toward those basics so training is lost and it takes you while to learn to shift gears with shifting technology and that sort of thing but you will find good news in this nearly all of the things which you have learned how to do now have their place in scientology and if youve learned how to do these thingsif under some different procedure name and so forthwell you re that much further ahead when we get down to complex technology such as routine 3r its complex technology now you join 3r up to 3n and run them all on the same team all with the same reins and my god onearmed paperhanger with the hives isnt going to couldnt be in any worse shape than this youll only get into bad shape if while youre trying to do this complex technology you havent learned which side of you the emeter goes on dont you see while youre doing this complex technology all of your weaknesses in the other five show up if youre still busy qingandaing 3r3 can get you intoi mean r3r can get you into more difficulty in less time q and isnt just an innocent accident that can be passed over and cleaned up in 3r it can be catastrophe it wont kill the pc you can recover the session but boy its that whole session is gone now why because hes particularly vulnerable its what you qand on you say all right let give you an actual instance actual instance you say all right now were going to date this implant pc says well ive got the picture right here why dont you take the date of the picture all right what is the date of the picture is it less than greater than_______ an hour later the whole bank goes into grouper reality goes by the boards the pc explodes and his skull flies in pieces through the ceiling well that was an innocent q and wasnt it the pc just offered up the engram in muddy sort of way and thought it was the implant but the auditor said that 6d been looking for an implant there and he never dated the implant and some fourthousand trilliontrillion years intervened between the picture the pc had and the implant the auditor wanted to date so he was running the implant with date error of fourthousand trillion trillion years quite an interesting date error isnt it dont you suppose that wouldnt tend to group up some bank well i think thats very interesting and yet that isnt much of q and dont you see see im not even berating that particular accident you have to be very slippy about this sort of thing you see well the auditor just doesnt make his own intention stick in the session which is the basic reashow things happen in q and hes trying to locate the date of an implant and the pc gives him an engram which is on an entirely different chain but which he thinks muddily is the implant and then the auditor says well to make the pc happy why well just say well thats the engram pc says he has it so we just qanda about the whole thing in other words the auditor doesnt carry out his intention originally of dating the implant he was looking for in the first place all he had to do was simply carry out the intention he started with in the first place and he would have been all right dont you see but his tendency to become the effect of the pc slips his gears see and he just gets into cross eyed situation where he has business being now carry out an auditing cyclecarry out repetitive auditing cycle lets look at how this influences it the auditor says im going to date this implant you see this is carrying out an auditing cycle you might not look at this as being an auditing cycle but it is im going to date this implant now and the pc says i have an engram here which i have been looking at which is the implant and the auditor never gets his question answered which understood the question is when is this implant he gets when is this engram do you see how that is in other words he intends something and he never gets it answered he wants to know when is the implant see matter if he has to go over the meter and do lot of things in order to determine this thing this is still his auditing question and the pc says its picture so he dates the picture and he never finishes off his auditing cycle and then couple of hours later youre still picking up the pieces scattered around the room and you wonder what the hell happened well frankly nothing happened to r3r at all the error was not r3r error the error is that the auditor wanted and knew he had to get the date of certain implant and he didnt get it elementary my dear watson isnt it you want to know what happened to the auditing session well whatever else might have occurred as an error in the auditing sessionyou could be very technical about all thisthe auditors question when is this implant is answered by here is an engram get its date and these things can slide by so innocently that you cant even recognize them as q and too delicate you say well ive got to take the pcs data you can say muttonheadedly well youve got to take the pcs data all right the pc says this was the engram in which the implant occurred well he didnt actually in this case say that but even if the pc said that the auditor has to choose between invalidating the pc and getting his data straight and all this sort of thing you get into judgment you get into an involvement of one kind or another you say well all thats very complicated it is not very complicated because never at any time did the auditor ask if it was the date of the implant in other words you just derail the whole procedure he started running routine 3r now heres whats amusing about this anecdote is the auditor wasnt running mr but 3n and mysteriously found himself runningor found it in progressmr and did the arc break assessment on 3n but was in actual fact doing r3r now look at that as further complication now you wonder where we are here i notice you all looking very puzzled well an implant is an engram and the auditor in this case went to the lengths of getting the date and duration of an engram which had nothing whatsoever to do with the implant you dont get durations of implants ninety percent of the time you dont even have to bother getting their dates and if the auditor had just omitted dating this implant everything would have run off like welloiled dream because they knew what chain of implants they were looking for and the sessionto be very factual with youwas actually 3n session and they found themselves doing r3r now how involved do you think that can get well how do you possibly differentiate between these two things its horrible well i might have added to the five to run the process theyre running but i consider that inherent in the auditing cycle you get the level of error this is the only thing im trying to get across to youthe level of error is all very very stupidly elementary always youre really not getting into errors which have anything whatsoever to do with r3r or 3n this auditor apparently has difficulty running the process which is started on and has tendency to weasel off into other processes that tendency existing then doesnt hold the line on very precise process this is not meant in spirit of criticism im just showing you something see start in running cchs see and then just kind of weasel off into reach and withdraw be the same thing wouldnt it all right well thats gross tendency that any of you could notice but how about the tendency ofcarried outno matter how faint this tendency is it still expresses itself in not adhering to procedure not starting and finishing an auditing cycle because an auditing cycle also includes completing the process you are running part of the auditing cycle thats the major auditing cycle you flatten the process youre running i want to make these points with you not in spirit of criticism or any derogation and i want to make these points with you for just this reason youre colliding with something which on the surface looks very complicated 3n and r3r look very complicated got all kinds of steps and has all about time track and have to list assess find right levels watch the ta like hawk and youre not going to have any trouble with those at all if you can do the basics of auditing actually it really isnt complicated if anything is wrong with mr its too idiotically simple we have here process which after all these years runs engrams by rote well thats fantastic but you cant run an engram by rote if you cant read and execute bulletin you say well oh yeah yeah well thats book one and so forth and i think there was something about implants in book one aw yeah well i understand implants all right idi implants and so forth we had technique one time we had pc sit down and he flowed the energy from the top of his head down around his shoulders and that must have been 3 oh yeah i guess thats 3n yeah very easy all right all right sit there and have the energy flow from both of your temples down over your shoulders yes well all right whats the matter you say theres kind of something going on well its all right just and so on pc says well itsthis is absolutably terrible dear ron i was running 3n the other day and it doesnt work aw your level of erroryour level of error is fantastic its never slight i never find these gross auditthats why you call them gross auditing errors because theyre never slightnever slight all right so somebody comes along and he does 3r3 and he dates these engrams and he gets these engrams all dated and so forth and the pc keeps getting groups of engrams and thinks hes running dubin and you say well study your 3r3 and do those steps better and learn how to move the pc on the time track better and dont get things confused the way youre confusing and moving the pc on the time track and the pc gets his engrams further grouped and hes arc breaking more often and you say now confound it study that bulletin study that bulletin learn to say move to the beginning of the incident and move through the incident to point so forth years later learn how to do that pc is getting worse and worse eyes getting black you see getting to look haggard crunched over you know starts withdrawing from life and you say well this 3r3 is pretty dangerous process look what it can do to somebody ah but ifnow heres what im tellingtelling you to do this you might not dois look into these basics with regard to this auditor look into the basics you may find something like cant read meter never has been able to read meter well let tell you the greatest crimes that you can pull and the only thing thatll give you any real trouble in r3r the only real trouble you will have will come from wrong date and wrong duration and that trouble is so far in advance and so high above any other trouble that you can have in doing r3r that it looks like the sun looking down upon some space fragments i mean the order of magnitude is absolutely fantastic meter reading the guy wasnt having any trouble with r3r he was having trouble with his meter he had some misconception with regard to meter his practice with regard to meters was bad or better than that he just didnt understand dating he couldnt ever use meter really on dating and he couldnt get his durations and so forth now look its very difficult for an expert meter reader to get the dates and durations of engrams or incidents or anything else you understand thats tough thats hard to do lets now add to that difficulty an inability to read meter now you see what i mean pc will never chop at you for moving him all over the time track unless youve already laid in the bypassed charge of wrong date or wrong duration because time is the single source of aberration wrong date wrong duration now when i say wrong date youve got this incident at 95 trillion years ago and its actually 949 trillion years ago thats not wrong date look for your gross errorsgross errors well this incident is 900 years ago and its really 945 trillion ah boy you start running errors in dates like that into r3r and boy that time track looks like an accordion after hot night in thein the polka parlor zzzzzzzzzzz you say whats this used to be time track the bypassed charge is fantastic youve missed the whole incident put it in the wrong place and then youll say well this pc is actually dubin pc because theyhere hes got this picture of going down to the growleror rushing down to the to the local corner saloon and getting growler for his old man seethis isthis is thethe whole incident next thing you know halfway down to the saloon he meets this dragon and finds himself mounted on horse and the pc will say well the old man must have had dts and i must have gotten some of his engrams and so forth and you run little bit further and you say wellwell lets see whats the scenery look like around there well i dont know like the 1890s or something like that and you say well 1890s lets redate this thing oh 1890 all right pc just said it so it ticks see you ever notice that you can pick date off the coach that the coach is thinking of well dating always will itll alwaysall the guy has got to do is said the date and youll get some tick on it hell say date and itfor an instant it flicks or you cant get date you dont have to do anything about it but he says 1890 and so on now this actually is true that pc does have the date and the right date does read but then he told you the date of the incident dont you see im saying well he just said the figures 1890 1890 will get faint vesperish tick itll only do one tick it wont do two ticks three ticks say all right its in 1890 well he getshe doesnt get the dragon anymore but he gets going up in this airplane you see to deliver the beer in an airplane and so forth but he says theres something wrong about this because there were airplanes in 1890 orville and wilbur didnt commit their crime until few years later so therefore theres something wrong with thisand the auditors in perfect agreement he says well this pcs running dub hes not running dub the auditor is running cant read meter thats whats the matter now you eventually get this all tangled untangled and you do an assessment and you find out you have wrong date or something and you find that this is 945 trillion years and he did go down to the saloon to get his old man some beer but halfway there the atom bomb hit and you get complete incident and it all unrolls and its all fine pcs happy with it and it reduces and so forth you might say that dubin case is only somebody thats got his dates mixed up you could probably cure case of dubin just by accurately dating start into this lifetime and keep going back and just date date date and you probably could close up case that was doing dub because the only time you get time track closure and other things happening and so forth is when you have wrong dates now thats very important then isnt it lets take look at this wrong duration nothing drives pc battier than to have wrong duration you say all right this incident is two days long its actually trillion years long he tries in vain to find the beginning of the incident he cant because hes looking at something that happens two days before so it stays all black and gruesome and he cant make sense out of it and hes all anaten and that sort of thing well after whilebecause whenever you get this phenomenon you re duration that is the ruleif you have any trouble and you cant find the beginning of an incidentthis is what made r3r i havent released this by the way before this moment but what made r3r workable is this datum that pc has perception on any incident that is properly dated and durationed thats the most important factor weve learned in many year theres where perceptics lie now theres only three reasons why he doesnt have perception on the incident that youre trying to run there are only three reasons you have the wrong date or the wrong duration or its got gpm in it and those are the only three things that can close an engram out so the pc cant run it now you can add another thing to it and actually that doesnt close out his perceptions and it becomes very junior but you can add this other thing to it just for fun and you could say its wrong assessment but all that does is give you ta action or the chain youre running has vanished youve flattened the chain you are running once more you wont be able to assesspardon youve got wrong assessment and youre now running him on the wrong chain the chain he was running is flat but that all represents itself in tone arm action and actually doesnt really always express itself in nonperception the whole secret of perceptionthe secret of perception in an engram is right chain right date right duration equals perception period every time man and the only thing that can get in the road of that thing is gpm and you pass the pc through it onceand because he resisted all the way through ithe had lot of black energy in there you see the black energy goes up bzzzzand of course obscures the incident i found the other day an engram that had gpm in it i didnt know it had gpm in it before i ran the pc through it couple of times it registered and then didnt register that it had gpm in itso i said well well just run the pc through it and i didnt really know that the thing had gpm into it until the lights in tunnel went out moment before there had been lights in this tunnel but now this time through theres lights in the tunnel so the old maestro knew at once that we had rekindled those items and made the black energy off of the items go bzzzzzt and of course it put out the lights so i got the incidents i got the took the pc to the first pair of items and it was wildcat gpm and youve got to learn how to run those thats another skill you have to learn haha sorry but the basic ones and the real tough ones weve got them clear back to the beginning of time we know their patterns all the way back i havent released them completely but actually the april 17th bulletin covers some vast period of time thats the gorilla implants and the bear implants and they cover vast vast period of timetrillions of trillions of years and that only changed just once they dropped couple of items out of it in the middle of all of this otherwise weve got all that we got thean earlier implant the glade implants weve got those weve got the earlier fairgrounds or circus implants before that weweve got the lot see and thats all very helpful and youll say thank god ron got these things but every now and then youll be running an engram in r3r and one of the things which you have to watch out for is does it have an implant in it before you scoot the pc through it be good thing to find this out about it so did it have an implant in it see while youre durationing it and hehheh it has an implant in it augghh well the proper procedure is not to throw the pc through the incident but to take him through the first pair of items in the implant if there are any and finally fool with it until you finally find out what its all about discharge the items out of it sometimes there are only half dozen items and get those youll see them fire rocket read you clean it up and then just handle it as an engram and youll get the rest of it you get motion and that sort of thing out of it get some of the emotion out of it and so on pick up two more items that you missed and clean it up its wildcat implant see and theyre never very longthey are never very very difficult the pc if its on his chain can reach them for sure but theres point in running where 3n and r3r cross and frankly as far as programming is concerned i would always start case on r3r and pick up those implants which turned up in the normal progress of running r3r i found myself going heighho down the helatrobus implants get the lot dont just pick his chain up you know just get everything you can lay your paws on in that series of implants heighho clean them up man got your paws on them then go on and handle it as an engram youve got it clean now nowthen youd always find the engrams that are on the pcs chain that are obscuring the implants of course were asking you to drive the 20 mule team borax mules you know out there with reins wrapped around both hands and you know and around your shoulders and driving with your toes because at any minute you check up this thing got an implant in it well yeah its an implant and what youll have table of dates eventually to tell you when all these implants occur and you say whats and you suddenly dawns on you 43 trillion 980 billion 706thats helatrobus zzz you know ive been betrayed we have the level failed to die and youve got the goal failed in the helatrobus implants youre sitting right on it see which is preceded slightly by to die haha now you have to know how to shift that transmission thatwith smooth shifting of gears right over to 3n and you just go ahead and handle the whole thing right there and forbear tracing back up the track and not handling any more engrams and scattering everything around just finish what youre doing it landed you there you found the engram you found the computation in the engram you just got whatever you could get your hands on cleaned up as much of it as you could and then you jolly well went back to running what you were running of course because youve never stopped running it you have just used 3n as an adjunct to mr which is all it is anyway thats all 3n is its just an adjunct to r3r it gives you how to run implants implant engrams the easy way by pattern and when you get onto wildcat one youve got few more headaches but its just because you havent got pattern youve got to take the pattern now when we go into this and study this over we find out that there are lot of technical details you have to know such as how do you assess for an arc break we did halfapage list on the pc and the tone arm went from 30 to 55 to 40and the moment it got back to 40 we had sort of blowdown so we ended the list and i i null the list and pc just seems to be awfully arc broke and we just dont seem to get anyplace on r3r after this well you have to know such things as pcs arc break if you do not run the tone arm action out of the list the pc is doing youre going to do list you got to do list list is list i dont care what its forand if you leave list halffinished you not only wont find any item on it that is any good to the pc but your pcs going to arc break the most frequent source of arc breaks in the old days was incomplete lists the guy never finished the list or overcompleted lists you know the list was complete at fifteen pages and theyre just now passing page 75 and the and the pc hasnt been able to think of any new items since page 20 but theyve still been grinding on the auditor keeps getting in the mid ruds and asking him in this lifetime what have you failed about on and on and on and on until you getlists been complete forever most frequent source of arc breaks isaround any listing actionis simply an incomplete list thats all you could take any arbitrary list and assess the pc on it because the pc didnt do it it is therefore not incomplete because he never started it you know its like your prehav levels and the preliminary step list of items i mean levels to be run well you can do all of those that you want to and youre not going to arc break the pc unless you get completely incorrect level and that can be very embarrassing to the pc and ive given the source of this list so that if you ever run into it and you just cant find anything on this listor if yourethe auditor doing it cant find any level on this list at all ive given you where these lists came from so you can get ahold of some of the old lines and put failed to it put it and failed to it and not to it and you can go on and extend this list considerably ive given you the sources for this list and you have all those theyre about every thought or combination of anything that man and life has but this is adequate for most pcs and it doesnt matter whether the level list is complete or not because its an arbitrary list pc didnt do it so therefore it doesnt stand as an incomplete list ah but the other listnow youyoure up against all the rules of listing and thats quite skill listing and nulling is quite skill and what does it do it goes back to meter reading get your auditing cycle completed when you confront these complex processes make sure that your nerviness does not stem from an inability to place the pcs chair you get the idea see youre saying im having all kinds of trouble with r3r well before you conclude anything about r3roh yeah go on and study it and learn it and so forthbut you just cant seem to make it work before you conclude anything catastrophic with regard to this whatsoever lets take look at what you are doing that makes up r3r that makes you nervous and youll probably find out that listing makes you very nervous or something and you find out well why does listing make very nervous oh well i itll be something like this ive just never mastered the art of writing things while i was looking at meter to see if they read yeah something like that and you say oh oh well wonder were having such hell of time in this assessment in other words go back to basic things like your meter your session auditing the pc auditing cycle q and pc keeps getting arc brokeyou cant figure out why hes getting arc broke and every time you try to find it outwell you didnt accept something the pc said you had better conclude sooner or later that you must be doing q and of some kind or another there must be something wrong with your auditing cycle otherwise your pc wouldnt continue to get arc broke look it over and patch it up now therefore learn to play this game called auditing on its fundamentals and when you feel very competent with its fundamentals why then i dont think that you will have much awe of procedure which is simply complex application of these fundamentals there really isnt very much to r3r guy has got time track and youre going to run him through these things and youre going to come cropper sometimesgoing to come cropper sometimes with it why well it isnt because you didnt tell him to move to the beginning of the incidentit isnt anything elementary like thator you didnt follow your procedureit isnt anything involved youll find out well you had something like wrong duration you just continued to get wrong durations and eventually running this pc you finally get it through your knucklehead that this pc just wont date on this chain that you are running and you finally say well trace this thing back well lets see lets trace this thing back here now what did i do soandso and so on and so on and so on and so on oh we musthehe doesnt have any tone arm action either oh we must not have the right assessment something is wrong with the assessment well how could there be anything wrong with the assessment and it suddenly dawns on you that you have absolutely confidence whatsoever in being able to clean up pcs needle so you can assess nothing wrong with mr see youre having troubleyoure having trouble handling session and handling meter so on this pc without going back and putting yourself through course or something like thaton this pc right then you decide well all right to hell with it this thing has got tone arm action so i must have wrong assessment thats it so theres something wrong with the item or theres something wrong with the level thats all all right now what could be wrong with those well i just must not have done what i was supposed to do to find the item or to find the level from which i got the item now something is wrong in that department well how come i couldwould get wrong assessment on this pc well ivelets see lets see his needle was awful dirty as matter of fact his needle is still dirty as matter of fact ive never seen clean needle on this pc ahh hey heyi think ive got it i think i got it i think this pcive never had this pc insession hahahahaha excuse ah so you say well now lets lets put this pc insession this pc has been roughed up few times and so forth lets just run in auditing eighteenbutton prepcheck something elementary only in this particular case why were just going to run them until weve got bit of clean needle and were not going to bother the pc and so forth because that seems to be weak spot here so lets just kind oflets run sort of an eighteenbutton prepcheck on auditing and let the pc answer it any way he wants to and well say its clean when its clean and well just kind of ease this thing out and so forth boy we find out all kinds of things this pc has been withholding and hes been suppressing and hes been upset with this and hes been in disagreement with that and so forth and you know you thought you couldnt run r3r well you just didnt have the pc insession see elementary my dear watson how can you do an assessment on somebody who isnt insession so you trace thisalways trace this back to these stupid fundamentals and your main danger as an auditor isthe main danger that you run intois that youre too complicated youre notyoure insufficiently idiotable see if you would justif you would just recognize that the simplicities of the game make it hang together and workif youll just recognize that why youll have some fantastic wins here and there look it over and eventually youll get very cocky about these things and itll all fall into line with you and so forth but the reason youre not achieving result here or there on complex technology goes back to these early ones you either arent doing it you arent doing it in an auditing session because you havent got session or you suddenly discover that theres something wrong between you and the pc and this meter this pc does not register well on this meter why well ill let you in on something the greatest errors that you can make in r3r the greatest errors that you can makeare wrong date and wrong duration those outshine any other error you can even make progress with wrong assessment you understand those are just enormous they ride up there at the umpteen skillion lightyear level see and way down below these things is wrong assessment well theres two ways we can get wrong assessment we can have had wrong assessment in the first place and we could actually have run it out so that we are now running on wrong assessment because you see we flattened the first assessment in which caseboth cases the ta will remain without motion you wont have adequate motion in the ta now the only other thing that can kill ta motion as far as r3r is concerned is this astronomic fact of wrong date wrong duration theyll kill ta motion wrong date wrong duration bang ta motion thats it ive been studying ta motion here latelywhat makes it and that sort of thing and i finally found these facts out and so theres this enormously important factjust cannot be overstressed wrong date wrong duration those are crash anytime youre really having any trouble with it youve got wrong dates and wrong durations i mean thats all you understand i mean thats waaay up there the other point here wrong assessment well the only thing that leads to is just ta action and not much pc interest and youre not getting much done on the case and so forth and so on its not going to ruin the case dont you see and flatten the chainyou flatten the chain and you said well chain couldnt flatten in one engram yet you did you flattened it in one engram what you found was basic on that chain you know it flattens in hundred or it flattens in one or its pointhas nothing to do with where the engram is on the time track the engram can be yesterday just yesterday and its basic well you ranrun this engram that you date as yesterday and you clean it all up and the pcs fine and the somatics reduce and everythings gorgeous about the thing and you look for an earlier one you cant get any date you cant get any lets see is the earlier incident we want gr gr greater greater than 10 days ago less thani dont get any read just minute get some better light on this now isis the engramis the engram the earlier engram which reduces to absurdiumthat chainis the earlier engram earlier than 20 days ago is it later thani mean i mean is it more more than 20 days ago leleless than 20 days ago i dont get any read here at all now maybe its the wrong order of magnitude ah is the earlier engram we are looking for on the reto refail to reduce to absurdity is this more than hundred trillion years ago is it less than athat doesnt read more than hundred theyre both reading did you think of something all right lets have another crack at this is it more than hundred trillion years ago lessi got dirty needle here you thinking of something four sessions later say i wonder something lights dawn you know to fail to reduce to absurdity fail to reduce to absurdity it doesnt read we flattened the chain oh excuse pc says selfrighteously well i told you i thought that was all there was to it pc didnt say word about it well thats some of the troubles you run into when you get wrong assessment man the devil himself with telepathy the russians have heard that the americans are now using telepathy to communicate to the atomic subsso they now have professor of telepathy who is studying telepathy and he wants to telepath to group at oxford university only he wont do it because he doesnt think telepathy works i mean our scientific world marches on but the point im making here is wrong assessment is contributive to wrong date and wrong duration because even if you have the right chain getting date to read and getting duration to read is hell its horrible its very hard to do with the pc insession needle clean right level right item next engram coming up deadeasy its difficult its not easy to get the right date and the right duration why because youve got the date which is usually the last moment of the engram toward present time so your duration extends that earlier see and if you dont getand the pc has reality on how early this thing went because hes only got the last tail of it which is the part toward present time so duration doesnt read worth nickeldating is easier to do than duration and brother i have dated something twice and redurationed it ten times trying to find the beginning of it when i finally did find the beginning of it zing of course i had to redate it by that time because it had now become unreal see its end was so much further away that it made about awell it made about hundred years of error in the date when we finally found the beginning of it and it was dark and it was terrible and the pc couldnt run it and nothing could be done about it and nobody could find anything in it and it was all mess and all mess and all mess and all mess and reduration reduration redurationand then finally got more proper date and then duration and then durationed it and then all of sudden had the right duration and bang pc got to the beginning of the thing went through it zipzipzip all of the somatics reduced everything was fine fine fine fine fine that pc was running all right on the right chain how many redurationings ten god help you someday when you get somebody who has an engram fifteen trilliontrillion years long try to find the beginning of that before youve gone halfway through of course your date is so wrong that its jamming the track anyway and just time after time you find the earlier part of it and you find the earlier part of it and you find an earlier part of itand finally you finally get it all worked out and you find out that this thing which first registered as one and onehalf hours long was actually 15 trilliontrillion years in length somebody stuck in mountain that long couldnt get out thats rough thats hard to do its hard to do when everything else is correct so youve got to have everything else correct and then it can be done but it is not easy to do when all signs and portents are favorable got that now you get wrong assessment and add it to this ohho youve had it or you overrun chain youve run five engrams on this chain and they dontno ta action on the last two the thing was sitting at 50 on the ta and youre getting ta action so you just say well maybe the ta action will pick up maybe ive got wrong dates and durations on this thing maybe the ta i actually pick it up and you say now is it more than you know is the next incident you know whats the date of the next earlier incident see get your head back on tas up there hasnt moved for two incidents 3r3 says that youre supposed to find the basic on the chain maybe you did maybe youve run two more incidents that you needed to run to flatten it maybe the things been flat but you cant go into esoterics as to whether something is flattened or not flattened or anything else if you cant even put pc insession how can you run an arc break when all your sessioning on the pc is an arc break when you wont answer anything the pc tells you how can you do an arc break assessment because youre laying in arc breaks faster than of course youre picking them up by assessment thats something like the frog that crawls up two inches and falls back three and he never gets to the top of the well that way whats in error then just your auditing cyclenothing more elementary than that so im saying its not terribly good news that taking somebody all the way to ot requires number of complicated procedures this is not very good news but it is good news that all the errors of these procedures when they really get erroneous fall immediately back down to just very few basics you can learn how to do those basics get confidence in that line recognize that your disabilities in handling other things fall back to those simple basics therefore you can always improve those basics so youll be able to do it and youve got clear road ahead of you im not at all dismayed as far as youre concerned in being able to do these procedures but im looking at what difficulty you are having here or there and i recognize theyre all elementary difficulties theyre not complex difficulties at all you can do these thingsyou can do them easily and you can bring off the show because im telling you youre right youre right here within handshaking distance of making ots ot is on the sunny side of thousand hours right this minute for any pc the length of time itll take him to go ot has intimately to do much more intimately to do with the auditors command of basics than it does the state of his case because i have made new discovery which will hearten you great deal and that is that case levels vii vi vall of themhave channel which if properly assessed give them clearrunning tamoving engrams with dub theres always little channel lies through the bank which is straight that the pc has reality on and that doesnt matter if youre running brushing teeth see hes still got that one win on that one flatten that chain reassess get another chain and he goes up up further further ability better better better better the next thing you know youve got it made youre not up against difficult cases youre up against rather difficult procedures and all that your difficult procedures are up against are your ability to handle the basics ive been talking about okay thank you
