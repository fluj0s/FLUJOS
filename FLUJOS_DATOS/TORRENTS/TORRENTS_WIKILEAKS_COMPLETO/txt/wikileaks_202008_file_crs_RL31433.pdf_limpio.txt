fy2003 global health budg et proposal it dedicated more than 40 of its funding to hivaids activities while decreasing spending in most of the other health programs some mbers of congress expressed concern that reserving significant portion of the global health budget for hivaids activities without increasing overall global health funding w ould have left other health programs without enough funds meanwhile usaid ma intained that in practice the increase in the overall global health budg et was more important than the program in which the funding changes occurred1 additionally it asserted that its integrative approach would minimize the impact of the lower budget allocations on the other health programs this report examines us global health funding trends since 1999 reviews issues surrounding usaids decision to funnel much of its money into hivaids activities and analyzes current global health spending priorities global health activities have become major component of us foreign aid partially due to growing concern among some policy makers that health could significantly impact economic growth national security and political stability in many parts of the world according to 2000 cia report the global infectious disease threat and its implications for the united states the persistent infectious disease burden is likely to increase the risk of economic decay social fragmentation and political destabilization in the hardest h it countries in the developing and former communist worlds2 the report further indicates that the economic costs of infectious diseases especially hivaids and malaria are already significant and will take heavy toll on productivity prof itability and foreign inve stment possibly reducing gdp by as much as 20 or more by 2010 in some subsaharan african countries3 infectious diseases could significantly affect not only t hose abroad but also americans at home according to the cia report over the last 30 years twenty well known diseases including tb malaria nd cholera have reemerged or spreadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31433crs3 4 ibidgeographically often in more virulent and dr ugresistant forms fu rthermore at least 30 previously unknown incurable diseases ve emerged since the 1970s although infectious diseases do not pose as great of threat to american security as they do for other countries they c ould still have significant impact many infectious diseases most recently the west nile virus originate outside us borders and are introduced by international travelers immigrants returning us military personnel or imported animals and foodstuffs the ci report predicts that the most dangerous known infectious diseases likely to threat the united states over the next two decades will be hivaids hepatitis c tb and new more lethal variants of influenza4 us health programs for many years have included prog rams that aim to thwart the spread of infectious diseases address the disastrous effects of hivaids and bolster the crumbling health infrastru ctures of many developing countries members of congress have b ecome increasingly aware of the potential dangers of the spread of infectious diseases conse quently the priority placed on global health funding within the broad scope of foreign aid has increased significantly since the mid 1990s congress has been especially s upportive and in many cases

operations conference re port hrept 107345 december 19 2001 p 3the child survival and health programs fund created in fy1996 is an account that funds co mpilation of global health programs that enhance the likelihood of child survival address maternal health c oncerns and curb the spread of infectious diseases the csh was created when there was significant pressure to cut foreign aid spending as part of the overall effo rt to eliminate the federal budget deficit5 in an effort to protect the mo st vulnerable populations in th poorest parts of the world the house subcommittee on foreign opera tions chaired by representative sonny callahan added langua ge that would introduce the child survival and disease fund into the foreign operations appropriation legi slation the objective was to ensure that there would be reductions in progra ms that directly affect younger children and to accelerate efforts to eradicate diseases that threaten younger children6 funding for csh was derived from preexis ting child survival and adult disease accounts those accounts were the development assistance fund da the development fund for africa dfa the economic support fund esf assistance for eastern europe and the baltic states aeeb assistance for the new independent states of the former soviet union fsu and the unicef portion of international organizations andprograms 7 initially the child survival and health programs fund originally called the child survival and disease programs fund account did not include reproductive health and population activ ities and included basic education for childrens initiatives education programs are longer part of the csh account while reproductive health and popula tion programs have been added currently csh is used for activities related to immunizations oral rehydration health and nutrition water and sanitation grant to unicef displaced and orphaned children reproductive health nd population activities the treatment

from 5926 million to 1836 billion in fy2003 when combined with funds from all accounts including csh funding for the global health budget reached 1972 billion in fy2003 for fy2003 the administration did not request csh funds instead it requested that 1594 billion of the global h ealth budget ordinarily funded through csh be funded through deve lopment assistance it requested that the remaining 177 million come from the other accounts br inging the total global health budget request to 1771 billion usaid argued th at funding the global health programs through the development assistance account would give it greater flexibility in project implementation as in past year s the administration requested the fy2003 unicef contribution through the international organization contributions rather than global health funds congress has challenged both of these decisions protecting the child survival and health programs fund and maintaining unicef contributions have remained high priority for many in congress consequently funding for global health programs and unicef were placed under the child survival and health programs account for fy2003 in th senate and house foreign operations billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31433crs7 9 the full global fund contribution is applied to hivaids funding in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 however only the 170 million of the global fund contribution

vulnerable children and other infectious diseases although the administration propos ed that some of the funds for those programs be reduced in fy2003 usaid main tained that it would strive to minimize the impact of the reductions by focusing on populations most in need and by leveraging other donors10 instead of focusing on the cuts in some programs usaid argued that the most important thing to concentrate on is the integrative nature of the programs and that overall spending on global health woul d increase on march 13 2002 usaid administrator andrew natsios testified before the house foreign operations subcommittee during that hearing mr natsios stated there are number of things we do in hivaids which is also something we do in maternal health and in child surviv for example mother that has sexually transmitted disease that is pregnant has very high risk of the kid dying when the child is born the survival ra dramatically drops if the woman has an std when shes pregnant so part of our child survival strategy is std strategy thats also part of our hiv stra tegy so lot of these programs in the field are actually integrated together and they have to be or they dont work the important factor i would point out here in all of these health accounts is the bottom line is up 60 million11 and so theres 60 million more being spent on health programs than there were before and i think thats good message12 issues and options for congress in its deliberations over the fy2003 appr opriations for global health in the foreign operations bill congress considered number of issues including the adequacy of the global health budget global health funding versus other development assistance hivaids spending versus ot her global health prog rams and the number of directives

the needs in the field they said that it is often difficult to balance competing priorities within the global health budget consequently they say th at the size of th global h ealth budget necessitates that as funding increases in one program area it decreases in others on february 12 2003 congress passed pl 1087 an fy2003 omnibus appropriations bill wh ich included 184 billion for csh and 197 billion for usaid global health activities most global health programs except family planning and reproductive h ealth initiatives were funde d above requested levels the increase was most significant for hivaids directed funds include 800 million for the fight against hivaids this figure is 140 million above the administrations request of 740 million and includes the presidents 100

appropriations committee voted to give 120 million to the united nations childrens fund unicef through the csh account although the administration did not reque st funding for unicef under the account the omnibus bill also reserves an additional 100 million for the global fund through the labor hhs and educati on appropriation llocating 350 million in total for the global fund global health versus other development assistance do current global health funding levels affect the implementation of other development assistance programs some are concerned with what they perceive as an overemphasis on global hea lth visàvis other devel opment programs in fy2002 health programs accounted for about 60 of all development assistance14 critics believe that other areas also need suppor t namely education democracy trade and investment and agriculture these areas also significantly impact development and health critics argue some claim if the programs that build human capacity promote stable governments encourage private investment and fost er environmentally friendly growth are not simultaneously s upported then the health programs will not be sustainable this issue has been raised

the world and reduce hunger is not by constant humanitarian programs but by teaching people how to grow more food and were not doing that because all of the money has been shifted to accounts where ther is more and gitimate interest15 if you have child survival projects and you keep kids alive until theyre 5 years old you know what happens after 5 they become malnourished because the parents are still so poor they cant provide for them we should look at the count ries where we have child survival programs for older kids to see what the malnutrition rates are they have been disturbingly high16 us representative jerry lewis conceded that agriculture does impact poverty reduction good governance and host of other development issues indeed ive felt for many many years its very difficult to

to pay paul could you explain to us why were not growing all the global health accounts equally24 although many in congress also deem countering the spread of hivaids priority they differ from the

allocation of funds they reporte d that it is not the large directives that significantly impact the global health programs rather it is the small ones that become substantial when totaled28 legislative directives have become more specific as congress has become increasingly concerned about global health i ssues when global health programs first began congress offered few directives as
