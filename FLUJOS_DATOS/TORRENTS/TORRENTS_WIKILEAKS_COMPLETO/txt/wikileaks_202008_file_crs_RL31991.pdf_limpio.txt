representative bart gordon ranking democrat on the subcommittee opposed the bill according to science committee democratic membership news release representative gordon said that he is disappointed that we didnt wait for the columbia accident i nvestigation board to report before marking up nasa workforce legislation he explained his opposition as follows on may 13th of this year all of the members of the democratic caucus of the science committee sent joint letter to chairman boehlert1 in that letter we asked him to delay the markup of any nasa workforce legislation until the columbia accident investigation board has reported and the committee has had chance to review its findings and recommendations admiral gehman has said on several occasions that the accident investigation board is examining issues related to nasas personnel contractors and culture as it attempts to ascertain the root causes of the accident indeed admiral gehman was quoted in yesterdays washington post as saying goodly portion of the report perhaps half will deal with issues of management at nasa we should wait to hear what the board concludes before we adopt legislative provisions that might prove either counterproductive or insufficien t to address the underlying problems identified by the board2 among representative gordons other concerns are these that issues affecting all nasa employees be

the senate senator george vo inovich introduced s 610 the nasa workforce flexibility act of 2003 on ma rch 13 2003 and it was referred to the senate committee on governmental affairs the committees subcommittee on oversight of government ma nagement the federal workforce and the district of columbia conducted hearing on human capital at nasa on march 6 2003 the bill was markedup by the full committee and ordered to be reported with an amendment in the nature of substitute on june 17 2003 the amendment in the nature of substitute to the bill offere d by senators voinovich and thomas carper and further modified by an amendment by senator richard durbin and agreed to by the committee included changes which would require nasas workforce plan to discuss the caibs workforce recommenda tions would remove the provision which would have lifted the cap on the number of employees who could participate in demonstration project at nas would provide that more than 25 of the total number of recruitment rede signation relocation and re tention bonuses awarded in any year could be awarded to supervisors or management officials and would add language to restrict exchange assignments to individuals in sc ientific and technical positions s 610 was reported srept 108113 on july 28 20039 the cbo estimates that s 610 would cost 80 million dollars over the period fy2004 through fy2008 specifically cbo estimates the cost at 6 million fy2004 13 million fy2005 18 million fy2006 21 million fy2007 and 22 million f y200810 the estimate for s 610 is higher than that for hr 1085 because the senate bill as reported but not as passed would have authorized an exchange program between nasa and the private sector that is not included in the house bill in the committee report accompanying s 610 senator durbin expressed his view that the provision in the bill which would authorize exchange assignments between nasa and private s ector employees raises rious concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest11 he noted senator voinovichs commitment to address such concerns and sa id that he was confident of making further progress on the provision prior to consideration of the legislation by the nate senator daniel akaka also presented his views in the committee report stating that as congress prepares to grant new personnel flexibilitie s to nasa congress must provide

security act continuedoversight over the agencys operational managerial and sa fety challenges12 specifically with regard to the provision on the exchange assignments mr akaka believes that for the exchange program to be effective there must be in place an adequate internal management structure th at is transparent and accountable for the proposed exchange program to work there needs to be sufficient safeguards to make certain that the program does not result in workforce shortfalls nasa should not lose more employees and talent than it gains from the private sector as such there s hould be controls over the proportion and number of private sector and nasa empl oyees who participate in the program the provision would benefit from additional safeguards to ensure that contractors do not use the program to gain competitive advantage in future contracts with nasa one way to address that concern is to institute cooling off period whereby contractors participa ting in the program would be restricted from contracting with nasa for an appropr iate period of time moreover there need to be assurances that minority owned and small businesses have the access to participate in the exchange program although s 610 does not specifically address contract management i believe that with such heavy reliance on contract personnel it is cr itical that there is effective and strong cont ract management at nasa13 when the senate proceeded to the consideration of s 610 on november 24 2003 senator voinovich for himself and senator carper offered substitute amendment 2214 that was agreed to by voice vote the same day the senate agreed to the committee amendment as amended and passed the bill as amended by voice vote and without debate the substitute amendment dropped provisions in s

also would allow the administrator of nasa to place limited rm and limited emergency appointees in careerreserved positions in the senior ex ecutive service ses careerreserved positions are required by statute to be f illed by career appointees and are designated as such if placing car eer appointee in the position is necessary to ensure impartiality as of june 30 2002 nasa d 505 ses allocations 330 of these werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31991crs7 19 information provided electronically to crs by the us office of personnel management office of executive resources management july 1 2003careerreserved positions and the remainin g were general pos itions which may be filled by career noncareer or limited term appointees19 if enacted this provision would give the administrator some additional flexibility in filling career reserved positions but might also be seen as an encroachment upon the ranks of career appoi ntments on the one hand it is likely that the head of nasa could fill careerre served position more quickly through the appointment of limited appoi ntee than through the hiri ng of career appointee however the exercise of this authority would reduce the number of careerreserved positions within nasa available to career appointees finally while this provision applies only to nasa it is possible that should this section be enacted other agencies would view it as precedent nd request the same flexibility in filling career reserved positions hr 1085 also would permit the administr ator to appoint individuals who are not career appointees in the ses to careerreserved positions this provision however does not use the terms limite d term appointee or limited emergency appointee to refer to an individual who would receive temporary appointment apparently hr 1085 would establish anot her category of ses appointee one that is as yet unnamed and only for nasa hr 1085 would be more restrictive than s 610 under the house bill careerreserv ed position would be vacant for someone other than career appointee to be appointed to it and it would be likely that the position would be eliminated within two ears temporary appointment would be allowed for only two years with possibility of oneyear extension the senate bill would provide the administrator with br oader authority while hr 1085 perhaps would address very specific need ie filling career reserved positions that might be eliminated within two years other issues that may arise during consideration of the legislation include the following with regard to the enhanced ipa authority extending assignments by four years instead of two years hr 1085 and s 610 5 usc 9808 should extensions of assign ments continue to be reviewed in twoyear increments if the proposed four year extension is adopted with regard to the enhanced r ecruitment relocati on and retention bonuses hr 1085 and s 610 5 usc 9804 9805 and the annual leave provisions hr 1085 5 usc 9813 s 610 5 usc 9812 what is unique about nasa that w ould require these more generous policies for nasa employees accord ing to the office of personnel management the existing recru itment relocation and retention bonus authorities are not being fully utilized by federal agencies how fully has nasa used thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31991crs8 during the march 6 2003 senate s ubcommittee hearing sean okeefe administrator of nasa testified as to the reasons nasa is seeking the enhanced human resources management flexibilities with regard to the various provisions of the legislation he said that the nasa industry exchange program introduces means for nasa to engage in mutually beneficial collaborat ventures with industry to infuse new ideas and perspectives into the agency develop new skills within the workforce and strengthen mission capabilities without such authority talented individuals from industry remain an untapped resource for the agency since the salaries and benefits of the federal sector are not competitive with the compensation packages offered to industrys most talented workers enhancing the intergovernmental personne l act authority which allows for exchanges between the federal government and state and local governments universities and nonprofits will allow individuals from academia or other institutions to continue working in support of longterm projects or programs when the need for continuity is critical enhanced recruitment relocation and retention bonuses authority would base bonuses on the higher locality pay salaries allow greater amounts when coupled with longer service agreements and make more flexible payment options available which could be tailored to the situation at nd and tie payment of the incentive to actual performance the enhanced annual leave provisions are targeted particularly to midcareer hires who likely would give up attractive vacation packages to become firsttime federal employees these flexibilitie s help nasa to compete with the compensation packages available to private sector employers the bills provision to allow limited number of term appointments to be extended up to six years rather than four will enhance its usefulness by accommodating the length of some nasa programs and projects in addition the bill provides that term employee may be converted to permanent position in the same line of work without further competition provided requirements are met ultimately it may make the concept of term appointments more attractive to potential applicants and thereby provide more robust labor pool for nasa management to consider in order to attract worldclass talent into nasas most essential positions enhanced critical pay authority up to the vice presidents salary is sought which will help us to compete in an enormously competitive job market separation incentives buyouts are va luable tool to encourage voluntary attrition nasa needs the tools to encourage targeted attrition in areas in which the need for certain skills has dimini shed so that it can recruit and reshape workforce that is aligned to current and future mission needs the authority to pay higher amount as buyout is requested because the current amount is not always enough to entice highly paid nasa professionals to leavehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31991crs9 20 statement of sean okeefe admini strator national aeronautics and

earlier in the form of legislation prepared by nasas political leadership and have been rejected largely on the grounds that they undermine merit system principles that they would exacerbate the
