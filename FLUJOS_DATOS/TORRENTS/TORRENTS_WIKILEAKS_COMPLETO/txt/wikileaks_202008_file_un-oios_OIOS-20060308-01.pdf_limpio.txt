raised over us1 m illion in funds which was sufficient to cover the cost of legal aid as assessed by icty however the current policy did not cater for the situation when he decided to exhaust m ost of

olad had included the num ber of additional allotm ents of counsel and staff hours per accused to be authorized as the perform ance m easure in the previous budgets as shown in the table below year target for additional allotm ents during the ear 2002 2003 8 20042005 2 sour ce ol ad budget subm ission for 2006 2007 17 oios agrees with olad that this is not useful perform ance m easure considering the num ber of variables outside its control that may lead to additional allotm ents to def ence team s olad has requested other indicators of achievem ent to be selected such as dim inished total expenditure on defence costs ta king into account the total num ber of cases however icty budget section inform ed olad that the existing indicators of achievem ent should norm ally be m aintained and the proposed new indicators should preferably not replace existing ones but rather be added to the list of existing indicators icty commented that in the light of the observations made during th audit concerning the inadequacy of the existing indicator relating to additional allotments per year the tribunal will be writing to the budget division formally requesting the exclus ion of this indicator from the logical framework established for the icty budget as icty will be addressing the issue oios is making recom mendation d establishment of indigency adequacy of arrangem ents 18 adequate arrangem ents for establishing indi gence were in place under article 21 of the statute accused are only entitled to legal aid if they are unable to pay for their defence in may 2004 the registry reform ulated its policy so that an accused with lim ited m eans would contribute less to the costs of his defence wh ile wealthier accused would contribute m ore the policy provides details to determ ine the indi gence or partial indigence including how the 6 amount to be contributed by the accused is to be determ ined however the registrars decision on how far the accused lacks m eans to remunerate counsel can be challenged by the accused who can seek review of the decision by the trial cham bers b investigations 19 during 2004 2005 olad had investigated requests from 42 accused for indigency and the progress m ade is shown in the table below number of accused amount to be contributed by accused registrars decisions issued 17 us179 m illion investigations com pleted registrars decision being finalized 14 us143 million investigations yet to be com pleted 11 yet to be determ ined sour ce information pr ovided by olad i nvestigator 20 olad plans to com plete the rem aining i nvestigations into indigence request by decem ber 2005 further requests for indigency may be lim ited since only six accused are yet to be apprehended oios is therefore of th opinion that current st aff resources should be sufficient to m eet the rem aining needs of the icty 21 olad conducted intensive investigations to determ ine the financial status of the accused that included m aking enquiries from member states and site visits to the region oios testchecks revealed that the contribution had been adjusted from the am ount payable to the def ence team for legal aid oios is th erefore of the opinion that olad has adequate procedures and controls for establishing nd approval of indigency except for the case discussed below 22 one accused mr fl initially request ed for legal aid claim ing indigency on 03 march 2003 the tribunal assigned tem porary counsel mr kk to the accused on 04 march 2003 to secure the right of the accused while verifying the declaration of indigency in the course of olads inquiry the accused inform ed them that subsequent to his application for legal aid his fam ily had established fund to raise m oney for his defence olad informed oios that upon request the accuse d provided additional information about the fundraising activities the fund had raised us291504 by october 2003 that exceeded the estim ated cost of the legal representation of us211200 as assessed by olad accordingly on 30 october 2003 olad determ ined that the accu sed had sufficient m eans to pay for his defence for the pre trial stage and withdrew the counsel assigned 23 the fund continued to raise m oney after the registry decision olad explained that since the accused was longer seeking legal aid from the tribunal and had indicated he wished to retain defence counsel himself b ecause he wanted to hire the best lawyers possible the registry did not monitor the fundraising campaign olad stated that it had legal basis to do so the accused privately retained and was represented by mr mm and mr kk during the pretrial stage 24 as the fund had raised sufficient f unds for the legal aid olad should have endeavored to recover the am ount already paid to the defence counsel as provided in the rule 45 however oios noted that though article 18 of the directive addresses the issue of withdrawal of counsel in such cases it does not clarify if the am ount paid to the counsel can 7 be recovered this issue needs to be addre ssed because it m ay encourage accused that are completely not indigent to request for lega l aid the existing provision enables them to benef it from legal aid paid f or by icty until the investigation into their indigence is completed even though they are nonindigent recommendation ¾ to discourage the m isuse of legal aid the icty registrar should consider including pr ovision in the directive on assignm ent of counsel that ables the office of legal aid and detention matters to recover fees paid to defence counsel assigned by it in cases where the accused is determ ined to be completely not indigent rec 02 25 icty commented that provision allowing th registrar to seek recovery of legal aid funds paid to an accuseds defence team wher the accused is found not indigent already exists in the rules of procedure and evidence rules rule 45e reads as follows where person is assigned counsel and is subs equently found not to be lacking the means to remunerate counsel the chamber may on applic ation by the registrar make an order of contribution to recover the cost of providing counsel including separate similar provision in the directive on the assignment of defence c ounsel directive is therefore considered unnecessary 26 however olad explained that the existing legal provision is intended to cover situations other than that cited in the draft report as reason for the recommendation as for the situation cited as matter of law and policy the registry cannot and should not seek recovery of funds paid to counsel assigned mporarily article 11b of the directive provides the basis for the registrys obliga tion to uphold the accuseds fundamental right to counsel as enshrined in article 21d of the statute assignment of counsel made under this article is not linked to the accuseds financia l status the provision guarantees the right to access to justice and its purpose is to encourage an accused who considers that she does not have sufficient means to remunerate counsel to seek legal aid similar guarantee is contained in rule 62b of the rules and artic 16f of the directive related to the assignment of duty counsel for the purpose of the initial appearance again irrespective of the financial status of the accused it is unlikel that an application by the registry to seek recovery of funds paid to counsel assigned pu rsuant to articles 11b or 16f of the directive would be granted by judge or c hamber furthermore such an application risks creating unwanted practical consequences litigation of the matter in court resulting in waste of tribunal judicial time and resources potential withdrawal of counsel and thereby delay of proceedings difficulties related to the enforcement of the judgeschambers decision if one is eventually issued therefor given the legal nature of the temporary assignments the legal and practical difficulties associated with recovering these relatively small amounts and the potential additional cost s which the tribunal might incur icty submits that the advice to pursue recovery of legal aid funds paid to counsel temporarily assigned should not be followed it is suggested that the current registry practice in such situations should prevail 27 two nonexhaustive examples of situations in which the existing provision in the rules may be put to use are where the registry subsequent to fi nding of partial indigency and the permanent assignment of counsel obtains informati on revealing that an accused does in fact 8 have the means to remunerate counsel and had that information been available would not have found an accused partially indigent in the first place b where an accused has been found partia lly indigent but refuses to pay his contribution and the tribunal decides to in th interest of justice proceed with the assignment of counsel but recover the funds at later stage2 28 oios thanks icty for the additional info rmation which in its opinion does not alter the need to address the issue raised by the recom mendation for the following reasons article 11 b of the directive provide for tem porary assignm ent of counsel specifically to enable registry to determ ine the declaration of m eans subm itted by the accused however the rules of procedure and evidence rules provide that cham ber m ay make an order to recover the cost of providing counsel further the rules do not differentiate between counsel assigned on tem porary and regular basis since the rule s take precedence over the directive it is not clear why registry cannot seek recovery of funds paid to counsel assigned tem porarily 29 while oios appreciates the right of accused to legal aid enshrined in the article 21 of the statute neither the rules nor the directive provide for the right of accused determ ined as completely indigent to be assigned counsel mporarily at organizations expense further contrary to olad assertion that am ounts invol ved are relatively sm all the am ounts actually paid are substantial icty paid approxim ately us90000 to the counsel assigned temporarily for fl which was not recovered 30 given the above icty should seek re view of legal provisions and establish effective controls so that unnecessary litigation can be avoided oios will theref ore keep the recom mendation open pending clarification whethe r icty intends to revise the existing provisions or outline what other m easures are propos ed to address the risk of m isuse of legal aid in cases where the suspect is subsequently found to be com pletely not indigent 31 the accused reapplied for legal aid prior to the start of the trial on 27 june 2004 for the trial stage and this led to reassessm ent of his m eans to rem unerate counsel icty explained that they opened new inquiry into the financial status of the accused as of the date of his renewed application it required the accu sed to provide the complete financial record of the fundraising campaign based on the docum ents and further to its own inquiries the registry was able to determine the fund had raised euro 1117669 32 the accused entered into an agreem ent on 27 october 2003 with mr mm and mr kk to represent him as his counsel for pre trial stage for lum p sum amount of euro 1000000 the agreem ent also stated that the accused would pay further fee of euro 500000 prior to the trial and in any event by ma 2004 in the event such funds were not available the two counsels agreed to continue to represent the accused until the end of the trial as assigned counsel funded by the registry according to icty the trial payment stated in the agreement was however never made as the fund had not raised that amount the accused then requested legal aid because he longer had sufficient means to pay his counsel for the trial phase in assessing the accuseds eligibility for legal aid olad determined the actual financial situation of the accused as of the date of his request for legal aid olad noted that an amount of euro 557000 was paid to mr mm and euro 443000 to mr kk in november 2003 2 this is possibility presently bei ng considered by the registry in coordination with the judges to overcom problem s caused by noncontri buting accused such as tim consum ing litiga tion delays in proceedings negative consequences for defence resources and t he risk of an appearance of injustice 9 33 olads investigation determ ined that balance of us155706 from the fund was still available to the accused since the tota l estim ated cost of the trial phase was us339176 the registry agreed to bear th additional expenses of us183470 339176 155706 in counsel and support staff fee plus the travel expenses 34 oios is of the opinion that the agr eement of 27 october 2003 between the accused and the two counsel retained by him were not binding upon the registry further the total amount raised by the fund for defence of the accused was m ore than that required for legal aid as assessed by olad oios is hence of the opinion that olad should not have agreed to bear the additional costs for the accused as stipulated in the agreem ent 35 icty commented that both legally and factua lly the registry proceeded in proper manner the agreement between counsel and the accused fl was not taken into account when it made its decision rather the registry assessed the factual situation at the time the second request for legal aid was made in ma king its decision the registry managed to fulfil its duty to uphold the statutory right to legal assistance of an accused who did not or longer had sufficient means whilst balancing this w ith its duty to ensure that public funds are spent properly and proportionately taking into account the necessity for fair and expeditious trial for three accused fl was tried jointly with two other accused 36 when the registry denied legal aid to fl in october 2003 it had established that the accused had sufficient funds to remunerate counsel at tribunal rates for the pretrial stage only the registry had not made determinati on on his eligibility for legal aid for the entire duration of the proceedings the purpose of the tribunals legal aid system as with domestic legal aid systems is to provide counsel to those accused who do not have sufficient means to retain counsel privately this is mandated by article 21d of the tribunals statute the question of whether or not the accused has the ans to remunerate couns is answered as of the date of his application for legal aid except in situations where bad faith or fraud on the part of the accused can be proven the regist rar has authority to refuse legal aid to someone who may once have had but longe r has money to remunerate counsel3 rather the registrar must ensure that an accuseds right to legal assistance is upheld it is submitted that had the registrar denied legal aid to fl on the basis that he should have used the 1 million to pay his counsel for the entirety of th proceedings it would have violated the right of an accused not requesting legal aid to choos counsel in dereliction of its obligations under article 21 of the statute 37 oios appreciates that the registrys deci sion to provide legal aid to accused involved striking sensitive balance between the rights of the accused to counsel and safeguarding the organizations financial resources oios so very m uch appreciates the additional inform ation explaining the reasoning behind the pr ovision of legal aid in the exam ple used in this report the issue f or oios is the f act th at there is provision in the directive to cover such cases and the absence of such provi sion can be exploited by accused and defence counsel and could lead to fee splitting 3 the exam ples provi ded t oios annexed t this com mentary show however t hat where there is reasonable suspicion that an accused seeking legal aid has disposed of his m eans in orde r to conceal the true ownership of these m eans or in order to avoid his obligations under th legal aid regim the registry exam ines the accuseds past financi situation in order t determine his financi status as of t he dat of hi s decl aration of m eans 10 recommendation ¾ to reduce the risk of possible misuse of legal aid by accused and the defence counsel the icty registrar should consider including provision in the directive that prevent accused that are determ ined to be non indi gent to revert back to icty for legal aid if they exhaust their resources in order to avoid their obligations under the legal aid system rec 03 38 icty commented that they interpret this r ecommendation to mean that there is need for mechanism which ensures that an accuse d who has been found totally nonindigent by the registry ie to have sufficient means to pay for his defence before the tribunal cannot subsequently revert to the tribunal to seek legal aid at later stage if he has exhausted his resources in order to avoid the payment of his gal expenses if this is indeed the meaning of the recommendation the icty agrees with it the result is achievable and has been achieved within the current legal framework olad has provided oios with examples which show that the current system works effectively and that there are sufficient controls and guarantees in place against misuse of legal aid funds 39 icty further commented that the factual circ umstances of f ls application for legal aid the case which has prompted recommenda tion 3 do not fall in the category of cases apparently targeted by the recommendation oios found that this case illustrates flaw in the legal aid policy that enables an accused that has been determined to be nonindigent to revert to the tribunal for legal aid if he exhaus ts his resources by any means icty does not endorse this finding and submits the following clarification regarding the factual and legal context in which the decision on fls application for legal aid was made these have already been incorporated in the paragraphs 22 23 31 and 32 above 40 as m entioned above oios appreciates the additional inform ation provided to explain the rationale behind the paym ent in this particul ar case oios was reviewing this case with the aim of determ ining what lessons m ight be l earned for the future in the opinion of oios icty has inadequate controls to cover situa tions where an accused who has sufficient m eans to pay for his com plete defence before the tribunal decides to exhaust the funds and then later reapply for legal aid from the tribunal oios will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of evidence that the directive has b een am ended or other controls put in place to mitigate this risk c other issues in application of indigency 41 while application of the indigency form ula has resulted in significant savings for defence counsel fees the system has its lim itations accused found partially indigent often refuse to pay their counsel this m ay result in disruption of the proceedings additionally accused m ay not cooperate with olad in asse ssing their financial m eans olad advised that one accused who applied for legal aid

akes decisions on fee and expense claim s of defence counsel amounting to us30 m illion per biennium this places substantive responsibilities on the head of olad considering the am ount involved nd

and assuring the 5 refer paragraph 99 14 accused of com petent defence and fair tra il within the constraints of united nations financial regulations and rules in other ar eas such as procurem ent

of advice rendered by local com mittee on contracts and headquarters com mittee on contracts respectively therefore oios is of the opinion that to assist the head of olad structured dele gation of

for defence counsel create the legal framework within which decisions on maximum allotments of hourslump sum payments are made the directive and the policies contai n guidelines as to when additional hours and adjustments of the lump sums are justified fu rthermore the process of approving additional defence expenditures involves several levels of approval olads associate legal officers head of olad and for assignment decisions and findings of partial indigence the deputy registrar approval by further committee ri sks decreasing efficiency which may well have negative impact on the ability

furtherm ore while oios appreciates that olad associate legal officer reviews nd head olad approves the lum p sum oios is of the opinion that this level of check is not adequate given the substantial am ounts involved even in level one cases the am ount exceeds us200000 and does not involve any review independent of olad to be effective the internal controls established should be commensurate with the am ounts involved it is for this reason that the united nations financial regulations and rules and procur ement manual provide that the procurem ent exceeding threshold be m ade on the basis of independent advice rendered by com mittee furtherm ore since only highlevel cases are xpected to be referred to the com mittee the number of such cases will be lim ited oios will close the recom

defence phase before its com pletion the registrar will decide to adjust the lum p sum unless the registrar finds after consulting the trial cham ber that the increase or decrease in tim does not result in an increase or decrease of work 65 oios review of estim ated duration with the actual duration for nine lum p sum allotm ents in 2003 and 2004 suggested the need for additional guidelines to establish the duration in one case9 where the actual duration was longer than that estim ated the increase in num ber of witnesses by six was one of the m ain reasons for allowing an additional two months paym ent however in another case10 where the actual duration was six weeks less than that estim ated adjustm ent was m ade to the lum p sum as olad determ ined considering all factors that there was reduction in overall workload though the cham bers legal officer opined that the reduction of ten witnesses m ight have resulted in couple of weeks decrease in the duration 66 oios also suggested that olad review if the office expenses portion of the lum p sum amounting to approxim ately us18000 were required to be paid for the reduced duration olad explained that in working efficiently the defence team had ensured that there were number of supplementary benefits for the tribunal as whole such as saving court time and chamber staffs time therefore it would not be appropriate to penalize the defence team for their efficiency recommendation ¾ to avoid the risk of inconsistency in decisions relating to adjustm ents to the estim ated duration of the prosecution or defence phases of trial ic ty office of legal aid and detention matters should review the cases decided so far and consider developing detailed guidelines on how the increase or decrease in workload would be determ ined rec 08 9 it0147 otp 10 it0366 17 67 icty agreed with this recommendation in prin ciple but noted that it would be difficult to implement in practice they exp lained that the general guidelines are contained in the pre trial and trial lump sum payment policies often these guidelines cannot be more specific as the decision to adjust or not the lump sum depe nds on the specific circumstances of the case and the tribunals interest for example to speed up the pretrial preparation in order to go to trial earlier than initially anticipated in order to comply with the completion strategy this is certainly true for increases in the defence workload the situation is more complex when it comes to decrease in the defence workload which is almost impossible to assess in abstracto sometimes the trial will be shorter because of efficient work by the defence sometimes because of change in defence stra tegy sometimes through combination of the two the tribunal may realize significant savings of both resources and judicial time as consequence arguably defence counsel have an incentive to work efficiently and to conclude the trial in as short period of time as possible they may lose this incentive if the registry is to decrease the lump sum in all cases wher the trial lasts shorter period than initially estimated in addition it may be improper for the icty to introduce standard decrease of the lump sum if this would have negative impact on the flexibility of the defence to alter the defence strategy in conclusion the registry will consider ways of further specifying the workload indicators for defence counsel but notes that it is difficult to find objective criteria and hence to set deadline for the implementation of this recommendation 68 oios thanks icty for the response and ppreciates the concerns raised oios also thanks icty f or the additional inf ormation ou tlining its initial thinking on how to tackle the recom mendation the reasons outlined are why oios suggested in its recom mendation that icty should review existing cases as first step to determ ine if there are any com mon factors which could be developed into guide lines if

sufficient to ensure the right of the accused to fair trial if the lead counsel decides to retain portion of the support staff costs in one joint case11 while one lead counsel distributed the entire support costs to staff recruited however the other lead counsel12 retained sixty five percent us108000 out of us169000 of the support sta ff allotm ent olad explained that they regularly monitor the performance of the fence teams by reviewing the filings made and discussing their performance with chambers recommendation ¾ if the lead counsel retains part of the support staff costs stipulated in

clearly apparent workload eg preparation for final briefperiod oios appreciates the olad clarification for the peri od 28 feb to 13 april 2004 but notes that there was docum ented justification for the counsel to stay at the hague during the adjournm ents including the court recess it was therefore not clear to oios if olad was required to pay dsa for all these adjournm ents especially since the

hague to other countries and olad agreed to pay for their travel costs lim ited to the dsa entitlem ent if the counsel continued to stay at the hague if olad requires counsel to stay at the hague it is reasonable to pay dsa to com pensate them for their stay however oios is of the opinion that if the counsel were to leave the hague for personal work or holiday then the olad obligation would cease to exist since the counsel would longer be in the hague 89 oios also noted that there is m echanism in place to ensure that the defence counsel were actually in the hague when the defence c ounsel are

activities in the absence of such report th ere is assurance if the defence counsel were able to f ulfill the m ission objectives 92 olad explained that the introducti on of mission reports would impose an unnecessary burden on defence team members and on olad controls currently in place are sufficient to ensure the proper and reasonable exp enditure of travel resources all case related travel of all defence team members has to be outlined in the defence work plan in the regular progress reports or in separate missi on plan further prior to undertaking any of the travel listed in these documents the tr aveling defence team member has to seek authorisation from olad afterwards documen ts such as boarding passes and hotel tickets need to be submitted olad is therefore of the opinion that sufficient controls are in place to address the concerns raised by the internal auditors oios notes the response and in light of the controls outlined is not proposing any additional action h

entation of lum p sum paym ent policy f or trials and pretrial and as well as the financial tracking system oios is of the opinion that olad should establish objective and m easurable criteria to justify staff requirem ents recommendation ¾ to assist in m onitoring how efficiently its resources are being utilised the icty of fice of legal aid and detention matters should create workload statistics with indicators designed to measure efficiency and perfor mance against planned work and objectives these indicators c ould be m ix of historical perform ance criteria such as num ber of detainees defence team members assigned indigency evaluations com pleted number of olad decisions challenged by accused invoices reviewed or travel requests rec 15 95 icty commented that it agreed with the recommendation in principle however it explained that the judicial management inform ation system compiled monthly by the registry as well as the logical framework of the budget document already contain indicators 24 reflecting the workloadperformance of olad olad will nevertheless undertake review of the existing indicators with vi ew to determining their relevance in terms of performance measures against planned work and objectives target date for implementation summer 2006 oios notes the response and will close th recom mendation upon receipt and review of results of the results of the review undertak to enhance workload statistics through the creation of perform ance b reporting lines 96 the current olad organization chart does not reflect the current reporting lines for instance the organization chart reflects that each gs staff reports to one associate legal officer alo or deputy head or investigator however oios found that each gs reports to two or m ore professional staff icty commented that olad will develop and provide new organigram displaying the actual reporting lines due to the size of olad the recommendation on direct reporting of one gs st aff to one professional does not provide the necessary flexibility for the efficient use of resources and is not advisable oios thanks icty for its response and proposes further action c job classification 97 oios reviewed five out of the authorised seven olad job descriptions and found that two of the job descriptions di d not reflect current responsibilities w hile the job description of head olad was recently classified in 2005 the classification was based on the duties responsibilities and work relationships prevailing in july 200019 hence this job classification did not reflect current responsibilitie s that included financial investigations into the financial status of the accused and abuse of legal aid provided by icty transfer of convicted persons to enforcing states and th increased olad workload as the num ber of detainees has increased significantly olad now manages defence team exceeding 400 as compared to 135 in 2000 further head olad now supervises team of ten as against five staff in 2000 recommendation ¾ to ensure that the job classifi cations of office of legal aid and detention matters ol ad staff reflect current responsibilities icty should review update and classify the job descriptions for the posts of head olad and associate legal officer rec 16 98 icty agreed with the recommendation targ et date for implementation summer 2006 oios thanks icty for the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of docum entation that the post have been reclassified i other issues investigations into professional m isconduct 99 during 2004 2005 olad investigated five cas of alleged financial m isconduct of defence counsel oios reviewed two of the cases and found that olad filed disciplinary 19 the section b attached are signed off on 07 july 2000 25 complaint in one case which include claim s for recovery of funds us416000 to the tribunal the second case related to invoi cing irregularities by four defence counsel considering the evidence available professiona l com petence of the counsel and that filing complaint against the counsel before the di sciplinary panel would adversely affect the defence of the four current accused olad conf ronted the counsel with the findings of the investigation and gave them an opportunity to repay the sum misappropriated from the tribunals legal aid fund in exchange for the pa yment counsel were inform ed that form disciplinary proceedings would be initiated agai nst them the tribunal had already recovered us170000 from the counsel however one couns is yet to pay the balance am ount of approxim ately us11000 olad also apprised the president of the tribunal of the case who was satisfied that registry had acted properly as olad is pursuing the recovery with the counsel oios is m aking recom mendation b the association of defence counsel adcicty 100 icty has recognized adcicty as the fence counsel organization recognized by the registrar pursuant to rule 44 of the icty rules of procedure and evidence oios noted that during 2004 2005 adcicty has taken pro active role to prom ote the rights of the defence counsel adcicty subm itted list of 32 issues affecting their work which need to be addressed by icty adcicty and olad regul arly m et to discuss these issues during 2004 2005 olad inform ed us that adcicty is currently urgently pressing them for decision relating to the f ollowing three issues i increase in the hourly rates for counsel used in the ceiling paym ent policy since the rates established few years ago have not been revised since then ii adjustm ent for the exchange rate fluc tuations since the defence counsel fees are denom inated in dollars and iii change of system of enforcem ent of partial indigency 101 the olad and budget section consulted us for our views on the first two issues which are discussed below i hourly rates for ceiling system 102 while oios appreciates the rates were established som time ago it is of the opinion that there be sound justification for any increas bearing in m ind that the rates in the lum p sum and ceiling system should be consistent and that any changes could im pact ictr as both icty and ictr pay the sam hourly rates 103 oios review revealed that the current hourly rates for counsel ranging us80 to us110 are consistent with the current united nati ons salary scales for p4 and p5 further olad and adcicty agreed in april 2005 to rem uneration of us16698 per m onth for the lead counsel based on the gross salary of p5 step vii staff m ember plus 40 percent component for office costs using this as the basis the hourly rate work outs to us9520 per hour which is less than the us110 already being paid to the counsel 104 therefore oios considers there is inad equate justification for an increase in the hourly rates established further olad should bear in m ind that any deviation should not disturb the balance of equality of arm s between the prosecution and the defence counsel icty commented that the hourly rates have not c hanged since 1994 yet during that period the 20 us16698 175 hours 26 base salary rate for the professional category p4p5 level was increased effective 1 january 2003 the tribunal in consultation with the ictr is currently considering whether such increase would warrant consequential adjustment to the hourly rate while oios appreciates the icty com ment it notes that th reason adduced for rationalizing the increase that the p4p5 salary scale was increased doe s not support the justification for any increase since the existing hourly rates are already higher than the revised scales ii exchange rate adjustm ent 105 oios is of the opinion that adjustm ent of exchange rate fluctuations should be considered based on the following rule 45 list includes defence counsel from all over the world and is not lim ited to the euro region b the defence counsel are expected to work from their respective places of work and not necessarily from the hague and are paid dsa for all days that they are expected to work outside their place of residence as th dsa takes into consideration the cost of living in the hague olad should consider whether any adjustm ents m ade for exchange rate fluctuations for defe nce counsel fees m ay result in double compensation c the lum p sum policy for the pre trial and trial phase was recently agreed to between the olad and adcicty in decem ber 2004 and april 2005 respectively c procurem ent of services 106 under the norm procurem ent rules and procedures the requisitioner is involved in establishing the requirem ents and the specifications for services but the rates for services are negotiated by the procurem ent section therefore in the view of oios there could be conflict of interest if olad were to negotiate directly with the adcicty f or issues that have direct significant financial im pact to the organization 107 oios noted that both the pre trial lum p sum policy and the current version of the trial lump sum policy were agreed after series of consultations between olad and adcicty while the chief of icty budget section was inform ed of the consultations between olad and adcicty he was not asked to review the re vised policies before they were finalized olad inform ed that the deputy registrar and the regist rar were kept informed of the consultations and the policies were approved only with their consent oios is pleased to note olad now consults with budget section w hile olad input for the discussion is critical however to avoid any conflict of interest cons ideration should be given to the consultations being led by icty adm inistration recommendation ¾ to avoid any possible conflict of interest with respect to procurem ent of services i nvolving legal aid the icty registrar should consider if consultations with the association of defence counsel that have substantial financial im pact should be conducted by team led by icty adm inistration with the active involvem ent of office of legal aid and detention matters representatives rec17 27 108 icty responded that it has strong reservations to the suggestion that registry officials such as olad staff have or may have conflict of interest in their consultations with the adcicty where olad and other registry staff engage in such consultations they represent and protect the interests of the icty furthermore the registry does not negotiate with the adcicty on any of the issues describe d in the draft report the registry consults with the adcicty on registry policies and practi ces prior to their adoption as gesture of good will because the policies concern the adcictys members however it is the registrar and the deputy registrar who make the fi nal decision as to whether or not certain policy is to be approved 109 the recommendation appears to be based on perceived past practices and does not take into account current procedures and policies by which the administration is fully involved in the consultations with the adc in fact any decision on changes to the terms and remuneration system for the adc must be appro ved by the registrar any consultations and recommendations made in this regard are first fu lly discussed with olad representatives the deputy registrar the chief of budget cao and the appropriate counterparts at ictr it is submitted that this approach provides str ong basis for sound decisionmaking and avoids any perception of conflict of interest 110 oios thanks icty for the com ments and would like to clarify that there is an inherent risk if the requisitioner is directly involved in procurem ent it is for this reason the united nations procurem ent manual provide for the gregation of duties between the requisitioner and procurem ent entity to m inimize any conf lict of interest 111 oios also reiterates that its recom mendation was not based on past practices but on the current prevailing practice in novem berdecem ber 2005 it is for this reason that oios recorded that olad now consults with the budget section refer paragraph 107 above further while icty adduces that the oios recommendation does not take into account current procedures and policies by which administration is fully involved in consultations with the adc olad did not provide any such docum ented policies or procedures to oios during the regular discussionscorrespondence th at took place during the course of audit oios will therefore keep the recom mendati on open and will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of policies and procedures established v further actions
