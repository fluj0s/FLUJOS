aggregate tax reduction consisting of several major tax cut measures aimed at particular categories f taxpayers income and activities eg families with children capital gains saving and investment education along with host of smaller more narrow provisions the bill also contains number of revenue raising items that fall far short of offsetting th revenue loss from the bills tax cuts the bulk of the revenue increases are fro m aviationrelated excise taxes substantial amount of revenue is also raised by an increase in tobacco taxes contained in an associated budget reconciliation act hr 2015 the aggregate net revenu effect of pl 10534 and associated provisions in hr 2015 is estimated to be reduction of 953 billion over 5 years and 275 4 billion over 10 years the origins of the taxpayer relief act can be traced to the first days of the 104th congress when in early 1995 house republicans introduced the contract wit h america as legislation number of tax cuts formed the centerpiece of th contract perchild tax credit broad reduction for capital gains reduction f estate taxes and liberalized individual retirement accounts and were passed by congress in november 1995 as part of the bala nced budget act of 1995 however president clinton vetoed the bill because of concerns that it favored upperincom individuals and would increase the federal budget deficit the taxpayer relief act that was pa ssed by congress in july 1997 and subsequently signed into law b president clinton contains tax cuts quite similar to the principal provisions of th 1995 contract including the child credit and tax cuts for capital gains more generous ira rules an d reduced estate taxes the recent bill also contains number of ta x benefits for education and host of more narrow changes in the tax law in part the intention of gressional supporters of the 1997 act was simply to reduce taxes as part of an effort to reduce the size of government and the aggregate tax burden the bill was not pass ed as remedy for an economic emergency at the1 time of enactment the economy was at full employment and had been growin g without interruption since ear ly 1991 indeed economic performance had been such that the revenuereducing tax cut was passed in the context of plan to balance the federal budget by the year 2002 but in targeting the tax reductions to certai n2 activities and types of income the bill was also intended to stimulate and encourage activities th at were argued to be economically or socially beneficial the tax cut forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97854crs2 crs calculations based on

baseline revenue and gdp estimates by the congressional budget office the economic and budget outlook fiscal years 1998 2007 january 1997capital gains and liberalized ira rules for example were supported on the grounds they would stimulate saving and investment the tax benefits for education wer designed to encourage investment in education in terms of its aggregate size the revenu reduction estimated to result from the taxpayer relief act might be termed modest or even small the revenue loss from the bill is expected to grow over time because number of its important provisions are phased in and because number of its p rovisions are back loaded or structured so as to postpone their revenue loss still by its fifth year when many of its phased in tax cuts have become fully effective the act is expected to reduce revenue by only slightly over 1 by its tenth year the act is expected to reduce revenue by slightly less than 2 in either case the reduction is small compared to the size of th economy the timated revenue loss in either the fifth or tenth year is less than one half of one percent of projected gross domestic product the reduction is also small3 compared to that of the 1981 economic recovery tax act erta whose scheduled tax reductions were expected to reduce tax revenues by an estimated 21 by th acts fifth year some of the 1981 acts tax cuts were rescinded by subsequen t legislation before they were fully implement ed of course the targeted nature of the 1997 acts provisions hold forth the possibility that while the aggregate cut may not be large the bill may have significant effects for some groups or sectors of th econom for example families with children or individuals with capital gain s income if the aggregate size of the ct is modest or small its shape can be described as irregular rather than even or acrosstheboard as suggested above the measur provides reductions applicable to particular activities groups and types of incom rather than acr osstheboard tax reductions that might for example be produced by general reduction in statutory rates the bill consists of 20 titles that can separated into 3 groups the first 10 titles contain the measures principal tax cuts 500 per child tax credit tax ben efits for education expansion of iras reduced capital gains taxes reduced estate and gift taxes extension of several expiring tax provisions and numerous other more narrow reductions the second part of the bill is its title x and contains the acts revenueraising provisi ons there are large number of these but most are small and narrowly applicable the principal revenueraising item i s extension and modification of set of aviatio nrelated excise taxes as noted above an additional revenue raising item is the increase in tobacco excise taxes that i s provided by hr 2015 the reconciliation bill generally devoted to outlays the third part of the bill contains its final 10 titles which are generally devoted to host of narrow provisions most of which the bill terms simplification measures the shape of the bill can also be described in terms of its impact on equity economists generally distinguish between two types of equity horizontal equity which compares taxes paid by persons with equal incomes and vertical equity httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97854crs3 us library of congress congressional research service distributional effects of the4 proposed tax cut crs report 97669 by jane g gravelle washington 1997 p 1which compares taxes paid by people at different income levels the impact of the bill on horizontal equit is relatively straightforward its tax reduction for individuals in certain specific circumstances likely reduces the tax systems horizontal equity the effect of the bill on vertical equity has been hotly debated throughout th bills path through congress the bills proponents h ave argued that it favors middle income taxpayers while others including the administration criticized earl versions of the bill for favoring upperincome people in part the differing view s were result of different methods of analyzing the bill and presenting conclusions study by crs however concluded that conventional economic analysis suggests the separate house and senate version s of the bill favored upper income individuals4 the final conference committee version of the act was modified from the house and senate versions to reflect compromise with the clinton administration however the essential elements of the house and senate bill remain in the final act before tur ning to closer look at the provisions of pl 10534 it helps to put it in perspective by comparing its p olicy direction to the two landmark tax acts of the 1980s the economic recovery tax act of 1981 mentioned above and the tax reform act of 1986 the 1981 and 1986 acts are generally recognized to have been guided by opposing views of the appropriate role of tax policy in the economy the 1981 act was in part based on belief in the economic efficacy of targeted ta x incentive s that judiciously selected and aimed tax reductions could enhanc economic performance for exam ple one of ertas most prominent measures was expansion of individual retirement accounts which were designed to stimulat saving only 5 years later however the tax reform act of 1986 was designed t promote economic efficiency equity and simplicity it was based in part on th notion that the econom functions best when taxinduced distortions of behavior are minimized both this idea and the acts goal of horizontal equity led to an emphasis in its provisions on reducing differences in how different activities and types f income are taxed while full assessment of the taxpayer relief act is of course premature t this point it is clear that the measure is closer to ertas guiding principles tha n those of the tax reform act for example the 1 997 acts liberalized iras build on the ira concept that was expanded with erta and both the tax payer relief acts ira provisions and its cut for capital gains are based on the same belief in the efficacy of tax incentives for saving and investment that underlay much of the 1981 act in contrast to the 1986 tax reform act there is little doubt that the 1997 act complica tes the tax system see for example the discussion below of the act s multiple alternative education tax benefits and its various holding periods and rate s for capital gains and as noted above th 1997 act likely reduces horizontal equity we note however an important difference between the 1997 act and both ert and the tax reform act the 1997 act is substantially small er than erta and while the net re venue impact of the 1986 act was quite small it was substantially broader in scope than the taxpayer relief

more stringent than those of the regular tax and it has its own rates wer than those of the regular tax person or corporation pays either their amt or their regular tax whichever i s greater the act reduces the amt in several ways first the act reduces but does not repeal entirely the socalled adjustment for depreciation which under prior w was the most important aggregate difference between amt taxable income and that of the regular tax under prior law the amt required depreciation deductions to be claimed at slower rate than did the regular tax it did this through two mechanisms by specifying longer recovery periods for assets ie depreciation deductions for different assets must be spread over mor years under the amt than under the regular tax and by requiring the use of slower depreciation methods meaning that smaller share of an assets cost can be deducted in the first years of the recovery period the 1997 act conforms amt recover periods but not depreciation methods with those of the regular tax effective fo r assets placed in service after 1998 the act contains two additional amt reductions first it repeals the amt beginning in 1998 for corporations whose gross receipts averaged less than 5 million in 1995 1996 and 1997 such corporations continue to be exempt from the amt in any tax year as long as their average gross receipts for the preceding 3 years does not exceed 75 million second the act repeals the amt adjustment for installment accounting in the case of farmers the conference agreement on the act did t include an earlier proposal to increase the

included in th spending act rather than the ta x act beginning in 2000 the bba provides 10cent per pack increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes thus raising the tax fro m current laws 24 cent s per pack to 34 cents the act increases taxes on other tobacco products for example c igars chewing tobacco snuff and pipe tobacco by the same propor tion effective in 2002 the bba increases the tax by an additional 5 cents per pack and increases the other tobacco taxes proportionally the conference agreement on the taxpayer relief act provided that th payments by firms under future federal legislation implementing the june 199 7 tobacco industry settlement wo uld be reduced by the amount of the acts increase in excise taxes in september however legislation repealing the provision was being considered b congress the senate voted to repeal the measure on september 10 other revenueraising provisions the act contains numerous other revenueraising provisions generally mor narrow in scope and raising smaller amount s of revenue that the aviation and tobacco excise tax provisions the act separates the provisions into the following categories financial products corporate

by robert keith and item veto and expanded impoundment proposals crs issue brief 89148 by virginia mcmurtry technical corrections the need for legislation to make technical corrections in the taxpayer relief act became apparent shortly after the bill was enacted on october 9 the house ways5 and means committee approved hr 2645 which contained over 40 provision s generally aimed at clarifying vague parts of the taxpayer relief act and ruling ou t unintended consequences the three most prominent changes were closing of n unintended benefit for conversion of amoun ts into roth iras clarification of rules for the netting of capital sses and modification of certain estate and gift tax provisions as described above in the section on iras the taxpaye r relief act contemplated an easing of the normal rules for taxing ira withdrawals in the case of amount s withdrawn from an ira established under prior law rules and reinvested rolle d over into roth ir under the bill the normal 10 tax on early withdrawals did not apply to amounts rolled into ro th iras and withdrawals that would ordinarily be immediately included in taxable income wo uld be included only over 4 years the act apparently unintentionally permitted amounts rolled in to roth iras to be subsequently withdrawn without incurring the 10 earlywithdrawal tax hr 2645 contain s provisions that foreclose this possibility hr 2645 also clarifies the netting rules for capital gains that determine which of the taxpayer relief acts various categories of capital gains are offset by whic h capital losses gain from assets subject to the 28 rate in the 28 basket as it is sometimes called is grouped with losses in the same basket losses from assets that would be subject to the 28 rate if they had produced gain instead of loss fo r example loss from an asset held more than year and less than 18 months that i s sold after jul 18 1997 is deducted under the bill from gain subject to the 28 rate in addition shortterm capi tal loss and longterm capital losses that have been carried forward are deducted from gains in the 28 basket if taxpayer registers ne t capital loss from assets in the 28 basket the loss is deducted from gains subject to the next highest rate the 25 rate that applies to gains subject to depreciatio nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97854crs14 the provisions in the technical corrections bill follow the rules proposed in letter fro m6 conressional leaders to the treasury department on september 29 bna daily tax report october 10 1997 p gg1recapture if capital loss still remains it is deducted from gains subject to the next highest rate and so forth6 the correct ion to the estate tax provisions concerns the interaction between the acts gradual increase in the unified credit and its extra exemption for famil businesses as noted above the taxpayer relief act scheduled gradual increase in the effective exemption provided by the unified credit from its current level f 600000 to 1000000 by the year 2006 estates comprised of family businesse s have the option under the act of claiming an additional exemption equal to th difference between 1300000 and the exempt ion afforded by the unified credit the total exemption from the family business provision and the unified credit cannot i n other words exceed 1300000 the unanticipated interaction arises because th exemption afforded by the unified credit comes off the bottom while the famil business exemption comes off the top that is the unified credits exemption i s calculated so that it effectively offsets the first taxable dollars of an estate that ar subject to relatively low tax rates under the estate taxs graduated rate structure in contrast the family business exemption offsets the last taxable dollars of an estate that are subject to the highest estate tax rates as consequence as the unified credi t increase is phased in and the family business exempti on consequently declines because of the 1300000 cap taxes on est ates comprised of family businesses can gradually increase an off the top exemption amount is exchanged for an off the bottom one hr 2645 would rectify this by providing that the family business exemptio n would be reduced by the dollar amount of the unified credit not by the increase in the credits effective exemptio n thus the maximum total tax savings from the credit and family exemption combined would remain constant as the credits increase i s phased in revenue effects the following estimates of the revenue effect s of the taxpayer relief act and the balanced budget act
