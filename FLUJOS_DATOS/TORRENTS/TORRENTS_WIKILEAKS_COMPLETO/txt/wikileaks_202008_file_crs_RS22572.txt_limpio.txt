updated related products include crs report rl33458 central asia regional developments and implications for us interests by jim nichol introduction turkmenistan has made little or progress in democratization since gaining its independence in 1991 according to the us state department saparamurad niyazov ruled turkmenistan since 1989 first as head of the soviet unions turkmen communist party then as president of independent turkmenistan the countrys may 1992 constitution granted niyazov overwhelming powers to rule by decree as head of state and government in december 1999 constitutional amendments made niyazov president for life according to several assessments he was among the worlds most authoritarian rulers and his regime was highly corrupt and responsible for serious human rights abuses the regime increasingly restricted contacts by citizens with the outside world sizeable natural gas exports provided major revenue but poverty reportedly was still widespread1 according to the bush administration the united states has strategic and economic interests in turkmenistan and must remain engaged with the country to gain its critical cooperation in reducing threats to regional stability including terrorism and illegal trafficking in drugs weapons of mass destruction and persons turkmenistan borders countries of security concern such as afghanistan and iran and the country serves as valuable assistance corridor to afghanistan although the united states has 1 us department of state country reports on human rights practices for 2005 march 2006 freedom house freedom in the

supported usled coalition overflights for operation enduring freedom oef in afghanistan land shipments of supplies for oef and subsequent reconstruction efforts however usturkmen ties were strained at times particularly after turkmen authorities alleged that us officials and those of russia uzbekistan and turkey might have been involved in an alleged 2002 coup attempt turkmenistan also objected to criticism from the united states and others in the international community about human rights abuses and the failure to democratize niyazovs death and the political succession days after turkmenistans ruling democratic party voted to make its head president niyazov its eternal party leader he died on december 21 2006 at age 66 ostensibly from heart attack the morning of niyazovs death the state security council3 and cabinet ministers named deputy prime minister and health minister gurbanguly malikgulyyewic berdimuhammedow the acting president it was also announced that the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22572 speaker of the mejlis legislature who constitutionally should have become the acting president had been arrested on vague charges in an address to the nation berdimuhammedow urged citizens to remain calm and announced that turkmen domestic and foreign policies would not change to help ensure peace air flights and train traffic into the country were halted and internet links severed tightening the countrys international isolation defense and security forces reportedly were deployed and citizens who were viewed as dissidents were warned not to cause trouble4 the khalk maslakhaty khm or peoples council supreme legislativeexecutive regional conclave convened on december 26 and changed the constitution to make legitimate berdimuhammedows position as acting president having long refused ostensible requests from the late niyazov to plan future presidential election the khm quickly approved an electoral law and announced that the next presidential election would be held on february 11 2007 among other provisions the law states that only citizens born in turkmenistan between the age of 40 to 70 who have resided in country for the past 15 years and who are officials or members of selected ngos are eligible to run the 15year residency requirement appeared designed to block expatriate politicians from eligibility and the minimum age was lowered from before to make berdimuhammedow eligible to run the khm designated six candidates for the presidential election one from each region all of whom were government officials deputy minister of the oil and gas industry and mineral resources ishanguly nuriyev first deputy head of the dashoguz regional administration amanyaz atajikov abadan mayor orazmurad garajaev 2 us department of state

ashirniyaz pomanov head of the karabekaul district administration muhammetnazar gurbanov and berdimuhammedow the ruling democratic party endorsed berdimuhammedow as its candidate thereby seemingly anointing him as niyazovs heirapparent the united democratic opposition of turkmenistan udot bloc of expatriate parties and groups met soon after niyazovs death and proposed hudayberdi orazow as their candidate in the upcoming election although this candidacy was ignored by turkmen officials udot urged turkmen citizens to writein orazow as their choice for president beginning his campaign berdimuhammedow asserted that the upcoming election would help mark the undeviating democratization of society the broadening of openness and the enlistment of peoples efforts in the administration of the state at the same time he appeared to acknowledge that at least some of the late niyazovs policies were not popular he announced that he would restore secondary education to ten years of study and higher education to five years boost educational and medical exchange programs provide access to the internet to all turkmen and revise niyazovs cuts to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22572 pensions while promising not to raise taxes berdimuhammedow pledged to continue several popular subsidy programs including the provision of free natural gas electricity salt and water and lowpriced bread housing and public transport perhaps an admission of widespread unemployment he stated that job creation would be priority and pledged to support small and mediumsized business development he also mentioned commitment to free labor in country where citizens allegedly are pressured to help in the harvest berdimuhammedow is widely expected to easily win election some observers suggest that the late niyazovs lingering cult of personality would have ensured an overwhelming and enthusiastic popular vote for berdimuhammedow as the heir apparent in free and fair race even without any moves by berdimuhammedows supporters to restrict the field of candidates and otherwise control the electoral process implications for turkmenistan widespread poverty and unemployment recent wheat harvest shortfall and governmental weakness and corruption raise concerns about stability in the weeks before niyazovs death there were anecdotal reports of bread shortages but apparently the interim leaders moved quickly to rectify this source of popular discontent berdimuhammedow appeared to acknowledge widespread agricultural problems when he ordered working group to draw up longterm reform strategy and asserted that it is necessary to make the sector viable and profitable both for farmers and the state in order to maximize harvests in security matters berdimuhammedow also appeared to admit that there were readiness problems when he pledged on january 5 that we will take every step to strengthen material and technical provision of our national army and other lawenforcement bodies it is very important not to have any kind of shortage instead they should be provided with sufficient food and ammunition5 the challenge of corruption was underscored by report issued in early 2006 by the ngo global 5 itartass jan 5 2007 bbc jan 6 2007 crs4 witness which alleged that the late niyazov personally controlled vast portion of the wealth generated from natural gas exports the ngo raised concerns that organized crime groups were involved in these exports and urged the international community to be wary of trading with turkmenistan6 some observers have argued that the turkmen governments actions since niyazovs death may be harbingers of liberalization they point out that for the first time in turkmenistans history citizens will be offered alternative choices in presidential election even if only government officials are running the political campaign has provided some possible signs of slightly more open climate for political opinion all the candidates while pledging to continue the late great leaders policies nonetheless speak of reforms they would implement if elected perhaps indicative of widespread popular grievances gurbanov pledged greater financial support for hajj travelers most turkmen belong to the sunni branch of islam pomanov promised greater aid for agriculture and support for youth and sports activities atajikov stated that he would once and for all give private land ownership to farmers7 these observers also suggest that berdimuhammedows initial policy announcements may indicate progressive political orientation that may result in less isolationist and authoritarian country such httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22572 pronouncements include pledge at campaign stop on january 5 that if elected i will do my best to turn turkmenistan into democratic country where people enjoy freedom and every condition to work and to rest and where justice peace and friendship dominate8 other observers discount such perceptions of liberalization berdimuhammedows pledge to continue niyazovs policies may not bode well for human rights reforms they argue they also point out that berdimuhammedow officiated over such policies as the neardestruction of medical care despite his own credentials as dentist ominous human rights developments in recent days include the arrest and disappearance of environmentalist andrey zatoka on december 17 and oppositionist nurberdi nurmamedow on december 23 just after the latter reportedly had been suggested as presidential candidate by his supporters these observers also caution that since berdimuhammedow and other officials continue to endorse the rukhnama spiritual guide allegedly written by niyazov religious rights may continue to suffer turkmen media shifted almost seamlessly from exhaustive coverage of niyazov to reporting on berdimuhammedow perhaps raising the specter of new cult of personality these observers warn few analysts however think that berdimuhammedow or his replacement will be able to or want to recreate the late niyazovs idiosyncratic regime9 some observers have criticized the succession process as palace coup since berdimuhammedow and his supporters orchestrated post hoc changes to the constitution to give putative legitimacy to his takeover as acting president and his candidacy in the 6 global witness its gas funny business in the turkmenukraine gas trade april 2006 7 itartass jan

presidential election10 few observers suggest that berdimuhammedow may be only figurehead or is ruling in tandem with the head of niyazovs presidential guard akmurat rejepov they argue that constitutional changes and other actions have indicated that the state security council headed by rejepov is now the dominant force eclipsing the legislature and presidency11 implications for us policy the administration appears to have cautiously considered that berdimuhammedows turkmenistan might prove to be less isolationist and authoritarian that human rights might improve and the country might seek to boost trade ties with the outside world including by building energy export pipelines assistant secretary of state richard boucher headed the us delegation to the december 24 funeral to signal this us interest in new beginning to usturkmen relations and to offer us assistance in reforms if theyre ready he called for smooth and peaceful transition of power but stated that the united states would not lay down blueprint of reforms for turkmenistan to follow12 he admitted that he did not have great expectations that the prospective presidential election would be free and fair but praised berdimuhammedows proposals httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22572 to reform education expand exchange programs and expand access to the internet as contributing eventually to more open society secretary of state condoleezza rice on december 28 voiced similar hopes of revitalized bilateral relations and us interest in advancing stable democratic and prosperous future for turkmenistan13 boucher stated that the united states would like to see turkmenistan be able to develop its resources its oil and gas reserves in market fashion that gets them market price for their energy thats where the idea of multiple pipelines multiple outlets and multiple options is really question of how to secure the sovereignty and independence of the nation14 some observers have warned that instability in turkmenistan could disrupt its sizeable gas exports to russia and since these supplies permit russia to export more of its own gas to europe such disruptions could have ripple effect in europe15 10 the turkmen ministry of foreign affairs denounced such criticism in russian media as not corresponding to reality and as provocative the ministry also stressed that the situation all over turkmenistan is calm and stable facilities and organizations are functioning normally and the people are provided with food products medicines and other necessary services wages pensions and allowances are being paid in time and social services are being provided properly cep20061229950018 11 slavomir horak turkmenistans succession welcome to berdymuhammedows world central asiacaucasus

political struggle continued crs6 such risk as well as the possible opportunities of turkmenistan more oriented toward the world economy might contribute to greater eu focus on turkmenistan as part of an energy diversification strategy turkmenistans minister of oil gas and mineral resources gurbanmyrat atayew on december 28 reassured foreign gas customers that the country was fulfilling its commitments on natural gas exports without delay and in full volume berdimuhammedow on january 5 2007 indicated an interest in enhancing turkmenistans sovereignty by diversifying its energy export routes including by building proposed transcaspian and turkmenpakistan pipelines some observers have criticized the administration for not pushing harder on the interim turkmen government to include opposition candidates in the election and for not moving to find and freeze any possible personal assets of niyazov in the united states they also have urged the administration to insist on progress in democratization and respecting human rights as conditions for closer relations16 underlining these concerns us analyst martha olcott has warned that berdimuhammedow may be insincere in promising reforms she argues that his aim may be to get western governments to pay less heed to exiled opposition politicians and to gain support for very nondemocratic constitution modified in very nondemocratic way and to validate an election in which httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22572 the electoral process was flawed from the beginning17 these critics also warn that turkmenistans participation in the global war on terrorism might change niyazov had supported usled coalition operations in afghanistan against the taliban and qaeda more prorussian leadership may join russia in calling for ending us and allied access to bases in central asia niyazov also had appeared successful in preventing islamic extremists from infiltrating from neighboring iran and afghanistan or otherwise gaining adherents however political instability in turkmenistan could increase the threat of islamic terrorism according to some observers18 congress has raised concerns about turkmenistans poor record of democratization and respect for human rights in hearings and other legislative action the 110th congress possibly might consider whether to boost or change the focus of us assistance if the berdimuhammedow government pursues reforms alternatively sanctions or other forms of disapproval might be debated if the berdimuhammedow governments human rights and democratization efforts remain inadequate other concerns may include the continuation of usturkmen antiterrorism assistance the possible extension of humanitarian aid to address purported turkmen food shortages and other urgent quality oflife needs and the possible impact of turkmenistans regime change on western energy security 15 continued instability rferl dec 21 2006 jeremy bransten turkmenistan energy analyst discusses
