certain requirements for income and age tax filer cannot be dependent of another tax filer and must be resident of the united states unless overseas because of military duty the eitc is based on income and whether the tax filer has qualifying child the eitc interacts with several nonrefundable federal tax credits to the extent lower income workers can utilize the credits to reduce tax liability before the eitc income from the credit is not used to determine eligibility or benefits for means tested programs however 19 states and the district of columbia now offer an eitc for state taxes and most of them are based on the federal eitc any change in the federal eitc would flow down to impact the state eitc policy issues for the eitc which reflect either the structure impact or administration of the credit include the work incentive effects of the credit the marriage penalty for couples filing joint tax returns the antipoverty effectiveness of the credit primarily family size issue and potential abuse ie compliance with credit law and regulations the national taxpayer advocate heads an independent program within the internal revenue service irs to handle taxpayer problems not resolved through normal channels and to identify issues that create problems for taxpayers as part of identifying problems for taxpayers the national taxpayer advocate prepares report each year to congress summarizing at least 20 of the most serious problems faced by taxpayers with recommendations to resolve the problems in the reports for 2002 through 2005 eitc related problems have been included among the most serious problems in the 2006 report while the eitc was not listed as specific problem concerns about the eitc and lowincome taxpayers are components of some of the

of eitc recipients childless adults and families with children because the credit is refundable an eitc recipient need not owe taxes to receive the benefits an eitc eligible family may also receive portion of the credit in the form of advanced payments eligibility for and the size of the eitc is based on income age residence and the presence of qualifying children

for the same period of time the filer with the larger agi had to claim the child2 beginning in tax year 2005 the eitc along with other tax provisions used by families child tax credit head of household filing status and dependent care tax provisions became linked to more uniform definition of child under the personal exemption tax provision changes made by the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311 the definition of child and the rules for when more than one party may claim child for these tax provisions are the same as the rules for the eitc in tax year 2004 however the interaction between the new definitions of qualifying child and qualifying relative may impact who could claim child under various tax provisions another change made by pl 108311 affected families in which the taxpayer or spouse is in the military although gross income for tax purposes does not generally include certain combat pay earned by members of the armed forces pl 108311 allowed members of the armed forces to include combat pay for purposes of computing the earned income credit for tax years that ended after october 4 2004 and before january 1 2006 generally tax years 2004 and 2005 the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 pl 109135 extended the option to include combat pay for calculating the credit through tax year 2006 and the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 extended the option through tax year 2007 the katrina emergency relief act pl 10973 provided that taxpayers affected by hurricane katrina may use their tax year 2004 earned income to compute their 2005 eitc pl 109135 also extended the option of using 2004 income to compute 2005 eitc to taxpayers affected by hurricane rita and clarified that to use this election the taxpayers 2005 income had to be less than

the requirements for head of household tax filer status to be eligible for the eitc was dropped by omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1990 this status was difficult for many lowincome working mothers to meet since many of them received more than half their cash income from afdc which is not regarded as selfsupport income by the irs in determining head of household status

treasury if the family has income tax liability as combination of reduced taxes and direct payments or as advance payments by adjusting withholding3 to receive an eitc person must file an income tax return at the end of the tax year together with separate schedule schedule eic if claiming qualifying child an eligibility certificate form w5 must be filed with the employer to receive advance credits through the employers payroll if the family or childless adult is eligible for the credit the credit is based on the credit rate which varies with the number of children and the earned income up to the maximum earned income amount the credit equals the earned income times the credit rate during this phasein period for the credit for each additional 1 of earned income the recipient receives an additional credit equal to the credit rate for example in ta x year 2007 for family with one child for each additional 1 of earnings up to total earned income of 8390 the family receives an additional 34 cents in eitc for earned income between the maximum earned income amount and the phaseout income level the eitc is constant at the maximum credit above the phaseout income level for each additional 1 of income the recipient loses credit at the phaseout rate in tax year 2007 for family with one child for each 1 of income above the phaseout level of income 17390 for married couples 15390 for others the recipient loses 1598 cents of eitc graphically the phasein period for the credit is steeper than the phaseout period because the credit is increased faster during the phasein than the credit is reduced during the phaseout in general the eitc amount increases with earnings up to point the maximum earned income eligible for the credit then remains unchanged fo r certain bracket of income the plateau and then beginning at the phaseout income level gradually decreases to zero as earnings continue to increase figure 1 provides graphic representation of eitc levels by income level for single parent family with one child 3 childless adults cannot receive the eitc through advance payments

as windfall to the government to reduce the impact of inflation on taxes certain tax provisions such as the personal exemption amount are increased each year by the rate of inflation the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 began indexing of the maxi mum earned income and the phaseout income levels for the eitc the structure of the eitc combined with indexing results in the largest annual percentage increases in eitc going to higher income eitc eligible taxpayers the effect of indexing on the eitc between year 1 and year 2 can be defined for four groups of taxpayers tax filers below the year 1 maximum earned income level will have increase in the eitc between year 1 and year 2 tax filers above the year 1 maximum earned income amounts and below the year 1 phaseout income level will have an increase in eitc equal to the change in the maximum credit amount the credit rate times the change in the maximum earned income tax filers above the year 1 phaseout income amount but below the year 2 phase out income amount will have an increase in eitc equal to the change in the maximum credit plus the year 1 phaseout reduction in the eitc the amount by which their year 1 income exceeded the year

earned or subject to tax economic theory suggests that the higher the marginal tax rate the lower the incentive to work to increase income the structure of the eitc phasein plateau and phaseout creates wide range of marginal tax rates for eitc recipients based on income the marginal tax rate for an eitc recipient excluding interactions with other credits can be broken down into four ranges that correspond to the structure of the eitc during the phasein when income is below the maximum earned income the marginal tax rate is negative and equal to the credit rate because for each additional dollar of income the eitc recipient pays income tax and receives an increase in the eitc equal to the credit rate times the additional income once the income reaches the plateau level the marginal rate is zero while there is tax liability and change in the eitc amount which is at the maximum during the phaseout of the eitc for each additional dollar of income the eitc recipient will pay taxes at the marginal tax rate and have reduction in the eitc at the phaseout rate creating marginal tax rate equal to the sum of the two changes this results in marginal tax ra that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate at the end of the phaseout of the eitc when the eitc equals zero the marginal and statutory tax rates for the taxpayer are equal figure 2 shows the statutory and marginal tax rates in tax year 2007 as income increases for single parent family with one child the marginal tax rates reflect the combined impact of the statutory tax rate and the eitc phaseout and do not reflect the use of any other tax credits

the nonrefundable tax credits which are taken against reduce tax liability include credits for education dependent care savings and the child credit to the extent an eitc eligible family has tax liability and can utilize one or more of these credits the refundable portion of the familys eitc is higher this is because using one or more of the tax credits reduces tax liability before the eitc but does not affect the calculation of the eitc for tax filers in the plateau or phaseout period of the eitc pretax contributions to savings for retirement education or medical purposes can increase the amount of the eitc by reducing the amount of earned income used to calculate the eitc in addition to reducing tax liability before the eitc if the contributions also qualify for nonrefundable credit this is because the earned income for the eitc like the income subject to tax does not include these pretax contributions as income

and to work more hours by increasing the marginal return to work after taxes this is because the eitc increases as work increases and is reflected in the negative marginal tax rate during the phasein range of the credit conversely the phaseout range of the eitc would create disincentive to work because the more the individual works and earns the greater the individual is penalized although the aftertax income is higher the individual not only has to pay taxes at the statutory rate but the earned income credit is reduced by the phaseout rate this is reflected in marginal tax rate for the phaseout period that is higher than the statutory tax rate in the phaseout range an individual may attempt to maintain level eitc by reducing work hours substituting leisure for work however many workers do not have the flexibility in their jobs to reduce hours alternatively the eitc can be viewed as wage supplement for lower income workers the wage supplement increases the hourly wage rate over the phasein range the supplement remains steady over the plateau range and over the phaseout range the wage supplement is reduced reducing the hourly wage down to the level actually paid by the employer in evaluating the work incentives of the eitc it is important to remember that all of the benefits and costs of work are not reflected in the marginal tax rate family receiving tanf benefits may be required to work stated number of hours to maintain certain noncash benefits however by working those hours the family earns income that may reduce other noncash benefits such as food stamps or housing allowances and may require additional cash expenditures for child care clothing etc studies on the eitc and labor force participation have concluded that the eitc has significant positive impact on participation in the labor force particularly for single mothers 6 some studies have concluded that there is negative impact on work hours at the higher levels of income but that the impact is not significant7 g15g138g155g155g146g138g144g142g561g18g142g151g138g149g157g162g561 the structure of the eitc may depending on the relative income levels of both parties impose marriage penalty 8

while the eitc is available at incomes above th federal poverty thresholds to the extent the eitc is an antipoverty program one goal may be to keep families above the poverty threshold or level the structure of the eitc with respect to family size has not changed since 1990 although benefits for most poverty related programs are related to family size the family size adjustment for the eitc is capped at two childr as result lowincome family with two children may remain above the poverty threshold because of the eitc while families with three or more children at the same income level and

when the internal revenue service irs as part of the taxpayer compliance measurement program tcmp released study on 1985 tax year returns with the eitc the study concluded that there was an overclaim rate of 391 this overclaim rate however did not reflect any later efforts by the irs to collect on the over payments later studies by the irs have resulted in lower over claim rates the 1997 and 1999 tax return studies 10 estimated that the unrecovered overclaim rates were 238 to 256 and 270 to 317 these studies presented the rates as upper and lower boundestimates because number of individu als contacted as part of the study did not respond the lower bound assumes that the overclaim rate for the nonrespondents is the same as for respondents while the upper bound assumes that all the nonrespondents are overclaims in the 1999 study 249 of overclaims with errors known were due to the child claimed not being the tax filerss qualified child the most common qualifying child error was that the child did not meet the residency test six months or one year depending on relationship the second most common was the child not meeting the relationship test particularly in the case of foster children where the child did not live with the tax filers for the full year or was not cared for as the tax filerss own child after errors in claiming an unqualified child errors in income reporting accounted for 214 of the overclaims most frequent income reporting errors were underreporting of earned income and modified adjusted gross income another 172 of known errors were for qualifying child also being the qualifying child of another tax filer as result of the overclaim rates there have been several legislative changes to improve eitc compliance among them are the requirement that dependents have identification numbers social security numbers prohibitions of 2 to 10 years on receiving the eitc after improperly or fraudulently receiving the credit for tax preparers due diligence requirements maintaining certain paperwork and permission for the irs to match tax filers to the federal case registry of child support orders maintained by the depa rtment of health and human services in addition some of the egtrra changes to the eitc definition of qualifying child and the tiebreaker rules rules for when more than one pe rson can claim child may help in the future to reduce these problems however the general rate of overclaims has not changed significantly since 1990 to reduce the complexity created by the different definitions of child proposals were made by both the us department of the treasury and the joint committee on taxation to conform the definition of child for purposes of the personal exemption child credit eitc dependent care and

expecting to claim th eitc would need to precertify that any child claimed for the eitc met the residency requirement had resided with the tax filer for at least half of the tax year the precertification effort was converted to study of approximately 25000 returns expected to claim the eitc and combined with two other compliance studies related to the eitc 1 study of filing status and

taken to complete examinations particularly exams conducted through correspondence with the taxpayer the taxpayer response rate for examinations and delays in the recertification process it is important to note that while including the time to complete the examination process an average of 181 days in fy2005 the taxpayer advocate noted that the time had declined each year since fy2002 when the average time for completion of an eitc examination was 220 days the taxpayer advocate service tas also did study of tas cases with refunds frozen by criminal investigation by the questionable refund program which is an irs program designed to stop fraud the taxpayer advocates notes that of the 473 returns selected for the study 75 claimed the eitc and that 80 of the returns selected for the study eventually received at least partial refund the taxpayer advocate has made several recommendations for the ci program related to the freezing of refunds including 1 that the irs conduct study of returns with refunds frozen by ci that were not tas cases 2 notify taxpayers soon after their refunds are frozen that their refunds are frozen and will not be released until determination is made currently taxpayers are not notified and 3 shorten the time period currently six months 11 for information on the new definition of child see crs report rs22016 tax benefits for families changes
