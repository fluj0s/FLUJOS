the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc clear procedure cch0 help lecture given on 5 july l958 thank you ive been informed were having congress down at the shoreham and i just found out about it and im little bit late but i wanted to come down and tell you couple of things ive learned lately if you want to hear them thats whats known as running the effects scale laugh the next two hours are going to concern themselves now that we have led up to it rather carefully going to concern themselves with clear procedure and this i trust if youre not clear already in the next few months this will concern you intimately okay i want to give you the rundown the exact processes and the commands in order toclear homosap okay alright the first things are the conditions of auditing first requisite preclear next requisite an auditor next requisite place to audit even if you have to make the space you have to have little place to audit in if youre doing this out in some other universe why remember that it might be universe around with space in it the state department i think has universe with space in it laugh theyre in germany all the time or some place now the auditor as i have talked about in the last hour should have pretty good idea of this thing called the auditors code and he should be pretty well drilled on his trs this isparticularly so of clear procedure because youre using processes which have teeth and if you flub on this one why its little more important flub than it is well recall time you communicated with someone thats fine recall time you communicated with someone recall time when eryou talked to somebodyaher oh i forgot to acknowledge you the last time didnt i ahemwell recall time recall time lets seewhats the command recall time when you said something youll still get away with it youll still get away with it running that process how could you help another how couldwhat was thatcommand ssssssst hand rising up pcs temperature laugh now the first process of course involves the session itself which is cch0 you must remember that there are some subprocesses that are sometimes necessary in clearing someone cch1 cch2 cch3 cch4 what are those processes cch0 of course simply opens the session its the various things that you ask you say what goal do we have for this session is it alright if i audit you these various preliminaries such as start ofclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help2 session you know lot of people forget that they forget to start session thats been going on for three or four hours and they all of sudden say say you know i never started this session lets start the session now laugh of course youve never done this chuckle some people talk and talk and talk and talk and never do start session but cch0 is merely the techniques involved in starting session thats the only thing that is involved in cch0 except one and that is present time problem now we get right down to auditing person to clear and this one we have to confront and take up all procedure being good all agreements being established and everything we take up this one present time problem we take it up at the beginning of every session nomatter how many sessions there are in clearing ill tell you why because the one thing that can keep profile from changing or iq from rising is present time problem present time problem by definition is some disturbance viewed by the preclear which is occurring in present time or the physical universe right now now you say his present time problem is the fact that he has birth engram in restimulation oh that is not present time problem because hes not being born right now you get the idea you say well the present time problem is hes been divorced several times and so forth and this is his present time problem this is what worries him well dont get the idea that what worries the preclear is present time problem present time problem is particular item its something thats going on in thephysical universe right now it has terminals it has location its disturbances are actual and the preclear can be so involved with it that he never gets into the auditing room and therefore he never gets any benefit from the auditing and youre wasting your time as an auditor because his profile demonstrably will stick right where it was until that present time problem is out of the room person has actually been audited for five consecutive intensives without the auditor clearing present time problem with slightest gain in processing that is the chief reason why there is gain on profiles because the preclear had present time problem and it was constant going on all the time auditing was happening and the auditor never straightened itout well the preclear is out there at the oil factory or some place or another hes not there in the auditing room now theres theres an interesting fact that you could absolutely stall clearing an individual by not handling present time problem you might be able to break the code here and there you might be able to flub process you might be able to run tr upside down and backwards and never acknowledge or something of the sort you still might clear somebody but im guaranteeing you will not clear somebody if you leave present time problem in restimulation thats how serious that one is its right there and its definitely part of clearing procedure now when you start to clear present time problem on preclear very interesting you say what are you worrying about what are you worrying about or is there anything worrying you or any other statement you care to make or question you care to ask on this sort of thing quite ordinarily will not be answered on serious present time problem in the affirmative the first answer that was very interesting so you say to the individual present time problem now do you have present time problem is there anything worrying you you say well thats fine we can get on with the session cant we chuckle if hes really up to here touching throat in enturbulance in the physical universeclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help3 hell say nothing worrying im all detached from it all im above such things of course i can go on being audited i can put it out of my mind you say well what can you put out of your mind well my house burned down this morning and my children are still there standing on the street but thats alright if i get audited i can take care of it little bit better so lets get on with it aw sometimes you have to beg for fifteen minutes to find one of these problems and find out what its all about thats the truth you have to sit right down and beg as an auditor to get this person to be honest enough to tell you that hes in trouble funny part of it is the present time problem very often will not seem very important he got traffic ticket this morning hes got to go down to court after the session it isnt anything sowe could let it go couldnt we you start auditing it and you find out its got bite to it and it will clear but supposing you neglected it then all during the session you keep asking the preclear what hes looking at now and what hes thinking about and so forth and he says oh nothing of course he says i see jail and policemen laugh quite fascinating quite fascinating an individual who gets then involved with plus randomity or minus randomity lets get real technical here whats plus or minus randomity well to people that werent in the first acc that werent at philadelphia you know they have trouble with this but its very simple minus randomity is bored stiff with nothing to do and plus randomity is going aroundin small circles that nobody could possibly do the banks of chuckle in other words theres too much going on or too little going on and the preclear considers it an abnormal state of motion either too little or too much and either one of these things is present time problem there is something going to happen well of course theres something going to happen if hes going to have dinner that night but he doesnt happen to consider that problem so its what the preclear considers it problem after youve beaten his silly head in to get him to admit he got one and its better to be very careful and very insistent much better to be very careful and very insistent than it is to just brush it off because the direction you can err is neglected you cant err in the direction of beating it to death unless as some auditor did theother day and id be ashamed to say who it was i told him there was probably present time problem on the case that wasnt flat so he ran it for five hours four and half hours after the preclear said it was totally flat and wondered then why the preclear remained out of session for the next two days in other words the auditing session became present time problem thats disobedience of the auditors code the process was longer producing change and the auditor continued to audit it ad nauseam this is pt problem run the wrong way pt problem run right is run very simply there are various ways to run present time problem how long do you run it until the preclear oh this sounds very funny sounds very funny to some practical get up and do individual until the preclear longerhas to do something about it thats how long you run pt problem i remember i was talking to you about spheres of influence in an earlier lecture the great oddity is if you flatten present time problem it quite often ceases to be problem in the physical universe not only does it cease to be problem where the preclear is but it ceases to be problem over here it is so much the case that we have one on record where the wife was dipsomaniac thats where they keep dipping into the old mans pocket book to run down to the liquor store and the preclear was audited on present time problem why wellclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help4 definitely it definitely was present time problem because the wife at the time the preclear was being audited had just got through busting up most of the furniture and so bit of pt problem the pc was rather disturbed and the auditor sat down and beat this thing through on what part of that problem could you be responsible for that is by the way the optimum technique to run present time problem if it can be run on the preclear sometimes its little high for him what part of that problem could you be responsible for is the exact auditing command and the only auditing command for clearing present time problem thats the optimum sometimes you have to get into invent problem worse than that problem or invent problem of comparable magnitude to that problem but these theseare these are things sometimes you have to run merely locational processes notice that wall notice the floor notice the ceiling to get the pc into the auditing room they cant even audit this pt problem its so strong its so fabulous but the optimum one and this will work on practically any case your working on if the persons conscious enough to talk to you it usually works and thats what part of that problem could you be responsible for well in this particular case the preclear was asked what part of that problem his wife could he be responsible for and he was run until he longer though he had to do anything about to or with his wife quite little while it took about three hours to get this one shaken out couple of days later the auditor asked him well hows your wife getting along how areyou getting along with your wife wife were getting along alright yes well just how it going you know pots and pans had been flying out of the window and furniture had been breaking up and bottles crashing on cops heads the last time we heard about this you see oh shes doing alright shes straightened up now this was reported to so i became interested enough to check into it at regular intervals for the next three four weeks she stopped drinking she wasnt audited he was audited but she was in his sphere of influence and she stopped drinking you very often find this sort of thing taking place so much so that we still have little test running running problems of comparable magnitude to hydrogen bombs we haventcompleted this process chuckle but were running this one on some people and some day why somebody will ask the defense department where do you have the hydrogen bombs stored and theyll say hydrogen bombs hydrogen bombs what hydrogen bombs see theres some dim possibility that if you audited this on couple of ots why atomic warfare would disappear now i dont want to give you any ideas and i dont want you running on anybody laughing now heres heres our heres our weve weve entered the field of magic and mystery right there as to how this sphere of influence can adjust around but the reason you audit it is so that it wont keep banging at the pc now you dont solve it you simply get thepc disentangled from it and evidently when he is longer party to it it loses the power to bite him in other words every time you have died i hate to go into that i mean the undertakers already have but every time something very bad has happened to you you had to consent to it first you had to consent to get getting finger cut off before it could be amputated sounds very funny but perfectly true it requires anyones participation and consent before anything can happen to anyone anywhere thats why when we say clearing is freedom from you certainly do get freedom from if you run out your consent to beclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help5 shocked maimed diseased and so forth if youre longer consenting to these things they dont happen isnt this interesting an interesting broad look at life that we get out of something weve had for years and years and years weve had this thing pt problem i dont think ive mentioned it very widely or very strongly i dont think its come up very often chuckle but pt problem is something that has more to it than simply getting session started youve stopped some portion of the physical universe from banging at this pc and it isnt so much that the pc would sit there and continue to worry about it as the fact that this enturbulance still evidently has the strength and power of entering the auditing room see from elsewhere if you get that as well as thefact that the pc would continue to be worried about it and be out of session you have more or less the truth of the condition that you would be trying to audit against if youre trying to clear somebody who had present time problem so this one you must handle and as i say the auditing command for it is what part of that problem could you be responsible for the first part of the process of course involves isolating the problem finding out what the problem is what is this problem now that that takes some doing i had fellow who was very nervous and very upset i looked at him i found his auditor i said hey what goes on here this person this person seems to be quite upset he isnt often that way well the auditor said i checked for present time problem i had him on meter and i checked forpresent time problem i didnt get any registry at all so i grabbed hold of the preclear and i put him on meter of course he didnt get any registry the meter was totally stuck just like it was frozen you could reach over and kick the pc which i did chuckle you got wobble on the meter well i guarantee that if you can get wobble on the meter the meter isnt going to tell you anything because it is stuck on what it is stuck on and you guess from there on out the only real liability meter has is you know something is wrong if the needle is stuck but the needle doesnt cooperate with you anymore to tell you what it is it just sticks harder but you cant see something that is motionless get more motionless chuckle now the pc didnt have much of pt problem he was merely going to be operated on thefollowing morning and didnt want to tell anybody in the organization it left with the problem of sitting there and having to take thirtyfive minutes of my valuable time and get rid of the necessity of an operation laughing this thank you the the situation with regard to session then does require that one now theres another thing that creeps all the way through session its sneaker ive had rather experienced auditor argue with on this one the only thing that will make preclear drop profile its funny thing i say the only thing its the only thing i know of though that will make profile drop during an intensive while youre trying to clear somebody is an arc break theres been break of communication the preclear longerbelieves the auditor is on his side theres been breakdown of their affinity their reality their communication and when that breakdown exists whether its real or imaginary the preclear believes its real and auditing continues long beyond that point you get depression of the profile in other words present time problem makes it stay the same but the arc break with the auditor makes it sagclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help6 i had an auditor recently say couldnt have been one couldnt have been one couldnt have been one i checked it over carefully thoroughly i said check it again the auditor checked it again and something on the order of four years ago out of session this auditor who was auditing the same pc that many years ago had said something the pc considered at that time an arc break and auditing subsequent to that time was depressing the profile thats how silly pcs are chuckle but it was there this auditor being careful auditor and good auditor of course checked it and checked it until it finally revealed itself and we had an advancing im sure an advancing profile after that the point is here that you could do something or the pc could feel that you did something or said something which was hostile and it breaks up the arc of the session in the original thesis the first book written on this particular subject the first published book on this subject 1947 it gives three equations so called the pc less than the reactive mind thats number one cannot solve or handle the reactive mind the pc is less than the reactive mind number two auditor is less than the pcs reactive mind and therefore just cant solve it auditor plus pc is greater than the reactive mind and so they can unravel it get the idea so as soon as you drop the auditor out in present time problem we drop the pc out as participant you see and with an arc break we drop out the auditor as participant as far as the preclears concerned and the reactive bank and so forth does not get handled thatselementary so these two things must be maintained the preclears cooperation must continue and the auditors arc with the preclear must continue and when these things dont continue then we get the whole thing going to pot the funny part of it is it is more important really if anything to have the auditor continue in arc with the pc than it is to have the preclear handling his own reactive bank because evidently the auditor can do it better than the preclear because when you drop the auditor out of the session and yet auditing continues you get reduction of profile reduction of the factors of capability of the case but if you just drop the pc out with present time problem you just get the profile staying the same now thats fascinating i consider it considerable commentary upon the necessities ofarc in session now another thing that you must do in auditing of course is flatten these processes you have to flatten them for this reason the universe and the people out there will sooner or later start flattening them or restimulate the unflattened process see how that could be and we get an unstable gain the pc was way up and then he went out and walked around in the society about four or five blocks and he went way down what would cause that the gain was unstable and it comes about because processes have been started on the case which have not been finished and the environment runs them only the environment isnt good auditor and so we get reduction of case in other words an unstable gain gain not holdingup is apparently caused by just this one thing of unflattened processes on the case only scientology can undo scientology quite interesting person has to be audited down scale to be pushed down scale but when process is half way finished was dropped when in full restimulation in an auditing session and then the preclear walked out into the environment and tried to do his job tried to work when he went through all of these things something clicked that process and it will run it the wrong way too and he gets bad auditing on the same process you see and the auditing is unintentional and it can reduce the profile itclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help7 doesnt however go below where it was in the first place now with these conditions existing auditing can exist on clear procedure without these things well theres reason to get superoptimistic because just auditing wont happen what does it take to make auditing happen it obviously takes good auditor and preclear who still thinks the auditor is on his side well how do you repair an arc break i ran an interesting session once this was the test session which established what havingness was in its manifestation for half an hour i ran process which was guaranteed to cut to pieces the mass and havingness of pc it was chosen with maliceaforethought as something that choked to pieces the preclears conceptof mass his concept of possession his concept of being anything anywhere anyhow and in view of the fact of being among friends i can tell you what process this is look around here and find something you could go out of communication with thats guaranteed killer now listen please promise youll only run this on psychiatrists chuckle now this was guaranteed to just cut everything to ribbons but i ran it for half an hour on this basis every time the pc would twitch or squirm or start to go little bit anaten i would say what have i done wrong the pc would say what have you done wrong you sure i didnt do something wrong as matter of fact couple of minutes ago there you when you made that noise it upset there had been noise but each time the pc could find somethingwrong and the session would come back to battery the pc would wake up the nervousness would drop out the twitchy feet would go you see how this is in other words i was patching up havingness with just one auditing command what have i done wrong and the pc was then permitted little by little to continue arc with the auditor even though the auditor although the pc didnt realize it was cutting the pc to ribbons the auditor really was doing something wrong the auditor was running process guaranteed to kill anybody and so it becomes important then to keep the pc in session and one of the best ways of doing it is to ask the pc when he appears to be upset has something gone wrong with session or have i done something wrong well now theres something you dont do you say what have i done wrong and then the pc says well moment ago there when you said that command and made the mistake and didnt give an acknowledgement there and dropped the book when you did that it why it upset little bit it distracted ill tell you what the auditor can do wrong at this point what he can do wrong he can fail to take responsibility for his action he can say well actually the book was just teetering there and you put it there when you came in the auditing room chuckle and youve got sort of an emanation coming off you that makes it very difficult for to remember the auditing command and its totally natural that i would make that many mistakes in other words the auditor starts to shift responsibility fromhimself to the preclear removes himself from the session the second he does that why you got it now he can run what part of that problem could you be responsible for the one shot command that doesnt work by the way is what part of that bank could you be responsible for isnt that nice command apparently worked like mad what part of that bank could you be responsible for what part of the physical universe creation or destruction of could you be responsible for he just went unconscious for some reason or another laugh obviously it was the perfect command very often we have perfectclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help8 commands originated and then without checking them of course we can always be right when we check them were sometimes wrong chuckle but the auditor has to retain responsibility for the auditing session while the preclear recovers responsibility for his past present and future and thats really what happens in this combination now given all these things the auditor gets to the most important process ever developed in scientology easily the most important process and some of the sharpest auditors around have not heard all there is to know about this process by one awful long ways and sitting right there will be very surprised with this process help the most important process ever developed why because running this process help will put intosession and make auditable people who formerly werent even vaguely auditable now thats just one test of it it splits valances it heals psychosomatic illnesses it moves ridges out of heads it exteriorizes preclears it does almost anything as single panacea process that you have ever asked of any process nobodys ever tried it that far they think its just something you audit in clear procedure to get it out of the road so that you can get on to something important like step six somebody said to very very recently i didnt have any idea help had that much breadth it makes the most lovely assist you ever tried to assist anybody with lovely assist person comes in in normal state homo sap you know got terrible hangover hivesyou want to get him back to battery something like that run help the test of help is that it shouldnt really be run on condition it should be run on terminals but if you can get away with running it on condition which is quite interesting gives you the command value of the process it handles something like tnt if you dont handle it right your pc has had it hes had it now what are you trying to do for pc youre trying to help him and the pc that never got gain in auditing is simply wasting this commodity thats the only thing hes doing he came to you for help didnt he he said oh im so bad off you know i have these horrible pains and these awful aches and i cant see and i cant smell and i cant talk and i want you to heal all up and so forth and ill pay you lot of money if you will dothis and get all this nonsense going on you sit down and you audit him he sneers and does the very things he shouldnt do and he fakes the process and so on what is he doing hes just wasting help he cannot be helped and herr doctor sigmund freud at the end of his 28th lecture i think it was said and these by us cannot be helped and these by us cannot be helped this is the one thing that made him sad there were several types of case that couldnt be helped by him he included the sane the insane the laugh but he said these by us cannot be helped now that becomes fascinating when you look this over carefully because it tells us definitely that the case that could not be helped is the case of course that cant be helped so you run help on him chuckle its one of these horriblesimplicities that is just painful in its stupid simplicity now the auditor who goes along and he audits somebody you know out of book and he says now what part of this problem could you be responsible for thank you what part of this problem could you be responsible for thank you what part of this problem could you be responsible for thank you and the pc says what did you say oh you heard the command laugh so we have an auditor who cannot help pc really whats wrong with his auditing he cant help preclears now in view of the fact that you run into anclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help9 awful lot of preclears who are anxious for just one thing to convince you that you cant help them you are liable to get the idea after while that you cant help them and this is what gets wrong with your auditing the only thing that gets wrong with your auditing is you cant help people now what about this help is it therapeutic to help people or is it aberrative is it right to help people or wrong to help people or shouldnt you go along in your own little cocoon sailing on the sea of idle dreams and let the rest of all that silly nonsense going on in the world just take care of itself is that right should you help it or leave it alone or what should you do about it well these are moral and ethical questions that have to do with youwhether its right or wrong for you to help somebody or not help somebody should however have bearing on the fact that you have an aberration on the subject of help you see there could be two different things whether you should or shouldnt help does not at all influence this other factor could or couldnt i cant help him the person who has bad habit is always telling you i cant help it laugh help you know is forbidden its illegal to help several things did you know that there are twentyfive illnesses that it is illegal to help in the state of california they are listed by the legislature of course nobodys ever asked this burning question this frying question i should say is the state legislature of california capable of helping anyonethats the aberrative side of the question dont you see capability of help is entirely independent of the duty or obligation to help these two things should be entirely different things and an individual cannot make up his mind on the rightfulness or wrongfulness of help so long as he himself is not totally clear on the subject of help now then fellows who run around and are criticized by their fellow man because they got to help everybody they got to help this or they got to help that theyre always helping stray dogs or theyre always helping stray cats i think some lady who can only help stray cats is still luckier than any policeman i ever met who could never help anything till the end of his days we are looking at the heart and soul of the upper dynamics when we are looking at helpbecause this is the woof and warp of association man is alive so long as he can help things and so long as he himself can be helped if he can do this hes alive and hes dead when he can longer help anything and nothing can help him that is new definition of death because really that is death when carried through to total absolute definition of death that would be the most absolute death there could be that wouldnt be death of body you understand just some light thing like that that would really be dead the funny part of it is everybody responds somehow and increases on help if it is run in this right fashion first you have to know about bracket whats bracket bracket is the number of ways or number of combinations that something can occur for instance acan give b stick b can give stick can hold stick for himself b can hold stick for himself b can hold stick for somebody else other than this person over here c can hold stick for himself or for b you get the number of combinations you just had an idea of stick being passed around and handed to one or another you get the auditing command that this is run in bracket i think somebody added up brackets one time and the highest series of bracket numbers i know about i think is 139 i think its something like that ways of runningclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help10 bracket what do we call bracket that means to cover all possible flows artillery term bracket throws the preclear out of the water now help is run in that fashion and the auditing command is again very simple command and it is other command it isnt invent way to help somebody thats not right its an asising type of command its command that really erases thoughts and old postulates and things like this you dont care whether youre draining somebodys bank or otherwise because every time you increase potential to help you increase havingness so you dont care whether you drain the bank or not the optimum way to run this theres just one way to run it funny thing when you say theres just one way to run it im talking now about clear procedure i know what i know about clearing people i know you can people to be three feet in back of their heads and they stay clear for two days i know you can run engrams until they can get used to running engrams and handle their engrams and to have to that degree clear and i know definitely this procedure is producing results when it is used with the provisos which im giving you and the help command is how could ____ help ____ now the blanks are filled in by the sides of the bracket in other words how could you help mother how could mother help you how could mother help herself how could you help yourself how could another person help mother how could mother help another person theres another oneout there how could another person help another person than mother we could keep on going out this way dont you see and we get these various commands we get these enormous brackets theres fiveway bracket nineway bracket it goes on up as i said theres 139 combinations garbled i think there are more than that that was persons name in england got that together for 139 which was page after page page after page and he says how many sides does bracket have shall i run all these on my preclear laugh five five will produce adequate results nine is quite safe you could get the listings of exactly what bracket is from an hco bulletin now how could ____ help ____ you understand you didnt ask him to dream up new way you didnt ask him not to dream up new way you just asked him more or less to tell you way now if youre allergic to people talking while youre auditing and it gets you upset too much there is an alternate command which is still workable providing you can police it and youve got him there on emeter good and solid and youre watching the meter you could say think of way to help mother think of way mother could help you you could actually run think of way but theres not any particular reason to because i dont think the preclears conversation is going to aberrate you more than he ordinarily would be if you were worried about it chuckle if you were worried about it it probably wont aberrate you any more than the garbled how could mother help you thissort of thing thats now how many ways and different combinations and so forth how many things could we run this on well you could say how could you help bacteria how could bacteria help you how could atomic particles help you how could you help atomic particles how could atomic particles help another person how could another person help atomic particles you get the idea how could atomic particles help themselves you can actually run that and get away with it of course probably burn up theclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help11 preclear but you could get away with it you get the idea help you have to settle this idea of help now what happens what gets wrong with help well there are probably many other things get wrong with it but the main one is you tried to help somebody and failed and after that you could think of only one thing to do and that was kill him probably all savage impulses derive from failure to have assisted anybody you want to kill you couldnt help in other words something gets wrong with the balance of help there is hate so pure not the hate of woman scorned but the hate of woman who wouldnt let you be helped or wouldnt help you or you wouldnt permit to be helped in other words theres going to besomething wrong with help for her to hate you now maybe it was so wrong with the person in the first place it was already wrong before they met but certainly something happened to key it in you wonder why youre having domestic troubles wife comes in says dear wouldnt you like to get your slippers and you say boy is she rubbing it in get my slippers hah i suppose this is fast touch for five spot something like that you say well wife shouldnt do that sort of thing shes been busy all day i feel selfconscious the idea of her in other words you got an aberration on the subject of help so you say dear thank you well couldnt i get you drink she says not thirsty dont bother yourself youre tired and youve been working all day and so forth just go sit downsome place youre tired and be quiet well what would you like for dinner oh anything anything few minutes later why you sit down at the table and she throws this plate of food on the table and says well i dont know where youre going but im going over to see mother for little while and you say whats wrong and then she and you are liable to figure out something else thats wrong see some other squabble it has nothing to do with this other sequence this other sequence was totally hidden this causation and you can remember that that morning something or other happened and you refused to let her do something of the sort or you accused her of something you know it will all build up on some tremendous oedipus here that had nothing to do with the actual activity which beganwith pair of slippers you watch it you watch it if you want to take your life in your hands just as an experiment for any given twentyfour hours make out your will give us your next of kin refuse every help offered you by everyone for the next twentyfour hours now that thats pretty wow theres some stories about people doing other things for twentyfour hours but this one would be suicidal everybody would be mad at you if they didnt practically destroy you you just refuse all help offered you actually its one of the more its one of the more interesting things to do laugh and if you feel tired of life why i advise it strongly i have unfortunately on two different occasions not meaning to at all having understanding of what was going on and not at that time having this process this process by the way was evolved for the hca manual which was never published and probably never will be i wrote the opening gun of it and i had to find the basic fundamental of auditing and the basic fundamental of auditing was of course help i wrote it down very glibly and wrote nice little essay and got it all set up and i got down to the end of the essay and i said just moment lets look this over again oh i said its not important and let it drift for three whole months before i really clamped on to it and made thorough going test and thenclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help12 psychosomatics started flying off and valences started breaking up and all sorts of miraculous things started happening with the use of this thing help i only had to work for about week to find the command it should be run with it was quite remarkable though it developed out of auditing itself now the individual the individual is evidently part and parcel of existence only so long as he can stay in an exchange of assistance with it as long as he can be of use as long as he can have game or goal or something common denominator of all these things is help now help goes over into something very interesting you really dont have dichotomy it isnt that you have help is plus and destroy is minus this is not true help goes into destroyyou get help destroy interaction and wherever you have destruction you had failure of help thats just as invariable garbled now this dichotomy works to this degree fascist regime comes in of some kind or another and they know how to make the populace help them give up produce and so forth they threaten to destroy them for instance theres one country i dont know its not very far from here it used to be great state garbled cave in they have income tax i think there and this this country this country threatens to destroy you if you dont give it some taxes see your taxes will help that government but their threat is to destroy you thats the only way they think they can collect they cannot help you theyre getting more and more laws forbidding them to help you you used to beable you could go in and lean across on the counter and say fix up my return then they scribble on for while and say oh thats alright joe and so forth and take small amount of money and that would be all there is to it now theyre running help destroy well helpdestroy goes just down to point where it becomes destroydestroy and helpdestroy will become destroydestroy so that you get helphelp help begets help and then returns help this is fairly sane and rather optimum then we get helpdestroy and then helpdestroy the other way and then destroydestroy and clear down here we get suborder of insanity the like of which well you people in this world of course have never experienced its called war doesnt ever doanybody any good any place and for years afterwards now days the victor is faced with the problem of helping the vanquished enough to wipe out the war and all you win is the right to help but thats all anybody ever wins now isnt it silly for somebody to fight for the right to help when all hes got to do is to help somebody and all hed have to do to help somebody without liability is to make up his mind that he was not necessarily destructible if he assumes that he himself is relatively indestructible then he is capable of helping everybody matter what they do but there are people around that all you have to do is offer them some help and they cut your head off i went into an institution and it happened two cases ive seen spin on this offered help proposition one girl walked up to immediately after the first phoenix congress and she said ive been told i should help you and i said well theres nothing for you to do right now and i just walked off and left she went out on the street and spun in was picked up by the police put into local spin bin garbled i wrote that down in the notebook as inexplicable and only what was inexplicable i thought for long time was there must have been some other event took place between my conversation with her and that spin there wasnt there is evidently other thing necessary ive known two such cases where it happened theyclearing course lectures 5758 5 clear procedure cch0 help13 offered help it was refused and they spun right in theyre on such delicate balance of being part of the human race that they spin right out of it when they get the least inkling of the fact that they cant be of assistance isnt that an interesting commentary this is how much this means to person this is how much of button this is but to you walk up to raving psycho and you say i want to help you well be sure there are axes or ice picks or anything around because hell finish you just offering help to him is enough for him to decide that destruction is necessary now you notice there wasnt single word i said there applicable to national government laugh now as we look over helpdestroy we begin to understand so much that for while as we look over the universe and find instances of this we tend to be overwhelmed but its good thing to do because almost anything equates into this helpdestroy curve almost anything it can be added up some part of it fundamental can be added up on help person gets up in fairly good state they can tolerate an enormous amount of help did you ever see little kid little suzette right now is going through period of not wanting to be helped she wants to be selfsufficient thats good thing good mechanism nothing wrong with it but i have eventually let her help things enough that i can now help her i dont think anybody else in the family can help her but i can help her why because i let her help i dont have to dream it up either shes gotten awfully good at it she gets bright and polite anddignified as long as i let her help something and of course there isnt any coordination between americas refusal to let children work and juvenile delinquency not much if you forbid them to help for years you wonder why then they destroy everything its inevitable the way to get teeners and so forth into an awful state and get them to destroy everything is to deny them the right to help so the biggest right there is is not the right to vote is not the right to freedom of speech or press or religion or anything else the biggest right there is in human rights is the right to help and now i just want to ask you one more question looking at this the index of willingness to help being the highest index in demonstration of clearing do you any longerdoubt my statement that those people in dianetics and scientology are the upper tens of thousands of the population of earth because they volunteered to help didnt they thank you end of lecture
