international education programsauthorizes variety of grants to institutions of higher ducation ihes and related entities to enhance instruction in foreign language and area studies flas this is one of the oldest us department of education ed pr ograms of support to higher education having been initiated as title vi of the national defense education act of 1958 this program reflects the special priority placed by the federal government on flas pecially with respect to diplomacy national security and trade competitiveness interest in hea title vi and other federal programs supporting flas has increased recently due to concerns regarding terrorism arising from foreign regions which are infrequently included in american postsecondary curricula although hea title vi authorizes several distinct activities approximately threefifths of the funds are used for two of thesenational nguage and area centers nlacs and flas fellowships this pair of programs has long been the core activity supported under title vi while the others are smallerscale supplementary activities intended to serve more specific goals eg the business and international educational education program or to support the two primary programs eg the language resource center program there appears to be broad agreement that interaction between american society and people and cultures from throughout the world is increasing steadily generating national security concerns involving nations large and small international education advocates argue that since it may be impossible to predict which nations will generate such concern in the future and substantial time is required to develop the necessary human capital it is important that ongoing support be provided from some source for instruction in all of the worlds significant languages and cultures however it may be questioned whether this support should be provided by the federal government and whether it should be focused on the nations colleges and universities on federally operated language schools or both it is likely that the 110 th congress will consider reauthorizing the hea major reauthorization issues regarding hea title vi include the follow ing should the federal government continue to support foreign language and areas studies in american institutions of higher education through hea title vi are hea title vi programs appropriately coordinated with other federal efforts to support advanced foreign language and area studies and should there be increased targeting of title vi grants on foreign languages and world

appropriation and the fy2008 administration budget request1 the authorization and appropriations statutes for hea title vi provide discretion to the us department of education ed in allocating funds among these specific activities the main constraints on this discretion include the provision of separate authorization levels for the parts b and c under which the title vi activities are organized most grants are made under each activity on multiyear basis with implicit obligations for future years the higher education amendments of 1998 pl 105244 authorized title vi at such sums as necessary through december 31 2005 the statutory authorities in the hea expired at the end of fy2004 however they have been recently extended and currently remain effective2 the last specific authorization was for fy1999 at 80 milli on for part 18 million for part b and 10 million for part c the hea also provides that more than 10 of part funds may be used for undergraduate international studies and foreign language programs 1 this information will be replaced by the fy2008 appropria tion and fy2009 request for each activity upon release of the administrations budget request for fy2009 2 the most recent

during the years of increased funding for title vi the funds were accompanied by numerous provisions in annual appropriations acts and conference reports which specify not only the general activities for which funds are to be used but the particular languages or world regions in which aided students are to specialize eg study of the arabic language or central asian nations the fy2002 department of educat ion appropriations act pl 107116 and accompanying conference report hrept 107342 included number of earmarks of the increased funds ie those above the previous years appropriation although omitting these earmarks the appropriat ions legislation for fy2004 the consolidated appropriations resolution 2004 pl 108199 and conference report pl 108401 retained provisions specifying the world regions and languages to which title vi funds should be directed the general stated purpose of this guidance is to sustain the investments made last year to train experts who have foreign language proficiency and crosscultural skills in the targeted world areas of central and south asia the middle east russia and the independent states of the former soviet union and provide new resources to build foreign language capacity and international expertise in these strategic world areas important to national security interests and other areas including southeast asia and africa the consolidated appropriations act 2005 p l 108447 and conference report hrept 108 792 contain constraints on the languages of emphasis or the distribution of funds among programs the act does earmark one percent of the total appropriation for program evaluation national outreach and information disseminat ion and 1500000 for an independent review of title vi programs to be conducted by the national research

in the 21st century the role of title vifulbrighthays in supporting national language capacity evaluated the impact of the foreign language components only ie not the area studies businessinternational education or other aspects of hea title vi as well as the fulbrighthays program administered by ed the authors of this report conclude that hea title vi support has been of critical importance to maintaining the nations capacity in the less commonly taught languages which have had now have and will have strategic importance for the united states at unpredictable moments for example the authors of this report found that ihes receiving title vi nlac grants enroll 59 of all graduate students in the less commonly taught languages and 81 of those in the least commonly

people and cultures from throughout the world is increasing steadily in some cases generating national security concerns involving nations large and small in order to respond to these developments it is deemed important that our nation should provide sufficient education and support to enable minimum number of people to acquire advanced knowledge of the language and culture of the worlds nations and regions which are of current concern in many cases foreign nations and cultures have attracted major national attention and concern relatively recentlyfor example afghanistan further since it may be impossible to predict which additional nations will generate such concern in the future and substantial time is required to develop the necessary human capital it is important to provide ongoing support for instruction in all of the worlds major languages and cultures and even many of the minor ones so the question is not whether support is important for instruction in critical foreign languages and cultures typically defined as those in which there is major security or trade interest and especially the subset of these that are infrequently taught in the nations colleges and universities rather it may be questioned whether such support should be provided specifically by the federal government and if so whether it should be focused on the nations colleges and universities on federallyoperated institutions which are dedicated to providing instruction to government employees or both the federal government operates two foreign language schools to help meet the governments direct immediate foreign language requirements the defense language httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31625g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g14 g138g151g144 g158g138g144g142g561 g138g151g141

foreign service institute school for language studies in arlington virginia overall the structure of title vispecifically the provision of grants to ihes to develop and conduct educational programs in specific subject areasdeparts significantly from the general approach of the hea the primary strategy of th hea is to provide student aid usually on the basis of financial need and to leave the selection of subjects to be studied to the students even most institutional aid other than title vi is focused on specific types of highneed institutions such as historically black colleges and universities not particular subject fields in contrast hea title vi provides combination of institutional aid to support instruction in specific although multifaceted field combined with fellowships limited to students in that field title vi is one of only two hea programs focused on specific subject areas and is the most targeted of those and as such requires particular justification 4 the primary argument supporting this departure from the general hea strategy is that advanced study of foreign languages and regions is of special importance to the nation especially but not only with respect to national security defense and economic competitiveness supporters of the continuation of subject areaspecific aid under title vi would argue that maintaining research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies is not only national priority but should be supported in both federallyoperated institutions as well as colleges and universities accessible to the nation at large the needs of federal employees are only subset of the range of national requirements for persons knowledgeable in foreign languages and cultures such skills are needed not only for national defense and diplomacy but also international trade and outreach activities to increase understanding of foreign nations and cultures among the broader public in addition the research necessary to expand understanding of foreign cultures or to improve methods of foreign language instruction is much more likely to take place in ihes than in federal institutions narrowly dedicated to intensive language instruction finally the quality of flas programs depends to significant degree on the development of linkages between american and foreign educational institutions and it is easier for colleges and universities to establish such ties than federal government institutions whose motiv ations may be suspected in some parts of the world in addition the support for specific subject area under hea title vi is not unique when the scope is widened to include federal agencies other than ed although few ed programs provide postsecondary institutional and student aid limited to specific field several other federal agencies provide support to ihes that is focused on providing instruction in specific subject areas on much larger scale than hea title vi examples include support for health care education and training by the national institutes of health and other agencies of the department of health and human services support for science and mathematics education by the national science foundation and the like each of these subject areas has been widely perceived as being of special national interest and therefore worthy of targeted federal support it might be argued that if sufficient numbers of students are interested ihes will provide adequate levels of instruction and research in critical foreign languages and area studies without targeted federal subsidies under hea title vi or other programs further if aid such as that 4 the other subject areaspecific hea program is title viia2 graduate assistance in areas of national need this program funded at 31

to some degree it might be limited to paying the startup costs of initiating instruction andor research in selected foreign language and area studies not as is currently the case paying share of ongoing costs of maintaining programs in addition more systematic efforts might be made to identify and utilize the language skills of recent immigrants to the united states from all parts of the world certainly colleges and universities are interested in offering very wide range of courses and programs and private foundations have occasionally provided significant levels of support for flas ihes foundations and corporations frequent ly provide funds or inkind support such as foregone tuition to match grants under several hea title vi programs currently however it is difficult for individual ihes to offer instruction in relatively rare but currently critical languages such as pashto or farsi proponents of title vi have argued that because individual institutions foundations or states would have insufficient incentive to provide funding for such studies they should be supported by the nation as whole for reasons of economies of scale without targeted federal aid under program such as title vi it is possible that ongoing support for such languages and world regions would be insufficient to meet national needs even with title vi funding it is possible that the level of support is inadequate or at least inadequately focused on current needs see below

g21g157g158g141g146g142g156g501g561 this report focuses specifically on title vi of the hea because this legislation is being considered for reauthorization by the 109th congress and because it is the largest source of federal support for flas in us colleges and universities and their students however it is not the only source of such support and it may be questioned whether title vi is appropriately coordinated with other related programs or whether some of these programs should be consolidated with title vi to improve coordination and efficiency in fact one of the stated purposes of title vi is to coordinate the programs of the federal government in the areas of foreign language area studies and other international studies hea section 601b3 the primary federal programs with

the nsep began making grants in academic year 19941995 early in the 104 th congress fy1995 rescissions were passed by the house of re presentatives that would have eliminated the program and returned

questioned whether these related programs should be consolidated or at least explicitly placed under the umbrella of coordinated coherent national strategy it is often assumed that efficiency is enhanced when separate federal programs serving similar purposes are consolidated especially if the programs involve potentially duplicative grant competitions on the other hand the importance of coordination among or possible consolidation of these programs may be diminished somewhat by the fact that the othe r programs discussed immediately above are much smaller in scale than title vi the fulbrighthays fipse and at least in the past nsep institutional grant programs described above are most similar to the activities funded by hea title vi they are already potentially coordinated in the sense that all three programs are administered by eds office of postsecondary education programs nevertheless coordination and efficiency might be further enhanced if these programs were fully consolidated or placed under single coordinating or advisory board although the nsep has several similar purposes its role of emphasizing national security needs and its service requirement for aid recipients distinguish it from the other programs discussed above as long as the nsep maintains these characteristics coordination might be more consistent with its purposes than consolidation with title vi and related programs at least with respect to the scholarship and fellowship programs currently such coordination occurs through representation on the national security educati on board of designee of the secretary of 9 for example such fipse grant along with funding from number of other federal programs and agencies has been made to the national foreign language center to support the development of langnet an online source for dissemination of language teaching resources see httpwwwlangnetorg httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31625g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g14 g138g151g144

with purposes similar to those of title vi may be questioned especially when the nsep has experienced substantial reduction in its trust fund which may call into question its longterm viability under its current funding structure since annual appropriations substantially exceed the funds earnings the gilman international scholarship program also provides funding for undergraduate students to travel abroad but lacks the national securityrelated focus and service requirements of the nsep particularly given its linkage to eds pell grant program the possibility of transferring the gilman program from the department of st ate to ed and incorporating it under the undergraduate international studies and foreign language programs of hea title vi might be considered proposals might also be considered to establis h multiagency board endowment foundation or other independent federal entity to coordinate andor administer all federal programs dealing with foreign language and international studies including the more extensive fulbrighthays activities administered by the department of state and possibly even the relatively small k12 foreign language assistance program authorized by title vd9 of the elementary and secondary education act esea 10 one function for such board or agency might be relatively longrange planning to attempt to meet both the federal governments and the nations needs for flas specialists in coordinated manner finally it might be questioned whether there should be increased coordination between ihes funded by hea title vi and the federal agencies which offer language instruction for example should there be some degree of explicit coordination between the targeting of hea title vi fellowships and institutional grants with the foreign language needs of

fellowship grant recipients for the fy20002002 cycle reflects balance among all of the worlds regions including several grants for study of such critical areasdefined as those in which there is substantial national security trade or diplomatic interest and which are infrequently studied in us ihesas the middle east and south asia but also numerous grants for study of areas such as western europe that are frequently included in ihe curricula without targeted federal assistance while the languages or world regions considered to be critical in terms of their national security or trade significance may vary over time and it would probably be disruptive and unproductive to substantially shift title vi funding whenever newly critical language or region 10 as noted earlier s 1799 107th

identify relatively stable group of languages or regions which are infrequently taught in american ihes on which title vi grants could be targeted to greater degree this raises the question of who should make decisions regarding targeting of funds on different activities languages or regionsed alone ed through an interagency advisory body such as the one which provides guidance on nsep grants new entity responsible for all federal flas programs and activities as discussed above or congress through authorizing or appropriations legislation as noted in table 1 several of the hea title vi programs require that federal funds be matched with nonfederal resources for this and other reasons it is frequently argued that the scale of federal support for flas studies under this program extends substantially beyond the level of direct fundingnamely that the title vi grants serve as magnet for additional funds from variety of institutional foundation corporate and other private sector sources through matching and possibly also quality signaling effects 11 nevertheless it may be questioned whether the scale of the hea title vi program however well targeted is adequate to meet national needs in contrast opponents of increased targeting of hea title vi grants on languages and regions deemed to be critical currently might argue that it is impossible to adequately predict what those languages and regions will be several years in the future the lead time between submitting applications and fully implementing new programs or the extent to which grants should be focused on any of them given this uncertainty it might be best they argue to rely largely on the initiative of ihes to develop and submit proposals for new title vi grants and to make grants to support study of comprehensive range of languages and regions as has generally occurred in the past rather than attempting to direct grants through central coordinating body it is difficult to quantify the level of such national needs in precise or systematic manner one regular effort to do so is an annual survey and analysis of federal language needs conducted as part of the nsep 12 which is linked to the award of scholarships fellowships and institutional grants under that program while this annual series of reports does not attempt to quantify the level of need for individuals with specific language or other skills it does identify large number of foreign languages world regions and disciplines that are of major national security interest and that are infrequently taught in the nations colleges and universities another study of such language needs has recently been conducted by the general accounting office the gao report which focused on 4 federal departments or agencies the army the state department the department of commerces fo reign commercial service and the federal bureau of investigation concluded that the changing security environment and the increasing globalization of the us economy have significantly increased the need for federal employees with foreign language skills these four agencies reported shortages of translators and interpreters as well as diplomats and intelligence specialists with critical foreign language skills agency officials said that these shortfalls have harmed agency operations and hindered us military law enforcement intelligence counterterrorism and diplomatic efforts 13 11 it is sometimes argued that the receipt of grants under competitive program such as hea title vi is perceived as signal of quality that may serve as magnet for more grants from foundations or other private sector funding sources beyond specific matching requirements 12 see httpwwwnduedunsepfederal_language_needs_2001htm 13 general accounting
