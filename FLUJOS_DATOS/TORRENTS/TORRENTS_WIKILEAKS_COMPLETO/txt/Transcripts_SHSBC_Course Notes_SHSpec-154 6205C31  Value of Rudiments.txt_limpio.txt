6205c31 shspec154 value of rudiments auditors tend to believe in the thought impulse system this is the idea that the auditors thought impulse is instantly and wordlessly transmitted to the pc so the meter reads then that is not the way you should be reading meter lrh has been doing research to see how vital how valuable ruds process is and how deep it will go if it is run as repetitive process we find that it is like trying to empty the ocean with small spoon that which is kicked into view by routine 3 is not kicked out of view by any repetitive process it is odd that this tremendous bulldozer 3ga wont run forward at all in the absence of these gnats flying at the back of it the answer to this puzzle is that the rudiments apply to present time and this universe now even if you get rud in on pc really solidly these rudiments processes are incapable of even dusting the gpm they will do only microscopic keyout if someone has gpm keyed in any repetitive rudiments process will do virtually nothing to it prepchecking can do keyout you can move it around with cchs but there are tremendous difficulties in assaulting gpms there is very effective process for cleaning up past auditing except for routine 3 auditing what didnt you know what didnt another know what didnt others know it is very lovely and effective it will sometimes do things for very arc breaky session but against lockedin gpm it has influence though it may look as though it is doing something repetitive rudiments processes can do things with the free track and whole track engrams that are not in gpms there is another good process multiple bracket on suppress what have you suppressed what has another suppressed in you what have you suppressed in another what have others suppressed in you what have you suppressed in others what has another suppressed in others when you start to run it you think it will clean up the whole track youd think it couldnt help cleaning up the whole track it makes you feel so horrible you could use invalidate in the same way and fail to reveal dont know same thing careful of could be very interesting but none of these processes is worthwhile as means of cleaning up the whole case this is because they are all thought manifestations figurefigure buttons what the pc has buried is the fact that his postulatingness is basically thinkingness it is on lower scale think is below effort on the know to mystery scale it is not postulatingness which is at the top of the scale none of these buttons will carry him through effort they just keep swatting him on the nose routine 3 processes are what it takes to get the pc above the effort band the pc is doing his figurefigure in the middle of the gpm masses he is getting his thinking dictated to him from circuits he is getting the word from circuit to circuit b from all kinds of conflicting and oppositional identities as you audit him you have to keep him from being alarmed and defensive about present time otherwise he is not up to confronting the effort and the masses he has large number of automatic thinks going these are all characterized under the existing beginning middle and end rudiments these buttons keep him so involved with thinkthink that he cant go upscale to get him to go upscale you need routine 3 processing this works by labelling and identifying masses which brings about differentiation among masses and gets the pc up to confronting masses your effort is not to get him to confront those masses it is to get the conflict of those masses identified and resolved any way you wish to do so it is actually pretty easy to do once you know what you are doing you can unhinge the almostimpossible balance of the gpm so that it can longer hang up and create itself out of the pcs energy the identification and labelling of the mass is the borderline between the thinkthink and the mass it lets the pc become aware of the mass whereupon it blows it is trick for thetan to confront the mass it is what mass to confront that is important when the pc confronts the anatomy of the gpm it disintegrates the way to get the pc into the gpm is with goals assessment see p 236 above on the theory on running goals in routine 3 the goal that the pc gets identifies the mass he is sitting in and when the pc gets it looked at it disintegrates goals assessment thus helps you identify which part of the gpm the pc is in it identifies the thinkthink that is going on and the principal mass that he has to get out of when you start listing down the gpm items all the pressures and electronics that hold the item in place start lifting so he cant stay there anymore he is not aware that he is in the item or being it he thinks he has to keep this one game because it is the only game he can play pcs are reluctant to get rid of mass because they feel that that is the only game around but the pc is really either not playing that game or having fun playing it when he gets his attention unfixated from that particular game he sees that there are other games around and he can start enjoying life he thinks he is in games condition but he is actually in nogames condition the only way you can boost the pc through the effort band is to permit the pc to have his full attention on the objects that you are trying to haul him out of if his attention is distracted by things in present time he has that much less attention free for addressing the task of going upscale through the know to mystery scale he feels that he doesnt have enough attention units to look at anything he is distracted by the thinkthink because masses with influential ideas are impinging on him rudiments processes have herding nonimpeding action the relationship of rudiments to routine 3 process is like that of hedge beside road it keeps the pc guided and heading forward outruds are like stones on the road ruds processes do not move the pc along the road they can retard the pc from going on if done wrong or if very badly done they can actually reverse progress with rudiments you collect all the pcs power of blowing things by straightening up his attitudes towards the auditor and the environment pc whose ruds go out gets recoil phenomenon if he looks at gpm then gets his attention jerked off he gets mass straight in the teeth the pcs attention acts as pressor beam it had part of his bank in focus and when his attention swept sideways it is suddenly as though you took the pole out of the hand of pole vaulter when he was half way up to the bar keeping ruds in includes not yanking the pc out of session this process of getting hit by something causes dispersal which causes the pcs ability to differentiate to lessen tremendously he confuses things and his anchor points are driven in the lower toned he is the less focussed he is or can be anyway and the more easily his ruds will go out even if he suppresses the outrud when an auditor has successfully put the pcs ruds in several times the pc will stay in session easily because of his confidence in the auditor he will learn that his attention can be properly directed by the auditor and that the auditor wont get him into trouble but dont get too cocky at this point the level of pc confidence adequate to prepchecking is probably not adequate to routine 3 because the stress in routine 3 is so great that the ruds have to be in much better and stay in well if the pc gets much auditing with rudiments out he gets more and more nervous so matter how little you expect from the session you should always get the pcs rudiments in in this way you will gain the pcs confidence that you can get his rudiments in and that he will at least get that degree of gain anyhow it is the auditor not the state of the case that makes the pc hard or easy to audit the first edge in may be difficult especially if there has been bad auditing that has made the pc nervous as time goes on however the tough pc whom you cant do anything with because he cant blow anything will improve as you gently and persistently get his ruds in shortsession him if necessary run something really easy so he has wins just get the ruds in little by little session by session as he stops being anxious about his ruds being in his needle will get cleaner clean needle should show up by the end of his second session you give him wins matter on what the first two times you get ruds in on pc you shouldnt expect the pc to respond well to rudiments check by the third time if the auditor got the ruds in thoroughly in all three sessions in the third the needle will be cleaner if that has not happened the auditor did not get ruds in in the earlier sessions the third rudiments check would be valid the fourth and fifth are still more valid rudiments are absolutely vital even though they wont move the gpm at all strangely enough the gpm also will not move at all without them
