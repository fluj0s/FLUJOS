nonmandatory introduction of the re solution with mandatory nonamendable language and specific expedite d fasttrack consideration although the immediate function of the withdrawal provision is to

submission of such quinquennial report and its review by congress congress can withdraw its approval of the wto agreement leading to the termination of the united states participation in the wto through the enactment of joint resolution disapproving the or iginal approval of the wto agreement the reasons for the disapproval provision are explained by the house ways and means committee as follows the purpose of this provision is to pr ovide an opportunity for the congress to evaluate the transition of the gatt to the wto and to assess periodically whether continued membership in this orga nization is in the best interest of the united states it is the desire of the committee not to leave this decision totally in the hands of the executive branch but to be active in determining whether the wto is an effective organization for achieving common trade goals and principles and for settling trade disputes among sovereign nations in the course of the fiveyear review individual members of congress can evaluate whether the wto remains on course as tradeoriented organization and has not expanded its activities to nontrade related areas congress wants to ensure that the united states can conti nue to exercise substantial influence within the wto and successfully promote goals that benefit american producers workers and consumers congress may vote on joint resolution di

withdrawal provision was added to the original draft of the measure in the trade subcommittee of the house ways and means committee prior to its introduction since the bill implementing th wto agreement was to be considered under the fasttrack procedure and hence could not be amended once introduced any changes to it had to be made before its formal introduction in mock markups in the relevant committees with both cong ressional and executiv participation the withdrawal issue came into legislative focus for the first time after the presidents quinquennial report of marc h 2 2000 but congressional disapproval action initiated in response to that report was unsuccessful see p 910 legislative procedure the legislation lays out specific expedited fasttrack procedure to be followed by the congress in the considera tion of the withdrawal measure to the extent that it differs from the regular procedure5 this procedure follows in the main the special abbreviated fasttrack procedure for the consideration of resolutions disapproving certain actions section 152 of the trade act of 1974 as amended 19 usc 21926 which has been modified with respect to the timetable for certain legislative steps by the provisions of section 125 itself the provisions of both section 152 of the trade act of 1974 and section 125 of the uraa are specifically defined as exercises of the

under the rules of the house of repres entatives the debate on overriding presidential veto is nor mally limited to one hour implementation procedure 1 implementation of the withdr awal by the united states 13 section 125 is not selfimplementing nor does it contain any specific provision regarding the withdrawal resolutions entry into effect presumably on the date of its enactment nor directive presumably to the president to transmit the notice of withdrawal to the directorgeneral14 nor the deadline for such transmittal this discrepancy was noted with some other relevant comme nts on page 4 of the house report on the measure as follows while enactment of resolution wit hdrawing congressional approval under section 125 would call into question the futu re of us participation in the wto it does not expressly provide for the pres ident to withdraw from the wto nor would the resolution put the united states in violation of its wto obligations15 2 wto withdrawal procedure the withdrawal of member from the wto is regulated by article xv of the wto agreement the provision requires the transmission of written notice ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32700crs8 16 for information on various aspects of th wto dispute settlement mechanism see crs report rs20088 dispute settlement in the world trade organization an overview crs report rs21763 wto dispute settlement stages and pending us activity before the dispute settlement body and crs report rl32014 wto dispute settlement status of us compliance in pending cases withdrawal by the withdrawing member to the directorgeneral of the wto which takes effect six months after the date of its receipt and applies to the wto agreement and all related multilateral trade agreements withdrawal from plurilateral agreements acceded to by the withdrawing member is controlled by the specific provisions of such agreements thus the withdrawal from the plurilateral agreement on government procurement unde r its article 10 takes effect 60 days after the receipt of written notice of withdrawal by the directorgeneral of the wto and the withdrawal from the agreement on civilia n aircraft under its article 96 12 months from the receipt of the written notice practical consequences whether or not the withdrawal resolution is adopted its mandatory consideration after its intr oduction can be expected to deal with various causes of dissatisfaction and in some instances frust ration that some members not all on the proponent side of the withdrawal issue feel toward the wto regime as in the debate on the withdrawal resolution intr oduced in 2000 see section of past activity on next page the salient arguments in fa vor of the resolution as put forward by its supporters in the debate are likely to be the encroachment on us sovereignty by virtue of us membership in the wto and submission to the obligations under the wto agreement usurpation of congress constitutional power to regulate commerce with foreign nations violation of the us constitution by implementing the wto agreement as congressionalexecutive agreement rather than treaty and more tangibly the perceived for the ited states adverse results of the wto dispute settlement mechanism16 in cases where the united states is either the complainant or the defendant again as in 2000 the opposition to the resolution is likely to argue that the wto has contributed greatly to the ex pansion regulation and transparency of international trade including that of the united states and that some deficiencies of the wto re gime as seen by the supporters of the resolution are nonexistent and their adverse effects exaggera ted and merely in need of reform rather than being sufficient reason for united states withdrawal from the wto in the event that the withdrawal reso lution is adopted and actually implemented by the united states withdrawal from th wto such withdrawal would on the most general level exclude the united states from participation in an international multilateral system of trade rules and practices which initially in the general agreement on tariffs and trade of 1947 wa s formulated and promoted principally by the united states itself since then it has been greatly expanded in the form of the wto agreement likewise with the ited states partic ipation and under its leadership into worldwide comprehensiv code of rules covering most aspects ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32700crs9 international trade this c ode has radically reduced ta riff and nontariff obstacles to free flows of world commerce in goods and services and provided forum for settling international trade disputes us withdrawal from the wto also would likely erode the us leadership position in international trade relations and thereby possibly put strain on the c ohesiveness of the organization on more specific functional level the withdrawal would relieve the united states from the obligations stemming specifically from the wto agreement but also preclude it from benefitting from its rights under the agreement particularly from access to wto dispute settlement mechanis m except for that access however this exclusion from the wto regime would in practice be likely to result in very limited selective changes in the united states position in international trade at least in the short run on the us side most obligations under the wto agreement have been enacted by the uraa as general us dom estic law and would not be automatically repealed by the withdrawal resolution to th at extent they would continue to apply not only to wto members but to us trad ing partners in gene ral some provisions of the wto agreement have been substantively in effect on the basis of earlier also generally applicable legisla tion others have been ame nded or newly enacted by the uraa again as generally applicable domes tic legislation such applicability would not cease due to the us withdrawal from the wto similarly those us present rights unde r the wto ie obligations of other wto members toward the united states wh ich are reflected in those countries generally applicable statutes or regulations would not cease to apply to the united states in either case appr opriate action in the united states by new legislation would need to be taken to nullify their reciprocal applicability if the united states withdraws from the wto its trade relationships with number of countries could tinue to be regulated by earlier bilateral compacts with them substantially less comprehensive than the wto which are still in force but currently suspended while both parties are members of the wto and by later agreements not related to the wto eg freetrade agreements within these parameters the united states but also all other wto members would be free of any restraint that is now mandated by wto rules if they wished to take any adverse action against each other by acting in such manner however they would be open to unrestraine d retaliation and c ounterretaliation wit hout recourse to the established wto mediatory or conciliatory procedure in this context us withdrawal from the wto would result in major disadvantage for the united states the loss of access to the wto dispute settlement mechanism with the concomitant loss of potential wto approval of wtolegal retaliatory action on the part of the united states in the event that the challenged us measure could have been found not to be in violation of wto rules httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32700crs10 17 us congress house committee on ways and means future of the world
