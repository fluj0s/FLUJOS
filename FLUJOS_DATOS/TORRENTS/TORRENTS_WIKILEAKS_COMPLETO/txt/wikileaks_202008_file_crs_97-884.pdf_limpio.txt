specialist in labor economics domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97884longer overtime hours the effect of the rise in benefit costs summary anecdotal accounts of the increased encroachment of regularly scheduled overtime on employees family or social lives and the heightened use of overtime at manufacturers who have not rehired all their employees let go during the 19901991 recession have suggested to some observers that it may have become cheaper for firms to extend work hours than to hire additional employees between 1956 and 1963 manufacturing workers put in an average of 25 hours of overtime in the next 29 years overtime at factories lengthened less than 2 minutes per year on average to 34 hours week between 1993 and 1999 in contrast overtime hours expanded an average of almost 13 minutes per year to 49 hours week although millions of jobs were created in nonmanufacturing industries during the 1990s some contend that more people would have been hired had change not occurred in the employment hours calculation of firms all other things being equal firm makes its employmenthours calculation based on the least cost combination of the number of workers and the number of hours per worker factor thought to influence this optimal combination is the per employee quasifixed nonwage cost of labor the higher these costs relative to total labor costs or the higher these costs compared to the overtime wage rate the more likely firms are to substitute longer hours for new jobs peremployee costs which do not vary with the number of hours employees work include employer spending associated with employee hiring and firing eg training and severance and with certain benefits eg health insurance as studies of the relationship between the use of overtime hours and quasifixed nonwage labor costs have produced mixed results claims about the jobcreating effectiveness of increasing the fair labor standard acts flsa overtime premium should be viewed with caution the coincidence of more overtime and little factory job growth could prompt proposals to raise the flsas overtime premium or to shorten its standard workweek these measures might not create as many jobs as expected if firms substitute capital for labor in the production process or if they pass the increase in labor costs on to consumers through higher prices which could then prompt decrease in product demand and employment the unemployment rate also might not fall as much as anticipated if workers whose hours are curtailed moonlight to maintain earnings or if the unemployed lack the skills needed for newly created jobs some could argue that because mismatch already exists between job openings and jobseekers at this point in the business cycle the government should take action others might seek to have mandated benefit costs curbed workers compensation is more state than federal program and there are many factors besides stateset benefit levels and eligibility rules that affect the cost of the program to employers social security because of its fairly high taxable wage ceiling is largely variable perhour rather than fixed peremployee cost which means cutting payroll

negotiators to settle on new terms in expiring collective bargaining agreements led to lengthy strike in august 2000 that renewed interest in employers seemingly increased use of overtime in this instance the concern about working longer hours chiefly was portrayed in the media as making it difficult for people to balance work and family responsibilities in other words it was reported that the telecommunications company regularly and with little notice required employees to put in overtime which in turn caused them to alter day care arrangements or make other lastminute changes in family or social activities previously some observers noted that manufacturers had employees working more overtime while little job growth meant that factory employment did not regain its prerecession level by the end of the 1990s although many millions of jobs have been created in nonmanufacturing industries during the rebound from the 19901991 recession these individuals believe that even more people would be hired if change had not occurred in the employmenthours calculation of firms an explanation that has been offered for employers greater reliance on overtime hours is the increase in employee benefit costs compared to overtime costs about 6 decades ago congress set the overtime premium that firms must pay employees for working more than 40 hours week in the fair labor standards act flsa at 1½ times covered workers straighttime wage rate this report examines whether employers did in fact rely more on overtime in the 1990s than in earlier decades it then explores why overtime hours might fluctuate in the shortrun and why they might have increased in the longrun the report concludes with an analysis of whether raising the flsas overtime premium implementing worksharing or curbing the growth of legally required employee benefits would prompt firms to create more jobs the trend in overtime hours worked statistics on overtime hours are regularly collected for only production workers in manufacturing industries who account for small share of total employment in 1999 for example production workers in manufacturing industries made up just 12 of all employees on private nonfarm payrolls and just 14 of all production or nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls1 while one should therefore be cautious about extrapolating the overtime versus employment experience of factoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97884crs2 workers to other sectors of the economy the previously mentioned labormanagement dispute at major telecommunications company suggests that the following

overtime hours worked in manufacturing industries has been on rising trajectory as shown in table 1 overtime among factory workers was less than 3 hours per week from 1956 through 1963 it then rose to and generally remained in the 3hour range from 1964 to 1992 overtime did not exceed 4 hours per week until 1993 and has remained in the 4hour range since then employers increased reliance on overtime becomes clearer when the same data are looked at in another way factory workers put in an average of 25 hours of overtime in the first 8 years 19561963 of the period under consideration during the next 29 years 19641992 overtime lengthened by just 09 hours or 03 hours less than 2 minutes per year on average to 34 hours per week overtime among manufacturing workers then soared by 15 hours per

finance v 32 2 summer 1992 p 53 hereafter cited as golden unions nonwage labor costs and the character of labor market adjustmentshortrun explanations not unexpectedly the fluctuations in employers use of overtime coincide with the ups and downs of the business cycle during recession eg 19571958 1960 1961 19691970 19731975 19811982 and 19901991 employers faced with declining demand for their products cut back on the use of labor both in terms of the number of employees and the number of standard and overtime hours for some period after recession ends and product demand is on the rise firms work their current employees longer hours rather than invest in new plant and equipment or in human capital until they feel fairly certain that good economic conditions will continue businesses do not want to incur the quasifixed labor costs associated with recalling laidoff employees or hiring new employees2 quasifixed nonwage labor costs are onetime expenses which firms incur when they hire or fire workers eg initial training costs as well as severance and supplemen tal unemployment payments and ongoing expenses which firms incur while an employee is on the payroll that vary less than proportionately with the number of hours the employee works eg health insurance premiums and pension contributions the distinction between quasifixed and variable labor costs then is that the former are not fully adjustable when employers alter hours of work through overtime or shortened shift lengths3 the concept of quasifixed nonwage employment costs will be addressed more fully later in the report in addition to the business cycle explanation for the shortrun variability of overtime hours firms might use overtime to avoid the reduced output that could otherwise result from employee absences equipment problems or strikes they might also have their employees work longer hours to fill unexpected rush orders placed by customers or to meet recurring seasonal spikes in demand eg christmas and summer holiday periods the impetus to use overtime for these reasons would seem to arise intermittently and at varying times in different industries unless these factors have become increasingly prevalent over the years and increasingly pervasive across manufacturing industries they have not likely contributed much to overtimes long term rise in the nations factories longrun explanations it has been suggested that since the 1980s manufacturers have tried to keep inventories below historical levels and to instead meet fluctuations in demand through justintime production schedules the fairly recent initiation of justintime production might thus be contributing to some of the escalation in manufacturershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97884crs4 4 from 1979 to 1989 cyclical peaks

george allen continuedreliance on overtime in the 1990s4 this practice is not likely to have affected the work schedules of employees in nonmanufacturing industries because their goods and services could byandlarge never be stockpiled however the belief that to remain competitive businesses must be able to suit their customers schedules eg making cable television repair calls in the evenings and on weekends appears to have become increasingly widespread in recent years all other things being equal firm makes its employmenthours decision based on the least cost combination of the number of workers and the number of hours per worker this optimal combination is achieved when for given increase in output the marginal ie additional cost of hiring one more employee equals the marginal cost of working current employees one more hour factor widely regarded as influencing the optimal combination is the peremployee ie quasifixed nonwage cost of labor increases in the share of total labor costs that is more affected by changes in employment levels than by changes in hours worked create an incentive for costminimizing firms to lengthen the workweek rather than expand employment and higher quasifixed nonwage labor costs compared to the overtime wage rate raises the likelihood that employers will substitute overtime for additional hiring5 nonwage employment costs that largely are independent of the number of hours worked include employers expenditures associated with employee turnover eg the cost of recruiting processing and training new employees or terminating current employees turnover costs typically are not included in empirical analyses because of the paucity of comprehensive data on all its elements eg on employee orientation or on litigation for example it has been asserted that firms have become increasingly reluctant to hire new employees because new laws or regulations have enabled more groups of workers to sue them or to bring complaints against them before government agencies concerning why the individuals were not hired or were terminated6 nonwage employment costs that largely are independent of the number of hours worked also include employers expenditures associated with certain employee benefits although there is standard definition of benefits the following supplements to wages often are regarded as such paid rest and lunch periods wash up time travel time setup time etc pay for time not worked eg for vacations holidays personal illness and family leave health retirement and life insurance legally required payments eg unemployment and workers compensation and social security benefits and other eg child care and employee discounts as well as meal and housing allowances7 not all of these benefits are quasifixed

1982 p 15 10 ibidemployee costs some benefits have both fixed and variable perhour elements8 which complicates their treatment for researchers and for policymakers according to the us chamber of commerce and the us bureau of labor statistics employer costs for employee benefits increased from less than 3 of total compensation wages and salaries plus supplements in 1929 to almost 30 today for the employer cost of employee benefits to be an explanatory factor in overtimes longterm growth it is not sufficient for it merely to have increased this cost must also have risen more sharply than the marginal cost of overtime in other words the ratio of the marginal cost of benefits to the marginal cost of overtime would have to be higher today than in the past to have induced firms to utilize their existing workforces more intensively rather than hiring from the external labor market in number of economic analyses researchers found strong positive relationship between the use of overtime hours and peremployee benefit costs relative to the overtime wage rate these studies suggest that employment might rise by at most between 03 and 40 however these estimates are larger than the actual employment gains that would result since many of the assumptions upon which they are based prove to be invalid9 the following are among the unrealistic assumptions some of which will be elaborated on later in this report hours and workers are perfect substitutes in the production process straighttime hourly wages and fringe benefits are constant employees will not moonlight and labor is homogenous evidence of statistical problems with the studies also calls into question the confidence that should be placed in these results an analysis which attempted to overcome some of these limitations produced mixed results an increase in the overtime premium would decrease overtime hours at nonmanufacturing establishments but have effect at manufacturing establishments in the case of manufacturers an increase in quasifixed benefit costs was found to decrease overtime10 one explanation offered for the statistically insignificant relationship between the overtime wage and hours in manufacturing is that the production process of manufacturers might make employment less substitutable for hours than is true in nonmanufacturing industrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97884crs6 11 ibid p 23 12 golden

14 exemptions are narrowly defined under the flsa examples of groups of employees exempt from the acts overtime premium include executives managers and professionals outside salespersons employees in certain computerrelated occupations and of certain seasonal amusement or recreatio nal establishments agricultural workers motion picture theater employees and casual babysitterspersons employed as companions to the elderly or infirm and some commissioned employees of retail or service establishmentsdepending on the specification model used the researchers estimated maximum employment gains from raising the overtime premium to double time of 05 to 15 in manufacturing and 08 to 18 in nonmanufacturing firms the economists cautioned that the failure to find statistically significant negative relationship between change in the overtime wage rate and overtime hours in manufacturing should reduce confidence in the belief that an increase in the overtime premium would lead to substantial reduction in the use of overtime hours in united states manufacturing11 another study which did not separately analyze manufacturers and nonmanufacturers similarly failed to find that the flsa has spurred job growth by curbing the use of overtime12 as previously noted the abovedescribed analyses assumed that the hourly wage remains constant when the overtime premium is changed however assuming that employees and employers have agreed upon combination of total weekly hours and weekly earnings hike in the overtime premium could leave both weekly hours and earnings unchanged if employers are able to sufficiently reduce the straighttime wage rate in other words under this hypothesis raising the overtime premium would not create additional jobs13 the results of this analysis suggest that hourly wage adjustments occur but not to the extent the employment effect is completely offset nonetheless decreases in the straighttime hourly wage of workers earning above the federal or state minimum wage could limit the jobcreating effectiveness of raising the overtime premium14 policy implications variety of implications for job creation could be drawn from the forgoing theoretical and empirical discussion they range from government changing the costs of overtime and of benefits to initiating worksharing to congress taking action to spur job growth in an economy with the lowest

the overtime premium some observers might recommend that the flsa be amended to raise the premium for working more than 40 hours in week from oneandahalf times covered nonexempt employees straighttime wage rate in order to discourage employers from regularly scheduli ng overtime and thereby to encourage them to spread to or share with unemployed workers the available hours of employment proposals to increase the overtime premium have been made in the past15 with their proponents arguing that its deterrent effect has been eroded since its impositions some 6 decades ago by the growth in employer costs for employee benefits16 how well an increase in the overtime premium might succeed at creating more jobs or at lowering the unemployment rate is questionable not all of the now regularly scheduled overtime hours might translate into new jobs particularly fulltime jobs because of the reactions of employers and employees to the policy change if firms substitute new employees for overtime hours compensation costs per hour worked would rise because of the previously discussed quasifixed nonwage employment costs as consequence firms might reduce their demand for workers and increase their use of now relatively less expensive capitalfirms might pass the increase in their labor costs on to consumers through higher prices if consumers responded by cutting back on purchases firms might then curtail output and employment raising the overtime premium would increase the amount of money that firms could save if they did not comply with the federal law the rate of noncompliance might rise as result which would lower the amount of job creation associated with the policy changeif the premium increase prompted firms to cut back their use of overtime the earnings of employees who formerly worked the extra hours would fall these workers might decide to moonlight ie take second jobs to maintain their prior earnings level which would reduce the number of new jobs potentially available to unemployed individuals employers in order to minimize the fixed labor costs associated with substituting new employees for overtime hours might create part time jobs because they typically offer fewer benefits than fulltimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97884crs8 17 an analysis by statistics canada estimated that the mismatch between job qualifications and unemployment workers qualifications would reduce the jobcreating effect of limiting overtime hours from 169000 to 93000 private sector jobs in novembe r 1995 the geographic mismatch of jobs created and qualified

september 1 1996jobs and the moonlighting workers mentioned above might fill some of these parttime positions moreover the very heterogeneity of labor could limit the potential employment gain or unemployment reduction associated with an increase in the overtime premium the skills of those who work overtime and the skills of the unemplo yed would have to be similar in order for the latter to adequately function as substitutes for the former if there were skills mismatch between the two groups it would reduce the employment effect of the policy change17 comparison of the characteristics ie education age and occupation of those unemployed and those working longer than 40 hours per week in march 1992 found the two groups to be quite different18 this last point is likely to be especially relevant in the current economic climate when the unemployment rate has been at its lowest level in three decades because the nation has experienced considerable job growth since the 19901991 recession firms that have wanted to expand output and employment in this extremely tight labor market have had to hire workers further back in the unemployment queue as these new hires likely are less productive ie contribute less additional output than those already holding jobs they raise the firms cost of production the cost of labor will rise even further if in response to skill imbalances or shortages firms compete for qualified workers by bidding up compensation instead of the unemployment rate falling much below its current level wages and prices could rise possibly prompting the federal reserve board to raise interest rates in order to slow the rate of economic and employment growth consequently other observers might argue that the government should take action to promote additional job growth despite firms increased reliance on overtime work initiating worksharing another means that some have advocated to spread employment across more members of the labor force is lowering the number of weekly hours per employee at single firm this shortening of peremployee work time commonly is referred to as worksharing in the united states worksharing might take the form of reducing thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97884crs9 19 see legislation in footnote 15 20 the latter form of worksharing has been used by some states the unemployment insurance ui system favors adjustment to demand through layoffs rather than through reduced peremp loyee hours shorttime compensation programs have tried to preserve jobs and offset the ui systems bias against worksharing by allowing employees whose hours were cutback to receive partial unemployment benefits 21 hunt jennifer hours reduction as worksharing brookings papers on economic activity 11998 22 freeman richard b worksharing

40houraweek standard19 or of implementing programs to preserve as opposed to create jobs in periods of deficient demand20 worksharing has gained more interest abroad than in the united states where in recent decades the jobless rate has been lower and where unions have relatively fewer members21 as in the case of raising the overtime premium the effectiveness of worksharing at creating jobs is affected by differences in the skill mix of workers and by the reactions of employers and employees to cutback in work time according to review of studies that looked at the relationship between reduced hours and employment or output the bulk of the nonexperimental evidence suggests that worksharing can raise employment through the substitution of bodies for hours however most of the evidence is generated by employer and employee interactions not by governmental intervention in markets employers and employees may respond differently to stateimposed hours reductions or reductions in hours negotiate d by union and management than to changes that arise from their own initiative in addition most of the studies do not explore the possible effects of worksharing on hourly pay effects that can be crucial to its impact on employment22 an increase in hourly pay to maintain annual earnings in response to decrease in an employees standard hours at given firm would limit worksharings ability to spur job creation so too would currently employed workers refusal to curtail total hours those employees who already are at or above their desired level of hours when worksharing is instituted might demand little or nothing in the way of compensation for shortened workweek however those employees who are working fewer hours than they would like might demand an increase in the straight time hourly wage or might choose to moonlight either one of these actions would dampen the impact of worksharing on the unemployed restraining benefit costs rather than focusing on the hours side of the equation other interested parties might urge that the rate of increase in benefit costs be curbed in order to promote greater job growth federally mandated benefit programs include workers compensation wc social security ss and unemployment insurance uihttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97884crs10 23 hart working time and employment p 274congress historically has had very limited role in the wc program it sets rules only for federal maritime and railroad employees thus the program is largely mandated by state not federal law wc costs under the state systems are affected by number of factors only two of which the level of benefits and rules for proving eligibility of benefits are directly controlled by state governments other important factors include the return on insurance company investments the majority of program costs are financed through private insurance companies employers injury experience the riskiness of the covered employment changes in medical costs workplace safety and in payroll size the extent of regulation by state insurance commissioners and the degree to which companies choose to selfinsure because numerous factors influence the cost of wc states would likely have to make relatively major changes in benefit levels or eligibility rules in order to have much of an impact on employer expenditures with respect to ss it is unlikely that congress would want to reduce the cost to employers because that would mean less revenue to pay for retirement and health benefits for the elderly programs expected to experience increasing financial strain in the coming years as the babyboom generation leaves the labor force moreover as previously mentioned some benefits are mixture of perhour variable and per worker fixed costs the employers ss contribution is largely variable cost because employees typically have earnings below the programs maximum taxable wage ceiling in other words the amount of employers payroll taxes vary directly with the number of hours worked by and hence wages paid to employees up to the programs earnings ceiling therefore it is unlikely that reduction in firms payroll taxes would provide incentives to create new jobs based on the underlying theory it is average hours rather than employment that may rise as result of cuts in taxes23 in contrast the federal unemployment tax rate is assessed against fairly low earnings level the federal share of the tax to finance the ui program thus is byand large fixed cost for employers economic theory suggests that changing the programs financing structure by increasing the federally set wage ceiling and correspondingly decreasing the tax rate would make the program more of variable cost to firms and therefore reduce employers propensity to substitute hours for jobs however much of uis financing is determined at the state level where such factors as experience rating as well as differing taxable wage bases and tax rates greatly affect the actual cost of the program to employers
