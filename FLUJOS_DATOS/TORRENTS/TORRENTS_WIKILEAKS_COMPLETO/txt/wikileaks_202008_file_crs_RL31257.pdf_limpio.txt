the us copyright act 17 usc 1201 1205 entitled copyright protection and management systems section 1201a1 prohibits any person from circumventing technological measure that effectively controls access to copyrighted work while the antitrafficking provisions of 1201a2 and b1 cover those who traffic in technologies designed to circumvent access control devices protecting copyrighted material from unauthorized copying or use civil remedies and criminal penalties are established since enactment the copyright protection and management provisions ie the anticircumventio n provisions have proven controversial critics argue that the dmca has chilling effect on rights of free speech university professor edward felten who decrypted software protecting digital music was threatened with liability

treaties both of which contain language obligating member states to prevent circumvention of technological measures designed to protect copyrighted works and to prevent tampering with the integrity of copyright management information2 to this end the act adds new chapter 12 to the us copyright act 17 usc 1201 1205 entitled copyright protection and management systems section 1201a1 prohibits any person from circumventing technological measure that effectively controls access to copyrighted work while the antitraf ficking provisions of 1201a2 and b1 cover those who traffic in technologies designed to circumvent access control devices protecting copyrighted material from unauthorized copying or use civil remedies and criminal penalties are established3 since enactment the copyright protection and management provisions ie the anticircumvention provisions have proven controversial while proponents assert that these provisions are essential to protect valuable intellectual property rights in the digital age critics argue that the dmca has chilling effect on rights of free speech and that its implementation will thwart the publics right to legitimate access to copyrighted works through the exercise of fair use several wellpublicized incidents and the opposition of organizations such as the electronic frontier foundation eff have fueled the controversy over the dmca the recording industry in an effort known as the secure digital music initiative seeks to develop open industry specifications for the protection of digital works towards this end the industry in the

report examines the decision universal studios v corley 7 which considers whether public dissemination of the computer code called decss to descramble encryption of dvd motion pictures may be prohibited universal studios inc v corley the us district courts decision eight major motion picture studios brought suit against computer hackers who developed and disseminated computer program to override and defeat the plaintiffs encryption system the studios distribute motion pictures for home use on digital versatile discs dvd s and protect them from being copied using an encryption system called the content scramble system css the encrypted dvds may only be viewed not copied on players and computer drives equipped with the licensed decryption technology in september 1999 fifteenyearold norwegian jon johansen and two other individuals reverse engineered licensed dvd player and discovered the css encryption algorithm and keys based on this information they created decss program capable of decrypting or ripping encrypted dvds mr johansen posted the decss code on his internet web site although mr johansen was subject to charges filed in norway he was not defendant in the studios suit defendants include eric corley described as leader of the computer hacker community and his company 2600 enterprises which publishes magazine called 2600 the hacker quarterly defendants posted the decss code on the 2600com web site the studios filed suit to enjoin the defendants from posting decss and to prevent them from electronically linking their site to others that post it the defendants responded with selfdescribed electronic civil disobedience ie they increased their efforts to link their web site to others to continue to make decss available8 the court reviewed the development of css means to control access to the plaintiffs copyrighted work and determined that decss is clearly means of circumventing it decss creators explained that the program was not developed to pirate copyrighted movies but to further development of dvd player that would run under linux as opposed to windows operating system the court concluded that css is technological means that effectively controls access to the plaintiffs dvd motion pictures that the only function of decss is to circumvent css and that defendants did offer and provide decss by posting it on their web site the defendants subjective intent ie whether they posted the code in order to infringe or encourage others to infringe copyright does not matter under 17 usc 1201httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31257crs4 917

good faith encryption research10 or security testing11 fair use the court found that the defendants raised significant point in the assertion that access control measure s like css may prevent lawful as well as unlawful uses of copyrighted material for example it could thwart the ability of film studies professor to prepare cdrom containing two different scenes from movies to illustrate lecture on cinematography but the defendants were not being sued for copyright infringement to which fair use is defense they were sued for violating the anticircumvention provision of the dmca which by express congressional intent precludes the fair use defense the fact that congress elected to leave technologically unsophi sticated persons who wish to make fair use of encrypted copyrighted works without the technical means of doing so is matter for congress unless congress decision contravenes the constitution12 the first amendment the court went on to consider whether the dmcas anticircumvention provisions as applied to prevent the public dissemination of decss violate the first amendment the court acknowledged that defendants accurately assert that computer code to the extent it is used to express ideas may be protected speech but went on to analyze both its function and the level of protection afforded in the case before it it concluded that even though the substance of the computer code may be expressive decss has functional nonspeech aspect it enables recipients to circumvent the css system societys increasing dependence upon technological means of controlling access to digital files and systems and its importance in the digital world led the court to accord more weight to the functional nonspeech aspect of the decss computer program and to hold that the anticircumvention provision of the dmca is valid contentneutral regulation in furtherance of important governmental interests here dissemination itself carries very substantial risk of imminent harm because the mechanism is so unusual by which dissemination of means of circumventing access controls to copyrighted works threatens to produce virtually unstoppable infringement of copyright13 injunctive relief the same urgency which compelled the court to elevate the computer programs functionality over its characterization as expressive speech supported the courts issuance of broad injunctive relief against the posting of decss hence it enjoined others from posting decss by linking web sites ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31257crs5 14id at 341 footnotes omitted 15id at 344 see also universal studios v reimerdes 111 f supp2d 346 sdny 2000final injunction 16universal studios v corley 273 f3d 429 2d cir 2001 17id at 458acknowledged that the extension of the prohibition to internet hyperlinks could have possible chilling effect or be viewed as too broad and issued the following caveat accordingly there may be injunction against nor liability for linking to site containing circumvention technology the offering of which is unlawful under the dmca absent clear and convincing evidence that those responsible for the link know at the relevant time that the offending material is on the linkedto site b know that it is circumvention technology that may not lawfully be offered and c create or maintain the link for the purpose of disseminating that technology 14 finding monetary damages to be inadequate and proof of actual damages to be difficult if not impossible the court granted permanent injunction against the posting of decss it addressed the defendants argument that an injunction would be futile because decss is already all over the internet to deny relief would be to encourage others to replicate unlawful conduct and to create futility defense but the court was more troubled by the magnitude of destruction of intellectual property rights posed by the internet these defendants would harm plaintiffs every day on which they post decss on their heavily trafficked web site and link to other sites that post it because someone who does not have decss thereby might obtain it this decision will serve notice on others that the strong right arm of equity may be brought to bear against them absent change in their conduct and thus contribute to climate of appropriate respect for intellectual property rights in an age in which the excitement of ready access to untold quantities of information has blurred in some minds the fact that taking what is not yours and not freely offered to you is stealing15 the decision of the united states court of appeal for the second circuit16 the second circuits analysis illustrates the tension between preserving free speech rights while protecting property rights in the age of the internet the court acknowledged that it was not within its purview to attempt to strike an optimal balance between the interest in freedom of speech and press on the one hand and the interest in protecting intellectual property from rampant piracy on the other this the court commented is not question appropriate for the courts but only for congress the fundamental choice between impairing some communication and tolerating decryption cannot by entirely avoided in facing this choice we are mindful that it is not for us to resolve the issue of public policy implicated by the choice we have identified those issues are for congress 17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31257crs6 18id two injunctions were issued one was issued to prevent the posting of decss and the other was issued to prescribe hyperlinking to decss 19273 f3d at 445 449 source code is the language in which computer programers speak while object code is the language in which computers speak source code is the form computer program takes when it is written by programer in programing language like perl or c this language must be compiled into object code or machine code or executed by an interpreter before computer can understand and perform the programs instructions object code contains sequence of instructions that the computers processor can understand but is difficult for human to read or modify an instruction is an order given to computer processor by the computer program ultimately manifesting as sequence of 1s and 0s in this regard the distinction between source code and object code may be distinction without difference they are merely different forms of expressing the same substantive concept the distinction is akin to expressing an instruction in english to german speaker through translator while the instruction initially manifests in form incomprehensible to the intended receiver as english or source code it is translated by translatorcompiler in manner comprehensible in germanobject code to the receiver the germanspeakercomputer continuedrather the court resolved the questions before it in narrow fashion considering only whether the balance proffered by congress meets standards of constitutional sufficiency under the first amendment our task is to determine whether the legislative solution adopted by congress as applied to the appellants by the district courts injunction is consistent with the limitations of the first amendment and we are satisfied that it is18 the second circuit concluded that the computer code at issue enjoyed first amendment protection but applied diminished standard of constitutional protection intermediate scrutiny to the regulation under this standard the injunction was upheld and the dmca survived its first serious constitutional challenge the first amendment framewor k the defendants central defense involved the first amendment under which he argued that the application of the dmca to his publishing activities violated his freedom of speech first amendment defense to law of general applicability proceeds through three basic issues 1 court considers whether the challenged regulation burdens speech protected by the first amendment it then asks 2 what level of first amendment protection and standard of review extends to that speech ie rational basis intermediate scrutiny or strict scrutiny and finally 3 the court applies the appropriate standard to determine whether the regulation withstands minimal constitutional sufficiency is computer code speech the court first held that all forms of computer code ranging from source code read the language in which computer programers speak to object code read binary code or machine code are cognizable as speech for purposes of the first amendment and are thereby worthy of protection19 inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31257crs7 19continued processor just as it is possible to communicate with german speaker without knowing german it is possible to write source program without knowing about the object code that instructs the actual functions of the computer that carries out the program 20see corley 273 f3d at 454 other courts commenting on the first amendment status of source code have issued narrow and divergent holdings leaving open the issue of whether object code is within the ambit of the first amendment see eg junger v daley 209 f 3d 481 485 6th cir 2000holding that because computer source code is an expressive means for the exchange of information and ideas about computer programing it is protected by the first amendmentemphasis added in dicta another court found that computer programs manifesting as object code ie compiled source code would not convey ideas suggesting possible argument that publication of object code would not receive first amendment protection dvd copy control association v bunner 93 cal app 4th 648 661 2001 citing junger 209 f3d at 484485 the bunner court held that an injunction brought under state trade secrets law against the internet publication of decss source code amounted to regulation of pure speech within the ambit of the first amendment id at 666 see also bernstein v united states department of state 945 f supp 1279 1287 nd cal 1996holding that software relating to encryption is simply topic of speech employed by some scientists involved in applied research and is speech afforded the full protection of the first amendment not because it enables encryption but because it is itself speech 21 corley 273 f3d at 450 regulation restricting speech is content neutral if it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech see id citing hill v colorado 530 us 703 720 2000 22 id at 450addition the court questioned whether two forms of computerre lated activity constitute protected speech hyperlinking and decryption programing the court issued broad holding on the preliminary issue finding that regulation of comput er code and its derivative manifestations or application eg computer programs and hyperlinks triggers first amendment protection when scientists and programers publish code they may communicate ideas between other computer scientists and programers for instance ideas about computational procedure this capacity in the courts view creates speech component of computer code20 what is the scope of the first amendment protection and to what does it apply the primary issue before the court involved the scope of the first amendments protection for computer code while the courts analysis on the first line of first amendment inquiry whether protection attaches is clear and broad its analysis on the second line the scope of protection is not the court began its analysis by restating the basic rule that contentneutral regulations incidentally burdening speech activity generally receive intermediate scrutiny21 two characterizations of fact serve as the basis for the courts analysis first computer code is by its nature expressive and functional ie at the same time code expresses ideas concepts and values about computer programing to other computer programers and instructs computers to perform function22 second it found that when regulation is directed at the functional aspects of computer code thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31257crs8 23id at 454 cf bunner at 664 finding that preliminary injunction issued against posting of decss source code amounted to prior restraint on pure speech which are highly disfavored and presumptively unconstitutional and holding that an economic interest in trade secret is not an interest that is more fundamental than the first amendment right to freedom of speech or even on an equal footing with the national security interests and other vital governmental interests that have previously been found insufficien t to justify prior restraint instructions to computer not the expressive aspect the speech to other programers then it would be construed as contentneutral regulation of speech subject to intermediate scrutiny23 these characterizations aided the court in construing the dmca as content neutral regulation causing the court to apply intermediate scrutiny the corley court held that when regulation burdens computer codes functional aspects and only incidentally burdens its expressive content the regulation will be subjected to intermediate scrutiny this is lower standard of scrutiny than courts traditionally extend to speech protected under the first amendment as the outcome of first amendment case turns on the applicable standard scrutiny this ruling constitutes the heart of the corley decision we therefore pause our case analysis to consider the extension of this standard in future cases the line the court draws between the speech and nonspeech or the expressive and functional aspects of computer code may pose difficulties in future cases while some hypothetical cases pose situations where the courts rationale and rules are fairly easy to apply the extension of the courts rationale in other cases may prove harder to apply thus the courts holding while clear on the facts before it may prove vague in extension for instance computer code posted on the internet in the form of executable binary or in programing language with compilable source at hand appears to possess higher degrees of functionality than constitutionally protected expression this is so because in these cases user or reader can with few clicks of mouse download and run the program allowing the user to exploit the codes functional attributes eg decrypting dvds rather than studying the codes architectural syntactic and semantic features eg examining the expressive aspects of code however it is not clear whether for example decryption algorithm expressed in formal codelike language that has correspo nding compiler meaning that computer in the world could read and thus execute the language has any functional attributes whatsoever indeed when computer language exists as pure abstraction it is not clear whether or how the speechnonspeech division in corley would apply other questions respecting the extension of corleys speechnon speech distinction abound for example to what degree is code printed on piece of paper functional to what degree is it expressive does more abstract description of decryption algorithm presented during lecture before computer science class in language other than source or object code have equivalent functional attributes to decss would the use of decryption code in an academic setting rather than ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31257crs9 24

not speak to the first amendment status of computer code but only to the governmental interest in regulating the exchange of this form of speech the court rejected the premise that the functionality of computer code defeats first amendment protection the fact that medium of expression has functional capacity should not preclude constitutional protection rather the appropriate consideration of the mediums functional capacity is in the analysis of permitted government regulation 26 supplemental brief for appellants at 1 see httpwwwefforgipvideo mpaa_dvd_ cases 20010530_ny_eff_supl_briefhtml visited january 3 2002 27 corley 273 f3d at 454 commercial setting heighten the level of scrutiny that court would apply that is would the regulation cease to be content neutral once applied to an educational use of code these issues do not appear to be immediately answerable through the courts distinction between function and expression though arguably vague in extension the courts rationale served its purposes in clear manner in the case before it indeed the court explicitly narrowed its rationale and reasoning to the facts before it favoring narrow holdings that would permit the law to mature on case by case basis24 other courts addressin g the first amendment status of computer code have found the functional characteristics of computer programs irrelevant on the first and second lines of first amendment inquiry rather these courts found the distinction relevant on the limited issue of measuring the governments interest in regulation which speaks to the third and final line of inquiry the application of the appropriate standard to the present case25 constitut ional protection for posting decss the free speech questions posed by the district courts injunction against corleys publishing activities followed three lines of inquiry required by intermediate scrutiny 1 whether the prohibition on publishing decss under the dmca was content neutral 2 whether the application of the dmca under these circumstance s served substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of ideas and 3 whether the means chosen did not burden substantially more speech than was necessary to serve that interest the court evaluated each issue in turn content neutrality corley argued that the antitrafficking provisions of the dmca are not content neutral because they specifically targeted scientific expression based on the particular topic addressed by that expression namely techniques for circumventing css26 the court found this analysis unresponsive to the speechnonspeech nature of computer code focusing instead on the functional character of computer code the dmca and the posting for that matter was not concerned with whatever capacity decss might have for conveying information to human being but with decsss ability to instruct computer to decrypt css27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31257crs10 28id 29id that functional capacity is not speech within the first amendment28 thus regulation directed at inhibiting that function is not contentbased regulation of speech substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression quickly dispensing with this issue the court found substantial governmental interest in providing owners of copyrighted materials with effective rights and remedies to protect their proprietary material from unauthorized use moreover the court concluded the interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression since the injunction relates to the posting of decss regardless of whether decss contains expressive content that would qualify as speech29 narrow tailoring the court labored over the final issue whether the incidental regulation on speech burdens substantially more expression than is necessary to further the governments interest in preventing unauthorized access to copyrighted material the court noted that congress could have attached civil and criminal liability only to those who actually gained unauthorized access to the copyrighted material which would be less restrictive alternative to further the dmcas objectives but congress need not employ the least restrictive means of accomplishing its objective it need only avoid burdening more speech than necessary to further legitimate interests congress must employ the least restrictive means only when its regulations burden speech receiving the highest level protection strict scrutiny here the question is whether the regulation burdens substantially more speech than is necessary to obtain its interest given the nature of the internet corleys posting made it possible for anyone in the world with computer to be two mouseclicks away from accessing decss three from downloading it and four from copying dvds on home computer the court was unpersuaded that the government could prevent the world wide dissemination and use of decss technology and the rampant piracy of intellectual property in lessspeechrestrictive manner constitutional protection for linking to decss reviewing the injunction preventing corley from hyperlinking to other decss sites on the internet the court determined that the prohibition was content neutral and applied intermediate scrutiny hyperlinks like compute r code have speech and nonspeech components hyperlink conveys informatio n the internet address of the linked webpage and performs function by clicking on the link it directs webbrowser to look up that address and display its contents instantaneously the instantaneous nature of the linking technology persuaded the lower court to issue the injunction the injunction was focused on inhibiting the functional character of linking technology since it applied for reasons independent of whether the link contained information comprehensible to human being without discussion the court of appeals asserted that the governments interests were substantial presumably the nature of the internet as media capable ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31257crs11 30376 us 254 283 1964involving the regulation of political speech to which the court applied strict scrutiny 31corley 273 f3d at 455456 32id at 457 33idinstantaneous communication and dissemination of information warrants heightened government interest in thwarting the ease in which circumvention devices may be obtained and distributed on the web whether this interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression was not clearly addressed by the court narrow tailoring in crafting standards for issuance of the injunction the lower court adapted the standards of landmark first amendment case new york times v sullivan30 avoiding strict liability for linking was necessary both the district and the court of appeals held to avoid two impairments of free expression inhibiting website operators from displaying links for fear that it might contain decss and prohibiting linking to website which would curtail access to information other than decss hence an injunction pursuant to the dmca against the posting of hyperlink will withstand constitutional scrutiny if the plaintiff shows by clear and convincing evidence that those responsible for the link 1 know at the relevant time that the offending material is on the linkedto site 2 know that it is circumvention technology that may not lawfully be offered and 3 create or maintain the link for the purpose of disseminating that technology31 corley argued that the only constitutionally viable standard would be one that would likewise enable plaintiff to enjoin newspaper from printing the address of website publishing decss this the court found ignores the reality of the digital world where materials are available for instantaneous worldwide distribution before any preventive measures can be effectively taken32 thus the relevant constitutional standard for print media is not necessarily appropriate for electronic media while the injunction runs the risk of inhibiting website operators from posting links to sites for fear that site might contain decss and while it also curtails access to other nonoffending information on linkedto site the court upheld the injunction the fundamental choice between impairing some communication and tolerating decryption cannot be entirely avoided the court concluded33 conclusion lawyers representing corley have asked that the full second circuit court of appeals reconsider the threejudge panel decision in the petition for rehearing corley argues among other things that the appellate panel misapplied the
