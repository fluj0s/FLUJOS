2006 mark jickling specialist in public finance government and finance division real estate investment trusts reit considerations for the federal employees thrift savings plan tsp summary real estate investment trusts reits are mutual funds made up of real estate and mortgage assets in recent years their performance has been stronger than broader market indicators leading to calls for inclusion of an reit alternative in the thrift savings plan tsp for federal workers at present the tsp is limited to five savings vehicles three of which are broadbased stock indexes proponents of inclusion cite greater diversification and participant choice in the tsp as well as potentially higher returns as benefits of the proposal the tsp board while studying the matter has argued that changes should only occur as part of comprehensive program should not encourage return chasing by participants and should maintain the current very low cost structure of the tsp hr 1578 the real estate investment thrift savings act was introduced april 12 2005 to provide for an reit option in the tsp hearings were held on the legislation april 19 2005 by the house government reform subcommittee on the federal

estate and mortgage assets in recent years their performance has been stronger than broader market indicators leading to calls for inclusion of reit alternative in the thrift savings plan tsp for federal workers hr 1578 the real estate investment thrift savings act was introduced april 12 2005 to provide for an reit option in the tsp hearings were held on the legislation april 19 2005 by the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization further hearings are scheduled for april 26 2006 companion bill s 2490 was introduced in the senate on april 13 2006 this report summarizes the legal and economic history of reits and the factors that have contributed to recent strong performances of reits as investment vehicles it then addresses the arguments behind their possible inclusion as an investment alternative in the tsp background on reits introduced in the 1960s real estate investment trusts reits applied the mutual fund concept to real estate by buying an interest in reit an investor could own share of number of real estate assets reducing the risks and transaction costs that accompany investment in single piece of real estate congress made the reit concept financially viable by enacting the real estate investment trust act of 1960 which exempted reits from double taxation of shareholder dividends that is reit income is not taxed at the trust level but only after it has been distributed to shareholders stock and bond mutual funds receive similar tax treatment to qualify for this tax exemption reits are required to distribute at least 90 of their income in the form of dividends second piece of legislation critical to the development of the reit market was the tax reform act of 1986 which permitted reits to operate and manage property themselves previously they were permitted to be only passive investors 1 barbara miles former specialist in financial institutions contributed to this report crs2 the tax reform act also channeled investment funds into reits by restricting the use of limited real estate partnerships as tax shelters individual reits tend to specialize in certain kinds of real estate but taken as whole the reit industry invests in the broad range of commercial and residential primarily multifamily properties figure1 shows the distribution of reit assets at the end of 2005 figure 1 reit assets by type december 31 2005 office 19 shopping centers 12 residential 17 selfstorage 4 regional malls 14 speciality 4 lodgingresorts 6 diversified 7 health care 5 industrial 7 mixed 4 source national association of reits there are two basic types of reits equity and mortgage equity reits develop own and operate incomeproducing real estate and provide tenant services whereas mortgage reits lend money to real estate owners and operators or acquire loans or mortgagebacked securities few hybrid reits operate in both modes the investment characteristics of the two types differ mortgage reits are highly sensitive to interest rates because their profits depend on the spread between the income from their loans and other debt assets and their own cost of funds as interest rates have risen since 2004 the returns on investment in and share prices of mortgage reits have fallen sharply equity reits on the other hand are affected by range of economic fundamentals besides interest rates for example reits that invest in hotels are sensitive to corporate profits and other factors that affect business travel similarly returns on investment in hospitals office buildings and shopping malls depend on host of sectorspecific uncorrelated trends reits may be either private or publicly held companies2 shares of publicly held reits are traded on the stock markets like shares of any other corporation as of the end of february 2006 there were 202 reits listed on the stock exchanges 2 figures in this report reflect only publicly traded reits crs3 with total market value of 368 billion of the 202 156 were equity reits 40 were mortgage reits and the remaining 6 were hybrids market capitalization of the classes was 335 billion 27 billion and 5 billion respectively3 table 1 summarizes the

market indicators such as the standard poors 500 since 2000 figure 2 compares the two indices since 1997 figure 2 standard poors 500 vs reit stock index 3 available at dow jones co httpwwwdjindexescommdsidxindexcfmevent showreitstats crs4 what accounts for the recent performance of reit stocks first the economic fundamentals have been favorable following the stock market crash in 2000 and the september 11 2001 attacks the federal reserve lowered shortterm interest rates to the lowest levels since the 1950s greatly reducing the cost of borrowed funds longer term rates partly in response to the fed moves and partly because of fall in post911 investment demand continued their decadelong decline lowering the cost of funds most important to real estate funding considerably long rates in particular have remained low by historical standards in 2006 in addition consumer spending has been strong since the end of the last recession in november 2001 which is good news for reits that invest in resorts and retail structures including shopping malls economic growth has been good for the industrial real estate sector and improving business conditions have buoyed the hotel and lodging sectors and are beginning to drive down the office vacancy rate in many parts of the country second factor has been wave of mergers and goingprivate transactions in the industry when publicly traded reit is acquired by another or taken private shareholders receive premium above the current market price for their stock the prospect of merger or buyout usually adds to the attraction of reit shares and drives prices up third and perhaps the most important factor behind rising reit share prices has been the relatively poor performance of other investments since the market peak in 2000 stock yields have been much lower than during the 1990s at the same time low interest rates have meant that returns to fixedincome investments like corporate bonds bank certificates of deposit and us treasury notes have been meager by historical standards the combination according to standard poors analysis has sent investor dollars surging into us reits in recent years4 thus performance of reit shares is affected not only by the fundamentals of the real estate business but also by the quality of other investment opportunities figure 2 shows that the reit index was negative during several periods in the late 1990s not just because of problems in real estate markets and earnings5 but also because investors shifted funds to nasdaq technology stocks and other hot sectors where returns of 30 per year were considered sluggish future prospects future returns on any stock market investment are of course uncertain several factors make predictions about reits even more uncertain than most as table 1 shows the market value of reit stocks has grown explosively since 1990 since 2000 alone market capitalization has more than doubled this suggests two things 4 raymond matthis robert mcmillan and joe niezielski real estate investment trusts standard poors industry surveys feb 16 2006 p 6 5 for an account of this difficult period for reits see steve bergsman after an awful year in the real estate investment trust market investment dealers digest june 28 1999 p 1 crs5 1 that publicly traded reits have become much larger though mergers external debt and equity financings as well as internallygenerated growth and 2 that investor perceptions of reits have changed the first point means that an investment fund that attempted to capture the aggregate return of the full range of publicly traded reits as tsp fund would presumably do would in fact be investing in shifting pool of firms and assets as public reits buy private funds or assets or as they are taken private the volume and composition of the real estate assets that generate reit income will not be constant which implies that past behavior of reit stocks may not be reliable guide to future performance on the second point if investors move in and out of reits in response to factors unrelated to the state of the underlying commercial real estate market the behavior of reit stocks under any given set of market conditions can be expected to change in 2000 wall street journal6 article noted that historically reits have behaved like stocks but in the last two years they have seemed more like bonds diving as interest rates rose recent ibbotson associates study found that the historical correlation between reits and smallcapitalization stocks has broken down early in the 1990s however the markets perception of these securities began to shift as the reit market grew along with investor understanding of the sector in turn shifts in the market began to alter the behavior patterns of this asset class since 1992 the reit market has more than quadrupled and investors have begun to view these investments more as real estate investments and less as simply domestic equity investments over the last 10 years correlations between reits and more traditional asset classes have been declining making them significant source of portfolio diversification7 together these trends suggest that the investment characteristics of the present set of publicly traded reits may not hold constant over the years to come in the shortterm the fact that reits have outperformed the sp 500 for several years running suggests that reit stocks may be overvalued and due for correction standard poors analysis notes that the cap rate measure of commercial property returns was low in early 2006 suggesting that stock prices were higher than the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market would 6 jonathan clements reits awakening from slumber wall street journal feb 15 2000 p c1 7 ibbotson associates ask ibbotson httpwwwibbotsoncom see also testimony of roger g ibbotson hearing of the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization april 19 2005 crs6 support8 nevertheless reit stocks have risen by 13 since the beginning of 2006 seemingly in defiance of common sense according to the wall street journal9 reit fund for the tsp the thrift savings plan tsp is taxdeferred retirement savings vehicle for federal workers akin to 401k plans for private sector employees although available to all federal employees it is particularly important to those covered by the federal employees retirement system fers whose contributions are partially matched by their federal agency at present the tsp has five investment vehicles three of which are broad stock indexes one of the stock funds tracks the sp 500 index of major uslisted companies the c fund the i fund tracks international stocks and the s fund invests in stocks not included in the sp 500 including shares of small and midsize companies the remaining two funds invest in bonds the f fund and government securities the g fund in addition the tsp has five automatic lifecycle arrangements of investing among the five vehicles each geared toward projected time frame over which accounts will remain in the tsp at this time the tsp does not allow for investment in individual stocks nor in funds made up of particular economic sectors or industries such as biotech or aeronautics the tsp has approximately 35 million participants and more than 180 billion in assets on april 12 2005 chairman jon porter of the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization introduced hr 1578 the real estate investment thrift savings act which would provide for real estate stock index investment option under the tsp the subcommittee held hearing on april 19 2005 chairman porter made the case for the legislation as follows what we are talking about today is simple concept diversification basic economic principles dictate that investors should not place all of their eggs in one basket but must spread their money and risk among different types of assets few years ago during the tech bubble collapse many federal employees experienced setbacks in their investment portfolio and did not have the option to invest substantially in reits federal employees should not be left out in the cold adding reit fund option to the tsp is the next logical step with its resilient earnings and lower volatility real estate provides sound investment over the long haul such an investment is valuable diversification tool providing the possibility of strong returns and risk reduction10 8 real estate investment trusts standard poors industry surveys p 7 9 jennifer forsythe reits rally again defying predictions wall street journal mar 22 2006 p d1 the article cites speculation on mergers as principal reason for the continued rise 10 opening statement of chairman jon porter hearing of the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization apr 19 2005 crs7 chairman porter also noted that the tsp offered five investment options versus 16 for the average corporate 401k plan investment diversification is the cornerstone of modern portfolio theory which holds that the inclusion of highly risky assets in portfolio can enhance overall returns and does not imply high level of risk to the portfolio as long as the risks are not positively correlated if the correlation between reits and the stock market has declined as the ibbotson study cited above finds reit fund would offer tsp participants way to hedge their investments in stock funds if the stock funds fell the reits would rise or at least not fall as far easing the pain of stock market episodes such as the bear market of 20002002 at the same time based on their expectations of future reit performance participants could move funds into reits in search of higher yields thus as chairman porter stated reit fund may offer both the possibility of strong returns and risk reduction11 the tsp governing board and ceo however have recommended against the addition of reit fund their arguments as set out at the 2005 hearing mentioned above12 may be summarized as follows the view of reits as hedge against stock market declines is complicated by the fact that reit stocks are already included in both the large and small stock funds currently offered by the tsp for example nine reit stocks are included in the sp 500 which the tsps c fund tracks gary amelio the tsp executive director noted in his 2005 testimony that the c and s stock funds held over billion dollars in reit shares making tsp the thirteenthlargest holder of reits in the united states thus the hedging value of reits is to an extent already built into the tsp if reits rise when other stocks fall the aggregate indexes mirrored by the tsp funds will fall less than they would have otherwise similarly superior returns earned by reits over any period are captured in the aggregate return to the tsp stock funds what the creation of reit fund would do is allow tsp participants to increase the proportion of reit stocks in their portfolios beyond their weighting in broad indices such as the sp 500 if their timing were right tsp participants who chose the reit option could outperform their peers who remained in the stock funds but figure 2 suggests that they would be choosing volatile investment option that could lead to losses as well as gains by offering only few investment alternatives the tsp is structured in way that discourages return chasing conventional wisdom in financial theory is that many investors particularly small investors tend to buy the stocks or mutual funds that did well in the last reporting period and that this is generally an unsuccessful strategy for two reasons return chasers are always paying topofthe market prices and by frequently reallocating their investments they incur high 11 ibid 12 statements of andrew m saul chairman of the federal retirement thrift investment board and gary amelio executive director before the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization apr 19 2005 crs8 transaction costs gary amelio noted that educational programs to discourage such counterproductive investment behavior would be expensive13 another argument regarding the hedging and diversification benefits offered by new tsp funds is that such alternatives ought to be offered if they are needed as part of comprehensive considered program rather than piecemeal if tsp investors would be better off with reit choice observers ask why not add funds based on emerging markets hedge funds commodities junk bonds and so on two general arguments against such multiplication of investment options are made one deals with fund expenses current tsp expenses are extremely low by industry standards off the charts according to andrew saul14 partly because the number of funds is limited if annual expenses go up by even fraction of percentage point the effect on total investment returns over 20 or 30year time frame can be dramatic testimony from barclays global investors which serves as tsp investment manager indicated that administration of reit fund while desirable from pure investment perspective would likely incur management and transaction costs considerably above present levels15 second there is some question whether wide menu of investment choices is in the interest of tsp participants many of whom are not and do not care to become expert in financial markets presenting unsophisticated investors with many choices may result in lessthanoptimal behavior including the chasing of returns discussed above or the selection of an unsuitable initial investment allocation which the participant may not correct later because the perceived costs of obtaining expertise are too high these arguments can be countered by the charge of paternalism and the case for investor choice and selfdirection is intuitively attractive if as neoclassical economics assumes individuals act rationally in their own selfinterest why should the government or its designees decide where tsp participants can put their funds however growing body of empirical and theoretical research called behavioral finance throws doubt on the notion that individual investors can be expected to make the decisions that are best for themselves16 behavioral finance identifies mistakes that investors make consistently such as reliance upon inaccurate rules of thumb and being influenced by the form in which an investment opportunity is presented rather than the substance these bad habits appear to be deeply rooted and not easily corrected by education programs 13 ibid 14 ibid 15 testimony of amy schioldager head of us equity indexing products before the house government reform subcommittee on the

j bowen the enemy within financial planning apr 1 2006 crs9 recent study of investment returns by definedcontribution plan participants found that individuals who chose an asset allocation or balanced fund such as the tsp lifestyle options achieved better returns than participants who make allocation decisions themselves17 results like these suggest that the neoclassical assumption that individuals can be relied upon to act rationally in their own selfinterest may be overly simplistic this line of analysis seems to support the contention of the tsp directors that the current plan design based on few broad choices and low costs has been recognized by many impartial observers as an optimum approach18 recent events s 2490 companion bill to hr 1578 was introduced by senator norm coleman april 3
