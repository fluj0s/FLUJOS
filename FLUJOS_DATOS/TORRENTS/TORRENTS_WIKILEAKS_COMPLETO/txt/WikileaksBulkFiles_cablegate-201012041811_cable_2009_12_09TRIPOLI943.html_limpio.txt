938 b tripoli 941 classified by joan polaschik charge daffaires us embassy tripoli department of state reason 14 b d 1 snf polecon chief met mfa americas acting asequivalent xxxxxxxxxxxx december 1 to convey our serious concerns about the security of the seven heufilled casks at the tajoura nuclear facility xxxxxxxxxxxx dismissed us concerns stating there was one sophisticated enough in libya to be able to do anything with the casks and that the chances of anything happening were very low he mentioned the iaea seals as evidence that the fuel was protected ref polecon chief underscored that the gol should be concerned about the situation as the casks were easily transportable and tajoura was poorly protected facility us doe specialists had recommended an increased security guard presence armed if possible around tajoura and the disengagement of the crane inside the facility polecon chief emphasized that the casks were easily transportable and advised him not to be too dismissive of the security risks involved in keeping the casks unprotected xxxxxxxxxxxx said that he would meet with foreign minister musa kusa today to relay our concerns 2 snf polecon chief also described the environmental disaster that could take place if we did not ship the casks to russia for disposal within month the us needed decision from the libyan side as soon as possible on the shipment as it would take time to reschedule the travel of the specialized russian plane including overflight permits landing permits and negotiating with the russian mfa to cancel other scheduled stops xxxxxxxxxxxx was not aware of how complicated it would be to schedule return visit of the plane although he understood that only few such planes exist in the world he said he agreed that decision needed to be passed to us within few weeks 3 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx was not aware that dr gashut claimed to have prepared document for senior regime officials listing all of the environmental dangers associated with holding the shipment back xxxxxxxxxxxx said that gashut probably gave the paper to prime mininsterequivalent albaghdad almahmoudi gashuts boss but did not think it had been passed to the mfa xxxxxxxxxxxx may well have been unaware of any communications between gashut and kusa on this issue xxxxxxxxxxxx promised to call us after he had briefed kusa 4 snf we also are seeking meeting with saif alislam alqadhaifs aide mohamed ismail ahmed to relay the same information in hopes of ensuring that senior libyan officials understand the grave security and safety risks posed by the halted shipment polaschik
