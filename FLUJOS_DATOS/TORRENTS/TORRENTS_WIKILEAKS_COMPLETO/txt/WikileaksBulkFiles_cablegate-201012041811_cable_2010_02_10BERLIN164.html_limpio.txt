afghanistan iran tac nukes classified by classified by political mc george glass for reasons 14 bd 1 c german fm westerwelle told amb february 5 that it was important to refocus afghanistan efforts on civilian reconstruction that we needed to avoid suggesting german troops engaged in less risk than other countries that he did not invite iranian fm mottaki to germany or seek meeting with him that any discussion of nonstrategic nuclear weapons needed to be conducted at 28 at nato and that he could not influence any decision by the european parliament on the swift agreement end summary 2 c the ambassador asked about westerwelles first 100 days in office though in an ebullient mood westerwelle said things were very difficult fdp slipped another percentage point in the polls hours before the meeting he said he had been in france february 4 for joint cabinet meeting but that nothing substantive came of it he observed that one never really knew what was going to happen with sarkozy involved afghanistan 3 c the ambassador reviewed his own recent trip to afghanistan he shared his impression that the germans were doing superb job at all levels from the rcnorth commander on down he learned how critical mentoring and partnering with afghan security forces had become he noted that the us was sending substantial forces to rcnorth where they would conduct training and be under german command westerwelle responded that this was important for germany and for international cooperation the ambassador added that the us was sending substantial helicopter support as well he said that germans could be proud of their troops in afghanistan westerwelle responded that this was good news he said that the london conference bore an excellent conclusion and was particularly useful for its focus on civilian progress he emphasized the importance of underscoring civilian reconstruction 4 c with request for confidentiality westerwelle referred to the january 20 bild zeitung interview with general mcchrystal in which the general is quoted as urging the germans to take more risks westerwelle recounted that he himself had had to answer questions about this article for ten days explaining that the germans were not peace soldiers while other countries provided the combat troops he said it was important that german troops not be relativized and cast as secondclass troops he observed that germany had originally deployed 3500 troops increased that mandate to 4500 and was now planning an increase of another 500 plus reserve he emphasized that this was major contribution compared with other european countries 5 c the ambassador noted that he had gained the impression in afghanistan that police training was more challenging than he had originally understood troops were usually required to provide force protection but german police training was the best 6 c the ambassador asked how the prospective february 26 bundestag debate to extend the bundeswehr mandate in afghanistan would play out westerwelle said the question was how large majority would approve the new mandate he said that spd caucus chief steinmeier displayed good will on this issue however spd chairman gabriel wanted to politicize the issue for domestic political gain nevertheless he thought some in the spd would support the new mandate however westerwelle expected support from the greens westerwelle noted that the may nrw state elections were also affecting the issue in negative way that said he said he could not see steinmeier opposing the larger mandate he hoped the ambassador would speak with steinmeier iran 7 c asked about the february 5 visit of iranian fm mottaki to the munich security conference westerwelle emphasized that he westerwelle had not invited mottaki to come to germany and westerwelle had also not requested meeting with mottaki rather it was mottaki who was asking to see westerwelle westerwelle said he had still not decided whether he would talk to mottaki or not he reflected concern that tehran might try to exploit mottakis visit to germany as distraction and continue executing people during the visit in any case westerwelle said his position was exactly the same as the us on iran and he would share the results of any meeting with mottaki if it took place berlin 00000164 002 of 002 8 c westerwelle said he would meet russian fm lavrov and separately chinese fm yang february 5 he suggested that moscow had been changing course on iran sanctions since the qom revelations the russians now saw iran as playing games on the nuclear issue however he observed that china was hesitant or even in opposition to sanctions reflecting on his recent visit to china westerwelle said he had not perceived any good will there at present he said he would ask yang again about iran and then share the results with the us westerwelle opined that it was important also to focus on brazil as an opinion leader in the third world he noted that president lula had received ahmadinejad warmly several months ago he added that he was uncertain what the saudis thought but that the other persian gulf countries seemed to be in an existential panic about the iranian nuclear program tac nukes 9 c touching briefly on arms control westerwelle stated unequivocally that tactical nuclear weapons was an issue for nato he said that when he had received kissinger schulz perry and nunn on february 3 to talk about their global zero proposal tactical nuclear weapons was not discussed he said that the four statesmen were very supportive of president obama tftp 10 c the ambassador raised the challenge of getting the european parliament to approve an agreement to share data with the us on tracking terrorist finance the ambassador noted the extensive efforts of the treasury department and other us agencies to explain the importance of the program to our common security he asked how one could get better support for the program westerwelle replied that the german government had been able to come up with solution for itself few months ago when the issue first surfaced comment in fact german interior minister mazieres vote to abstain in the eu council vote on tftp on november 30 reflected the complete deadlock within the coalition government between tftp advocates in the cducontrolled interior ministry and tftp opponents in the fdpcontrolled justice ministery end comment however westerwelle said that now that the issue was in the european parliament he had ability to influence it he said that he was very very aware of the secretarys interest in this issue nevertheless he had sense that almost all groups in the european parliament had concerns with the proposed agreement he emphasized that this was not an issue that only concerned his party the fdp but rather many others as well 11 c westerwelle shared that he had not yet appointed new coordinator for germanamerican cooperation comment 12 c westerwelle who spoke with ease in english was in buoyant mood and more confident on his issues than we have seen him so far he seemed ready to defend any intimation that he was less than supportive of troop surge defense minister zu guttenberg told the ambassador two days ago that westerwelle had worked for increase of german troops for afghanistan see berlin 157 with invocations of the importance of civilian reconstruction on iran he leapt at the chance to tell us he had not invited mottaki his dodges on both tactical nuclear weapons and terrorist finance were all but practiced his comment that he was unable to affect the vote in the eu parliament on tftp was bit disingenuous on february 4 an mfa official acknowledged to visiting treasury officials in berlin that german meps were in fact leading the charge against tftp in the eu parliament with the tacit support of the fdp if not of specialists in the justice ministry and mfa themselves westerwelle still cuts good image in meetings and in the press here even though his party continues bout of free fall in the polls his ministry though still wonders privately to us where he gets his policy direction from end comment 13 u the ambassador did not have the chance to clear this cable before departing berlin murphy
