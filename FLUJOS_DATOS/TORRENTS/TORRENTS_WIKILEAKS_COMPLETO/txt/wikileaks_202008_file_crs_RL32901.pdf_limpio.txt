inventory of proposals in the 109th congress to amend the fair labor standards act summary the fair labor standards act flsa 29 usc 201219 is the basic federal statute dealing with minimum wages overtime pay child labor and related issues enacted in 1938 it has been modified throug h the years to take into account changing workplace trends and to meet new worker and employer demands the act has undergone general amendmen t on eight separate occasions 1949 1955 1961 1966 1974 1977 1989 and 1996 in addition to numerous more specific legislated changes it has also been the subject of continuing administrative rulemaking by the department of bor dol and has been the focus of extensive litigation that has impacted the manner in which the act is applied the flsa is divided roughly into three parts corresponding to its subject areas minimum wage section 6 overtime pay section 7 and child labor section 12 these are accompanied by body of statutor exemptions or exceptions section 13 definitions appear in section 3 other s ections deal with ad ministration penalties and related matters nothing in the act requires that congress revisit the statute amendment has tended to respond to change in the value of the minimum wage as the level of the wage floor has eroded throug h inflation congress has re visited the flsa and while addressing the wage rate it has also often revised c overage patterns and modified overtime pay and other requirements child labor by and large but with exceptions has been primarily the respons ibility of the secretary of labor operating within general guidelines laid down by congress until recently legislation to amend the flsa had been freestanding the product of extended hearings in 1996 that pattern shifted the 1996 flsa amendments were adopted as floor am endment to broad proposal dealing with business and related tax issues as result some have come to view as new pattern linkage of labor standards enhancement with sometimes unrelated benefits for employers others argue that there is inherent reason to tie flsa amendments to benefits for employers in the 109th congress it can be expected that further changes will be urged with respect to the flsa some to increase worker protections and others arguably to allow employers more flexibility by reduc ing them this re port will be updated to reflect legislation introduced andor

labor policy concerns for at least half century but only in the wake of the great depression beginning in 1929 was congress able to forge comprehensive federal measure that would withstand judicial review while resp ecting the differing interests of employers and workers the flsa is divided roughly into th ree parts minimum wage section 6 overtime pay section 7 nd child labor section 12 these are accompanied by body of statutory exemptions or excepti ons section 13 definitions appear in section 3 other sections deal with ad ministration penalties and related matters enforcement and

overtime pay protections of the act shall not apply with respect to any employee employed in bona fide executive administrative or professional capacity as such terms ar defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the secretary having so stated the congress moved on to other issues and very largely left the defining and delimiting up to the secretary see section below overtime pa

federal minimum wage is set in statute and remains at fixed rate declining in value as price levels continue to rise until changed through legislative action although the general rate is curre ntly 515 an hour there are also series of subminima or special treatments for students youth persons with disabilities regularly tipped employees and others in addition special consideration for small businesses has been built into the act for the most part each of these subminima is in some measure separate and apart from the general wage rate2 in 1968 the federal minimum wage reached in relative
