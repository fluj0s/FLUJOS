children and family court advisory and support service paper for the board meeting on 01 december 2006 pensions policy 1 aim and purpose 11 the pensions policy sets out how cafcass applies employer discretions in accordance with the local government pension scheme regulation 106 cafcass is required by the regulations to have published policy on the pension employer discretions without the published policy the pension provider west yorkshire pension fund is unable to process applications from the employer where the use of one of the discretionary options may be preferred option 2 action for the board 21 to consider and approve the policy 3 recommendation 31 to approve the policy 4 key strategic issues for the board to consider 41 the policy does not commit cafcass to the awarding of discretionary awards the policy merely allows cafcass the opportunity to apply discretionary awards and it provides some flexibility that could not be used if the policy was not approved 5 financial implications 51 the policy does not itself lead to additional cost and any use of the discretionary award will be made within existing budgetary constraints 6 risks 61 the risk is that cafcass would not be able to utilise some flexibility in relation to discretionary pension awards at time when cafcass is undertaking major change management programme in addition the specific element that refers to new option of flexible retirement has raised much interest amongst staff and although the use of this option is at the employers discretion the absence of this option would cause cafcass some difficulty with the implementation of the change programme and reduce flexibility for individual employees jabbar sardar head of human resources november 2006 pic
