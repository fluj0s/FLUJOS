and natural resources policy resources science and industry division earthquakes risk monitoring notification and research summary close to 75 million people in 39 states face some risk from earthquakes seismic hazards are greatest in the western united states particularly california alaska washington oregon and hawaii the rocky mountain region portion of the central united states known as the new madrid seismic zone and portions of the eastern seaboard particularly south carolina also have relatively high earthquake hazard compared to the loss of life in other countries relatively few americans have died as result of earthquakes over the past 100 years the united states however faces the possibility of large economic losses from earthquake damaged buildings and infrastructure until hurricane katrina in 2005 the 1994 northridge ca earthquake was the costliest natural catastrophe to strike the united states some damage estimates were 26 billion in 2005 dollars estimates of total loss from hypothetical earthquake of magnitude more than 70 reach as high as 500 billion for the angeles area the may 12 2008 magnitude 79 earthquake in sichuan china has raised some concerns about the possibility of similar devastating earthquake occurring in seismically active and densely populated parts of the united states such as california given the potentially huge costs associated with severe earthquake an ongoing issue for congress is whether the federally supported programs aimed at reducing us vulnerability to earthquakes are an adequate response to the earthquake hazard under the national earthquake hazards reduction program nehrp four federal agencies have responsibility for longterm earthquake risk reduction the us geological survey usgs the national science foundation nsf the federal emergency management agency fema and the national institute of standards and technology nist they variously assess us earthquake hazards send notifications of seismic events develop measures to reduce earthquake hazards and conduct research to help reduce overall us vulnerability to earthquakes congress established nehrp in 1977 and its early focus was on research that would lead to an improved understanding of why earthquakes occur and to an ability to predict their occurrence precisely understanding has improved about why and where earthquakes occur however reliably predicting the precise date and time an earthquake will occur is not yet possible congress most recently reauthorized nehrp in 2004 pl 108360 and authorized appropriations through fy2009 the 2004 reauthorization designated nist as the lead agency to create better synergy among the agencies and improve the program congress may wish to determine whether the reorganized structure has yielded expected benefits for the program appropriations for nehrp have not met levels authorized for the past four years falling short by an average of 31 for fy2005 through fy2008 what effect funding at the levels enacted through fy2008 has had on the us capability to detect earthquakes and minimize losses after an earthquake occurs is not clear contents earthquake hazards and risk 1 usgs releases new

government supports efforts to assess and monitor earthquake hazards and risk in the united states four federal agencies responsible for longterm earthquake risk reduction coordinate their activities under nehrp the us geological survey usgs the national science foundation nsf fema and the national institute of standards and technology nist congress reauthorized nehrp in 2004 pl 108360 and authorized appropriations for total of 9025 million over five years given the potentially huge costs associated with large damaging earthquake in the united states an ongoing issue for congress is whether the federally supported earthquake programs are adequate for the earthquake risk this report describes estimates of earthquake hazards and risk in the united states the current federal programs that support earthquake monitoring and that provide notification after seismic event and the programs that support mitigation and research aimed at reducing us vulnerability to earthquakes earthquake hazards and risk figure 1 indicates that good information exists on where earthquakes are likely to occur and how severe the earthquake magnitude and resulting ground shaking are likely to be the map in figure 1 depicts the potential shaking hazard from future earthquakes it is based on the frequency at which earthquakes occur in different areas and how far the strong shaking extends from the source of the earthquake in figure 1 the hazard levels indicate the potential ground motion expressed as percentage of the acceleration due to gravity g with up to 1 in 10 chance of being exceeded over 50year period crs2 figure 1 earthquake hazard in the united states source usgs fact sheet 20083018 april 2008 at httpearthquakeusgsgovresearchhazmaps products_dataimagesnshm_us02gif modified by crs all 50 states are vulnerable to earthquake hazards although risks vary greatly across the country seismic hazards are greatest in the western continental united states particularly california washington oregon and alaska and hawaii alaska is the most earthquakeprone state experiencing magnitude 7 earthquake1 almost every year and magnitude 8 earthquake every 14 years on average because of its low population and infrastructure density alaska has relatively low risk for large economic losses from an earthquake in contrast california has more citizens and infrastructure at risk than any other state because of the states frequent seismic activity combined with its high population figure 1 also shows relatively high earthquake hazard in the rocky mountain region portions of the eastern seaboard particularly south carolina and part of the central united states known as the new madrid seismic zone discussed below other portions of the eastern and northeastern united states are also vulnerable to moderate seismic hazard according to the usgs 75 million people 1 magnitude is number that characterizes the relative size of an earthquake earthquake magnitude is often reported using the richter scale magnitudes in this report are generally consistent with the richter scale richter magnitude is calculated from the strongest seismic wave recorded from the earthquake and is based on logarithmic base 10 scale for each whole number increase in the richter scale the ground motion increases by ten times the amount of energy released per whole number increase however goes up by factor of 32 the moment magnitude scale is another expression of earthquake size or energy released during an earthquake that roughly corresponds to the richter magnitude and is used by most seismologists because it more accurately describes the size of very large earthquakes intensity is measure of how much shaking occurred at site based on observations and amount of damage intensity is usually reported on the modified mercalli intensity scale as roman numeral ranging from i not felt to xii total destruction crs3 in 39 states are subject to significant risk during the period 19751995 only four states did not experience detectable earthquakes florida iowa north dakota and wisconsin the map shown in figure 1 is based on the new usgs seismic hazards map released on april 21 2008 see box for more information about the new map usgs releases new national seismic hazards maps and new earthquake forecast for california on april 21 2008 the usgs released new national seismic hazards maps that update the version published in 2002 compared to the 2002 version the new maps indicate lower ground motions by 10 to 25 for the central and eastern united states based on modifications to the groundmotion models used for earthquakes the new maps indicate that estimates of ground motion for the western united states are as much as 30 lower for certain types of ground motion called longperiod seismic waves which affect taller multistory buildings ground motion that affects shorter buildings of few stories called shortperiod seismic waves is roughly similar to the 2002 maps the new maps show higher estimates for ground motion for western oregon and washington compared to the 2002 maps due to new ground motion models for the offshore cascadia subduction zone in formulating the 2008 maps the usgs gave more weight to the probability of catastrophic magnitude 9 earthquake occurring along the cascadia subduction zone that fault ruptures on average every 500 years and has the potential to generate destructive earthquakes and tsunamis along the coasts of washington oregon and northern california according to report released on april 14 2008 california has 99 chance of experiencing magnitude 67 or larger earthquake in the next 30 years the likelihood of an even larger earthquake magnitude 75 or greater is 46 and will likely occur in the southern part of the state the fault with the highest probability of generating at least one earthquake of magnitude 67 or greater over the next 30 years is the san andreas in southern california 59 probability for northern california it is the haywardrodgers creek fault 31 the earthquake forecasts are not predictions ie they do not give specific date or time but represent probabilities over given time period and even the probabilities have variability associated with them the earthquake forecasts are known as the uniform california earthquake rupture forecast ucerf and are produced by working group

hazards maps such as the one in figure 1 are often combined with other data such as the strength of existing buildings to estimate possible damage in an area following an earthquake the combination of seismic risk population and vulnerable infrastructure can help improve the understanding of which urban areas across the united states face risks from earthquake hazards that may not be immediately obvious from the probability maps of shaking hazards alone the usgs has identified 26 urban areas that face significant seismic risk from the combination of population and severity of shaking table 1

earthquakes occur worldwide each year but the majority are of small magnitude or occur in remote areas and are not detectable more earthquakes are detected each year as more seismometers2 are installed in the world but the number of large earthquakes magnitude greater than 603 has remained relatively constant between 2000 and 2007 there were 2261 3876 earthquakes per year in the united states according to the national earthquake information center neic see figure 2 as figure 2 shows about 98 of earthquakes detected each year by the neic are smaller than magnitude 50 only 55 earthquakes exceeded magnitude 60 for the eightyear period less than 03 of the total earthquakes detected for an average of slightly less than seven earthquakes per year of at least 60 magnitude large earthquakes although infrequent cause the most damage and are responsible for most earthquakerelated deaths over the past 100 years relatively few americans have died as result of earthquakes compared to citizens in other countries4 the great san francisco earthquake of 1906 claimed an estimated 3000 lives as result of both the earthquake and subsequent fires since 1970 three major earthquakes in the united states were responsible for 188 of the 212 total earthquakerelated fatalities see table 2 2 seismometers are instruments that measure and record the size and force of seismic waves essentially sound waves radiated from the earthquake as it ruptures seismometers generally consist of mass attached to fixed base during an earthquake the base moves and the mass does not and the relative motion is commonly transformed into an electrical voltage that is recorded seismograph usually refers to the seismometer and the recording device but the two terms are often used interchangeably 3 see usgs earthquakes facts and statistics at httpneicusgsgovneiseqlistseqstats htmltable_2 4 estimates of earthquakerelated fatalities vary and an exact tally of deaths and injuries

is located approximately 960 miles southwest of beijing and the earthquake was triggered approximately 12 miles below the earths surface as of june 11 2008 nearly 70000 fatalities had been reported the earthquake was felt in parts of eastern southern and central china and as far away as bangladesh taiwan thailand and vietnam several large aftershocks have occurred since the main seismic event the may 12 earthquake resulted from movement along northeasttrending reverse or thrust fault reflecting stresses resulting from the convergence of rocks of the tibetan plateau to the west against the crust underlying the sichuan basin and southeastern china the region has experienced large earthquakes in the past on august 25 1933 magnitude 75 earthquake struck the northwestern margin of the sichuan basin resulting in approximately 9300 fatalities some concerns have been raised about the possibility of an earthquake of similar magnitude occurring in seismically active region of the united states such as southern california where fault movement similar to the eastern sichuan earthquake may occur on may 22 2008 the usgs released hypothetical scenario for magnitude 78 southern california earthquake called the shakeout scenario in the scenario scientists hypothetically simulated the ground shaking and fault rupture associated with magnitude 78 earthquake and estimated the resulting damage to buildings and infrastructure the scenario estimated approximately 1800 fatalities and 213 billion in economic losses as result of the earthquake the report points to aggressive retrofitting programs that have increased the seismic resistance of buildings highways and other critical infrastructure in southern california as one reason why the number of possible fatalities is relatively low some scientists have raised the possibility that earthquakes such as the may 12 sichuan event may sometimes exhibit cascading behavior where bursts of seismic energy are released along different places in single fault or jump between connected faults earthquakes that occur along the sierra madre fault in southern california for example could trigger series of cascading seismic events along other faults such as the san andreas seismic hazards estimates may not fully account for the damage that could be caused by cascading earthquakes along connected fault system scientists are hoping to examine the sichuan earthquake in more detail to better understand the nature of cascading seismic events and how they affect the us seismic hazard estimates sources ken hudnut geophysicist usgs

infrastructure and lost economic activity as urban development continues in earthquakeprone regions in the united states concerns are increasing about the exposure of the built environment including utilities and transportation systems to potential earthquake damage7 one estimate of loss from severe earthquake in the angeles area is over 500 billion an even higher estimate approximately 900 billion includes damage to the heavily populated central new jerseyphiladelphia corridor if 65 magnitude earthquake occurred along fault lying between new york city and philadelphia8 some studies and techniques combine seismic risk with the value of the building inventory9 and income losses eg business interruption wage and rental income losses in cities counties or regions across the country to provide estimations of economic losses from earthquakes one report10 calculates that the annualized loss from earthquakes nationwide is 44 billion with california oregon and washington accounting for 37 billion 84 of the us total estimated annualized loss table 4 shows cities with estimated annualized us earthquake losses over 10 million annualized earthquake loss ael addresses two components of seismic risk the probability of ground motion and the consequences of ground motion it enables comparison between different regions with different seismic hazards and different building construction types and quality for example earthquake hazard is higher in the angeles area than in memphis but the general building stock in angeles is more resistant to the effects of earthquakes the ael annualizes the expected losses by averaging them by year single large earthquake can cause far more damage than the average annual estimate however annualized estimates help provide comparisons of infrequent high impact events like damaging earthquakes with more frequently occurring hazards like floods hurricanes or other types of severe weather the annualized earthquake loss values shown in table 4 represent future estimates and are calculated by multiplying losses from all potential future ground motions by their respective frequencies of occurrence and then summing these values11 7

2001 annualized earthquake losses ael calculated in 2000 dollars estimating earthquake damage is not an exact science and depends on many factors primarily these are the probability of ground motion occurring in particular area see figure 1 and the consequences of that ground motion which are largely function of building construction type and quality and of the level of ground motion and shaking during the actual event some researchers have questioned whether the probability of ground motion estimates for regions of the country that experience infrequent earthquakes such as the new madrid seismic crs10 zone are too high12 these researchers question whether the benefits of building structures to conform with the earthquake probability estimates merit the costs in light of the uncertainty in making those probability estimates13 an uncertainty analysis of the seismic hazard in the new madrid seismic zone is beyond the scope of this report the new madrid seismic zone in the central united states is vulnerable to large but infrequent earthquakes series of large magnitude greater than 70 earthquakes struck the mississippi valley over the winter of 18111812 centered close to the town of new madrid mo some of the tremors were felt as far away as charleston sc and washington dc the mechanism for the earthquakes in the new madrid zone is poorly understood14 and earthquakes of comparable magnitude have occurred in the area since these events such factors contribute to the difficulty of making reasonable damage estimate for lowfrequency high impact event in the region based on the probability of an earthquake of similar magnitude occurring this uncertainty has implications for policy decisions to ameliorate risk such as setting building codes and for designing and building structures to withstand level of shaking commensurate with the risk developers of building codes tend to err on the side of caution table 4 also shows annualized earthquake losses for the cities of new york boston and newark where destructive earthquakes have struck for generations15 those cities represent areas of relatively low seismic hazard but have high populations and dense infrastructure which produces significant risk to people and structures according to some estimates16 in the absence of any significant or damaging earthquakes for those cities in recent memory however the actual risk is difficult to grasp intuitively monitoring congress authorized the usgs to monitor seismic activity in the united states in the 1990 reauthorization of the national

table 3 crs11 motion project nsmp globally the usgs and the incorporated research institutions for seismology iris operate 140 seismic stations of the global seismic network gsn in more than 80 countries the gsn provides worldwide coverage of earthquakes including reporting and research and also monitors nuclear explosions advanced national seismic system anss the mission of anss is to provide accurate and timely data and information products for seismic events including their effects on buildings and structures employing modern monitoring methods and technologies17 if fully implemented anss would encompass more than 7000 earthquake sensor systems covering parts of the nation vulnerable to earthquake hazards the system includes over 700 stations consisting of backbone stations dense urban networks and regional networks18 in the original conception for anss approximately 6000 of the planned stations are to be installed in 26 high risk urban areas to monitor strong ground shaking and how buildings and other structures respond currently five highrisk urban areas have instruments deployed in sufficient density to generate the data to produce near realtime maps called shakemaps19 which can be used in emergency response during and after an earthquake approximately 1000 new instruments are to replace aging and obsolete stations in the networks that now monitor the nations most seismically active regions the current regional networks contain mix of modern digital broadband and high resolution instruments that can provide realtime data they are supplemented by older instruments that may require manual downloading of data universities in the region typically operate the regional networks and will likely continue to do so as anss is implemented lastly approximately 100 instruments comprise the existing backbone of anss with roughly uniform distribution across the united states including alaska and hawaii these instruments provide broad and uniform minimum threshold of coverage across the country the backbone network consists of usgs deployed instruments and other instruments that serve both anss and the earthscope project described below under research understanding earthquakes in 2004 congress passed the national earthquake hazards reduction program reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108360 which authorized 30 million for anss in fy2005 and 36 million per year through fy2009 congress first authorized the program with pl 106503 at level of 38 million for fy2002 and 44 million for fy2003 total expenditures for anss from fy2002 to fy2007 are

11 of the 7000 seismic stations originally envisioned for the program national strongmotion project nsmp under anss the usgs operates the nsmp to record seismic data from damaging earthquakes in the united states on the ground and in buildings and other structures in densely urbanized areas the program currently has 900 strongmotion20 instruments in 701 permanent stations across the united states and in the caribbean the nsmp has three components data acquisition data management and research the near realtime measurements collected by the nsmp are used by other government agencies for emergency response and realtime warnings if fully implemented the anss program would deploy about 3000 strongmotion instruments and the nsmp program would operate those strongmotion instruments located in buildings and other structures many of the current nsmp instruments are older designs and are being upgraded with modern seismometers global seismic network gsn the gsn is system of broadband digital seismographs arrayed around the globe and designed to collect highquality data that are readily accessible to users worldwide typically via computer currently 140 stations have been installed in 80 countries and the system is nearly complete although in some regions the spacing and location of stations has not fully met the original goal of uniform spacing of approximately 2000 kilometers the system is currently providing data to the united states and other countries and institutions for earthquake reporting and research and for monitoring nuclear explosions to assess compliance with the comprehensive test ban treaty the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief 2005 pl 10913 provided more than 8 million to

forecasts are being made available now that give for example 24hour probability of earthquake aftershocks for particular region such as california these forecasts are not predictions and are currently intended to increase public awareness of the seismic hazard improve emergency response and increase scientific understanding of the shortterm hazard24 in the california example timedependent map is created and updated every hour by system that considers all earthquakes large and small detected by the california integrated seismic network25 and calculates probability that each earthquake will be followed by an aftershock26 that can cause strong shaking the probabilities are calculated from known behavior of aftershocks and the possible shaking pattern based on historical data when destructive earthquake occurs in the united states or in other countries the first reports of its location or epicenter27 and magnitude originate either from the national earthquake information center in golden co or from one of the regional seismic networks that are part of anss other organizations such as universities consortia and individual seismologists may also contribute information about the earthquake after the event products such as shakemap are assembled as rapidly as possible to assist in emergency response and damage estimation following destructive earthquake national earthquake information center neic the neic part of the usgs is located in golden co originally established as part of the national ocean survey department of commerce in 1966 the neic was made part of the 24 usgs openfile report 20041390 and california 24hour aftershock forecast map at httppasadenawrusgsgovstep 25 the california integrated seismic network is the california region of anss see httpwwwcisnorg 26 earthquakes typically occur in clusters in which the earthquake with the largest magnitude is called the main shock events before the main shock are called foreshocks and those after are called aftershocks see also httppasadenawrusgsgovstepaftershocks html 27 the epicenter of an earthquake is the point on the earths surface directly above the hypocenter the hypocenter is the location beneath the earths surface where the fault rupture begins crs14 usgs in 1973 with data gathered from the networks described above and from other sources the neic determines the location and size of all destructive earthquakes that occur worldwide and disseminates the information to the appropriate national or international agencies government public information channels news media scientists and scientific groups and the general public the neic has longstanding agreements with key emergency response groups federal state and local authorities and other key organizations in earthquakeprone regions who receive automated alerts typically location and magnitude of an earthquake within few minutes of an event in the united states the neic sends these preliminary alerts by email and pager immediately after an earthquakes magnitude and epicenter are automatically determined by computer28 this initial determination is then checked by aroundtheclock staff who confirm and update the magnitude and location data29 after the confirmation second set of notifications and confirmations are triggered to key recipients by email pager fax and telephone for earthquakes outside the united states the neic notifies the state department operations center and often sends alerts directly to staff at american embassies and consulates in the affected countries to the international red cross the department of humanitarian affairs and other recipients who have made arrangements to receive alerts with the advent of the usgs earthquake notification service ens notifications of earthquakes detected by the anssneic are provided free to interested parties users of the service can specify the regions of interest establish notification thresholds of earthquake magnitude designate whether they wish to receive notification of aftershocks and even set different magnitude thresholds for daytime or nighttime to trigger notification shakemap traditionally the information commonly available following destructive earthquake has been epicenter and magnitude as in the data provided by the neic described above those two parameters by themselves however do not always indicate the intensity of shaking and extent of damage following major earthquake recently the usgs developed product called shakemap that provides near realtime map of ground motion and shaking intensity following an earthquake in areas of the united states where the shakemap system is in place currently shakemaps are available for northern california southern california the pacific northwest nevada utah and alaska30 figure 3 shows an example of shakemap with improvements to the regional seismographic networks in the areas where shakemap is available new realtime telemetry from the region and advances in digital communication and computation shakemaps are now triggered automatically and made available within minutes of the event via the web in addition better maps 28 stuart simkin neic golden co telephone conversation nov 4 2006 29 in early 2006 the neic implemented an aroundtheclock operation center and seismic event processing center in response to the indonesian earthquake and resulting tsunami of december 2004 funding to implement 247 operations was provided by pl 10913 30 see httpearthquakeusgsgoveqcentershakemap crs15 are now available because of recent improvements in understanding the relationship between the ground motions recorded during the earthquake and the intensity of resulting damage the maps produced portray the extent of damaging shaking and can be used by emergency response and for estimating loss following major earthquake if databases containing inventories of buildings and lifelines31 are available they can be combined with shaking intensity data to produce maps of estimated damage figure 3 example of shakemap source usgs httpearthquakeusgsgoveqcentershakemapncshake40206647 note earthquake occurred northeast of the the geysers ca on december 1 2007 at 1250 pm with magnitude of 39 viewed on january 12 2008 the shakemaps have limitations especially during the first few minutes following an earthquake before more data arrive from distributed sources because they are generated automatically the initial maps are preliminary and may not have been checked by human oversight when first made available they are considered work in progress but are deemed to be very promising especially as more modern seismic instruments are added to the regional networks under anss and the computational and telecommunication ability improves 31 lifelines are essential utility and transportation systems crs16 national earthquake hazards reduction program nehrp in 1977 congress passed the earthquake hazards reduction act pl 95124 establishing nehrp as longterm earthquake risk reduction program for the united states the program initially focused on research led by usgs and nsf toward understanding and ultimately predicting earthquakes earthquake prediction has proved intractable thus far and the nehrp program shifted its focus to minimizing losses from earthquakes after they occur fema was created in 1979 and president carter designated it as the lead agency for nehrp in 1980 congress reauthorized the earthquake hazards reduction act pl 96472 defining fema as the lead agency and authorizing additional funding for earthquake hazard preparedness and mitigation to fema and the national bureau of standards now nist mitigation in 1990 congress reauthorized nehrp pl 101614 and made substantive changes to decrease the emphasis on earthquake prediction clarify the role of fema clarify and expand the program objectives and require federal agencies to adopt seismic safety standards for new and existing federal buildings in 2004 congress reauthorized nehrp through fy2009 pl 108360 and shifted primary responsibility for planning and coordinating nehrp from fema to nist it also established new interagency coordinating committee and new advisory committee both focused on earthquake hazards reduction the current program activities are focused on four broad areas developing effective measures to reduce earthquake hazards promoting the adoption of earthquake hazards reduction measures by federal state and local governments national building standards and model building code organizations engineers architects building owners and others who play role in planning and constructing buildings bridges structures and critical infrastructure or lifelines improving the basic understanding of earthquakes and their effects on people and infrastructure through interdisciplinary research involving engineering natural sciences and social economic and decision sciences and developing and maintaining anss the george brown jr network for earthquake engineering simulation nees32 and the gsn the house science committee report in the 108th congress on hr 2608 pl 108360 noted that nehrp has produced wealth of useful information since 1977 but it also stated that the programs potential has been limited by the inability of the nehrp agencies to coordinate their efforts33 the committee asserted that restructuring the program with nist as the lead agency directing funding towards 32 nees is an nsffunded project that consists of 15 experimental facilities and an it infrastructure with goal of mitigating earthquake damage by the use of improved materials designs construction techniques and monitoring tools 33 us house committee on science national earthquake hazards reduction program reauthorization act of 2003 hrept 108246 aug 14 2003 p 13 crs17 appropriate priorities and implementing it as true interagency program would lead to improvement under the reauthorization the director of nist chairs the interagency coordinating committee which is composed of the directors of fema usgs nsf the office of science and technology policy and the office of management and budget the interagency coordinating committee is charged with overseeing the planning management and coordination of the program primary responsibilities for the nehrp agencies break down as follows nist supports the development of performancebased seismic engineering tools and works with other groups to promote the commercial application of the tools through building codes standards and construction practices fema assists other agencies and privatesector groups to prepare and disseminate building codes and practices for structures and lifelines and aid development of performancebased codes for buildings and other structures usgs conducts research and other activities to characterize and assess earthquake risks and 1 operates forum using the neic for the international exchange of earthquake information 2 works with other nehrp agencies to coordinate activities with earthquake reduction efforts in other countries and 3 maintains seismic hazard maps in support of building codes for

experiments and computer simulations of how buildings bridges utilities coastal regions and materials behave during an earthquake conclusions the 2003 reauthorization of nehrp shifted leadership of the multiagency program from fema to nist and authorized the program through fy2009 congress may wish to determine whether the reorganized structure has yielded expected benefits for the program now in its fourth year since pl 108360 was enacted appropriations for nehrp have not met levels authorized in the law for fy2005 through fy2008 falling short by an average of 31 for fy2005 through fy2008 what effect funding at the levels enacted through fy2008 has had on all programs authorized under nehrp is unclear although progress in some programs has been slower than anticipated for example the advanced national seismic system anss an integrated system of earthquake sensors deployed across the country is about 11 complete in part because appropriated funds for anss have historically been fraction of the authorized levels to what extent the current rate of progress toward meeting the goals of anss affects the us capability to detect earthquakes and minimize losses after an earthquake occurs is not clear congress may also wish to examine if and how new research results generated under earthscope research program at nsf distinct from nehrp on understanding earthquakes are contributing to the nations resilience to earthquake disasters an ongoing question is how scientific advances in understanding the fundamental nature of earthquakes funded by earthscope and other programs at nsf and the usgs can be applied towards improving the us capability to minimize losses from destructive earthquakes additional reading aspects of the federal role in the aftermath of
