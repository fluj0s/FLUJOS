defense division speculation about ties between suspects in the oklahoma city federal building bombing and state militias have raised concern over what these militias are and from where they derive their authority if any it is necessary to put the state militias into the context of state as opposed to federal military forces first each state has its army national guard and air national guard with both federal and state missions1 the army national guard and air national guard are somewhat unique among the worlds reserve military forces as they fill both federal and state missions each states national guard is both military force under the command of the respecti ve state or territorial governor and part of the federal reserve components therefore each member has dual status as member of the national guard of his or her state and as member of the reserve component of the army or air force the national guards federal mission is to provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war national emergency or as otherwise needed the guards state mission is to provide trained and disciplined forces for domestic emergencies or as otherwise directed by state law second several states have military forces which are organized and funded by the states but which have formal association with the federallysupported trained and equipped national guard2 these forces are often called state guards military reserves defense forces or emergency volunteers their mission is to perform some of the national guards domestic responsibilities in case the guard

soldier of fortune april 1995 51 8 state volunteers replace activated guardsmen washington post december 24 1990 a3mobilized for war their modern origins date back to both world wars when the entire national guard was mobilized leaving organized military forces other than rapidly expanding active duty units who had to focus on wartime training to deal with natural disasters or civil disorders3 similarly some state defense forces assisted in crowd control or coping with natural disasters during the persian gulf war period when 62000 regular army guard and 16000 air guardsmen were called to active duty4 there has been some concern in the media that members of some state defense forces have attracted individuals whose temperament is not suited to being part of an organized armed force or who have assumed inappropriately the same powers that the regular national guard has5 other state defense forces however appear to be welldisciplined and have had few if any such problems6 third there are groups which call themselves state militias but have official sanction from state government it appears that the michigan militia which has been the object of much discussion in the aftermath of the oklahoma city bombing is an entirely private organization7 in some cases of course it may be that individuals who are members of either the regular national guard of state or that states home defense force or guard may also be member of private group that calls itself militia however department of defense regulations prohibit military personnel from participating in groups that espouse supremacist causes or advocate violence one academic observer has suggested and some spokesmen for the national guard have agreed that the high degree of racial and sexual integration in the armed forces today is actually at odds with the attitudes of white supremacist groups leading some members of these groups to take an adversarial stance toward both the active and reserve components of the armed forces including the national guard8
