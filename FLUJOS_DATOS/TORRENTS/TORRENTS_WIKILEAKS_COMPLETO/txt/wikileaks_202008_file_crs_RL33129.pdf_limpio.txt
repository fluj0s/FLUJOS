reducing human and economic losses from flooding in the united states local governments are responsible for land use nd zoning decisions that shape floodplain and coastal development however state nd federal government s also influence community and individual decisions on managing flood risk the federal government constructs some of the na tions flood control infrastructure supports hazard mitigation offers flood insurance and provides emergency response and disaster aid for significant floods in ddition to constructing flood damage reduction infrastructure state and local entities operate and maintain most of the flood control infrastructure and have initia l floodfighting responsibilities prior to the lower mississippi river flood of 1927 the federal role in flood control was limited the flood control ac t of 1936 19 stat 1570 declared some flood control proper federa l activity today the fede ral agencies most involved in flood control and flood fighting and emer gency response are the us army corps of engineers corps and the federal emergency management agency fema the 110th congress is faced with numerous flood control issues including responding to disasters and adjusting fe deral flood policies the recent midwestern floods and hurricane katrina ve broadened interest in fundamental review of the current approach to managing floodwaters questions raised are do current policies programs and practices result in an acceptable level of aggregate national risk do they promote wise use and investments in the nations floodplains and coasts do they encourage development that puts people in harms way levees represent particular challenge in that they may encourage development in floodprone areas but sometimes fail or are ove rtopped by significant storms hurricane katrina brought national attention to the catastrophi c consequences when structures fail or are breached similarly two major midwest ern floods in the span of 15 years one in 1993 and one in 2008 have raised concer ns about structures ability to reduce or avoid flood damages and their ffects on development patterns the 110th congress addressed so flood issues in the first omnibus water resources development act wrda enacted after hurricane katrina wrda 2007 pl 110114 for example wr da 2007 requires that national water resources planning avoid the unwise use of floodplains and floodprone areas and requires the president to report by 2010 on national vulnerability to flood damages including the risk to human life this report is to include assessments of current programs and recommendations for improvements the law also creates committee on levee safety to make recommendations fo r national levee safety program how these changes are implemented over the next few years may affect the nature of federal investment in flood and storm damage infrastructure and mitigation measures this report provides primer on re sponsibilities for flood management describes the role of federal agencies and discusses flood issues before the 110th congress the report also discusses th legislative response to hurricane katrinahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33129contents flood management

flood these flood year designations however do not indicate how often an ar ea may flood rather they are based on the chance that an area may flood in any given year for example the term 100year flood is the flood elevation that has 1 chance of being equaled or exceeded annually it is not the flood that will occur once every 100 years 100year floods can occur more than once in relatively short period of time likewise 500year flood is five times less likely to occur in any given year then 100year flood 02 chance of flooding flood risk management and levees federal primer midwestern flooding in 2008 and hu rricane katrina flooding in 2005 have enlivened interest in reducing the risk of flooding in communities across the nation these largescale events have demonstrated that not only is property damaged during floods but also floods can represent signif icant risks to life and can cause economic disruption and other social hardships the 110th congress like many earlier congresses is faced with numerous flood control issues including responding to flood events and altering federal flood damage reduction mitiga tion and insurance policies these issues have been brought to the fore as the midwest experiences its second major flood in 15 years1 in the united states local governments are responsible for land use and zoning decisions that direct floodpl ain and coastal development however state and federal governments also influence community nd individual decisions on managing flood risk for example the federal governme nt constructs some of the nations flood control infrastructure suppor ts hazard mitigation actions offers flood insurance and provides emergency response and disaster ai d for significant floods the federal agencies most involved in flood damage reduction and flood fighting and emergency response are the us army corps of engi neers corps and the federal emergency management agency fema this report is divided into three sec tions the first describes the current intergovernmental division of responsibilitie s for flood management and the federal role and interest in flood management the second provides framework for understanding flood risk management issues and the challenge of addressing the reliability and level of protection of the nations levees the third section describes actions that the 110th congress has already taken and

protection such as seawalls and the periodic placement of sand on beaches to cont rol erosion the flood control act of 1950 64 stat 170 began the corps emergency ope rations by authorizing flood preparedness and emergency operations individuals communities and the various levels of government as with many other policy areas the federal system has resu lted in public functi ons for flood damage reduction being shared by all levels of government local governments are responsible for land use and zoning deci sions that direct floodplain and coastal development however numer ous federal and state fl ood policies and programs influence local and individua l decisionmaking the fede ral government also funds some flood and storm damage reduction measures manages flood insurance and mitigation program and provides disaster assistance2 it also generates essential data through mapping and other efforts levees may be built by federal state or local entities including private entities at the local level generally levees are maintained by local entity with some exceptions local levee dist ricts are generally the first entities responsible for monitoring levee conditions during flooding the levee districts are also the first entity responsible for emergency response if flood or other emergency exhausts the levee districts flood fighting resources the distri ct typically contacts the state the state will contribute its flood fighting res ources to the local effort as the states resources are exhausted it typically will contact the corps for assistance under the corps emergency response authority federal role and interest in reducing flood damages the federal role in flood control began in the late 19t h century prompted by devastating floods in the mississippi river basin congre ss created commission to oversee the development of levee system to contro l the rivers flow the mississippi river flood of 19273 and floods in the mid1930s ushered in modern era of federal flood control investment the flood control act of 1936 19 stat 1570 declared flood control proper federal activity in the national interest4 section 1 of the act established the following policy it is hereby recognized that destructive floods upon the rivers of the united states upsetting orderly processes nd causing loss of life and property including the erosion of lands and impairing and obstructing navigation highways railroads and other channels of commerce between the states constitute menace to national welfare that it is the sense of congress that flood control on navigational waters or their tributaries is proper activity of the federal government in cooperation with states their political subdivisions andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33129crs3 5 r burby hurricane katrina and the doxes of government disaster policy prepared for annals of the american academy of political and social science march 2006 6 this is described in the corps digest of water resources policies and authorities continuedlocalities thereof that investigations and improvements of rivers and other waterways including watersheds thereo f for floodcontrol purposes are in the interest of the general welfare that the federal government should improve or participate in the improvement of naviga ble waters or their tributaries including watersheds thereof for floodcontrol purposes if the benefits to whomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs and if the lives and social security of people are otherwise adversely affected as with many other policy areas the federal system has resulted in public functions for flood damage reduc tion being shared by all vels of government since the mid1980s local project sponsors often local governments or special levee and drainage districts share construction cost of federal flood control projects and are fully responsible for opera tion and maintenance local entities and sometimes state entities may construct flood control infrastructure inde pendently from the federal government and are responsible for nd use and zoning decisions guiding development in floodplains and coastal areas the impetus for federal and state ttention to flooding comes from multiple sources for instance flooding often can occur regionally and flood control works of one community can exacerbate or altern atively mitigate flood risk in other areas some federal and state actions attempt to alter individual nd community behavior to account for flooding risks and losses most individuals discount the probability of loss from infrequent events even if those events may cause significant losses and disruption in general many local d ecision makers do not view environmental hazards such as flooding as serious pr oblems in comparison to the many other problems that local governments are expected to address5 principal federal agencies as previously noted the corps and fema are the principal federal agencies involved in flood damage reduction and flood fighting and emergency response other federal ag encies also are invol ved with flood damage reduction projects such as the us depa rtment of agricultures natural resources conservation service the depa rtment of the interiors bureau of reclamation and the tennessee valley authority at the direction of congress the corps is authorized to participate in the cost shared planning and cons truction of flood damage re duction projects such as building levees and floodwalls to reduce damages from coastal and riverine flood hazards the corps is responsible for mu ch of the federal c onstruction investment in flood control and storm pr otection infrastructure it has constructed nearly 9000 miles of the nations roughly 15000 miles of levees corps involvement in flood control construction is predicated on the pr oject being in the national interest which is determined by the likeli hood of widespread and general benefits shortfall in the local ability to solve the water resources problem the national savings achieved and precedent and law6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33129crs4 6 continued engineering pamphlet ep 1165211 1999 7 as discussed earlier the term 100year flood is the flood elevation that has 1 chance of being equaled or exceeded annually it is not the flood that will occur once every 100 years 100year floods can occur more than once in relatively short period of time the 1994 galloway report see note 15 uses an analogy of bag of 100 marbles where 99 are clear and 1 is black every time you pull out black marble would be equivalent to 100year flood but the black marble is replaced and the bag is shaken up before you draw again so it is possible but not likely you might draw the black marble two or three times in row or with greater frequency than only one time in 100 draws 8 although the corps account paying for these activities may receive some appropriations in the annual energy and water development appropriations acts this initial appropriation is often supplemented with emergency appropriations specific to the emergency being addressed 9 for more information see crs report rl33053 federal

local entity for operati on maintenance repa ir and rehabilitation the corps however has retained res ponsibility for roughly 900 miles of levees primarily along the mississippi river nd for multipurpose dams fema has various programs such as its hazard mitigation grant program and its flood mitigation assistance program that promote fl ood mitigation actions such as assisting in removing vulnerable structur from floodplains and other activities that reduce the impact of flood disaster the corps performs most of the federal inspections of levees levee inspections are conducted for participation in two federal programs the first is the corps rehabilitation and inspection program this program provides federal assistance for repairing levees damaged during floods the corps is to conduct annual or semi annual inspections of levees for initial inclusion in the program and for continued eligibility for assistance the corps also often performs the inspections to certify levees

protection assessing integrating and managing threats vulner abilities and consequence by john moteff 11 association of stat flood plain managers reducing flood losses is the 1 chance 100year flood standard sufficient washington dc 2004a flood risk framework hurricane katrina and recent midwestern flooding demonstrate that not only property damage but also significant risk s to life economic disruption and other social hardships occur during floods flood risk is composite of three factors vulnerability which allows threat to cause consequences eg level of protection provided by levees and dams their reliability and location within floodplain10 threat of an event eg probability of category 5 hurricane storm surge or 200year flood affectin g particular location and consequence of an event eg prope rty damage loss of life economic loss environmental dama ge reduced health and safety and social disruption reducing vulnerability and the 100year flood in the united states the 1 annual chance flood more commonly known as the 100year flood is standard often used as basis for iden tifying mapping and ma naging flood hazards for example the nfip and most state nd local governments use location in the 100 year floodplain or similar coastal zone inundation areas as triggers for various requirements the 100year flood standard was established at the recommendation of group of experts in the late 1960s i t was selected because it was already being used by some agencies and it was thoug ht that flood of that magnitude and frequency represented reasonable probability of occurrence and loss worth protecting against and an intermediate leve l that would alert planners and property owners to the effects of even greater floods11 the adoption of the 100year flood standard in many respects guides perceptions of what is an acceptable level of vulnerability the 100year flood standard is vul nerability standard and not risk standard thus the question of whether the 100year flood standard combined with current threat and consequen ce information results in an acceptable level of risk remains largely unaddressed this question is especially relevant for low probability high consequence events such as category 4 hurricane hitting major urban center the attempt to provide at least 100y ear flood protection often drives local floodplain management and infrastructure investments resulting in measure of equity within and across communities that equity in vulnerability however results in uneven levels of risk because floodi ng of different co mmunities has different consequences such as differences in th potential loss of life social disruption structures damaged and economic impact because of variations in land use and development patterns httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33129crs6 the national flood insurance program doe s not differentiate between 100year flood protection provided by flood contro l structure and flood protection resulting from natural topography and hydrology as result development behind levees and downstream of dams providing 100year flood protection is not signated as located in special flood hazard area thus freeing occupants from flood insurance requirements while the nfip largely pr esumes that levees dams and other flood control structures will not fail their presence does not entirely eliminate an areas vulnerability to flooding the residual flood risk behind levees or downstream of dams remains largely unaccounted for in the nfip and often is not incorporated into individual local and state decisionmaking residual risk is the portion of risk that remains after flood control structures have been built and other damagereducing measures have been taken risk remains because of the lik elihood of the measures design being surpassed by floods intensity and of struct ural failure of the measures often when the designs of flood control structures are rpassed or when structures fail for other reasons the resulting flood is catastrophic as shown by the floodwall breaches in new orleans with hurricane katrina in 2005 the damaging consequences of floods increase as developmen t occurs behind levees and below dams ironically this development may occur because of the fl ood protection provided the nations risk in terms of lives lost economic disrup tion and property damage is increased by overconfidence in the leve l and reliability of stru ctural flood protection next step risk management approach investments in flood control measures such as dams and levees and emergency response ac tivities have resulted in decreasing trend excluding the deaths associated with hurricane katrina and most recent midwestern floods in lives st to flooding since the 1920s during the same period property damage due to flooding has been increasing through the nfip the federal government attempts to promote floodhazard awareness and damagereducing practices as well as to ssist individuals in managing flood losses while this produces clear benefits for moderate floods some stakeholders are concerned that structural flood control measures and the nfip together may contribute to false sense of security for individuals and communities this sense of security may foster decisions to locate in potentially hazardous areas thus increasing the national vul nerability to flood losses the 2008 midwestern floods and hurricane ka trina have contributed to interest in fundamental reexaminations of the approach to managing floodwaters some of the questions raised are do current polic ies programs practi ces and investments result in an acceptable level of aggregate risk for the nation do they promote wise use and investments of the na tions floodplains and coasts risk management is being increasingly viewed as method for setting priorities for managing some hazards in the united states because floodplain and coastal development are largely managed by local governments some aspects of national flood risk management likely would be unwelcome and infeasible and could be perceived as resulting in an inequitable di stribution of flood prot ection for example if floods in large urban concentrations are perceived as representin g greater risk for the nation federal resources may be di rected away from protecting smaller communities and lesspopulated states two of the concerns raised in discussionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33129crs7 12 for information on dam safety see crs report rl33108 aging infrastructure dam safety by nic lane 13 national research council levee policy for the national flood insurance program us dept of co mmerce oct 1982of greater emphasis on risk analysis in the development and design of specific projects are that risk analysis may result in lower levels of protection being implemented in some areas and that in formation and knowledge are insufficient to perform an adequate analysis however an argument can be made that the federal government has an interest in reducing risks resulting in national consequences and in prioritizing federal involvement and appropr iations accordingly factors complicating the determinati on of the nations flood risk include changing conditions and incomplete inform ation for example many flood control projects were built decades ago using the av ailable data technolog ies and scientific knowledge of the period that may have underestimated flood haza rds for particular areas similarly there are issues with changes in risk over time due to processes such as land loss subsidence sealevel rise reduced natural buffers urban development and infrastructure aging for existing dams there is some information on consequences of failure as measured by loss of life economic loss environmental loss and disruption of lifeline infrastruct ure such as bridges and power grids however the database with this inform ation only tracks the amount and type of losses not the likelihood of failure12 riskreduction approach for organizi ng federal floodre lated investments likely would incorporate many struct ural and nonstructu ral flood management measures already being considered and implemented but change their priority and mix options considered in riskcente red approach may incl ude shifting federal policy toward wise use of floodprone ar eas eg rules or incentives to limit some types of development in floodplains inco rporating residual risk and differences in riverine and coastal flood risk into federa l programs eg resi dual risk premiums as part of the national flood insurance prog ram creating nati onal inventory and inspection program for levees promo ting greater flood mitigation and damage mitigation investments ree valuating operations of fl ood control reservoirs for climate variability and uncer tainty and investing in technology and science for improved understanding of flooding threats the levee challenge hurricane katrina brought national attention to the issue of levee and flood wall reliability and differe nt levels of pr otection provided by flood damage reduction structur particularly those prot ecting concentrated urban and population centers 1982 national research council re port stated that levee overtopping or failure was estima ted to be involved in appr oximately onethird of all flood disasters and that the nations dam inspection program suggests that large percentage of locally built levees are likely poorly designed and maintained13 how to address levee reliability and various levels of protection remains at issue many levees protecting todays communities and agricultural investments originally were pla nned and constructed beginning near ly century ago or more than century ago by local

separate levees landowners often consolidated their resour ces by forming levee district as consequence of this history many of todays physical constructions and configurations as well as institutional arrangements fo r flood protection have roots distinct from their current use as flood protection for development most levees currently are operated by levee district or some other special or general local government for the most part municipalities serving concentrated urban populations have assumed flood control responsibilities while speci levee districts remain abundant in rural and agricultural areas note however that there are exceptions to this generality an issue that may limit government entities interest in levee construction maintenance and possibly inspection re sponsibilities is liability for flood damages principal source of concern may stem from the uncertainty related to the implications of paterno v state of california which held the state of california liable for levee it did not build but opera ted as part of statesponsored levee system 14 the issue of federal liability for damages is discussed in crs report rl34131 federal liability for hurricane

database with an inventory of the nati ons levees by 2009 and to inspect federally constructe d and other levees how these changes are implemented over the next few years may affect the nature of the federal investment in flood and storm damage infrastructure and mitigation measures selected remaining issues the 2005 hurricane season and the 2008 midwestern floods have focuse d the nations attention once again on issues that flood experts have debated for decades the vastation of these events renewed public concerns about reliability of the nations aging flood control levees and dams the debate over what is an acceptable level of risk especially for lowprobability highconsequence events and who should bear the costs to reduce the flood risk particularly in the case of levees is taking place not only in the affected states but nationally the concerns being raised rang widely including interest in providing more protection for concentrated urban popul ations risk to the nations public and private economic infrastructure support fo r reducing vulnerability by investing in natural buffers equity in protection for lowincome and minority populations consistency in and the form of flood insu rance and disaster aid and the level of federal state and local investment in structural and nonstructural flood damage reduction measures response to the 2005 hurricane season and previous midwestern floods included discussions of expanding mitigation activitie s such as floodproofing structures and buyouts of structures on the most floodprone lands investing in efforts to restore natural flood and storm surg attenuation and assuring vigilant maintenance of existing flood control structures as well as interest in new and augmented structural flood protection measures although majo r flood events generally spur these discussions the policy changes implemented often are incremental15 the 110thhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33129crs10 15 continued called the galloway

practice by judy schneider for senate jurisdiction see crs report 98242 committee jurisdiction and referral in the senate by judy schneidercongress like previous congresses faces challenge in reaching consensus on whether and how to proceed on anything other than incremental change because of the wealth of constituenci and communities affected by federal flood policy another practical challenge is the division of congressional committee jurisdictions over the federal agencies and programs involved in flood mitigation protection and response16 there are many questions that remain about how events unfolded in the aftermath of hurricane katrina and much information that is still needed to understand how to apply and communicate na tionally the lessons in the gulf and midwestern states learned about flood risk and disaster prep aredness and response although there is way to protect agains t all flood risk many contend that more information is needed to evaluate flood ri sk to understand the re liability and residual risk of structural flood protection and to incorporate the full range of flood consequences into local state and federal decisionmaki ng and programs
