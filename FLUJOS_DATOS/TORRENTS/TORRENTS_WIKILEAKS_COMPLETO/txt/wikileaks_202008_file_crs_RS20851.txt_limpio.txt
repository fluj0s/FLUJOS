national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the department of the navy don has several efforts underway to transform us naval forces to prepare them for future military challenges key elements of naval transformation include focus on operating in littoral waters increasing the navys capabilities for participating in the global war on terrorism gwot networkcentric operations use of unmanned vehicles directly launching and supporting expeditionary operations ashore from sea bases new kinds of naval formations new shipdeployment approaches reducing personnel requirements and streamlined and reformed business practices this report will be updated as events warrant background this report focuses on the transformation of us naval forces the navy and the marine corps which are both contained in the department of the navy don for an overview of defense transformation in general see crs report rl32238 defense transformation background and oversight issues for congress by ronald orourke key elements of naval transformation table 1 summarizes several key elements of us naval transformation each of these elements is discussed below1 1 up through 2006 don organized its transformation efforts under its overall vision for the future called sea power 21 the sea power 21 framework remains in place but the navy in 2007 appears to be emphasizing it less in discussing don transformation the sea power 21 framework is built around three main components sea strike which refers to the ability of naval forces to project precise and persistent offensive power from the sea sea shield which refers to the ability of naval forces to not only defend themselves at sea but to contribute to homeland defense project an overland defensive shield to help protect overseas us allies and friends and provide seabased theater and strategic defense against ballistic missiles and sea basing which refers to the ability of naval forces to operate at sea as sovereign entities free from concerns of access and political constraints associated with using land bases in other countries this use of the term sea basing is more general than sea basing concept discussed elsewhere in this report continued crs2 table 1 key elements of us naval transformation previous us naval forces transformed us naval forces plan for standalone midocean operations plan for joint and combined operations in littoral against soviet naval forces waters against regional adversaries primary focus on major combat operations increased focus on global war on terrorism gwot platformcentric operations networkcentric operations manned platforms only significant use of unmanned vehicles intermediate land bases established to support sea basing concept for staging forces at sea and expeditionary operations ashore conducting expeditionary operations ashore with little or reliance on nearby land bases primary formations are carrier battle groups and use of new naval formations such as expeditionary amphibious ready groups strike groups traditional shipdeployment approaches new approaches such as the fleet response plan frp and sea swap manpowerintensive ships and shore ships and shore operations with fewer people cost operations people treated as free good of personnel fully recognized traditional business practices streamlined reformed practices source table prepared by crs littoral operations in late 1992 with the publication of navy document entitled from the sea the navy formally shifted the focus of its planning away from the cold war scenario of countering soviet naval forces in midocean waters and toward the postcold war scenario of operating in littoral nearshore waters to counter the land and seabased forces of potential regional aggressors this shift in planning focus has led to numerous changes for the navy in concepts of operation training and equipment over the last 12 years among other things it moved the focus of navy planning from geographic environment where it could expect to operate primarily by itself to one where it would need to be able to operate effectively in joint manner alongside other us forces and in combined manner alongside military forces of other countries it also led to an increased emphasis on amphibious warfare mine warfare and defense against dieselelectric submarines and small surface craft the littoral combat ship lcs and the ddg1000 formerly ddx destroyer are key current navy efforts intended to improve the navys ability to operate in heavily defended littoral waters2 1 continued these three components are to be supported and bound together by forcenet which is the navys overarching concept for combining the various computer networks that us naval forces are now fielding into master computer network for tying together us naval personnel ships aircraft and installations for description of the sea power 21 framework see vern clark sea power 21 projecting decisive joint capabilities us naval institute proceedings oct 2002 pp 3241 2 for more on the lcs and ddg1000 programs see crs report rl33741 navy littoral combat ship lcs program oversight issues and options for congress by ronald orourke and crs report rl32109 navy ddg1000 ddx and cgx ship acquisition programs oversight issues and options for congress by ronald orourke crs3 global war on terrorism gwot the navy in mid2005 began implementing several initiatives intended to increase its ability to participate in what the administration refers to as the global war on terrorism gwot these initiatives include the establishment of the following navy expeditionary combat command ecc riverine force reserve civil affairs battalion maritime intercept operations mio intelligence exploitation pilot program an intelligence datamining capability at the national maritime intelligence center nmic and navy foreign area officer fao community consisting of officers with specialized knowledge of foreign countries and regions3 networkcentric operations the concept of networkcentric operations also called networkcentric warfare ncw is key feature of transformation for all us military services the concept which emerged in the late 1990s involves using computer networking technology to tie together personnel ships aircraft and installations in series of local and widearea networks capable of rapidly transmitting critical information many in don believe that ncw will lead to changes in naval concepts of operation and significantly increase us naval capabilities and operational efficiency key ncw efforts include the navys cooperative engagement capability cec network the naval fires network nfn the it21 investment strategy and forcenet which is the navys overarching concept for combining the various computer networks that us naval forces are now fielding into master computer network for tying together us naval personnel ships aircraft and installations related program is the navymarine corps intranet nmci4 unmanned vehicles many analysts believe that unmanned vehicles uvs will be another central feature of us military transformation perhaps uniquely among the military departments don in coming years will likely acquire uvs of every major kind air surface underwater and ground widespread use of uvs could lead to significant changes in the numbers and types of crewed ships and piloted aircraft that the navy procures in the future in naval concepts of operation and in measurements of naval power the lcs is to deploy various kinds of uvs unmanned air vehicles uavs and unmanned combat air vehicles or ucavs which are armed uavs if implemented widely could change the shape naval aviation unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs and uavs could significantly expand the capabilities of navy submarines5 sea basing for expeditionary operations naval forces are inherently sea based but the navy is currently using the term sea basing in more specific way to refer new operational concept under which forces would be staged at sea and then used to conduct expeditionary operations ashore with little or reliance on nearby land base under the sea basing concept functions previously conducted from the nearby land base including command and control fire support and logistics support would be relocated to the sea base which is to be formed by combination of amphibious and sealifttype ships the sea basing concept responds to central concern of transformation advocates 3 for more on the navys role in the gwot see crs report rs22373 navy role in global war

and issues for congress by ronald orourke 5 for more on naval unmanned vehicle programs see crs report rs21294 unmanned vehicles for us naval forces background and issues for congress by ronald orourke crs4 that fixed overseas land bases in the future will become increasingly vulnerable to enemy antiaccessareadenial weapons such as cruise missiles and theaterrange ballistic missiles although the sea basing concept originated with the navy and marine corps the concept can be applied to joint operations involving the army and air force to implement the sea basing concept the navy wants to field 14ship squadron called the maritime prepositioning force future or mpff squadron that would include three newconstruction largedeck amphibious ships nine newconstruction sealifttype ships and two existing sealifttype ships additional connector ships would be used to move equipment to the mpff ships and from the mpff ships to the operational area ashore some analysts have questioned the potential affordability and cost effectiveness of the sea basing concept6 new kinds of naval formations the navy in the past relied on carrier battle groups cvbgs now called carrier strike groups or csgs and amphibious ready groups args as its standard ship formations in recent years the navy has begun to use new kinds of naval formations such as expeditionary strike groups or esgs ie amphibious ships combined with surface combatants attack submarines and landbased p3 maritime patrol aircraft surface strike groups ssgs and modified trident ssgn submarines carrying cruise missiles and special operations forces7 for forward presence crisis response and warfighting operations key navy objective in moving to these new formation is to significantly increase the number of independently deployable strikecapable naval formations esgs for example are considered to be formations of this kind while args generally were not the navy in 2006 also proposed establishing what it calls global fleet stations or gfss the navy says that gfs is persistent sea base of operations from which to coordinate and employ adaptive force packages within regional area of interest focusing primarily on phase 0 shaping operations theater security cooperation global maritime awareness and tasks associated specifically with the war on terror gfs offers means to increase regional maritime security through the cooperative efforts of joint interagency and multinational partners as well as nongovernmental organizations like all sea bases the composition of gfs depends on combatant commander requirements the operating environment and the mission from its sea base each gfs would serve as selfcontained headquarters for regional operations with the capacity to repair and service all ships small craft and aircraft assigned additionally the gfs might provide classroom space limited medical facilities an information fusion center and some combat service support capability the gfs concept provides leveraged highyield sea based option that achieves persistent presence in support of national objectives additionally it complements more traditional csgesg training and deployment cycles8 6

operations concept 2006 washington 2006 pp 3031 crs5 new shipdeployment approaches the navy is implementing or experimenting with new shipdeployment approaches that are intended to improve the navys ability to respond to emergencies and increase the amount of time that ships spend on station in forward deployment areas key efforts in this area include the fleet response plan frp for emergency surge deployments and the sea swap concept for longduration forward deployments with crew rotation the frp navy officials say permits the navy to deploy up to 6 of its 11 planned csgs within 30 days and an additional csg within another 60 days after that which is called 61 navy officials believe sea swap can reduce the stationkeeping multiplier the number of ships of given kind needed to maintain one ship of that kind on continuously station in an overseas operating area by 20 or more9 reduced personnel requirements the navy is implementing variety of steps to substantially reduce the number of uniformed navy personnel required to carry out functions both at sea and ashore don officials state that these actions are aimed at moving the navy away from an outdated conscript mentality under which navy personnel were treated as free good and toward more uptodate approach under which the high and rising costs of personnel are fully recognized under the dods proposed fy2008 budget and fy2008fy2013 future years defense plan fydp active navy end strength which was 365900 in fy2005 is to decline to less than 325000 by fy2010 reductions in personnel requirements ashore are to be accomplished through organizational streamlining and reforms and the transfer of jobs from uniformed personnel to civilian don employees reductions in personnel requirements at sea are to be accomplished by introducing newdesign ships that can be operated with substantially smaller crews shift that could lead to significant changes in navy practices for recruiting training and otherwise managing its personnel current ship acquisition programs related to this goal include the lcs the ddg1000 and the ford cvn78 class aircraft carrier also known as the cvn21 class10 improved business practices don is pursuing variety of initiatives to improve its processes and business practices so as to generate savings that can be used to help finance navy transformation these efforts are referred to collectively as sea enterprise don transformation centers exercises and experiments many don transformation activities efforts take place at the navy warfare development command nwdc which is located at the naval war college at newport ri and the marine corps warfighting laboratory mcwl which is located at the marine corps base at quantico va11 these two organizations generate ideas for naval transformation and act as clearinghouses and evaluators of transformation ideas generated in other parts of don nwdc and mcwl oversee major exercises known as fleet battle experiments fbes 9 for

httpwwwnwdcnavymil and httpwwwmcwlusmcmil respectively crs6 and advanced warfighting experiments awes that are intended to explore new naval concepts of operation the navy and marine corps also participate with the army and air force in joint exercises aimed at testing transformation ideas issues for congress potential oversight questions for congress include the following are current don transformation efforts inadequate excessive or about right are don transformation efforts adequately coordinated with those of the army and air force is don striking the proper balance between transformation initiatives for participating in the global war on terrorism gwot and those for preparing for potential challenge from improved chinese maritime military forces12 is don achieving proper balance between transformation and maintaining nearterm readiness and nearterm equipment procurement how might naval transformation affect navy forcestructure requirements13 will the need to fund army and marine corps reset costs in coming years reduce funding available for navy transformation14 12 for discussions of these two issues see crs report rs22373 navy role in global war on
