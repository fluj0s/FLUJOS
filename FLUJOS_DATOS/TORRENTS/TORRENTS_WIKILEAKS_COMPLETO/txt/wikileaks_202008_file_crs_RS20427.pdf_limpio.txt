c onduct bible studies discussion sessions and prayer meetings for members and staff and often officiate at the weddings and funerals of members they also coordinate the gue st chaplains who are frequently invited by members to deliver the daily invocation the custom of opening legislative sessions with prayer began in the continental congress which elected jacob duche rector of christ episcopal c hurch in philadelphia to serve as its chaplain from 1774 to 1776 ex cept for brief period described below both chambers have elected chaplain since the first congress in 1789 the house chose william lynn presbyterian minister from philadelphia as its first chaplain and the senate picked samuel provoost episcopa l bishop from new york each received salary of 500 until the midnineteenth cen tury the chaplains were not considered officers of congress they were elected for single session instead of an entire congress and worked alternately in each house changing weekly when congress moved to washington in 1800 churches were so few that the chaplains even took turns conducting sunday rvices in the house chamber now part of statuary hall visiting clergy also participated in these services which were open to the public during the early years of congress the chaplains duties centered primarily on the preparation and delivery of convening prayers and they served as pastors of churches in the washington area in addition to their congressional duties as their duties to congress increased the chaplains resigned their pastorates after their election to devote more time to the position of chaplain an office and staff were also provided the period without chaplains lasted from 1857 to 1859 when questions were raised by citizens who objected to the employment of chaplains in congress and the military as breach of the separation of church and st ate some critics also alleged that the appointments of chaplains had become t oo politicized accordingly local clergy voluntarily served as chaplains however the difficulty in obtaining volunteer chaplains resulted in the return to the practice of selecting official house and senate chaplains in late 1994 prior to the convening of the 104th congress some thought was given to having volunteers of rotating denominations fill the post of house chaplain however the republican leadership decided to maintain the system of fulltime paid chaplainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20427crs3 the constitutionality of the chaplains pr ayers was upheld in 1983 by the supreme court marsh v chambers 463 us 783 on the grounds of precedent and tradition the court cited the practice going back to the c ontinental congress in 1774 and noted that the custom is deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country from colonial times and the founding of the repub lic further the court held that the use of prayer has become part of the fabric of our soci ety coexisting with the principles of disestablishment and religious freedom subsequently on march 25 2004 the us district court for the district of columbia citing marsh v chambers dismissed suit that challenged the congressional practice of paid chaplains as well as the practice of opening legislative sessions with prayer
