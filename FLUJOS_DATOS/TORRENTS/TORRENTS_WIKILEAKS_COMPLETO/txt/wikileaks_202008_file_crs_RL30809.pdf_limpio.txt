the development of our nations rivers needed to be balanced by protecting certain rivers that possessed outstanding undeveloped qualities this sentiment culminated in the enac tment of the wild and scenic rivers act of 1968 rivers may be designated for protection under the act by congress or nominated for inclusion by governor and approved by the secretary of the interior the act addresses the protection of the water flows of designated rivers both expressly and by imp lication this report examines the purposes language and legislative history of the act in order to analyze its effects on federal and state water rights it also reviews specific water rights provisions within certain river designations the act states that the united states policy is to preserve certain rivers possessing outstanding values in freeflowing condition and its purpose is to implement that policy the act contains several paragraphs on water rights stating that the jurisdiction of the states and united states over waters shall be determined by established principles of law that any taking of water rights shall entitle the owner to just compensation that the jurisdiction of the states over waters is unaffected by the act to the extent that such jurisdiction may be exercised without impairing the purposes of the act or its administration and that the act sha ll not be construed to alter interstate compacts the act also implies the availability of federal water rights necessary to accomplish the purposes of the act designation of any stream or portion thereof as national wild scenic or recreational river area shall not be construed as reservation of the waters of such streams for purposes other than those specified in this chapter or in quantities greater than necessary to accomplish these purposes this report discusses federal authority over water and federal reserved and nonreserved water rights based on the language of the act and its legislative history it appears that the act creates federal water rights the act does not specify the quantity of the right the amount of the federal right is likely to vary from river to river depe nding on the rivers flows the unappropriated flows in the river at the time of designation and the values for which the river is being protected in practice federal reserved water rights have not always been claimed if alternative means eg water rights acquired under state law are adequate necessary water flows sometimes have been secured under state law through cooperative agreements and by purchases from willing sellers

grew for the idea that the natural tendency toward development of our nations rivers needed to be balanced by protection of certain rivers possessing outstanding undeveloped qualities this sentiment culminated in the enactment of the wild and scenic rivers act of 1968 wsra1 rivers may be designated by congress or in some instances be nominated by governor and approved by the secretary of the interior designation provides certain protections from development and from the adverse effects of water resources projects the act declares it to be the policy of the united states that certain rivers that possess outstandingly remarkable scenic recreational geologic fish and wildlife historic cultural or other similar values shall be preserved in freeflowing condition 2 the act further provides that the established national policy of dam and other construction be complemented by policy that would preserve other selected rivers in their freeflowing condition to protect the water quality of such rivers and to fulfill other vital national conservation purposes 3 the act establishes three categories of rivers wild scenic and recreational river will be classified as one of these categories depending on its characteristics and values at the time of designation and the desired level of protection rivers in the wild and scenic river system are managed by various federal agencies 4 the act defines river as flowing body of water or estuary or section portion or tributary thereof including rivers streams creeks runs kills rills and small lakes5 river is freeflowing if it exists or flows in natural condition without impoundment diversion straightening riprappi ng or other modification of the waterway6 the act provides protection for designated river by limiting the licensing of dams reservoirs and other water project works on or adversely affecting protected segments river may be included in the wild and scenic river system even if minor structures such as low dams or diversion works already exist along the section of the river proposed for inclusion 7 to protect the flow of the river several provisions of the act allow for the assumption or creation of federal water rights sufficient to carry out the purposes of the act the act allows the united states to assert taking of water right at the time the river is designated and entitles the previous owner of the water right to just compensation8 it also provides that the reservation of water right is limited to the purposes specified by the act and is limited to the quantity necessary to accomplish those purposes9 the act does not affect the jurisdiction of the states to manage water of included streams if state jurisdiction would not impair the purposes of the act nor does it affect interstate compacts that might govern waterways included in the wild and scenic river system10 1 pl 90542 82 stat 906 codified at 16 usc 1271 et seq 2 16 usc 1271 3 id 4 the national park service the bureau of

them the commerce power including the navigation power the spending power the war power the treaty power and the property power11 furthermore under the supremacy clause art vi cl 2 of the constitution when the federal government exercises legitimate authority the federal law may preempt state law12 however the point at which federal law preempts state law is not always clear the supreme court has recognized the federal power to regulate water under various constitutional powers and resultant statutes for example pursuant to the commerce clause art i 8 cl2 congress may regulate water and water use and pursuant to the authority to regulate navigation may even abrogate state sanctioned water rights without paying compensation 13 also the authority for congress to tax and spend for the general welfare has been said to provide the federal government powers in connection with water and water projects beyond those under the commerce clause14 considering that the act also provides for the acquisition of lands by the federal government in the river corridor another source of constitutional authority for the wild and scenic rivers act is the property clause art iv 3 cl 2 which authorizes congress to make needful rules and regulations regarding federal property

of regulation of water use15 and court is likely to be cautious in concluding that federal water right is created the power of the federal government to do so cannot be denied the critical factor is whether congress intended that such rights be created as indicated either by express language or by implication from congressional purpose reservation or directive for which water is necessary court will derive evidence of that intent from the language of the statute in question its purposes and on points as to which there is any ambiguity its legislative history 11 see 4 w aters and water rights

freeflowing condition to protect the water quality of such rivers and to fulfill other vital national conservation purposes16 because the act includes language that limits it from being construed to reserve water for purposes other than those named or in greater quantities than necessary it seems likely that congress intended to create federal right to some or all of the instream flows of designated rivers or river segments in order to carry out the purposes of the act17 the words reserve and reservation also appear in the few supreme court cases relating to federal water rights although the nature and extent of federal power over water generates perpetual debate the supreme court has held that the federal government may at the least reserve unappropriated water water not subject to right vested under state law for federal purposes from federal public domain lands18 this reservation may be express but typically is inferred from the congressional purposes in reserving lands for some purpose the federal right vests and has priority date as of the date of the reservation whether or not the water is put to immediate use19 hence the federal right is junior to rights existing on the date of the establishment of the federal right but senior to all rights vesting after that date after court determines that water right has been created by reservation the amount of the water right necessary to carry out the acts purposes must be determined the quantity of wsra federal water right appears to be the amount necessary to achieve the purposes of the act in the case of the wsra it appears to be that amount necessary to preserve the freeflowing condition of the river and to preserve the values for which the river was protected 20 it is therefore arguable what quantity is sufficient in each instance and the protected amount may not be the full flow the river the definition of freeflowing would seem to suggest that the full unappropriated flow as of the time of designation ie subject to those existing uses and diversions that do not impair the purposes for which the river is being protected is protected on the other hand by referring to necessary water 1284c may indicate that the amount of the federal right may be less than the full amount of water available in river that is subject to heavy spring flows for example the argument might be made that some peak water flows could be impounded or diverted upstream as long as sufficient flow was released to the protected segment to maintain the values for which it was protected to summarize the wsra appears on its face to protect designated rivers in freeflowing state by reservation of the waters of such streams necessary to carry out the purposes of the act to 16 16 usc 1271 17 this conclusion is reinforced by the express though nega tively stated reference to the creation of water rights in 16 usc 1284c designation of any stream or portion thereof as national wild scenic or recreational river area shall not be construed as reservation of the waters of such streams for purposes other than those specified in this chapter or in quantities greater than necessary to accomplish these purposes 18 cappaert v united states 426 us 128 1976 united states v new mexico 438 us 696 1973 arizona v california 373 us 546 1963 winters v united states 207 us 564 1908 19 see arizona 373 us at

nonetheless review the legislative history of the act for confirmation clarification or contradiction of that apparent intent the legislative history might also be examined for possible clarification of particular points such as the quantity of the federal right different courts however give different weight to legislative history the legislative history including comments made during consideration of the bill indicate many of the same conclusions reached by reading the current statutory language that is during the debate congress recognized comments provided by the department of the interior specifically stating that the bill would not affect existing water rights under state law and that subsequent appropriations under state law would be permissible so long as they did not adversely affect the designated rivers 21 these comments also reinforced the understanding of the quantity of the reserved right which would allow only enough water to meet the purpose for which the river was designated22 debate over proposals of this legislation incl uded an emphasis on whether the bill would affect current water rights according to comments in the legislative history the committee took great care to work out language that would make it clear that present water law is not altered by the provisions of this bill 23 in the relevant comments the legislative history indicates that only unappropriated waters could be reserved for the purposes of the act24 it also noted that the reservation is subject to prior water rights vested under state law and therefore the appropriate secretary cannot insist upon any greater flow in the river than the amount of unappropriated water 25 finally the legislative history indicated that the federal right would be superior only to subsequent appropriations under state law26

freeflowing rivers failed to provide for the reservation of water in the rivers such result would run contrary to the language of section 13c and the congressional declaration of policy27 this case was decided in the context of congressionally designated river rather than state nominated river because rivers that enter the national system through the state application process must be managed by the state in question protection of their freeflowing nature and values is accomplished under state law section 13 refers to designation of any stream or portion thereof in connection with the reservation of necessary water and the argument can be made that federal water right is available to protect statenominated rivers as well as those congress designates however we know of instances in which federal water right has been invoked to protect statenominated river 28 in addition the individual legislation designating wild and scenic river may address particular water flows and facility situations although federal reserved water rights appear to be available under wsra they have not always been claimed29 agency materials30 indicate that in instances where another underlying federal right eg national forest reserves exists and appears adequate to provide sufficient water wsra federal right might not be asserted31 similarly if right to adequate instream flows is available under state law the united states has applied for necessary water by that route adequate flows may also be obtained under specific state statute through cooperative agreements by filing defensive protests objecting to possibly harmful water right applications by others or through purchase of necessary water from willing sellers the united states has never condemned water rights for wsra purposes 32

however the lack of specificity in water rights protection under the act and an unclear priority date for the rivers have led some to include water rights protections within subsequent legislation

in the arid west the vast majority of wild and scenic river legislation does not address water rights the few designations that do reference water rights and their different forms are discussed here

under wild and scenic designations upstream landowners and development interests including state and local governments may be concerned about whether new downstream wild and scenic segments may limit their water use and future water diversions conversely downstream landowners and others may fear that upstream designations will limit their future water development options several factors may be considered when evaluating the water rights for proposed river one consideration is the type of designation of the riverwild scenic or recreational the amount of water needed to protect the values of each section may vary depending upon the type of designation and its placement in the watershed for example water usage related to protected waterway presumably would be most restricted if the river were designated as wild development or water usage near wild rivers cannot change the essential characteristics of primitive watersheds and shorelines and unpolluted waters 16 usc 1273b1 recreational river would have the fewest restrictions of the three types as that designation applies to rivers that already have some access by roads some development along their shorelines and some impoundment or diversion of waters in the past 16 usc 1273b3 however future restrictions on development including on water resource projects apply even to recreational rivers another key factor is the type of land through which the river flows national parks national forests and wilderness areas have established water rights for waters within their boundaries to protect their resources 33 in each of these areas the rivers themselves are an important resource34 the implied water rights conferred by the wild and scenic rivers act for specific river designated inside one of these land areas would be an overlay to those existing rights that is second layer of rights reserving water to the extent needed to accomplish the purpose of the designation in many areas protection of wild and scenic values may be accomplished with the original reserved water right however the implied priority date created with the designation of 33 see eg winters v united states 207 us 564 28 s ct 207 52 l ed 340 1908 when the

land may create conflict when river designation includes specific priority date arguably the more specific priority date could supersede the more general implied priority date effectively eliminating the more senior priority right the river once enjoyed this conflict has not been tested in the courts

goal may be to quantify the extent of the new water right under state law another goal may be to establish priority date for any new water rights created by the designation for example the enacting legislation for the clarks fork wild and scenic river in wyoming which is designated as wild river has this language about water rights the secretary of agriculture is directed to apply for the quantification of the water right reserved by the inclusion of portion of the clarks fork in the wild and scenic rivers system in accordance with the procedural requirem ents of the laws of the state of wyoming provided that notwithstanding any provision of the laws of the state of wyoming otherwise applicable to the granting and exercise of water rights the purposes for which the clarks fork is designated as set forth in this chapter and this paragraph are declared to be beneficial uses and the priority date of such right shall be november 28 1990 16 usc 1274a116 this provision has the benefit of clearly establishing priority right as well as the date and quantity of that priority the clarks fork river is in national forest it is not clear whether this water rights designation provides second albeit junior water right or whether it has the effect of thwarting the existing water rights that exist due to the land designation giving the water rights created by the designation lower priority than if the statute had been silent water rights provision might also establish that the river designation does not interfere with established water rights an example of this type of water rights language is found in the statute protecting the cache poudre river in colorado 16 usc 1274a57 this wild river is in both national park and national forest its water rights language is as follows inclusion of the designated portions of the cache poudre river shall not interfere with the exercise of existing decreed water rights to water which has heretofore been stored or diverted as of the date of enactment of this title the reservation of water established by the inclusion of portions of the cache poudre river in the wild and scenic rivers system shall be subject to the provisions of this title shall be adjudicated in colorado water court and shall have priority date as of the date of enactment of this title pl 99590 102 100 stat 3331 this water right provision recognizes existing water rights for stored and diverted water it also establishes priority date as of the date of the act for each river segment within the designation additionally it establishes jurisdiction for any disputes over water however the section preserving existing water rights refers only to those waters stored or diverted as noted above it could be argued that this provision undercuts the existing priority of water rights created by designation of the cache poudre segments in rocky mountain national park and roosevelt national forest and gives those segments more junior priority as of the date of the act 35 it could 35 in one case federal court held that the department of the interior had broken the law by surrendering its priority continued

claimed the language creates an overlay the legislative history of the clause could be read as indicating that the house of representatives believed they were providing priority right for the first time for the river36 in any event when priority is specifically created within designation any existing priorities should also be addressed to avoid ambiguity as to their status only one example was found where the existing priority rights of the designated water body were acknowledged that language is found in the pro posed legislation to change black canyon of the gunnison national monument into national park and make the gunnison river wild and scenic river it states water rights or the reservation of water which would expand on the existing reserved water right for the black canyon of the gunnison national monument shall be created by this designation hr 1321 102 nd37 this language appeared to address the gunnison rivers water rights adequately and likely would have assuaged concerns from upstream and downstream owners that their water usage not be changed or limited by the designation even if not expressly stated other water rights provisions would focus on protecting existing rights rather than establishing priority date for example the proposed legislation for northern rockies ecosystem protection included this language nothing in this act may be construed as relinquishment or reduction of any water rights reserved appropriated or otherwise secured by the united states in the state of idaho montana wyoming oregon or washington on or before the date of enactment of this act hr 488 107 th this language would appear to protect any water rights that existed at the time of the designation including any water rights that the designated rivers may have different version of water rights language clarif ies that rivers designation as recreational will not interfere with adjacent landowners water supply38 the missouri river segments protected under the act have this language regarding water rights in administering such river the secretary shall permit access for such pumping and associated pipelines as may be necessary to assure an adequate supply of water for owners of land adjacent to such segment and for fish wi ldlife and recreational uses outside the river corridor established pursuant to this paragraph 16 usc 1274a22 continued right see high country citizens alliance v nort on 448 f supp 2d 1235 d colo 2006 36 see hrep 99503 march 20 1986 the language also recognized that inclusion of segments of the cache poudre river in the wild

of passage of this section 37 while this bill did not pass the black canyon of the gunnison became national park in 1999 the gunnison river was not designated as wild and scenic river as part of that

g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g561 to summarize the wild and scenic rivers act appears to create federal water rights to flows of protected river segments necessary to carry out the purposes of the act the text and legislative history seem to support this interpretation the right appears to be limited to water not otherwise obligated under state law but with the additional power in the federal government to condemn rights vested under state law if necessary to accomplish the federal purposes to date this condemnation power has not been used the quantity of the water right is the amount sufficient to carry out the purposes of the act and more probably the quantity of particular protected river or segment would depend on the existing flows the values for which the river was being protected and its classifications it also is not totally clear as of what date the federal right takes priority where that analysis is relevant especially in those instances where the designating language includes specific water rights provision ordinarily the relevant date would appear to be the effective date of the reservation or designation however some protecti ons of the act begin when river is designated for study and it might be argued that this is the proper priority date with respect to river that later is successfully included in the system in practice in addition to claiming federal reserved rights for some protected rivers the federal agencies managing wild and scenic rivers have sought to safeguard the necessary river flows under state law through cooperative agreements and through purchases from willing sellers several bills that propose to designate rivers for inclusion in the wild and scenic rivers system have been introduced in the 111 th congress hr 167 would modify the boundary of the rio grande wild and scenic river s 40 would design ate fossil creek tributary of the verde river as part of the wild and scenic rivers system signations also are
