and ideology as factors influencing assignments to committees senate traditions further dictate that in most instances party ratios in committees reflect the overall party ratio in the chamber the comprehensive and complex system of limitations began to evolve at least 100 years ago by the second half of the 19th century for example it was already an accepted although informal practice that senator should chair more than one legislative committee the legislative reorganization act of 1970 incorporated slightly more restrictive version of that practice into the standing rules previously chairs of standing legislative committees sometimes also chaired joint select or special committees the 1970 rule prohibited senators from chairing more than one committee of any kind with two exceptions 1 standing committee chair may also chair joint committee the jurisdiction of which is directly related to that of the standing committee and 2 chairman may also chair one temporary committee or temporary joint committee not including conference committees the prohibition in force todayadopted on february 4 1977 when the senate agreed to sres 4 of the 95th congresscontinues the first exception but reflects small change to the second see section iii of this report early in the 20th century both parties in the senate adopted informal practices intended to distribute committee assignments especially to prestigious committees more equitably dissatisfaction with the results led to the adoption of formal more elaborate limitations in the legislative reorganization act of 1946 the new rule limited each senator to membership on two socalled major standing committees however majority party senatorsand later all senatorswere permitted additional assignments on socalled minor standing committees in addition senators could serve on any number of special select and joint committeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98912crs2 2us congress senate temporary select committee to study the senate committee system first report with recommendations senate report 941395 94th congress 2nd session 1976 p 6the legislative reorganization act of 1970 introduced more comprehensive yet complex and restrictive system all committees were subjected to the limitations code and divided amon g three classes senators were required to serve on two committees in the first class and permitted to serve on one in each of the other classes to assure majorityparty control of all committees in closely divided senate senators could receive temporary assignments to fifth committee exceptions in the form of grandfather rights were granted to protect the assignments of senators sitting on more than the prescribed number of committees before the effective date of the act january 3 1971 over the years the senate granted extensions of grandfather rights permitted some senators to serve on additional committees without losing other assignments and exempted certain committees from the limitations rules these actions permitted some senators larger number of committee assignments than they otherwise might have held under the legislative reorganization acts limitations during its comprehensive review of committee operations the 1976 temporary select committee to study the senate committee system chaired by adlai stevenson iii dill found that the average numb er of committee and subcommittee assignments per senator had more than tripled in 30 years for example in 1947 each senator served on approximately five panels in 1976 that number had increased to 19 the select committee concluded that this proliferation of assignments was responsible for an inefficient division of labor uneven distribution of responsibility conflicts in the schedul ing of meetings waste of senators and staff time unsystematic lawmaking and oversight inadequate anticipation of major problems and inadequate membership participation in committee decisions 2 it was in this atmosphere that the senate agreed to sres 4 95th congress which incorporated the new assignment limits into the senate rules the 1977 revision of the rules continued the threeclass committee structure of 1970 changed the composition of the classes somewhat and eliminated the overall limitatio n on assignments in the third class the rules revision also retained the mechanism for temporary additional assignments to assure majority party control of commi ttees although sres 4 retained the concept of grandfather rights most expired at the start of the 96th congress however the provisions allowing the former chairs and rankin g minority members on two abolished committees the district of columbia committee and the post office and civil service committee to serve on the committee on governmental affairs in addition to other assignments had expiration date in addition new temporary grandfather rights were created at the beginning of the 96th congress and at the beginning of every congress since sres 4 the committee system reorganization amendm ents of 1977 also removed the limitations on assignments to prestigious or exclusive committees these limitations had started as informal party practice and were converted into formal rules by the legislative reorganization act of 1970 both parties nevertheless continuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98912crs3 to enforc limitations on assignments to exclusive committees although they differ somewhat on the committees they regard as exclusive as explained in section i restrictions on the senates subcommittee structure were first adopted in the 1970 act and dealt only with subcommittee chairmanships with the proviso that senators might continue to occupy all such chairmanships held as of january 3 1971 and continuously thereafter senator was to serve as chair of more than one subcommittee of any of his or her class committees see section i sres 4 of 1977 eliminated the grandfather rights of 1970 and extended the prohibition on subcommittee chairs to all committees it also inaugurated limitations on subcommittee assignments in most cases allowing members to serve on three subcommittees of each class committee and two subcommittees of each class b committee the transfer of majorityparty status to the republicans as result of the 1980 elections changes recommended by the 1984 select committee on committees the return of the democrats to majorityparty status in 1986 and the transfer of majority party status to the republicans as result of the 1994 elections necessitated further temporary modificati ons to the assignment provisions and the adoption of new grandfather rights the balance of this report describes the current limitation provisions i full committee assignments paragra phs 2 3 and 4 of senate rule xxv in effect create three groups of committees for assignment limitation purposes for easier identification these groups are referred to below as classes b and c even though they are not so labeled in the rule subject to
