conservative national action party pan won the july 2006 presidential elections in an extremely tight race defeating andrés lópez obrador of the centerleft democratic revolution party prd by less than 1 of the vote he succeeded vicente fox also from the pan who in 2000 became the first opposition presidential candidate to defeat the long ruling centerleft institutional revolutionary party pri calderón was sworn to sixyear term on december 1 2006 in an unusually brief inauguration ceremony due to fears that members of the prd congressional delegation would interrupt the ceremony while the pan made significant gains in congressional elections and became the largest block in the 128member senate and 500member chamber of deputies it failed to win majority in either house the prd also made significant gains and has the secondlargest block of members in the chamber of deputies and third in the senate for the first time in history the longruling pri lost its plurality of seats in congress although it still remains significant political force in the legislative branch with the secondlargest block in the senate and the thirdlargest in chamber of deputies because the pan does not have majority in congress president calderón has often turned to the pri to advance his legislative agenda although that might prove more difficult in the lead up to midterm congressional elections in july 2009 since calderóns election the pri has fared well in state and municipal elections around th country some observers view the next congressional elections as contest between the pan and the pri to secure the largest number of seats in the chamber of deputies since the 2006 elections the prd has suffered from deep internal divisions that code erode its chances for support in the 2009

pension reforms that had stalled under the previous fox administration in june 2008 president calderón signed judicial reform decree after securing the approval of congress and mexicos states for an

companies were involved in the derivatives market and have taken big hits with the mexican stock market declining over 30 as of midnovember 2008 the rapid decline in the price of oil is also major economic setback for mexico which depends on oil proceeds for over one third of government revenue the decline in us demand for imports from mexico resulting from the us economic slowdown will have an impact on the mexican economy because of its dependence on the united states as an export market as noted above economic growth already is slowing and remittances from mexicans living in the united states have declined unemployment is likely to increase which could increase pressure for mexicans to migrate an economic slowdown in mexico also might strain the governments progress in reducing poverty the calderón government has taken number of measures to attempt to cushion the mexican economy from the fallout of the global economic crisis and the onset of recession in the united states the value of the mexican peso has declined by about onefifth since august 2008 although more recently has seen some improvement the government has used billions in its international reserves to shore up the peso and the mexican central bank established temporary reciprocal currency sway line with the us federal reserve for up to 30 billion in late october 2008 the imf announced that it would be creating shortterm lending facility for emerging markets like mexico that have strong economic policy track record the government has also announced that it has hedged its oil exports for 2009 at

often discussed as potential tool to combat poverty mexico is the third leading recipient of remittances after india and china accounting for just over 11 of global remittance flows in 200717 its nationals received 23 billion in 2006 and just under 24 billion in 2007 while mexico receives the largest amount of remittances in latin america it is comparatively small share of mexican national income accounting for about 3 of mexicos gdp in 200718 as noted above the rate of remittance growth slowed to just 1 in 2007 far less than average annual increase of 19 from 2003 through 2006 and is expected to decline 1 in 2008 the pattern of remittance flows to mexico suggests potential limitations to the use of remittances to reduce poverty and inequality mexican states receiving the most remittances are those with traditionally high rates of migration which do not represent the poorest states in mexico in 2006 roughly 55 of remittances sent to mexico went to 7 of mexicos 32 states these states are michoacán guanajuato jalisco mexico the federal district veracruz and puebla the impoverished states of oaxaca guerrero and chiapas received less than 14 of remittances sent to mexico in the first half of 2007 the effect of remittances on poverty in mexico remains unclear though there is evidence to suggest that remittances improve household income it is estimated that 8090 of remittances in mexico are used to cover consumer needs including food and utilities another 10 is spent on investment most likely housing home town as sociations htas from the state of zacatecas pioneered efforts to increase the development impact of remittances beginning in 1993 the state of zacatecas and the mexican federal government agreed to allocate one dollar for every dollar zacatecan

fox extended the program nationwide in 2002 through 2005 htas municipal state and federal governments spent 230 million on 5000 local development projects in partnership with htas 19 while this is

report issued in early march 2008 the mexican government generally respected human rights during 2007 but many problems remained it recognized the mexican governments efforts to reform and professionalize the police force although it highlighted that corruption and impunity particularly at the state and local levels remain endemic problems the conduct of state law enforcement officials in response to protests in oaxaca and michoacán was of particular concern in 2006 but these situations stabilized in 2007 however progress was made during 2007 concerning the allegations of state abuses and killings during these 2006 protests additionally during 2007 there were reports of the police sometimes torturing suspects to force confessions which were sometimes used in prosecution despite constitutional prohibition while the government took action against some improper behavior by law enforcement personnel including firing some 250 federal police commanders and 34 regional police coordinators many officers committed crimes with impunity and without fear of prosecution violence among drug cartels was of particular concern during 2007 according to the state departments

reports that some individual local state and federal police immigration and customs officials were involved in facilitating drug trafficking according to the human rights report despite various judicial refo rms lengthy pretrial detentions lack of due process and judicial inefficiency and corruption persisted human rights conditions in oaxaca were of concern in 2006 due to significant political unrest from may to december 2006 the unrest was initially due to the violent repression of peaceful teachers union strike but expanded to include other parties and broader political interests central goal of the protesters was the remova l of oaxacan governor ulises ruiz of the institutional revolutionary party pri the protests led by the popular assembly of the people of oaxaca

protestors the commission also determined that federal police were responsible for the killing of at least one protestor56 former president fox pledged to investigate and prosecute those responsible for human rights violations including the dirty war period from the 1960s to 1980s human rights activists are critical of what they view as lukewarm efforts by his administration to improve human rights in mexico and to address past violations the na tional commission on huma n rights presented report to president fox on november 27 2001 that documented human rights abuses and disappearances of persons in the 1970s and early 1980s and president fox named legal scholar ignacio carrillo as special prosecutor to investigate these and other cases on january 4 2002 in april 2006 the fox administration announced that the special prosecutors office would be disbanded in november 2006 ignacio carrillo presented his final report on the repressive era from the late 1960s to 1982 the report found that the repression was matter of state policy and led to the summary execution of over 700 mexicans torture and the razing of villages the report was praised by some as an acknowledgment of state responsibility for the repression that can be used to prosecute those responsible for human rights violations others remain critical as one has been convicted of charges relating to these alleged crimes only one of the three presidents from this period luis echeverria 19701976 is still alive president echeverria faced genocide charges for his role in the repression of 1968 student protest that left dozens dead when he was interior minister echeverria tried to evade prosecution by claiming the 30year statute of limitations had expired judge rejected this argument and reinstated the arrest order in november 2006 after he determined that the statute of limitations did not go into effect until echeverria left public office in december 1976 in july 2007 the criminal tribunal absolved echeverria of any responsibility for the 1968 killings the unsolved murders of over 400 women killed and disappeared in ciudad juárez and other parts of the northern state of chihuahua since 1993 remain concern to human rights activists who maintain that the lack of prosecutions and inadequate investigations demonstrate the level of impunity in mexico and lack of official accountability to mexican citizens in february 2006 the fox administration closed the special prosecutors office charged with coordinating federal and state investigations into the murders and folded it into an office responsible for crimes against women throughout mexico the mexican government also announced in february 2006 that it found evidence of serial killings in ciudad juárez nineteen women were

enact similar legislation the letter also suggests that mexico reform its penal codes to increase penalties for violence against women the members also expressed concern that mexicos 14year statute of
