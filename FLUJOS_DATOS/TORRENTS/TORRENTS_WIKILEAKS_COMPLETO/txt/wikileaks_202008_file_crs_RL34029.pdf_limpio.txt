and concessions in their favour5 haiti has many prior ities for development that ar deeply interconnected to address the persistent poverty crisis in the country th haitian government and the

pursuing mediumterm development plan s that will improve living conditions for haitis vast poor population and cons truct government institutions capable of providing services and stability the haitian government is working with international donors to develop longt erm poverty reduction plan since 2000 in response to unresolved electi ons disputes and questions of transparency us and other foreign donors have directed assistance through nongovernmental organizations the interim government 20042006 fo cused on macroeconomic performance the préval administration has continue d efforts begun by that government maintaining fiscal discipline and implementing structural economic reforms now that an elected government is in pl ace donors are looking at how to ensure transparency as they provide funds direc tly to the government again in addition since president préval took office in may 2006 both the new government and international donors are shifting from shor tterm program to carry haiti through transition period to longterm prog ram to help reduce poverty in haiti shortterm strategy for addressing haitis needs haiti and its multilateral and b ilateral donors deve loped an international strategy for assistance to address haitis shortterm needs in between the collapse of the government of president jeanbertrand aristide and the time new government could be elected and installed the wo rld bank the interamerican development bank the united nations and the european commission convened the international donors conference on haiti in july 2004 working in conjunction with haitis interim government the conference adopt ed the interim cooperation framework icf which focused on development goals in four general areas political governance economic governance economic recovery and access to basic services at the conference international donors including the united states pledged 12 billion from 2004 to 2006 to help haiti rebuild its infrastructure strengthen institutions and improve basic services according to the imf about 960 million of these funds had been disbursed as of december 2006 in july 2006 international donors pledged 750 million to bridge haitis budget gap and fund economic social and democratic rec onstruction projects through september 2007 the interim cooperation framework establis hes priority needs and projects that fall under four broad categories for each of these four strategic axes the framework provides strategy priority objec tives and monitoring indicators6 the strengthen political governance and national dialogue axis addresses security police and disarmament the judicial system and human rights and the electoral process httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34029crs4 the strengthen economic governance and institutional development category promotes improved and more transparent management of public finances strengthening the capacities of public institutions and decentraliza tion in favor of regional urban and local preparation of development strategies the promote economic recovery objective aims to reverse haitis trend of economic regress by promoting macroeconomic stability providing reliable electricity revi ving the private sector and providing jobs and access to mic rofinance economic recovery programs also aim to help farmers meet their needs improve roads and transport and rehabilitate and protect the environment improve access to basic services is the fourth axis because basic services are so scarce in haiti the priorities in this category are many they range from immediate goals such as providing emergency humanitarian aid to more longterm goals health related longterm goals include increasing the availability of potable water and lavatories extending minimal health services and improving access to them improving the ability to address food security and improving solid wa ste management programs also include improving the quality of and access to education at all levels engaging disadvantaged youth supporting haitian artisans and reinforcing the media as means of promoting pluralism and democracy other priorities in clude improving slums and the governments ability to provide social safety nets and protection progress has been made toward these objectives since 2004 such as the organization of elections jobs creation nd broader access to clean water and other services the economic policies of the st rategy focused on restoring macroeconomic stability and establishing good governance practices and had success in areas such as the preparation of budgets before th commencement of fiscal year and improvements in fiscal transparency but because the emphasis was not on economic growth results were negligible accordin g to the haitian gove rnment and haitians did not experience an improvement in living conditions mediumterm strategy for addressing haitis needs building on drafts created by the in terim government 20042006 the préval administration produced an interim pove rty reduction strategy for the years 2007 2009 this plan calls for actions to be taken with macr oeconomic framework focusing on three goals maintain macroeconomic stability target actions to reduce poverty and create conditions conducive to continuous and sustainable growth driven by private initiative the strategy notes that programs already outlined need to continue and that the absence of sector in this strategy does not mean that sector is not important partially in response to criticism that too many prior ities were set forth in earlier plans the haitian government says this plan focuses on those sectors that can be effectively financed in the first year considering limitations of time and human and financial resources httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34029crs5 the interim poverty reduc tion strategy defines major priorities for 20072009 to be infrastructure energy educati on health and security the government established these priorities for intervention activities growth favorable to the productive sectors focusing on agriculture industry trade environment craft industries transportation electricity communications and tourism governance and institutional reforms addressing justice and rule of law fiscal transparency moderniz ation of the management of public affairs deconcentration and decentralization and development of social sectors emphasizing health hivaids education water sa nitation and housing with such low or negative economic growth over the last forty years haitis per capita income has droppe d by about 1 year the government does not anticipate that real economic growth alone can alleviate poverty as result the government has called for grow th policy that is propoor and for first priority to be given to investment projects that have social and human benefits longterm strategy for addressing haitis needs international donors are ssisting haiti in developing longterm poverty reduction plan to succeed the interim coope ration framework it will build on the priorities needs and programs alread laid out in the interim cooperation framework and the interim p overty reduction strategy as well as lessons learned in implementing those strategies an important part of this strategy as it was with the others is developing the final plan through participator process with the overarching goal of ensuring that the interests of haitis most disadvantaged population are taken into account par ticipatory process is also intended to strengthen democratic and governance processes by building consensus among various political and civic entities and promoting haitian ownership of the development plan according to the haitian governments strategy paper the participatory process was to begin in the first quart er of 2007 final poverty reduction strategy pape r is to be submitted to the haitian parliament in july 2007 and implementation is to begin in october 2007 critiques of the poverty reduction strategy process some analysts have questioned whethe r poverty reduction strategies prs in general represent the best development st rategy for country poverty reduction strategy papers are require d to qualify for debt relief through the world banks heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative and the imfs poverty reduction and growth facilities theref ore some groups say fulf illing requirements set by the international financial institutions drives the poverty reduction strategy process and becomes another type of c onditionality rather than the poverty reduction goals of

damage done by the negative impacts of their structural adjustment policy reforms and that alterna tives or reforms to structur adjustment are generally precluded from discussion7 in review of earlier poverty reduction strategies in seven countries including haiti actionaid reported that although there was general support for locally generated poverty reduction st rategies the evidence suggested there was little in country ownership of the plans excep t among some of the bureaucracies that implement them the study found that im portant constituencies are being excluded through the consultation design or their own lack of capacity the report also concluded that the imf and the world bank continued to have si gnificant influence and control over the process and conten t of the poverty reduction strategies themselves and their subseque nt debt relief and loan pack ages this influence the report said meant that largely discredited adjustment instruments and targets have reappeared leaving the prs susceptible to the charge of new form same substance andsame impact on the working poor and excluded8 another group the bretton woods project which monitors the world bank and the imf in collaboration with nongovernment organizations and researchers says these international financ ial institutions should broaden their sources for development analysis and that ministers from indebted countries and prominent academics have recently voiced concerns bout the conflicts of interest underlying the banks role as analyst and lender9 some of these groups caution civil societ organizations about participating in the public consultations for these strategi poverty reduction strategies are not necessarily development strate gies they say because the public consultation process excludes discussions of other important ements of development policy such as trade policies domestic and fo reign investment strategies industrial policies deficit spending and other issues they suggest either broadening th scope of discussion within poverty reduction pub lic consultations or supplementing them with public forums led by civil society organizations the bush administration

greater access to equitably applied justice humanita rian assistance and institutions capable of providing these basic needs10 usaids programs are based on the objectives strategy and monitoring indicators tablished under the interim cooperation framework usaid began implementing new strategi in three areas in fy2007 because haitis poor have become even more vulnerable by the co mplex disasters arising out of instability and insecurity one program is aimed at protecting vulnerable populations this program includes effort s to 1 improve em ergency preparedness and disaster mitigation 2 protect and increase the food security of groups such as children under five years of age and preg nant and lactating women 3 work with vulnerable populations to increase family in come and decrease food insecurity and 4 promote stability by providing short term employment opportunities in violence prone areas especially for outofschoo l youth the proposed budget for this program for fy2007 was 106 million in velopment assistance da and 19 million in economic support funds esf congress has passed continuing resolutions for fy2007 and funding for fy2007 is still unclear the second new strategy involves democr acy and governance this program aims to strengthen civil society organizations so that they can reach out to groups traditionally excluded from the political process and apply pressure on the haitian government to create and implement good governance reforms judicial reform programs focus on improving the justice nistrys capacity to function providing protection and treatment for victims of organized violence preventing human trafficking and providing specialized education and other opportunities for marginalized youth in haitis most violent areas other programs aim to strengthen the parliament and help local government institutions be able to incorporate citizen input and deliver services the proposed fy2007 budget for this program is 8 million in development assistance da and 13 million in economic support funds esf the third new strategy invol ves education the four ements of this program include 1 investment in primary schools to achieve quitable access to quality basic education 2 supporting the social integration of adolescents through vocationaltechnical education 3 strengthening the capacity of the ministry of education and 4 increasing government ove rsight of education at the local level the proposed fy2007 funding for this program is 46 million in development assistance da and 6 million in economic support funds esf

would decrease from 395 million to 345 million moving forward on haitian development according to the imf mission chief for haiti the préval administration has made concerted efforts to continue the strong macroeconomic performance initiated by the interim government maintaining fiscal discipline and continuing structural economic reforms such as passing new or ganic budget law most analysts agree however that even strong macroeconomic performance will not be enough to reduce poverty in haiti the imf points out th at enormous political technical and institutional challenges must also be overcome before poverty reduction objectives can be achieved the world bank and others say that it is highly unlikely that economic growth will reduce poverty as long as haitis income inequality remains as high as it is and by 2030 the income gap is expected to grow three factors contributing to income inequality are large disparity in the capacity to generate income with the rural areas having the least capacity access to education which only half the population has and whether or not household receives remittances from abroad analysts say that policy imed at reducing income ine quality in haiti should address decentralization to provide more and be tter infrastructure and services throughout the country11 according to the world bank public spe nding on education that is targeted toward the poor can reduce poverty in both the short and longterm access to education it says can reduce poverty rela tively quickly by increasing individual productivity and helping to shift poor people from lowpaying agricultural employment to better paying jobs in the i ndustrial and service sectors in the long term the bank says education can increas poor childrens chances of breaking out of the cycle of poverty by gaining access to formal employment this means however that investment and the economy must be strong enough to create job opportunities for newly educated peoplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34029crs9 usaid defines three groups of challeng facing development efforts in haiti public sector institutions with little capacity to govern weak private sector whose growth is extremely limited by an atmosphere of insecurity and the degradation of haitis natural resources which are needed for pr oductive economic activities because haitis current capacity is so limite d and its needs are so great the imf maintains that technical assistance will be crucial in making progress according to the haitian government ther has never been systematic policy for poverty reduction nor coherent program with precisely defined objectives haitis limited capacity to develop plans and absorb f unds and donors concerns over transparency of government spending continue to pose obstacles to the execu tion of development programs both donors and the haitian government share responsibility for addressing problems with the disbursement of funds and the coordination of foreign assistance the préval administration notes in its interim poverty reduction strategy paper that the cap acities of those who have stake in the poverty reduction process are also generally inadequate for the implementation of such process and calls for assistance to strengthen those stakeholders capacities as well usaids office of transition initiatives which provides fast flexible short term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs worked in haiti from 2004 to 2006 its mission iden tified three ingredients necessary to increase security in haitis most violenceprone areas community ownership development assistance and rule of law and said that all three elements must be present it also said that programs targeted at reducing violence must address spoilers whether political or criminal who want to incite disorder to promote their own interests the millennium development goal that the haitian government agreed to in 2000 for environmental sustainability was to reverse losses by 2015 according to the imf this will be difficult to achieve as losses have continued over the last decade and environmental policies are wea k currently only 38 of total land area is forested weak political structure combined with ongoing political tensions violence massive poverty and income inequality have ma it difficult to pursue the goals of interim development and p overty reduction plans and will do so for the successor poverty reduction plan as well if not adequate ly addressedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34029crs10 12 tables and
