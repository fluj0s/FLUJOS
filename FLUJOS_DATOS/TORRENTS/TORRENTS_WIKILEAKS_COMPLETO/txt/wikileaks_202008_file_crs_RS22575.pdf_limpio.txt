compensati on and liability information system or cerclisaccording to the epa since the beginning of the brownfields program the agency has awarded 1067 assessment grants to taling 262 million 217 revolvi ng loan fund grants totaling 2017 million and 336 cleanup grants totaling 613 million the epa states that this 527 million of assistance has leveraged more than 96 billion in private investment helped create more than 43029 j obs and resulted in the assessment of more than 10504 properties and th cleanup of 180 properties4 the agency says that it has awarded more than 22 million in brownfields job training grants approximately 3000 people have completed training progra ms and more than 1800 have obtained employment in the environmental field earning an average wage of 1326 per hour5 cercla has stringent liability provisions that impose strict joint and several and retroactive liability on all past and present ow ners of contaminated or polluting facilities as well as on those who transported the haza rdous substances to facility and on those who arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at facility owned or operated by another6 concern over the possible applicability of this strict liability scheme to owners and developers of brownf ield properties was identified as deterrent to their cleanup and reuse in many cas because cercla had provisions for relaxing the liability even for the socially desirable goal of upgrading contaminated real estate the brownfields act helped in this regard by exempting from liability 1 owners of land contaminated by source on contiguous property and 2 prospective purchasers of property known to be conta minated it also explained in detail what constitutes all appropriate inquiry phrase used in the superfund act as prer equisite to land buyers innocent landowner liab ility defense7 also even before enactment of the brownfields act the epa revised its system of tracking sites8 suspected of contamination with hazardous substances to clarify when further action by the agency was planned at the site and to remove the stigma of being associated with the superfund program the act also included provisions to estab lish and enhance state and tribal response programs particularly for brownfields these programs include the traditional enforcementdriven cleanup pproaches as well as newer voluntary cleanup programs that avoid some of the costs and delays of that line of action and offer incentives for participating most states provide some sort of liability release and other incentives include streamlined process financial or tax incentives and technical assistance the brownfields act authorizes 50 million per year in grants to states and tribes to support their programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22575crs4 in addition the 2002 law expanded the definiti on of what is considered brownfield for purposes of grants so communities may now receive funding for

july 28 2006 hrept 109608 part 1 the bill would have extended the grant authority through fy2012 at the current level of 200 million annually in add ition it would have required the epa inspector

of available funding be used for sites where petroleum is the cause for site contaminati on such sites would still be eligible for f unding but would have to compete with other brownfield sites for priority and funding it also added factor for the epa to us in ranking brownfield grant applications the extent to which the grant would implement green building standards and energy efficient building standards th is would have codified the agencys currenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22575crs6 practice the bill also would have rene wed through fy2012 assistance to states and tribes at the current level of 50 million annually in addition to brownfields reaut horization and appr opriations the 109th congress enacted two laws addressing the cleanup and re development of brownfields in the first session pl 10959 hr 3 reauthorized funding for federal surface transportation programs which included pilot program to support planning activities for highway and public transportation projects including brownfields redeve lopment planning also enacted was an extension of the brownfields tax incentive which allows taxpayer to deduct cleanup costs at brownfie ld site in the same year the costs are incurred called expensing rather than deducting the costs over period of years capitalizing this tax break had expi red at the end of 2005 but the provision was made retroactive to then and was extended to december 31 2007 in the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 hr 6111 signed by the president on december 20 2006 see crs report rl34184 the section 198 brownfields tax
