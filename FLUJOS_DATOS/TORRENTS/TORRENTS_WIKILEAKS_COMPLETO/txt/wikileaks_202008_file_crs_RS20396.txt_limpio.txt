increasing demands on the department of defense katherine lemay brown national defense fellow foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the national defense authorization act for fiscal year fy 2000 pl 10665 mandates military honors at funerals for all eligible veterans the mandate will likely require the department of defense dod to divert some defense funding and military manpower to nonwarfighting task this act converts honors details from time honored tradition which the military services rendered according to their standards and resources to mandated requirement current funding pressures and tight manpower levels coupled with increasing veterans requests and expectations may make it more difficult for the services to furnish sufficient personnel for veterans funerals however the current mandate appears to fall short of the veteran service organizations expectations which may lead to continued controversy about the issue this report will not be updated background until the national defense authorization act for fy2000 is fully implemented the military services in accordance with dod directives will provide funerary tributemilitary honors within the constraints of available resources1 dod has charged the air force as the executive agent for implementation of the new law the current military regulation allows for differing levels of support for active duty members and medal of honor 1 department of defense directive 130015 military funeral support 30 september 1985 active duty reserve component personnel on active duty and medal of honor recipients receive full traditional honors consisting of pall bearers firing party bugler and chaplain retirees receive honors in range of traditional honors to single military representative to present the us flag veterans and national guardreserve component personnel receive single military representative to present the us flag congressional research service the library of congress crs2 recipients retirees and veterans2 the military services operate under servicespecific policies the honors vary from service to service and are dependent upon available resources for example the marine corps policy provides full military honors for all active duty reserve retired and former marines based upon available resources the army policy is to provide full or partial honors or service representative to meet the dod directive dod strongly encourages the services to surpass the minimums in addition there have been occasions when honors were not rendered due to lack of resources the services utilize both active and ready reserve forces3 but have not been authorized specific manpower for honors details the congressional rationale for originating the law can be found in the strom thurmond national defense authorization act for fy1999 hrept 105736 section 567 the conferees agree that men and women have unselfishly answered the call to arms at tremendous personal sacrifice these men and women who have served honorably whether in war or peace deserve commemoration for their military service at the time of their death by an appropriate tribute burial honors are an important means of reminding americans of the sacrifices endured to keep the nation free the national defense authorization act for fy19994 required the dod to provide an honor guard of not less than three individuals with the capability of playing taps for every veteran funeral request that occurred after december 31 19995 the act also directed the secretary of defense to host conference to be completed not later than december 31 1998 to determine means of improving and increasing military honors for veteran funerals and allowed for the secretary to make rebuttal to the law and to report findings and recommendations back to congress as directed dod in conjunction with the department of veteran affairs va held the conference on november 17 1998 the conferees included senior officials from dod and va as well as representatives from veteran service organizations and funeral directors associations charged with reviewing current policiespractices trends in veteran deathspotential funeral demands military resources associated costs communication concerns and alternative solutions the conference participants sought to balance this mission and military readiness 2 military

honorably served designated contract with the military all military retirees are veterans but most veterans are not retirees 3 office of the assistant secretary of defense reserve affairs rsc ddram 11471148 fy1998 the ready reserve is comprised of military members of the reserve and national guard organized in units or as individuals liable for recall to active duty to augment the active components in time of war or national emergency the ready reserve consists of three reserve component subcategories the selected reserve consists of those units and individuals designated by their respective services and approved by the chairman joint chiefs of staff as so essential to initial wartime missions as they have number one priority over all other reservists the individual ready reserve and the inactive national guard 4 pl 105261 section 567 enacted october 17 1998 5 pl 105261 did not require the three persons to be uniformed military personnel crs3 proposed department policyrecommendations following the conference dod reported to congress recommendations for active duty members retirees and veterans funerals the conferees recommended minimum honors detail of two personnel with at least one uniformed military representative of the deceaseds relevant service and second person either uniformed person or other authorized provider of funeral honors ie member of veterans service organization these two individuals would provide the ceremonial folding and presentation of the american flag to the next of kin and would play taps preferably by bugler but possibly highquality recording in addition to secure reserve personnel participation they recommended legislative changes that would give support by suggesting additional retirement points6 and pay for reserve forces participation they also recommended that reserve forces be allowed to remain on active duty in excess of 180 days during fiscal year to provide military honors and that workers compensationliability insurance should be provided for nondod authorized providers7 in addition dod vowed to enhance communications and coordination of obtaining funeral honors by establishing single 1800number and web site for information and funeral honor requests the dod also initiated the development of an information kit to be distributed nationwide to local funeral directors legislation the national defense authorization act for fy2000 mandates not less than two members of the uniformed armed forces active or reserve with at least one uniformed military representative of the deceaseds parent service to provide the ceremonial folding and presentation of the american flag and the playing of taps the act also expands the definition of veteran as defined in section 10124 of title 388 to include the selected reserve as described in section 2301f of title 389 it also provides for reservists to receive additional benefits of one point for each day on which funeral honors duty is performed for at least two hours medical care for associated injuryillness 6 points are method of determining the extent of reservists participation in the reserve component point totals determine various aspects of reserve retirement eligibility and the amount of reserve retirement pay received the authorization of additional points could serve as an incentive to secure reserve participation 7 department of defense report to congress on military funeral honors for veterans 17 november 1998 executive summary 8 as defined by title 38 usc section 1012 and 24 2 the term veteran means person who served in the active military naval or air service and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable 24 the term active military naval or air service includes active duty any period of active duty for training during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty and any period of inactive duty training during which the individual was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty 9 as defined by title 38 usc section 2301f the secretary shall furnish flag to drape the casket of each deceased member or former member of the selected reserve section 10143 of title 10 who completed at least one enlistment as member of the selected reserve or in the case of an officer completed the period of initial obligation service as member of the selected reserve b who was discharged before completion of that persons initial enlistment as member of the selected reserve or in the case of an officer period of initial obligated service as member of the selected reserve for disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty or c who died while member of the selected reserve the terms selected reserve and reserves include members of the national guard crs4 and 50 stipend the legislated benefits for reservists are less than the conference participants and veteran service organizations recommended the significant differences between the dod recommendation and the legislation are in the requirement for both personnel to be members of the uniformed armed forces in the expansion of the eligible veteran population to include the selected reserve and in the authorized reserve benefits strains on dod resources because additional resources were not provided for the funeral honors requirement in the national defense authorization act for fy2000 it will require dod to divert defense funding and military manpower to nonwarfighting task at time when the armed forces are by consensus experiencing high operations tempo difficulties furthermore the demands on dod are likely to increase as the actuarial trend of veterans deaths rises with the continually aging world war ii veteran population and as the definition of veteran for the purpose of funeral honors is expanded to include the selected reserve the annual number of deaths of veterans in the united states has increased since 1989 the veteran population continues to rise and the trend is not expected to peak until 2008 figure crs5 the va stated that the number of veteran deaths increased 81000 from 1989 to 1997 and is projected to increase an additional 83000 by 200810 this estimate excludes the number of eligible selected reserve veterans it has been estimated that there could be 60000 selected reserve veterans added annually based upon the new legislation11 not all veterans deaths result in request for funeral honor details in 1998 the active duty services provided honors for about 37000 funerals in addition to those rendered at arlington national cemetery12 this number of provided honor details is approximately 8 of all veteran deaths for the same period these numbers do not include the honor details performed by the national guard or by veteran service organizations the american legion alone reports having at least 4000 honors teams nationwide these numbers do not include the number of requests that were not honored estimating the number of requests for honor guards from those eligible is very difficult13 two models were reviewed during the dodhosted conference in november 1998 the conference participants estimated funeral honors requirements based on 45 of all projected veteran deaths that result in request for headstone at their funeral as reported by va however many believe that the estimate should be based on the 75 of all veteran deaths that result in request for flag as reported by the va under the national defense authorization act for fy2000 if the 45 estimate is used requests could grow to at least 270000 by the year 2008 if 75 is more accurate reflection requests could be 465000 by 2008 regardless of which estimate is accurate the result is likely to be significant increases in demand on the resources of the military services14 in an attempt to meet this possible tenfoldplus increase the services will turn to the reserves and veterans service organizations for additional volunteer support although this support is partial solution in some areas some active duty bases will likely be required to build and commit fulltime honor guard teams an additional issue is that there are fewer uniformed personnel in fewer locations to meet the mandated requirements the active duty military has declined to 14 million today 35 decrease from 1989 and the reserve force has decreased by 25 of the current 14 million active personnel 300000500000 are unable to be called upon for funeral honors support due to being stationed or deployed outside the united states or due to other circumstances such as formal training travel or medical care recent 10 department of defense report to congress on military funeral honors for veterans 17 november 1997 section i5 11 the number of selected reserve veterans has not been defined by dod or va in work between the office of the deputy assistant secretary for manpower and personnel the office of the assistant secretary for reserve affairs and the va they have estimated for budget and planning purposes 60000 selected reserve veteran deaths per year 12 the va does not provide honor details 13 major reason the estimating is difficult is because there is single statistical data base for the existing system of requesting and supplying military funeral honors for veterans thus the current data is incomplete 14 the improved communication and coordination of procuring honor details via the 1800number and the additional information provided conuswide to all funeral directors will also likely increase the number of requests crs6 recruiting and retention challenges have increased the shortfall of qualified personnel in addition 81 of 495 major military installations have closed in the past ten years15 the base closure program has produced large geographic areas of responsibility that sometimes include more than one state since there are uniformed military members authorized for the honors duty enlisted active duty volunteers who have performed their regular duty often have to take to the road for 57 honor details in as many days to help cope with the new responsibilities many honor guards have already moved from an all volunteer group to quota system of assignment commanders are curtailing other traditional requests of flag details for active duty retreats retirements and promotions as they do not have the manpower to meet these internal requeststraditions as well as the veteran funeral obligations16 veteran service organizations historically veteran service organizations have contributed to debates over dod policy on military funeral honors organizations such as the military coalition and the retired officers association have demonstrated significant support for codification of minimum of three uniformed service members with every effort being made to provide full honors for every funeral17 these groups were among the first to highlight need for improved communications concerning the honors available and are looking forward to the dod initiative to create 1800number and web site they continue to argue for increases in appropriations to support the funeral honors details since the current act appears to fall short of their position of less than three personnel for honors details and significant increases in reserve benefits the controversy of this issue is likely to continue 15 office of the secretary of defense news release public affairs no18399 21 april 1999 16 telephone conversation colonel d baker 93d support group
