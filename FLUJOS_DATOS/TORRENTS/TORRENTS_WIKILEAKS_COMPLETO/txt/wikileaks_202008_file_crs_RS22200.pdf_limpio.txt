distributional effects of the alternative minimum tax steven maguire specialist in public finance government and finance division summary the alternative minimum tax for individuals amt was originally enacted to ensure that highincome taxpayers paid fair share of the federal income tax however the lack of indexation of the amt coupled with the recent reductions in regular income taxes has greatly expanded th potential impact of the amt temporary increases in the amt exemption and provisions which allow taxpayers to apply nonrefundable tax credits against their amt liabilities expired at the end of 2007 certain taxpayers will be more adversely affected than others in general married taxpayers filing joint returns will be more adversely affected than single taxpayers in addition taxpayers with rge families will be more adversely affected than taxpayers with small families in terms of income the largest increase in taxpayers subject to the amt will occur over adjusted gross income agi ranges of 100000 to 500000 taxpayers with agis between 50000 and 100000 will eventually be affected with the negative effects of the amt growing substantially over time taxpayers with agis above 500000 will not be significantly affected by the expiration of the higher amt exemption this report will be updated as legislative action warrant s or as new data become available background the alternative minimum tax amt for individuals was originally enacted to ensure that all taxpayers especially highincome taxpayers paid at least minimum amount of federal taxes however abse nt legislative action there w ill be significant increase in the number of middle to uppermiddleincome taxpayers affected by the amt in the near future in 2006 about 42 million taxpayers we re subject to the amt but by 2008 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22200crs2 1 us congress joint committee on taxation present law and background relating to the individual alterna tive minimum tax jcx3807 june 25 2007 2 for more detailed information on the amt see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax fo r individuals by steven maguirejoint committee on taxation jct estimates that up to 257 million taxpayers could be subject to the amt1 there are two main reasons for the increase in the number of taxpayers affected by the amt first under the regular income ta x the tax brackets standard deductions and personal exemptions are indexed for infl ation the amt tax brackets and basic exemptions are not indexed over time this has produced reduction in the differences between regular income tax liabilities and amt liabilities at any given nominal income level differences that will continue to sh rink in the absence of amt indexation the second reason is that the 2001 and 2003 reductions in the regular income tax further narrowed the differences between regular and amt tax liabilities the combination of these two factors means that absent legisla tive changes there will be significant growth in the number of taxpayers affected by the amt2 the effects of the amt have been mitigated through temporary increases in the basic exemption for the amt and temporary change s that allow taxpayers to use nonrefundable personal tax credits to reduce their amt liabilitie s the most recent increase in the basic amt exemption occurred in december 2007 w ith the enactment of the tax increase prevention act of 2007 tipa pl 110166 under provisions of this act the amt exemption for 2007 was set at 66250 for joint returns and 44350 for unmarried taxpayers in add ition this act allows taxpayers to temporarily use nonrefundable tax credits to offset amt liability the joint committee on taxation estimates that these two changes will reduce federal revenues by almost 506 billion in 2008 the basic amt exemption is scheduled to decrease to its prior law level of 45000 for joint returns 35750 for unmarried taxpayers and nonrefunda ble tax credits will not be allowed to offset amt liability who will be subject to the amt in the future for 2008 the basic exemption for the amt has reverted to its lower priorlaw levels and nonrefundable personal tax credits are not allowed against the amt as result there will be significant increase in the number of taxpayers subject to the amt and there will also be significant change in the types of taxpayers who will be subject to the amt the potential distributional effect s of the amt are summarized below married taxpayers filing joint returns will be more likely to fall under the amt than will taxpayers filing as si ngles or heads of households this occurs because in 2001 taxpayers filing joint returns received more generous reductions in their regular income tax liabilities than did taxpayers filing as singles or heads of households as result at any given income level taxpayers filing joint returns have seen their regular income tax liabilities reduced to levels that are near or actually below their amt liabilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22200crs3 3 in addition to disallowing deductions for statelocal taxes the amt does not allow miscellaneous itemized deductions and allows deductions for medical expenses only to the extent that they exceed 10 of agi 4 see crs report rl32942 state and local taxes and the fede ral alternative minimum tax by steven maguire and crs report rs22083 alternative

by gregg esenweinlarger families will be more likely to fall under the amt than will smaller families this occurs becau personal exemptions which are allowed under the regular income ta x are not allowed under the amt taxpayers who itemize their deductions under the regular income tax and who have large itemized deductions for statelocal taxes will be more likely to fall under the amt than w ill taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions or taxpayers who take only small deductions for statelocal taxes this occurs because deductions for statelocal taxes are not allowed under the amt3 taxpayers in hightax states who claim itemized deductions for statelocal ta xes will be more likely to fall under the amt than taxpayers in lowtax states who claim little or deductions for statelocal taxes hence taxpayers in hightax states such as new jersey new york connectic ut district of columbia and maryland will tend to be more adversely affected by the amt than will taxpayers in lowtax states such as south dakota mississippi tennessee alaska and alabama4 in 2008 even taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions on their regular income tax returns will be subject to the amt at relatively modest income levels for instance taxpayers filing joint returns with two children four personal exemptions will be subject to the amt when their incomes exceed approximately 65114 taxpayers filing joint returns with children two personal exemptions will be subject to the amt when their incomes exceed approximately 746605 table 1 shows the effects of the amt by adjusted gross income agi levels for selected years between 2005 and 2010 data for 2006 is not available in 2006 taxpayers with agis in the 200000 to 500000 range were the most affected by the amt almost 74 of taxpayers in this income range had amt liabilities in 2008 and beyond taxpayers with agis in the 100000 to 500000 range will be the most affected by the amt by 2010 more than 86 of the taxpayers with agis of 100000 to 200000 will be subject to the amt approximately 981 of ta xpayers with agis in the 200000 to 500000 range will be subject to the amthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22200crs4 6 us congress joint committee on taxati on tabulations memorandum of may 18 2007the number of taxpayers with agis in the 50000 to 100000 range who will fall under the amt will grow steadily over the 2007 to 2010 period by 2010 over 41 of the taxpay ers in this income range will be subject to the amt the number of very highincome taxpayers agis over 1000000 subject to the amt will increase over the 2006 through 2010 period to reiterate it is the lack of indexation of the amt combined with the reductions in the regular income tax that are the pr imary factors responsible for producing these results

confirms the distributional effects of the interaction between the recent reductions in the regular income tax and the amt6 this data shows with the amt and without the amt the static change in tax liability that would occur by adjusted gross income agi class if certain portions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were repealed the jct findings are shown in table 2 for example table 2 shows that taxpayers with agis between 100000 and 200000 would receive 531 billion in tax reductions from the 2001 and 2003 taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22200crs5 reductions if there were amt but because of the interaction of the amt and the regular income tax this income group w ould receive only 285 billion in tax reductions hence the amt takes back 248 billion or 465 of the regular income tax reductions

reduction in the regular income tax occurs for taxpayers with agis in the 75000 to 500000 income range for these taxpayers the amt takes back from 22 to 63 of the recent reductions in the regular income tax taxpayers with agis in excess of 1 million are much less affected by the amt losing only about 35 of the reductions in the regular income tax to the amt why are very highin come taxpayers not so adversely affected by the amt although the amt was originally intended to make sure that highincome taxpayers paid at least minimum amount of federal inco taxes they will not be the group that will be the most adversely affected by the amt in the future there are several reasons why highincome taxpayers especially those with adjusted gross incomes agis over 500000 will be less affected by the amt than their lowerincome counterpartshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22200crs6 7 the basic amt exemption is phased out for taxpayers with amt taxable incomes in excess of 150000 in 2008 the basic amt exemption of 45000 for joint returns is completely phased out at income levels in excess of 330000first for highincome taxpay ers the marginal tax rates they face under the regular income tax tend to be higher than the marg inal tax rates they face under the amt for example under the regular income tax the top two marginal income tax rates are 33 and 35 the top rate under the amt is 28 second under the regular income tax pers onal exemptions are phased out for high income taxpayers so the fact that pers onal exemptions are not allowed under the amt does not have significant effect on high income taxpayers who do not get personal exemptions under the regular income tax third under the alternative minimum tax the basic amt exemption is phased out for taxpayers filing joint returns when amt taxable income exceeds 1500007 hence many highincome taxpayers do not get ba sic exemption under the amt therefore the reduction in the basic amt exemption will have effect on their amt liabilities finally highincome taxpayers generally derive significant percentage of their total income from capital gains and dividend income under both the regular income tax and the amt the tax rate on longterm capital gains and dividend income is limited to maximum rate of 15
