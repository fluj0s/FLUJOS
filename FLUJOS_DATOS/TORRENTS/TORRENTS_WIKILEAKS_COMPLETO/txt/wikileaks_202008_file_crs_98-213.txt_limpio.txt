1995 and 336 million in 1996 the fy1997 dc appropriations act pl 104 194 approved deficit of 74 million instead the district of columbia was pleased to report to congress in february 19982 that it had ended fy1997 with budget surplus of 1859 million3 for fy1998 the districts projected budget surplus as of july 31 1998 was 274 million4 the fy1998 dc appropriations act pl 105 100 had instructed the

fy1997 the accumulated deficit fell to 332 million at the end of fy1997 instead of rising to 527 million as had been expected during last years appropriations process the expected surplus for fy1998

not need to undertake the 110 million in intermediateterm borrowing it had planned to cover the accumulated deficit district officials warn that the surplus is fragile future surpluses depend on the growth of revenues outpacing the growth of expenditures the district continues to lose population and employment while the surrounding suburbs grow under federal law the district is not permitted to tax the income earned in the city by commuters nonresidents who account for about twothirds of the income earned in the district for fy1997 and fy1998 district revenue collections exceeded projections thanks to robust economy and improved tax administration other onetime factors contributed to those surpluses achieving the surplus for fy1997 was explained as follows of the 2599 million swing from the projected deficit of 740 million to the actual surplus of 1859 million 1109 million or 43 was attributed to revenues in excess of projections another 539 million or 21 was attributed to savings from medicaid cost adjustments and 536 million or 21 to leaseback sale of the correctional treatment facility both considered onetime events only 415 million or 16 was attributed to reduction in expenditures some of which resulted from the districts failure to spend because of poor procurement practices6 in fy1998 revenues were expected to be 180 million more than budgeted7 also in fy1998 the district received federal contribution to the nations capital of 190 million there will be unrestricted federal contribution in fy1999 and possibly none in future years these two onetime items contributed 370 million in revenues covering more than the july 1998 projected surplus of 274 million for fy1998 in addition the district has deferred capital expenditures in recent years as part of the effort to balance its budget and because of its inability to borrow from the private capital markets this has created large infrastructure deficit or backlog of needed capital expenditures

committee bills as well as elements introduced for the first time in the conference agreement on the omnibus appropriations bill in the following discussion comparing the housepassed bill hr 4380 with the senate appropriation committee bill s 2333 it will be noted whether the proposal was included in the final fy1999 dc appropriations act enacted as part of the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 1999 hr 4328 pl 105277 each discussion is organized to correspond to the three traditional components of the dc appropriations bill the appropriation of federal funds on behalf of the district see table 3 in the section on major funding trends federal funds the appropriation of the districts expenditures from it own local funds see table 4 in the section on major funding trends district of columbia funds and general provisions that set congresss policies for the operation of the districts government36 in brief in the case of federal funds with only few exceptions the final act included both what the house approved and the senate committee proposed neither the house nor senate committee nor final dc appropriations bill adopted the presidents full proposal for federal spending on economic development efforts in the district instead important parts of the presidents economic development proposal were restored by the offsets package that the administration introduced into the conference agreement on the omnibus appropriations act this included 25 million for the dc national capital revitalization corporation and 50 million for transportation infrastructure and other economic development projects and planning federally funded school scholarship provision was included as title ii of the bill passed by the house efforts to attach school scholarship provision to the bill approved by the senate appropriations committee interfered with s 2333 ever coming to vote on the senate floor there is school scholarship provision in the final fy1999 dc appropriations act in the case of local funds the senate appropriations committee approved the districts proposed fy1999 budget the house removed the funding for advisory neighborhood commissions ancs but added federal funding for several projects to be included in the districts budget the final act followed the houses treatment of dc local funds 36 policy provisions are sometimes included in the sections appropriating federal or local funds and not just in the general provisions section of the bill crs15 there were numerous differences between the housepassed and senate committee bills in the policy provisions included for the district government37 the final act included all of the provisions that appeared in both the house and senate committee bills it included most of the provisions that appeared in one bill but not the other but not all of those provisions finally it included some provisions that first appeared in the conference agreement there are 69 general provisions of policy in the final fy1999 dc appropriations act there were 54 in the house bill and 57 in the senate committee bill the clinton administration expressed serious objection to three provisions included in the house but not the senate committee bill and threatened to veto any final bill including them federal funding for private school scholarships barring adoptions by unmarried couples and barring the use of local funds for needle exchange programs for illegal drugs the first two provisions were not included in the final bill enacted but the third was housepassed bill hr 4380 on july 30 1998 the full house appropriations committee approved several amendments to the bill that had been approved by the house dc appropriations subcommittee on july 24 the changes made by the full committee are noted in the description that follows the full house approved the dollar amounts of federal and local funds recommended by the appropriations committee however additional amendments regarding policy provisions were considered on the house floor during the debate that began on august 6 and carried over into the early morning of august 7 both the provisions that were adopted and those that were rejected on the house floor are reported at the end of this section federal funds the house approved expenditures of 491181 million in federal funds for dc using the full amount of the houses 302b suballocation38 this is 37 both the house and senate bills deleted many general provisions that were included in the fy1998 dc appropriations act although not as many as the district had requested be deleted the house and senate bills did not include several new provisions that the district had proposed for the districts request see us president 1992 clinton

38 the house dc appropriations subcommittee had approved much lower federal expenditures of 429781 million this was 61 million less than the houses 302b suballocation of 491 million the was largely because the house subcommittee did not adopt the presidents economic development spending proposals for the district or the senate appropriations committees alternative the house appropriations committee approved 485781 million the full house added 54 million for the dc student opportunity continued crs16 5 million higher than the presidents request of 486 million and 9 million higher than the senate appropriations committee proposal of 4818 million in federal funds it is 42 million lower than the 533 million in federal funds appropriated for fy1998 not including the 302 million appropriation for correctional facilities capital construction and repair in fy1998 the final act approved slightly more than the house 494590 million before adding the 1250 million in offset provisions the house endorsed the amounts proposed by the president for the three criminal justice functions now funded by the federal government 1848 million to the dc corrections trustee for operations 142 million to the dc courts including 121 million for operations and 21 million for capital improvements and 594 million for the dc offender supervision defender and court services agency the senate appropriations committee approved the same amounts for the corrections trustee and the offender supervision agency and these were included in the final act however the senate appropriations committee approved 14 million less for court capital improvements 7 million and thus courts as whole 128 million the senate recommendation on courts was included in the final act the managers amendment approved by the full house appropriations committee added 4 million to the appropriation for the offender services agency for the establishment of residential sanctions center and drug testing intervention and treatment the managers amendment also added 7 million for an environmental study and related cleanup activities at the lorton correctional complex to be transferred to the federal agency with authority over the complex this funding would be channeled through the dc corrections trustee both were included in the house passed bill neither appeared in the senate committee bill the lorton program was retained in the final act but the drug treatment program was not the house dc appropriations subcommittee rejected the presidents 100 million economic development proposal nor did it follow the senate appropriations committee in approving 75 federal contribution to dc transportation infrastructure instead the house subcommittee approved only 1 million to study the proposed metro station improvements at the washington convention center project in contrast the managers amendment approved by the full house appropriations committee provided 25 million for improvements to the mount vernon square metrorail station at the site of the proposed washington convention center comparable to the presidents proposal and the senate appropriations committee bill it also provided 21 million as federal contribution to the nations capital infrastructure fund for transportation infrastructure improvements in the district together these total 46 million that is still lower than the 75 million the senate appropriations committee provided for these items the housepassed bill followed these recommendations 38 continued scholarship program the amount remaining under the 302b suballocation of 4912 million crs17 the final dc appropriations act included 25 million for the metrorail station as recommended in all the proposals it included 18777 million for the infrastructure fund slightly lower than the 210 million approved by the house and far less than the nearly 50 million that might be available under the senate committee bill in addition however the offsets section 134 of the omnibus act provided 50 million for infrastructure and economic development projects bringing the total amount for these three categories to 93778 million far larger than either the house or senate proposal the full appropriations committee and the full house agreed with the dc appropriations subcommittees recommendations on other items of federal funding this includes federal funding of 12 million for metropolitan police department office of citizen complaint review 3240 million to fund 55 pay raise for fire fighters to establish parity with the police and 20391 for charter schools to be added to the 12235 million in local funds approved for charter schools these federal contributions are also included in the appropriation of dc local funds the final act included these provisions although the amount for charter schools was reduced to 15622 based on lower student enrollment figures the house subcommittee and full committee approved 85 million for the us park police aviation unit for helicopter and necessary capital expenditures to the aviation unit base last year the fy1998 appropriations act provided 120 million to the park police for services to the district this was included in the final act where the senate appropriations committee approved 1 million for georgetown waterfront park fund the house approved 3 million for the district to hire the corps of engineers to study and to make improvements to federal property at the washington marina southwest waterfront the 3 million is also included in the appropriation of local funds for economic development and regulation both were included in the final act where the senate committee approved 71 million in federal funds for boys town usa operations in dc the house approved 40 million in federal funds on the condition that boys town of washington collects 31 million in matching funds from private contributions the final act approved the full 71 million the house approved funding

city museum the house approved 20 million for the establishment and operation of city museum provided that the historic society deposit an equivalent amount of matching funds the district is to lease the carnegie library at mount vernon square to the historic society as the site for the museum the final act approved the houses recommended 20 million for the city museum conditional on matching funds the final act provided 700000 divided among three purposes 300000 for needs and design study for national museum of american music 300000 for the washington center alliance to further and promote the objectives of the crs18 interactive downtown task force and 100000 to save new york avenue inc for the further improvement of the portion of new york avenue designated as the capital gateway corridor title ii was added to hr 4380 by amendment on the house floor it authorized the district of columbia student opportunity scholarship program for fiveyear period although 7 million in federal funds was authorized for fy1999 the amount appropriated was 54 million the amount remaining under the 302b suballocation when the title was added school scholarship provision was included in the senate committee bill or the final act local funds the house bill made few changes to the districts budget request and thus differs from the senate appropriations committee bill in those respects net these changes increased by 27258 million three totals shown in table 4 operating expenses of the general fund all operating expenses and district of columbia funds when the housepassed bill is compared with the districts request and the senate appropriations committee bill under the category of government direction and support the house rejected the districts request for 453000 for advisory neighborhood commissions ancs39 of the local funds appropriated for public education the house committee earmarked 750000 244078 for fy1998 and 500000 for fy1999 to pay the boy scouts of america for

carry out improvements to federal property at the washington marina southwest waterfront under public safety and justice the house added 12 million in federal funding for metropolitan police

charter schools from the 12235 million requested by the district to 32626 million the final act included these provisions but scaled the federal funds amount for charter schools down to 15622 million reflecting lower enrollment and the corresponding aggregate amounts for public schools total operating expenses and total dc funds fell accordingly policy provisions the house included several new policy provisions in its fy1999 appropriations bill unless otherwise noted these are not included in the bill approved by the senate appropriations committee some were included in the final act but others were not under the appropriation of local funds for the control 39 both the full committee and the full house rejected an amendment to restore the advisory neighborhood commission funding crs19

senate on november 9 1997 and the house on april 30 1998 but vetoed by the president on may 20 1998 the house rejected four amendments offered by the district of columbias delegate congresswoman eleanor holmes norton 43 these prohibitions all apply to the use of any funds appropriated under this act 44 the house appropriations committee had approved an amendment prohibiting the use of federal but not local monies to support needle exchange program for users of illegal drugs this was substitute for an amendment subsequently rejected by the committee to prohibit the use of local as well as federal funds for needle exchange program crs21 1 to restore the 573000 in local funding for the advisory neighborhood commissions that had been requested by the district 2 to allow local funds to be expended for abortions while still prohibiting the use of federal funds 3 to remove the prohibition in the bill against the use of funds by the dc government for petition drive or civil action which seeks to require congress to provide for voting representation in congress and 4 to strike the section of the bill that repeals the districts recently enacted residency requirement for newly hired district government employees the general provision section 131 providing that operating funds be available only when appropriated in an annual appropriations act was removed by point of order this would have infringed on the control boards right to spend funds derived from intradistrict transfers and interest earnings clinton administration position45 the administration seriously opposed three amendments which if included in the final bill from congress could lead the presidents senior advisers to recommend veto the private school vouchers the prohibition on adoptions by couples who are not married or related by blood and the prohibition on funding needle exchange programs the clinton administration expressed its disappointment that the house bill did not fund the presidents proposals for economic development by federal funding for management reform and locallychartered revitalization corporation the administration supports the increased funding for charter schools the administration is generally opposed to what it views as unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of the district and the congresss undercutting the authority of the control board and the superintendent of public schools by placing conditions on the management of the district government the administration opposes the restriction on the use of local funds for abortions it supports restoring funding for the advisory neighborhood commissions it would like the amendment prohibiting smoking by minors to be made sense of congress amendment it is concerned by provisions that legislate how local funds are used for salaries and pay raises in the dc public schools 45 executive office of the president office of management and budget hr 4380 district of columbia appropriations bill fy 1999 statement of administration policy washington house floor august 6 1998 crs22 title ii district of columbia student opportunity scholarships46 t h i s provision was not included in the final act title ii of hr 4380 would have authorized the provision of scholarships to limited number of the district of columbias resident students in grades k12 from lowincome families for an initial fiveyear period the scholarships could be used to attend public or private schools in the district or nearby suburbs tuition scholarships or pay the costs of supplementary academic programs outside regular school hours for students attending district of columbia public schools dcps enhanced achievement scholarships the authorized appropriation level for this program would be 7 million for fy1999 8 million for fy2000 and 10 million for each of fy2001fy2003 plus onetime authorization of 250000 for program evaluation more than 75 of the appropriations for any year could be used for program administration hr 4380 appropriates 54 million in federal funds for the scholarship program with budget of 54 million possibly fewer than 2000 students would be assisted this is less than 3 of the estimated student enrollment of 74283 in the dc public schools and 4400 in charter schools for the 199899 school year the scholarship program would be administered by private nonprofit corporation known as the district of columbia scholarship corporation district of columbia scholarship fund would be established within the us treasury to hold the federal funds appropriated until they are dispersed to the corporation expenditures for the scholarship program would not appear in the districts budget eligible for scholarships are students in grades k12 who are residents of the district with family income below 185 of the standard federal poverty income threshold for family of their size during the first three program years first priority in the awarding of scholarships would go to students who have been attending the dc public schools dcps or are about to enter dcps kindergarten in all years priority would also be given to students who received scholarship in the preceding academic year pupils already in private school might receive scholarships if funds remain after the public school pupils are served if funds are insufficient to provide scholarships to all eligible applicants recipients would be selected by lottery there would be two types of scholarships tuition scholarships could be used to pay the costs of tuition and fees at public or private school in the district or the inner ring of suburban jurisdictions and b enhanced achievement scholarships could pay the costs of tuition fees and transportation for program of instruction which enhances student achievement of the core curriculum and is operated outside of regular school hours to supplement the regular school program section 46 this school scholarship provision is nearly identical to the provision that was considered as part of the fy1998 dc appropriations bill it was included in title iii of hr 2607 as originally passed by the house in 1997 it was split off from the version of hr 2607 approved by the senate and passed by the senate as separate bill s 1502 on november 9 1997 s 1502 was approved by the house on april 30 1998 but vetoed by president clinton on may 20 1998 publicprivate school choice proposals for pupils in the district of columbia were also extensively considered but not enacted during the 104th congress particularly hr 2546 see crs report 951030 district of columbia public schools status of federal legislation affecting them crs23 203c2 the dollar amount of tuition scholarships would be the lesser of 3200 or 100 of tuition fees and transportation costs if family income is below the poverty level and the lesser of 2400 or 75 of tuition fees and transportation costs if family income is between 100 and 185 of poverty 185 of the poverty level is also the maximum income for pupil eligibility for free or reduced price school lunches the dollar amount of enhanced achievement scholarships would be the lesser of tuition fees and transportation or 500 for all students with family income below 185 of poverty the maximum dollar amounts for scholarships would be adjusted in the future by changes in the consumer price index cpi scholarships would be considered aid to the student not the institution participating schools could not charge scholarship recipients tuition and fees in excess of the amounts charged to other dc students attending the school participating institutions could not discriminate on the basis of race color national origin or sex although schools might operate singlesex classes or institutions it is explicitly provided that religiouslyaffiliated schools participating in the scholarship program might give preference to members of specific religion in admissions or employment and that scholarship funds might be used for sectarian purposes by such schools the program does affect the rights of students or the obligations of the district of columbia public schools under the individuals with disabilities education act the bill lays out conditions for new educations institutions to become eligible to participate in the program on provisional basis schools eligibility to participate in the scholarship program might be revoked for good cause such as failure to meet program requirements or if 25 or more of the scholarship recipients at the school fail to make appropriate progress as determined by the corporation within four years of enactment the us general accounting office would be required to contract for an evaluation of the scholarship program including comparisons of scholarship recipients and similar but nonparticipating students in the dcps with respect to achievement test scores graduation rates parental satisfaction and impact of the program on the dcps47 senate appropriations committee bill s 2333 federal funds the senate committee bill endorsed several of the presidents requests for federal funding however it differed with the presidents proposals on federal funding of dc economic development the major differences were that the senate committee bill would appropriate for transportation infrastructure the 50 million that the president proposed as seed money to capitalize an economic development corporation in the district and would use the 25 million for management reform more broadly than for economic development purposes only see table 3 the senate appropriations committee proposed total of 4818 million in federal funding for the district that is 44 million lower than the 4862 million 47 this description draws from crs issue brief 98035 school choice current legislation by wayne riddle and james stedman updated regularly crs24 requested by the president it matches the senates may 14th 302b suballocation of 482 million but is 9 million lower than the senates july 13th suballocation of 491 million it is 51 million lower than the 533 million in federal funds appropriated for fy1998 not including the 302 million appropriation for correctional facilities capital construction and repair in fy1998 the president proposed 100 million in federal support for economic development and management reforms composed of 50 million in seed money for locallychartered economic development corporation 25 million for metro station improvements at the proposed washington convention center and 25 million in payments to dc for management reforms to improve economic development infrastructure the senate appropriations committee bill reconfigured this 100 million like the presidents proposal the senate appropriations committee bill would provide 25 million for management reform however unlike the presidents proposal it would not be restricted to management reform efforts related to economic development instead it could be used for any of the types of management reforms identified in the 1997 revitalization act the final act included 25 million for management reforms the senate appropriations committee bill did not endorse the presidents proposal for providing 50 million in seed money for an economic development corporation for the district of columbia and specifically forbade capitalizing the national capital revitalization act of 1998 dc act 12355 enacted this spring by the dc council however the senate committee bill would provide 500 million to conduct study and prepare report for congress by may 1 1999 on the feasibility of such an economic development corporation an offsets provision in the final act provides 25 million to capitalize the economic development corporation instead the senate committee bill would provide 75 million for transportation infrastructure needs of the district namely the repair and maintenance of roads highways bridges and transit of that 75 million up to 25 million could be used for improvements to the mount vernon square metrorail station at the site of the proposed new washington convention center the president also proposed 25 million for those metrorail station improvements as part of his 100 million economic development package the final act provides 25 million for the metrorail station and 50 million from the offsets for transportation infrastructure and economic development projects the senate appropriations committee bill requests the same amount as the president for the dc corrections trustee for operations 1848 million and for the offender supervision defender and court services offender services agency 594 million for the districts courts the senate committee bill requests the same amount as the president for operations 121 million but less for capital improvements 7 million instead of the presidents 21 million thus the senate committees total request for the courts is 128 million compared with the presidents 142 million these amounts are included in the final act crs25 in addition the senate committee bill proposes federal funding for four specific projects in the district not found in the presidents budget boys town usa would receive 71 million for its activities in the district including 47 million in capital costs for constructing five residential facilities and 24 million in firstyear operating costs for those facilities the georgetown waterfront park fund would receive 1 million in federal funds to be matched by 1 million in contributions in cash or in kind for construction and landscaping these amounts are included in the final act federal contribution of 500000 each would be given to conduct needs and design studies for two proposed new museums to be located in the district national museum of american music and city museum and visitors center the final act provides 300000 for the music museum and 2 million for the city museum local funds the senate appropriations committee bill completely endorses the districts proposed budget of its own local funds unlike the housepassed bill which made some changes that were endorsed in the final act policy provisions the senate appropriations committee bill includes numerous general provisions directing the operation of the dc government and its policies many of the senates general provisions are the same as those in the house passed bill all but one of these carry over from the fy1998 act48 as in prior year appropriations acts and the housepassed bill the senate committee bill for fy1999 would prohibit the district from funding most abortions sec 129 senate 131 final act or from enforcing the provision of health and other employment or government benefits for unmarried domestic partners sec 131 senate 133 final act the only new provision that the housepassed bill and senate appropriations committee bill agree on is to repeal provision recently enacted by the dc council to require district residency for newly hired employees of the district government sec 145 senate 153 final act all of these were included in the final act the senate committee bill contains numerous new provisions not found in the house passed bill among these the senate bill addresses the controversy that surrounded the appointment of chief management officer and the salaries paid to certain district officials the senate committee bill contains new section 151 that authorizes the control board to employ chief management officer cmo and to delegate to the cmo responsibility for oversight and supervision of whichever departments the control board determines this is included in the final act sec 159 the senate bill would have given the cmo is the authority to appoint and fix the pay of staff as the cmo considers appropriate but this was not included in the final act the employment agreement of january 15 1998 between the control board and the current cmo camille barnett is declared valid the final act did not go along with the senate bill which would have permitted the control board to set marketcompetitive market salary for the cmo sec 151 as well as the chief 48 there are several provisions from the fy1998 act that the house bill carries over but the senate appropriations committee bill does not see house sec 128 133 and 134 regarding reporting requirements for university of the district of columbia the dc public schools and the emergency transitional education board of trustees sec 138 regarding an energy and water conservation plan for the public schools and sec 141 regarding compliance with the buy american act crs26 financial officer sec 152 the inspector general sec 153 and the executive director of the control board sec 157 to help control the costs associated with the special education program the senate appropriations committee bill would increase from the current 50 days to 120 days the amount of time that the district of columbia public schools dcps has to assess and place student with disability who may require special education services sec 140 currently if the school district fails to meet the time deadline parents are often successful in arguing that their child should immediately be placed in private school program with the dcps bearing the cost of the legal proceedings tuition and transportation estimated at 48000 per student for fy1999 the final act included this change sec 145 the senate committee bill includes the dc adoption improvement act of 1998 sec 149 its objective is to have more children placed in permanent homes through adoption rather than leaving them in the foster care system where they move from one home to another the districts adoption and foster care system has been under federal court receivership since 1995 with significant changes in wording this provision was included in the final act sec 157 receiverships or other agencies under courtappointed official would be required to submit their budget to the mayor to be included in the districts annual budget to be forwarded to the council sec 136 the mayor and council could make recommendations but could not change the estimates this was included in the final act sec 140 beginning with fy2000 reserve of 150 million would be established by the chief financial office cfo for the control board to be spent according to criteria established by the cfo and approved by the control board sec 146 the committee report indicates that this is intended to provide flexibility in unforseen circumstances such as change in law that mandates certain actions or onetime expenditures in technology this is included in the final act sec 155 the senate committee is concerned that various nonprofit organizations are unable to deliver medical and social services because the district government has withdrawn its financial support the bill would require the control board to report to the congressional appropriations and authorizing committees on the status of all partnerships or agreements between the district government and such nonprofit organizations and on its plans to reinstate any terminated partnership sec 144 this was included in the final act sec 152 the university of the district of columbia would be permitted to invest in equitybased securities sec 135 sec 139 final act the dc public library would be authorized to hire fundraiser and raise funds from private sources to be spent with prior approval of the cfo and control board sec 148 the number of years that the same auditor may audit the districts financial statement and report would be extended from 3 to 5 years sec 154 sec 160 final act as requested by the control board this is intended to provide auditing firms greater incentive to bid on the contract these were all included in the final act crs27 under the senate proposal funds that are accumulated through fees charged for local services that are nonappropriated could be expended by the cfo with prior written approval of the control board sec 147 this was not included in the final act the us army corps of engineers would be given limited authority to contract for engineering and construction services to facilitate its ability to assist the dc public schools with their capital improvements program sec 130 sec 132 final act unlike the house the senate bill carries over from the fy1998 act the requirement that the control board and the chief executive officer of the dc public schools report to congress by april 1 on all measures necessary and steps to be taken to ensure that the public schools begin on time the next academic year 19992000 sec 137 sec 141 final act these were both included in the final act omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 1999 pl 4328 pl 105277 the district of columbia appropriations act 1999 was included as division section 101c of the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 1999 hr 4328 pl 105277 enacted october 21 199849 the conference agreement on the omnibus act added several items of federal funding that had not been included in either the house or senate committee bill under the regular dc appropriations act the conference agreement added 1 million for the childrens national medical center it provided 3 million for medicare coordinated care demonstration project as had been provided in the fy1998 act in addition to the dc appropriations act sections 131 134 at the end of division appropriated another 125 million in federal funds for the district of columbia for four designated purposes this included 25 million to capitalize the dc national capital revitalization corporation 30 million for special education costs in the dc public schools 20 million for year 2000 information technology and 50 million for transportation infrastructure and economic development projects combined with the provisions of the regular appropriations act this provided more economic development assistance to the district than had been included in the presidents original february 1998 budget request the additional 125 million was part of an offsets agreement between the clinton administration and congressional leadership included in the conference agreement on the omnibus bill the offsets package involved converting the private assets held by certain dc pension funds into us treasury securities section 130 of division and using the estimated 42 billion in revenue proceeds from the asset sales to finance variety of programs during fy1999 including the 125 million for the district of columbia 49 the district of columbia appropriations act was one of eight appropriations bills included in pl 105277s division omnibus consolidated appropriations section 101 crs28 the conference report did not introduce any substantial changes to the appropriation of local funds the conference report did introduce few general provisions that were not included in either the housepassed or senate committee bill secs 162169 major funding trends federal funds impact of the revitalization act the national capital revitalization and selfgovernment improvement act of 1997 the revitalization act pl 10533 dramatically changed the way of appropriating federal funds for the district of columbia beginning in fy1998 more changes were implemented for fy1999 these changes have made it more complicated to compare funding trends over time to start the revitalization act eliminated the annual federal payment to the district and annual federal contribution to certain dc retirement funds that had been present through fy1997 consequently the historical trend in federal funding since fy1993 tracked in table 2 cannot be extended beyond fy1997 table 2 district of columbia appropriations fy1993 to fy1997 budget authority in millions of current dollarsa federal monies to dc fy1993 fy1994 fy1995 fy1996 fy1997 federal payment 624854 630603 660603 660000 660000 federal contribution to 52070 52070 52070 52070 52070 dc retirement funds other federal 11075 17327 0 0 6702 appropriations total 687999 700000 712673 712070 718772 these figures represent current dollars exclude permanent budget authorities and reflect rescissions simply adding together the amount of federal funds appropriated and local funds appropriated overstates the total amount of expenditures being approved on behalf of the district because there is some overlap some of the federal funds appropriated are paid to the district government and appropriated again as part of local funds for fy1999 this includes the 3 million for waterfront improvements at the washington marina 12 million for the civilian complaint review board 3240 million for the firefighters pay raise and 15622 million for charter schools however as result of the changes brought about by the revitalization act and programs added in the fy1999 appropriation large portion of the federal funds is now paid to entities other than the district government or the control board acting as its agent these amounts are not counted in dc local funds it would also crs29 apply to federal funding for scholarship program administered outside the district government for fy1997 and prior years the federal payment to the district was paid to the district government and the same funds were appropriated again as part of the districts expenditure of local funds under the revitalization act starting in fy1998 the federal government took direct responsibility for funding three justice functions corrections offender supervision and courts the federal funds for those functions are now paid to trustees or other entities outside the district government and spending for those functions has been dropped from the districts budget of local funds50 however the appropriation of federal funds for those justice functions remains under the dc appropriations bill with one exception prison construction beginning in fy1999 in fy1998 the first year of the revitalization plan the federal payment to the dc corrections trustee for correctional facilities construction and repair was part of the appropriation of federal funds to the district of columbia beginning in fy1999 however federal funding for new prison construction for dcs convicted adult felons the capital spending component of corrections is to be made to the federal prison system in the department of justice through the appropriation for the departments of commerce justice state the judiciary and related agencies the president requested 300000 for these prison capital expenditures for fy1999 this shift in the subcommittee jurisdiction for funding capital construction for correctional facilities for the district largely explains the decline in the proposed appropriation of federal funds for the district of columbia from 835 million actual in fy1998 to 486 million presidents amended request in fy1999 to avoid confusion in comparisons between fiscal years the measure of total federal funding for fy1998 has been revised downward by the prison construction amount of 302 million from 835 million to 533 million another major change is that unrestricted federal contribution was requested for fy1999 although the revitalization act eliminated the annual federal payment it did authorize another form of unrestricted cash contribution called federal contribution to operations of government of the nations capital or federal contribution however the revitalization act authorized specific dollar amount for the contribution for fy1998 only 190 million the act left the contribution amount for fy1999 and future years to be determined in relation to certain considerations enumerated in the law the fact that federal contribution was requested by the president for fy1999 led to proposal from the clinton administration and bill being introduced congress hr 3920 that would eliminate the congresss role in approving the district of columbias budget see the federal contribution section at the end of this report51 50 federal funds paid into escrow accounts with the control board for safekeeping on behalf of the district are counted in local funds 51 this brief summary focuses on the budgetary and financial aspects of the revitalization plan continued crs30 instead of providing the district with an unrestricted money contribution for fy1999 the president and congress have chosen instead to provide federal funding to the district in the form of numerous separate appropriations earmarked for particular programs in the aggregate the amount of federal funds appropriated for the district in the final fy1999 omnibus appropriations act was 619590 million this includes 494590 million under the dc appropriations act and 1250 million under the offsets package in comparison 5330 million in federal funds were appropriated for fy1998 at first glance the 620 million total may appear comparable to the 660 million annual federal payment that the district was receiving prior to the revitalization act the major difference is that the district is not free to spend that money as it chooses in some cases the earmarked money is paying for functions taken over from the district or that the district would otherwise be financing on its own it thus provides some financial relief for the districts budget this description applies to most of the items in part 1 of table 3 authorized by the revitalization act in other cases however the federal funds are earmarked for additional or new programs or projects that might not otherwise be undertaken by the district while these federal funds supply additional financial resources to the district they do not necessarily provide financial relief to the districts budget this description applies to many of the items introduced in the fy1999 appropriations listed in parts 2 and 4 of table 3 51 continued for the district not discussed are other significant aspects such as changes involving sentencing parole location of prisoners and disposition of the lorton correctional complex in fairfax county virginia required as condition of federal takeover of dc corrections responsibilities and the temporary shift in management responsibility from the mayor and council to the control board required by the final legislation for further detail see crs report 97766 district of columbia

the corrections trustee for construction and repair from835 million to 533 million b in addition to the proposed court funding of 142 million the presidents original budget request of february 1998 included 6 million federal payment to the dc judicial retirement and survivors annuity fund the president also proposed that the payments to the judges pension fund be changed from discretionary to mandatory expenditures fy1999 us budget appendix p 104950 however the presidents fy1999 budget amendments of may 1998 withdrew this 6 million request instead the federal contribution for judges pensions in fy1999 will be paid from the pension fund assets transferred from the district to the federal government under the provisions of the 1997 revitalization act removing this 6 million request reduced the total for the presidents fy1999 budget request for the district from 492 million to 486 million c see the offsets in part 4 of this table d the senate appropriations subcommittee bill would permit up to 25 million of the 75 million for transportation infrastructure to be used for improvements at the mount vernon square metrorail station at the site of the proposed new washington

appropriation of dc local funds for the receiving agency see table 4 g in the final version of the fy1998 dc appropriations act 26 million in local funds were approved for pay increase for fire

committee bill approved 482 million equal to its may 14th 302b suballocation but 9 million lower than its higher july 13th suballocation of 491 million the amount of federal funds approved for dc appropriations in the final appropriations act 494590 million exceeds these 302b suballocations with respect to budget allocations the requirements of the budget act were waived for the final omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 1999 hr 4328 pl 105277 in the aggregate the omnibus bill did not violate the overall 302a budget allocation for the eight appropriations bills which it encompassed although adjustments had been made in individual bills revised 302b allocations were calculated for each of the original individual appropriations bills after the conference agreement on the omnibus bill was reached major funding trends district of columbia funds the district of columbia government and financial control board submitted consensus budget request for fy1999 to the congress on june 1 1998 the operating expense budget included 5231 billion in revenues and 5189 billion in expenditures with surplus of 41 billion the districts largest increase in recommended spending compared with fy98 was for the dc public schools within the budget for the public education system the district governments request for 648 million was nonetheless 60 million less than the school district had requested the budget request for the operations of the control board itself was reduced by 500 million from 3220 million to 2720 million however the overall budget request for the dcfrma increased to7840 million to include 5120 million for the office of the chief management officer cmo dr camille barnett receiverships is new category in the dc budget for fy1999 this will help account for areas of expenditure of local funds are currently beyond the control of the district government and control board because they are largely determined by court orders three of the citys four receiverships are included the lashawn foster care receiver the commission on mental health receiver and the department of corrections medical receiver not included is the receiver for the department of public and assisted housing on the grounds that it is financed predominantly by federal monies the budget for the receiverships for fy1998 is recorded as zero because they were not included in the dc budget for appropriations purposes even though these activities did have expenditures in prior fiscal years 53 continued appropriations further revised allocation to subcommittees of budget total fiscal year 1999 105th cong 2d sess sprt 105247 july 13 1998 presidents budget request obtained from the house appropriations committee july 16 1998 crs37 based on the numbers presented in table 4 the difference between the districts request for total general fund operating expenses in fy1999 and the amount enacted for fy1998 is 348 million however if the 319 million for receiverships is subtracted from the fy1999 budget request in order to standardize the comparison then the fy1999 request is just 29 million larger than the fy1998 appropriation of 40 billion the net increase in operating expenses for all of the districts enterprise funds considered together is 15 million above the fy1998 request of 646 million the apparent 14 billion increase in capital expenditures between fy1998 and fy1999 is misleading the fy1998 appropriation for capital expenditures of 269 million is for one year only the 17 billion requested in the fy1999 budget is for sixyear capital plan the senate finance committee bill and the final act plased an overall cap on the number of fte fulltime equivalent positions for fy1999 at 32900 exclusive of intradistrict positions for fy1998 32837 positions had been approved for fy1999 the district had requested and the house appropriations committee had approved 34169 fte positions54 the house senate and conference committee largely approved the districts budget request with one exception the house bill and the final act did not approve the districts request for 0573 million for advisory neighborhood commissions anc under the category of government direction and support the conference report states that the district may reprogram funds for fy1999 and may request anc funding for fy2000 to cover the ancs subject to improved management and financial controls over the ancs being enacted by the dc council the congress increased funding above the districts request for three categories providing federal funds to finance the increase some but not all of the federal funds appropriated for the district listed in table 3 are thus counted again in the appropriation of the district of columbias local funds shown in table 4 all of these were federal payments included in the housepassed bill and the final act but not in the senate appropriations committee bill this helps explain the difference in amounts among the three versions of the bill for three line items the 3 million for waterfront improvements at the marina in southwest washington is included in economic development and regulation the 12 million for the civilian complaint review board and the 3240 million for the firefighters pay raise are included in public safety and justice the federal payment for charter schools is included under public education system the amount was 20391 million under the house bill and 15622 million under the final act 54 us congress house committee on appropriations district of columbia appropriations bill 1999

washington convention center enterprise fund are net amounts equal to the gross amounts minus the transfers from the general fund enumerated in the appropriations act the fy1998 capital outlay appropriation of 269 million was for one fiscal year the districts fy1999 request of 17 billion was for 6 years the authorization under the fy1999 appropriations act is for two fiscal years the capital funds remain available to be obligated until september 30 2000 the federal contribution for fy1999 president clinton did not recommend federal contribution to the district of columbia and congress did not choose to make one the option to make federal contribution however remains available for future years under authorizing law the revitalization act officially repealed the federal payment to the district of columbia but in its stead authorized federal contribution towards the costs of the operations of the government of the nations capital subtitle g section 11601 of pl 10533 the federal contribution like the predecessor federal payment can be thought of as an unrestricted grant payment available for the district governments various spending needs including repaying loans from the federal government or private financial market this is in contrast to the other federal payments made under the fy1998 and fy1999 appropriations acts which take over or finance specific district government functions the 1997 revitalization act authorized specific dollar amount for the federal contribution for fy1998 only 190 million for fy1999 and future years the act left the dollar amount of the federal contribution to be determined according to the act after fy1998 for each subsequent fiscal year such amount as may be necessary for such contribution in determining the amount appropriated pursuant to the authorization under this paragraph congress shall take into account the findings described in paragraph 1 the four elements cited as findings in paragraph 1 may be paraphrased as follows the congressionally imposed height limit on buildings and other limitations relating to the federal presence in the district that may tend to reduce tax revenues crs41 the congressional prohibition against levying an income tax on nonresident commuters which limits the districts ability to tax income earned in the district of columbia the unreimbursed public service costs imposed by the federal governments presence and the resulting high tax burden on district residents relative to residents of other jurisdictions in the washington dc metropolitan area and other cities of comparable size as with previous legislation authorizing the federal payment the revitalization act does not present formula or methodology for translating the generalized notion of compensating the district for the federal governments presence into predictable dollar amount55 proposal to end congressional appropriation of dc local funds both the federal payment and the federal contribution to the district were counted as part of the districts local funds for appropriation purposes this provided grounds for the congress to appropriate all of the districts expenditures from local funds table 4 in addition to appropriating payments of federal funds made on behalf of the district table 3 citing the repeal of the authorization of the annual federal payment by the 1997 revitalization act the clinton administration submitted to congress on may 18 1998 proposal that the congress would longer appropriate the part of the districts budget funded solely by local funds56 congress would however continue to perform oversight for the district and make appropriations for those functions that the federal government now funds directly as result of the revitalization act such as the criminal justice system during control year the procedures established by the dcfrma act57 would generally continue however in cases where the district and the control board disagree the control board would be authorized to resolve the disagreements instead of sending two versions of the districts budget to congress on may 20 1998 representative eleanor holmes norton the delegate to congress from the district of columbia introduced hr 3920 the district of columbia legislative and budget autonomy act of 1998 the bill would amend the dc home rule act in addition to eliminating congresss role in approving the district of columbias budget it would eliminate congressional review of newly passed district laws 55 all of these four factors have been cited at some time in previous legislation authorizing the federal payment 56 the proposal was transmitted in letters sent by franklin d raines director of the us office of management and budget dated may 18 1998 to the speaker of the house and the president of the senate 57 district of columbia financial responsibility and management assistance dcfrma act pl 1048 crs42 removing congresss authority to approve the dc budget
