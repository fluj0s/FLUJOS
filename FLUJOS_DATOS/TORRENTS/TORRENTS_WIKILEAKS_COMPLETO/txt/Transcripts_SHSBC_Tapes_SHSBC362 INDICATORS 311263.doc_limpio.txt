indicators lecture given on 31 december 1963 thank you well i havent seen you for quite while ive been trying to groom in your instructors and ive been working behind the scenes my hand will have been felt here shortly well its very beautiful evening for the old year to be dying i hope it dies very dead i dont like to see it any possibility of it quivering back to life you know we can bury it with all the sentiment of drunken relative who stole all our money yeah 1963 been quite year its been very successful technically fantastically it will go down in history for that reason but boy from the standpoint of steady uninterrupted screech of speed and action and so forth it i dont want to see it back actually that was this has been the year in which weve achieved the technologies to ot and grooved them in and polished them up the year in which we have taken all of the various technologies of scientology developed over all these years back from dianetic days and stretched them out into proper classes and prepared the way and opened the gates and laid the bridge and done tremendous number of things weve had our heaviest attacks since 1950 in this past year and these things are folding up the attackers look like weak kneed fighter who has been pulled off the mat the third time and his manager is standing over there looking anxiously around the sparring partners for new boy you know and they for instance just i think it was yesterday why infernal ravening organization over in the united states that practices legal banditry on all the citizens and so on the real government of the united states since its the one that has the authority over every individual citizen including senators congressmen and the president it lost it lost it had attacked mary sue and myself hoping thereby to get through to the fcdc and it lost and it ran up small if somewhat dirty white flag and that was the end they were suing us for various things including falsely asserting that we had children laughter and none of these attacks none of these attacks actually very serious they make an awful lot more noise than they have lead in them they mostly blank shots theyre mostly shot out for the press and so on and then they fade and so forth for instance i think the last this one with infernal ravening was the last shot fired of the year and it was total loss to the enemy but week or so ago why peter down in australia was taking care of the situation and there was supposed to have been public debate with members of the opposition snarling ravening hydrophobic froth you know peering around their fangs and these blokes were supposed to have appeared before television program and for debate on the subject of scientology and peter got down to the station and there was nobody else there and they didnt show up and probably died by biting themselves probably or something like that laughter but they didnt show up and this left peter sitting in front of battery of television cameras and lights you see with nobody to debate with so very brilliantly they decided that the public should phone him and ask him questions about scientology so he sat there for half an hour with the phone in his hand answering the phone answering everybodys questions on the subject of scientology and the station liked it and the public liked it and they got lots of phone calls and traffic and so forth and we dont quite know what happened to the opposition but they havent really appeared since not only didnt appear there but then theyre going to have big hearing of some kind or another and hes got shot in the locker that is something like dropping cannonball on an ant hes sitting there wellarmed and the fda and so on this ceased to be serious two or three months ago therell be still be some uproar and upset but sooner or later theyre going to have to run up their dirty white handkerchief too but everybody is very optimistic about this now and our attorneys and so forth are all optimistic about it over in the states all you have to do is just keep winning see just keep winning you dont have to win very ferociously on the legal line but just keep winning and the only thing we can really hope for in 1964 that all attacks on scientology are senselessly brought they bring type of charge that they cant possibly win on and if our luck just holds consistently they will continue to do this you see like suing mary sue and myself because we dont have any children and because we havent been in england and are not in england i think those were the charges on which they were suing but if they will just go ahead and continue this line of idiocy why we will continue to win with the greatest of ease i hope we dont have to work any harder than we have had to work in 63 in order to keep on winning but weve actually today with the disappearance of this old year got it pretty well in the bag and of course i look forward to tremendous amount of very hard work in codification of materials and laying them out for instance you havent got textbook for scientology 0 you havent got textbook for scientology i you havent got textbook for scientology ii i beg your pardon you almost have one i wrote one years ago student manual and its been sitting there waiting to be published and so on and it exactly matches the levels of scientology ii so we may have that textbook long ahead of any other textbook just because it was written i think back in 58 when all the material was still there and fresh but then theres scientology iii and that hasnt been codified and scientology iv and that hasnt been codified and scientology v and we got lots of bulletins on that thats actually better and lots of tapes thats better done than lot of other levels and then scientology vi and its just now in state where your instructors are wrestling at it see so the essence of the future is the compilation of existing materials and getting it out in very ready fashion in order to get it assimilated easily this new method of dissemination i think youll find it very very effective and the only thing i know that might modify this method of dissemination is that an upperscale auditor will have certain processes which he can run on lowerlevel or class person do you see what i mean so that if youre class iv you have certain small bag of medicine man tricks which you can trot out on i or ii or iii dont you see which produces some interesting magic and which they themselves at level i you see would not be able to audit yet they can receive that level of action there are several of these and amongst them is this case analysis of which you have recent bulletin edgar pulled some off on brandnew rawmeat fellow and he hardly knew what happened by the way that fellows cough is still off and those were simply it was simply thirtyfive minute application of the basic fundamentals of case analysis adapted with instruction or understanding on the part of the person receiving it and it turned off what was apparently incipient tuberculosis and so on well you take technology of that particular type and so forth that would be used by higherlevel auditor on lowerlevel pc so small little bag of tricks like this ill manage to collect up and get together and there are several of these techniques and then probably one more thing theres probably in 1963 we probably bent the old idea of you shouldnt heal and so forth we probably bent that one very badly and the ama has been getting in our coiffure they are very decent fellows as far as their membership is concerned but i think that they themselves at the ama headquarters are due in for horrible shock because give us couple three more wins of the type weve been getting and give us nice suit against the ama something like this give us few little more wins and we will open the door wide open on the subject of psychosomatic healing and that will be the end man as far as theyre concerned because we can then enforce an ethical policy dont you see that if you cannot if you do not get results on the patient you must refund his money and we can put this out on heavy propaganda line and of course that will finish any ineffective healing activity there is the only person who can do this of course is the person who has very effective healing activities thats whats known as in bridge as leading from strength we have several of these things now we have several of these things now which are quite quite miraculous and anybody running anybody running at level vi goes through every time his auditor makes bust he goes through more illnesses and more types of psychosomatics and so on that could be easily counted all his auditor has got to do is get couple of goals in juxtaposition and the start running down the line of misworded goal and you immediately have thrombosis articularosis of the lumbar immediately and you can turn on more ills and turn off more ills than you can shake stick at to such an extent that i have now become very contemptuous of the whole subject i mean i see these guys floundering around i understand whats wrong with them im not contemptuous of them but i mean the idea of the ills of the human body and so forth you get couple of ris in crosswise and man youve never seen any ills like they can be caught its rather horrifying from an auditors standpoint to look at these fellows and see what this well look what is this fellows coronary see some other bloke he has bizarre pain in the sacroiliac of some kind or another what is this and so forth and everybody rooting around trying to find the right chemical you know the correct chemical in order to squirt into them or the proper torsion table on which to stretch them or some of this sort of stuff and once you get accustomed to what exists on the whole track its just little bit frustrating because of the complexity of upperlevel technologies that you simply cant say to this fellow what would solve this whats the ri what goal does it belong to what is out of shape here on the particular lineup you know you see this girl shes crying her eyes red and streaming going down to the divorce court you see because her husband is brute and so on and the children home staring emptily into space mama and daddy are you know and chaos reigning in all particular directions and so on examine the situation and of course it just youll find that shes had consistent present time problem with the ri you see bad men or something like this the amount of the amount of difficulty thats caused by the misalignment of the psyche is fascinating in its tremendous complexity and disillusioning in the simplicity of its cause and you think of how few items can make so many complex troubles and there it is but of course i suppose that well make advance in that particular direction but the ardures of level vi technology and the ardures of running the stuff you see weve been at this now for about trying to run these things for about three years and every time wed make decent breakthrough on the thing and so on why wed come up against small nicety you see that has to be observed in order to prevent this and that technology itself has finally worked itself into pretty confoundedly complex piece of technology really requires auditing it requires an educated pc but of course the end product of this for gods sakes is ot that you cant sniff at any goal we ever have had in the past went glimmering some time about 62 it started to go glimmering and it sure went glimmering in 63 i mean the goal for the individual on an assured basis of what he could attain if he simply kept plugging at it and going forward and was well trained in it and so on shot up factually as realizable fact to some point which is well its just so far out of order of magnitude of what anybody expected before that its probably quite unreal to most people and it certainly every now and then gets unreal to i get caught between couple of gpms or something like this and we dont find the goal on the list or something of that sort and we say there we are there we are and were all set now except for this creak and i take look at somebody auditing this and recognize the tremendous skill which both the auditor and the pc have to have because even when they have that tremendous skill and even when they know all the answers they make enough mistakes to keep them very busy but the end product of its fantastic i got very great reality on the amount of gain which was attainable because for some months weve kept looking for the pt gpm on see weve been running gpms but every time we get the track beautifully unburdened we find out theres more pt gpm see i mean its closer to pt gpm i think youll find out this is quite ordinary see you find out that the truncated gpm you ran actually had top see well if it had top then theres probably one on top of it theres probably one closer to present time well if theres one closer to present time it probably has top too and theres probably one closer to present time than that were now seven gpms from the one we thought was the pt gpm seven and just few months ago just few months ago in running gpms that is listing for goals and trying to line up present time gpm see ive been running gpms and so on when they run they run because you can usually start in if youve got the right top oppterm and so forth all it does is leave little residual charge you know where it went on the track youve got it plotted out because youve got the goal below it dont you see and you take that chunk out of the track well it unburdens you see the case tremendously and your perception and ability to handle them increases and great reality i connected with subjectively last night was how much case advance id made in just about three months because about three months ago boy we were trying to list on goal oppose basis up from an indeterminate base trying to get closer gpm to pt and i was being wrapped around telegraph poles it was grim i dont mean telling mind telling you it was real grim of course on my track ive done all the research that youre getting the benefit of and its shot full of holes you know and things have been misaligned and so on and things have been improperly run for instance ive got lot of gpms that have been run with oppose well thats unburdened them and taken charge off of them but its still left tremendous numbers of bypassed items you see in the area well last night we were working at it i was handing up goals lists amounting to five or six goals with the rocket reading goal on it stacking it up putting the gpm on top of it you see you know there it is all right the next one listing in to the top oppterms to see if it was there see if you could get anything to read like top oppterm on the gpm in order to find out if there was gpm closer to present time and we handled four of them like they were just old sacks of straw see you get into it when you finally attack that particular hill and you think of the idea of just casually listing into the top of gpm to find out if theres an item thats going to read there see will actually practically part your hair in the middle with horror because it just about rips you to pieces you know it turns on creaks and bypassed charge and howling arc breaks and so on were sitting there i just stacked up four gpms on up to pt got the truncated gpm and say well it cuts off right there and for the first time could look forward into the future you see and there was nothing nothing where did it all go you know just like it had been sawed off with band saw you know and we had stacked up four of them bypassing all the items listing into the tops of each one chopping them all to ribbons and so forth i didnt turn hair not even quiver i got up this morning and i wondered well i wonder if couple of those are backwards you know and i went creak and i said well theyre not backwards lets see what are my considerations on this little bit of selfauditing laughter and i said well my considerations on this there were couple of them backwards creak oh thats far cry man thats far cry from three months ago ah i got big subjective reality on it tremendous subjective reality an awful far cry from last spring man we couldnt tell whether it was an implant or splant of course we didnt even know if there were was such thing as an implant gpm last spring you couldnt tell what was which and who was where and so on i think i turned out last spring some of the most remarkable line plots i think that will ever be seen maybe you can do better when youre learning but that was pretty good because they have didnt even know didnt even know implants existed you see so you get things like being active you see solving somebody or something with the goal to be active implant ri sitting alongside of an actual gpm ri boy that must have made plenty of creak man take the middle of gpm an actual gpm with great big sixtyfivefoot by twentyfeet by ten foot mass pull it down into the helatrobus implant area and pin it up against one of their parking meters see laughter wild absolutely wild incredible survived it i will say i sometimes felt lethargic my weight built up very very badly and is falling off now at tremendous rate i mean about four or five the last four or five days ive lost about twelve pounds because these things are what give you weight see they give you residual body mass you see you never created them ordinarily your early ones particularly you didnt make these things when you were in the body and you made them footloose and fancy free and running them while youre in body of course is not the way most of them were made and its little bit hard on the body and the bodys in the road of the ris and is expressing and experiencing all the heat and other duress that occurs and every time you make mistake the duress is tremendous and the body goes creak crack blump thud you know and you take quite beating in this particular direction if youre doing an incorrect job of the thing sixtythree was the year i had to do all the research work ive sacrificed everything now the other day the other day not too long ago i was outside taking look at the dawn and it was great relief the van allen belt is nice and warm and you can sit in the van allen belt amongst the radiation thats supposed to be so harmful its nice that its there it holds in the warm air you know and you can put out your beams and warm your hands and rain clouds rain clouds are absolutely beautiful there theyre almost as good as drink of cocacola laughter and my you can get into the ice crystals of rain cloud and its very nice its very nice its cooling refreshing you know like taking cold shower on hot summer day and all of sudden youre not stricken by these fantastic temperature reactions see youre in body you see you get temperature difference of ten degrees up or ten degrees down and youre kind of miserable you know and outside you get temperature differential of two hundred degrees centigrade up and two hundred degrees centigrade down it makes nice change slight variation slight difference of aspect but i do have one problem and i end this year with problem and its tough problem i dont know if ill be able to solve it or not but as an ot how do you drink cocacola laughter this is this is operating as problem with and ive been trying to solve this in various practical ways and so forth im far too big to get into cocacola bottle you see when you really go bad as thetan and become drunkard laughter what you do is you take few drops of liquor and you drip them on the barroom table you see and let it evaporate see in your face youre wearing doll body or something like this you know you let it evaporate you know into your face like brandy sniffing and you can get drunker than skunk it all depends on the degree of volatility of the liquor you happen to be dedicated to but alcohol works pretty good in this and you know cocacola doesnt evaporate see you can pour it on the table and it doesnt evaporate it just gets sticky and so i i dont know i i thought in my various offices in various continents and that sort of thing we could get small tub and empty few bottles of cocacola you see in the tub and dump some ice trays in you know and you could get in you could get in laughter maybe that would be better so forth yeah thats operating as problem thats the biggest present time problem i have so thats fairly good one to be ending the year on and its worrisome though well we have quite bit quite bit that ground weve covered gains weve made and that sort of thing and were in actual fact were the gainers tremendously and all out of proportion the gainers in 63 we actually never really thought we could fly so high so smoothly the only real drawback is the fact that the technology that takes it to the highest level is complex technology but im working hard on it so that its fairly smoothly rounded and can be learned rather easily as i think the instructors who are im briefing at this particular time will tell you its fairly well rounded up not much doubt about you making it of course youre sitting there now you wonder if youll ever make it all the way and i can tell you that if you are or have wondered if youre ever going to make it all the way while you are making it all the way you will have many other periods when youll be absolutely certain that you will never make it all the way thats the greatest certainty i can give you you have just been dropped in the middle of wrong goal at the end of an intensive that is halfrun and the right goal cant be found and for week or two youll be very sure that you will never make it all the way but the nice part of it is you can pick yourself out of these things and you do go on and just the action of getting tone arm action actually restores your hope in the matter and you can keep on going the finite end product results i was joking with suzie about it this morning and i said maybe were going to do totality of ot on gross basis just handling and messing up gpms you see and handling more gpms and finally well get so accustomed to handling gpms and the familiarity will be so great well never have to run any of the items at all because at this stage i think to some slight degree i think two thirds at least of all the gpms which i have have either been partially run or placed on the track and discharged to some slight degree this is not necessarily good dont you see because they have been put into considerable restimulation and youre in the middle of the tenth or twelfth gpm from present time in the goal as an ri and you pack this with you as you come back up you see to straighten out the pt gpm you feel little jammy but nevertheless nevertheless i hope that ive been over the jumps on this stuff very hard and very harshly theres doubt in my mind its just matter of time now lets get it run out and ive been felt horrible and ive felt this way and ive known many times that it was impossible to make it ive also known that it would be impossible for you to make it ive known all kinds of pessimistic and very very sour ideas on how tough it was and that sort of thing and ive managed to recover from each one of these so lets hope you do too the final end product of scientology or thetan in this universe has been achieved in 1963 so whatever else can be said for the year at least we can give it that okay audience mmmm yes all right well i just wanted to talk to you about it little bit and get it off my chest and talk it over with you this is what audience thirtyfirst december thirtyfirst of december the last year all right of 1963 saint hill special briefing course all right im going to give you very brief lecture on the subject of indicators as they apply to lower levels this is brandnew subject and the instructors know all about it theyve gotten the lot and i didnt bring my notes the whole subject of indicators is new one and when you learn something at astronomic stratospheric level such as routine 6 and level vi material it of course can turn around and go down into the lower levels and this is exactly what has happened with indicators routine 6 cannot be run without indicators an individual this is not lecture on routine 6 this is lecture on lower levels routine 6 auditors must know their indicators bang they must know the indicator and what to do bang all auditing time is lost if it is lost by failure to know recognize and do the proper action indicated by an indicator you could lose 90 percent of your auditing time at routine 6 if you didnt know the indicators thats how serious it is you probably if you didnt know the indicators at all you would never make an ot at all all right so much for that level indicators are present at every level you have indicators at 0 i ii iii iv youve got them all and v youve got these indicators are present at every single one of those levels indicators are divided into two classes good indicators and bad indicators accuse of involved technology if you wish but i dont think you can get much simpler than that theres good indicators and bad indicators the first thing you must know about indicators is that if an auditor doesnt know the good indicators he does not then know what the bad indicator is occurring into now lets go over this little bit slowly somebody comes along and he tells you that you must not cut the pcs itsa all right so you dont cut the pcs itsa because of an instructor or you dont cut the pcs itsa because youve read it in bulletin or you dont cut the pcs itsa because youll get an infraction sheet you get the idea well why dont you cut the pcs itsa well you dont know the good indicator see cut itsa gives you the bad indicator of dirty needle and an arc breaky or gloomy or notrunningproperly pc those are all bad indicators well whats the good indicator whats the good indicator obviously the good indicator is smooth needle and cheerful pc i mean its elementary as that and thats why you dont cut the pcs itsa see because you want cheerful pc and smooth needle you follow it you dont it isnt that you dont cut the pcs itsa because it says so in bulletin or because the instructor will be mad at you its because the good indicator would not be present and bad indicator would appear lets follow this now i have many times had this gruesome experience ive given an auditing demonstration and had lot of people sit there and learn absolutely nothing from it except that was how auditing should maybe look when i did it it didnt look anything like that when they did it so that was just my peculiarities of auditing or anyone with my altitude of course with regard to an auditing session could not fail to have good pc and have the session look good you follow what im trying to tell you in other words the people sitting there watching the session did not know the good indicators because i assure you that i learn every time i turn around at routine 6 level and so forth i can have arc breaky pcs that arc break much harder than your pcs the level of course gives you greater stress on the case and when you get routine 6 arc break man you get nice juicy squeezy arc break it splatters all over the ceiling its big its cecil b mille production its not only little well you offended you know blanketyblank blankblank powpow and it sounds like that record i gave reg for christmas of the overture of 1812 with the actual cannon shots in it you know and i gave it to him with malice i want to see if his new hifi set would stand up it not only stood up to it it stood up to it very gorgeously but it almost the cannon going off sounded so real unexpectedly that it almost blew jack horners head off laughter now looking at something like that we know what were looking at what should music sound like see well it should be intelligible and you should tell whats being played and what is playing it and it should sound real as though its in the room youve got various good indicators but now let give you an index about music and you will see something here very very good electronics chap told this and this is very good test for is hifi equipment hifi equipment and can you really are you really dealing with good recording and things of that particular character is it good microphone this type of test is very simple and this is what i would mean by good indicator see this bad indicator you say well the hifi equipment sounds corny and you read up what does what is bad hifi equipment you see well it sounds dissonant it sounds this and that you get woof and wow and you get this and that and you get an imbalanced decibelization of the lower condenser areas you see and the tweeter tweeter very poor its not matched has different impedance didnt tell you confounded thing you see and yet those are all apparently bad indicators and so forth that you have well the question is is do these things mean anything unless they are compared to the comparative datum now you know in the logics it says for datum to be understood and so forth it has to have comparative datum so you have to have good indicator newspapers by the way are playing this on you all the time theyre saying how bad everything is how bad everything is how bad everything is i dont know they dont tell you how things should be good they shouldnt necessarily tell you how good everything is but nobody says how things should be good yet theyre apparently always working against an ideal standard there must be wrecks there must be fires there must be be be you see on and on and on and apparently theyre working against the standard which is some kind of good standard but they never tell you what this good standard is so of course its just all bad bad bad well lets get back to hifi equipment you could say the woofers are not woofing and the tweeters are not tweeting and the wow is disgraceful and you can say lot of things about this hifi equipment dont you see but how should it sound all right theres how it shouldnt sound well how should it sound thats the important one how should it sound and this old electronics whizzeroo told he says now he says its like this you walk into the lobby of the theater when the aisle doors are closed and you listen to an orchestra playing in the theater all right he says thats poor hifi equipment see now he says you open the doors and walk down the aisle to about the center of the theater and listen he said and thats good hifi equipment and you know you can tune set with it you tune set up until it sounds like the musicians are in the room and you can keep balancing things until you move the musicians into the room and oddly enough you can take well set up panel like regs new hifi has down there and you actually can move them into the theater beyond the lobby doors and move them right back into the room with you see you can move them out and distant and away and in tuning up piece of equipment therefore how should piece of equipment sound the good indicator it sounds like the musician is playing in the room with you well its almost indefinable dont you see i mean theres decibels or woofs or wows or any other descriptions in this thing so actually anybody then can figure out what was good hifi equipment is it capable of putting clarinet in the room so it sounds like the clarinetist is standing in the room with you playing the clarinet or does it sound like hes back in the bedroom playing the clarinet dont you see thats all you have to know about it all right you take it on that basis now we can go woofs whatters and flops and you put the condensers through into the ruddy rods and so forth well all that is doing is monitoring the reality or present or nearness or clarity of the sound so if youre going to teach anybody to do anything i have just learned this principle very recently not the hifi but learned this on teaching scientology ive had barrier to overcome this is problem i was trying to overcome and that is that ive had many people listen to or watch an auditing session and not know what the devil they were looking at i know this for this good reason that i get their comments afterwards written down and its some of the wildest piece of commenting i ever heard in my life they dont they havent grasped what occurred in the session and you turn in bunch of criticism of your own sessions as taped and so forth which demonstrated rather conclusively to that you needed tool with which to appreciate what session was all about what was session what should it sound like and i finally worked this out on good indicators and bad indicators and thats direct result of it and if you dont know the good indicators of course you cant ever tell what the bad indicator is so what should session sound like and one of the first things that an auditor should make it his business to know is the points which should be present in properly running session not whats wrong with the session but whats right with right session whats right with this session now knowing whats right with the session he of course can then tell whats wrong with the session but if you dont know whats right with the session you can never tell whats wrong with the session and that is the way i have licked this problem i trust this will be successful and will improve auditing here and there and everywhere in other words heavy concentration on teaching auditors what are the good indicators of session what are the good indicators of session theyre bong and bong and bong and bong and bong and if these things are not present then bad indicator must be present well whats the bad indicator thats present that cancels the good indicator so i give you that dont cut the pcs itsa why not cut the pcs itsa well youre going to get dirty needle well all right thats interesting as statement but it already assumes you see that this particular auditor knows that he ought to have smooth needle in the session see its as elementary as that but it makes that assumption and thats an unjustified assumption because maybe he doesnt know that and the good indicator is the pc should be cheerfully itsaing away all right pc is sitting there cheerfully going on and happily carrying on and cogniting on things and so forth well thats the way pc ought to operate well all right you say well if you cut the pcs itsa you make the pc unhappy well this assumes that the fellow knows that pc ought to be happy in session and maybe people dont know that at all psychoanalyst doesnt know that other practitioner ever knew that so this is unjustified how does pc look in session when they are running properly well they ought to be taking their case seriously somebody will say you see they ought to be really concerned about all the wicked things they have done in life you know they ought to be ought to be ought to be ought to be ought to be and you get seven thousand different varieties of how the pc should look in the session all matching the ris of the auditor whats the good indicator pc cheerfully itsaing well you say cheerfully itsaing why what the hell you mean this guys going to run through some you mean this guys going to get better sitting there cheerfully talking hoho yeah hes not going to get better any other way man because the only frame of mind that you can asis in is cheerful hightoned frame of mind and thats the hightoned frame of mind people asis in now were talking about if we run secondary of course wed expect somebody to cry through the secondary or fear or something like that we dont happen to be running secondaries these days and you can expect this to occur early on in session that or early on in process that the pcs looking sort of gloomy and hes looking this way and hes looking that way and so forth but only early on when youre handling the thing he is gloomy about youre bringing him out of the gloom and the good indicator is that the gloom is decreasing or the tears are decreasing you see and that he is moving forward toward the good indicator the pcs moving straight ahead toward the good indicator and should arrive there fairly rapidly you dont want somebody weeping for seventy five hours its all right for pc to weep ive seen pcs running secondary weep dozen years off their apparent age theres nothing wrong with this but thats running of course secondary now the truth of the matter is as the pc rapidly moves on forward how long should the pc be weeping well how long should the pc be weeping whats the good indicator well the good indicator is that it fades away and the pc gets very cheerful with suppression of the weeping at all thats the good indicator and the bad indicator would be he went on crying for seventyfive hours of auditing and you would say theres something awful wrong here man so you get good indicator heres the pc cheerfully looking at his life and gets interested talking to the auditor these are good indicators you see tone arm riding at an acceptable range on the meter you see with so much motion these are the good indicators you know you can stack these up im not trying to give you list of them at this particular time im trying to show you what they are and we get this picture of what an auditing session is out of the good indicators that should be present in the auditing session and if these good indicators are not present then bad indicators must be present and if bad indicators are present then certain actions must be taken by the auditor now certain actions must be taken by the auditor to continue the good indicators in existence those are the routine actions of auditing those are what youre taught as the trs and so on you just go on doing these things and youre not cutting the pcs itsa so long as the session is running all right but when bad indicator shows up one or more good indicators tend to go away and the bad indicator indicates another course of action must be taken by the auditor bad indicator inevitably and always means that the auditor must now do something good indicators mean that the auditor must continue what he is doing and bad indicators indicate the auditor must do something else thats the general picture but actually for any given process the bad indicators give you precise and immediate thing to do this requires more listing and more workout but you can admit this is pretty clever see pc somethingorother and somethingorother well youre doing soandso ill give you gross one right now pc makes critical remark of the auditor makes critical remark about the auditor all right now at one of your saint hill levels of course that means you do session arc break assessment at lower level why run some ow or pardon at very low level youd run some ow at intermediate level just pull the missed withhold or find out what the persons done see but there is the action pursuant to the bad indicator bad indicator you see the bad indicator doesnt mean theres anything wrong with the auditor the bad indicator simply means something has gone wrong with the proper form and action of the session somethings gone wrong here so it is now up to the auditor seeing this bad indicator to do something about it now theres several things that you can overdo these bad indicators and you can get ahead and get all plowed up and messed up and do nothing but remedy bad indicators remedy bad indicators remedy bad indicators and of course whats the matter with this session well none of the good indicators will be present so if you dont know what good indicators are and dont know that you should continue what is bringing about these good indicators if you dont know what good indicators are then you wont know what to continue do you see how should this pc look how should this pc sound how should this meter react how should this bank be responding now those all have good indicators in connection with them now heres good indicator if you dont know this good indicator then the bad indicator makes sense at all lets give you the bad indicator and show you how it drops you into the soup tone arm was high tone arm on this pc was running consistently high well whats whats consistently not high see you have to ask that question see what how should tone arm operate if tone arm shouldnt be moving between 45 and 55 then where should it be operating well tone arm oper out of the broad range of optimum action of tone arm is from 20 to 40 thats the broad range common range is about 275 to 35 thats very nice range very nice operating range if youre really hotter than pistol at level vi youll get the pc operating between about 225 because now youre operating thetan and male and female have nothing to do with it level vi it starts in about level v that you cease to lose the male and female significance of your meter and at level vi youve for sure lost it and pc starts plowing along there and the pcs running between 25 and 3025 let us say and 325 optimum running range pcs running in that range man youve got it made nothings wrong you havent missed any items it tells you so on and so on it just gives you avalanche of information just seeing the tone arm moving where it ought to be moving now the tone arm is now moving between 275 and 375 well it still theres little something awry but were not going to bother with it its light indicator dont you see its too light to fuss with but weve got something crossed up somewhere on the track and were not enough sure at this particular time what it is but the tone arm is running and running like mad between 275 and 375 and you see its just its all right you dont do anything about it just that little bit high just that little bit high somethings been missed somewhere well of course the time to use bad indicator is when you cant go on with the good indicators just because bad indicator leaps up into view at very light level of bad indicator is reason you knock it all apart if the session is still full of good indicators you understand so the pcs talking cheerfully everything is going along fine youre finding items everything is going along beautifully and so on and so on and so on and your tone arm is running now between 325 and 40 but it is running between 325 and 40 and i do mean its running the pc is getting heat on the items the pc is so on all the good indicators are present you see theyre all there theyre all there theyre all there well eventually you get down to the bottom of some bank or another and you find out that youve skipped gpm back there and its just coming into view hehheh and all of sudden your tone arm starts to run up now around 475 to 525 well this is definitely in the road of the session you cant operate this way you cant operate at all so you now have got to do something about it and you very nicely put it all together and do the right thing and go on with your action this just gives you an idea of good indicator and bad indicator so there are three grades of indicators there are two kinds of indicators and there are three grades of indicators just thought youd like it nice and neat there are light indicators medium indicators and heavy indicators the two grades of indicators i mean the three grades of indicators are simply the suddenness with which you have to take action on medium indicator action must be taken and action must be taken as soon as you can comfortably get to it and on heavy indicator emergency crash action must be taken right now and the light indicator is normally plotted so as to show you that something is wrong you know something is wrong so that you can be alert to find out what it is without actually interrupting the session of the pc the purpose of the light indicator is just to show you that somebody is moving over close to the edge and they may move back onto the main road without you doing single thing about it but theyre over close to the edge and the auditor had better be alert he doesnt want that moment when he hears the rending of wheels on the abutment and the crash of the car as it goes over the cliff and the long dwindling scream thats grade four and he never should get up to grade four indicator he never should get up to grade four indicator which means slightest possibility of any more auditing of this pc ever we dont even put that in as an indicator because it would certainly indicate something because we already have at grade three pc not wanting auditing thats an indicator thats bad indicator now this of course automatically assumes that pc should want auditing as one of the good indicators see so you got pc and theres the pc whats the good indicator and by good indicator we mean normal or reasonable not extraordinary or bonus indicator this is what we expect you see you expect to sit down to table and eat off plate see i mean thats the level of expectancy you see i mean there it is you know youre not going to eat off the floor off dogs dish you know at least not on this planet at this particular time now youve got then whats the expectancy well the expectancy is if youve got an indicator like bad indicator pc not wanting auditing you must realize that there must be such thing as good indicator which is pc want auditing good you see doesnt mean superlative or bonus see it just means thats expected normal indicator see its just normal pc wants auditing pc wants auditing thats normal well i can tell you how far out indicators are on an awful lot of pcs see wheres my session wheres my session oh yeah when are we going to have my session all right fine thats good good not anxious to have session but he wants his session then he sits down and so forth you dont have to go out whistle and dig and beat up the brush you see or anything of the sort theres the pc you know the clock has wound up to certain period of time and there is the pc and perhaps getting little cross with you for being few minutes late for your session or something like that see its all an indicator that he wants his session not anything you do anything about its almost good indicator that he is little bit hmmm you werent here and so on we lost five minutes of my auditing time werent on time didnt start the session on time you wouldnt attach anything to that as an indicator see its not really bad indicator it frankly is good indicator pc wants his auditing you see how this gives you different frame of reference normal good indicator the pc wants his auditing that thats it well if he doesnt want his auditing thats bad indicator thats real real bad indicator thats grade three bad indicator so it tells you that all of your devotion to session and so forth must be on that indicator pc doesnt want his auditing well you better not do anything but handle that indicator you can take it up eight dozen ways from the middle and youre going to eventually collide with the reason why and its always going to surprise you itll be some elementary simple thing you should have thought of all the time except its very complex and the pc never would have noticed it but the point im making here is the good indicator is pc wants his session now our arc break with governments and that sort of thing is probably because were not auditing them we must remember that harry truman going along pertly and so forth god help us i certainly would have been much happier to have educated that bloke that did his auditing but man he was being sweated over on engrams god knows how long he practically cleared that man every piece of information that came out was immediately snaffled up by the white house psychiatrist there are even rumors floating about that they were spending time you see the president was getting psychotherapy of some kind mysterious kind of well we ought to know what he was getting because we were we would have been much happier to have given this guy some information instead of him culling it out of bulletins and and he never even had any tapes dont you see or anything like that all he had was book one book one and whatever other bulletins and correlative information was issued well thats rather interesting truman apparently wanted his auditing well possibly the rest of the government wants auditing and probably lots of people in the world want auditing and we probably arc break them by not auditing them they will ask for auditing in numerous ways including try to blackmail you and so on the truth of the matter is though that wanting auditing is far more common as an indicator than you would suspect and of course it is the expected good indicator when it is absent the pc says well i dont know if i want to be audited i dont know rarh rarh rahr hes being late for his sessions and hes hard to dig up and so forth man youre dealing with grade three indicator i mean thats bad indicator whats expectancy all right whats you could im just giving you brief glimpse here the needle and meter should look certain way the pc should look and sound certain way the pcs attributes should be soandso and soandso now oddly enough it is grade two bad indicator that pc has present time problem thats grade two it isnt to be considered in the line of absolute crashing emergency because at certain periods of the session the pc will develop little ptp which you eventually care for and so forth just with what youre doing grade three indicator means immediately emergency action but this is something you attend to and something you attend to right now why well the pc makes case progress of any kind whatsoever in the presence of present time problem how do you like that present time problem case progress it just equates that way thats it theres modification on that statement this is borne out over the years man this is really borne out over long periods of time that pc with an arc break gets worse graph his graph worsens if hes audited in the presence of an arc break see in other words theres an arc break has occurred the arc break isnt remedied then you can reduce the pcs graph thats the only thing that will worsen the case is auditing pc over and beyond and ignoring the arc break thats the only thing that will worsen the case and the only thing that will make the case not progress not onequarter of an inch you couldnt put building jack under the case and have the case advance pc with present time problem that graph is going to remain the same present time problem plus an arc break god knows what happens to the graph but weve got this you see so we say well the pc shouldnt have present time problem and so forth you must always audit the present time problem and this is something that you have to take care of and etc and etc and etc and etc this is all very interesting but wheres the good indicator obviously the good indicator is the pc in an auditing session should have present time problems well then obviously your pc couldnt be in session if he had present if hed always had present time problem while being audited then nobody had ever worked forward to getting the pc into session because the good indicator of present time problem has never emerged on this case so if present time problem good indicator has never emerged on the case then we can obviously say the case has never been insession that is quite remarkable when we put these good indicators up in the framework that they deserve to be in you see immediately they start to show you an awful lot of bright bright look here see well you could check pc out on good indicators you see well now this is particularly important to you because youre actually going to supervise as much or more auditing than you will do youre going to supervise an awful lot of auditing and i mean you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you all of you youre going to supervise auditing thats for sure youre going to supervise it lot of these new level programs dont think otherwise any auditor becomes an auditing supervisor so much so that the hat auditor is practically synonymous with the hat auditing supervisor see but auditing supervision how are you going to do auditing supervision unless you know how session looks man what are you going to do what is this thing called session we have descriptive material that covers it whatsoever can you walk down an aisle and look at bing and say is that good session going on well is it good session or isnt it good session well you could say it isnt good session because certain bad indicators were present pcs cans have been on the floor for the last half an hour dont you see and the pc is facing the other direction looking out the window and the auditor is humming laughter now thats auditing supervision by bad indicator and if you only supervised by bad indicator now listen carefully if you only supervise by bad indicator you will never get any auditing done if it does occur itll occur by accident you cannot auditing supervise by bad indicator you can only auditing supervise by good indicator because when the good indicators cease to exist your action then must be in the direction of recreating them but if theres nothing toward which youre recreating of course you cant make anything there anyhow lets say all right lets say weve got fifteen bad indicators present in the session lets just be outrageous you see we got fifteen bad indicators present so very brightly and smartly you eradicate two bad indicators hah you still got thirteen you havent yet got session going there so you must learn your good indicators and you must learn to do session supervision by good indicators in other words you can tell everything is running all fine and everything is going ahead and you actually could fix your level of expectancy of how much gain these cases are going to make just on the number of good indicators present you can look down the aisle and see that so on and so on just glance down the meters and the needles are clean and the tone arms are running in the expected course and there is tone arm action going on the pcs are talking cheerfully about their own case and the auditors are listening to them and so forth and its all these good indicators you see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten good indicators all present so forth well you know now that group of pcs theres going to be an awful lot of psychosomatic difficulties going to disappear and their difficulties in life and livingness are going to go by the boards and their lumbosis is going to diminish and you can just be comfortable man comfortable theres nothing spectacular going on in the whole length of the room see but all the good indicators are present in those sessions you could just sit back and relax put your feet on the desk man and you just say ah well that all those things are going to happen and everybodys going to be happier and better and theyre all going to be cheerful and everythings going to be fine see because thats what it ought to look like now if it doesnt look like that then some bad indicators are present and for every one of these actions that are going on which arent going on properly there is major bad indicator present all you have to do is establish whats present pow pow pow pow pow pow pow and give an immediate auditing response to remedy that one your good indicators will pick up little bit make sure there are other bad indicators present get these things out of the road weed them out and youve restored the session then back to all good indicators and it goes on swinging thats how to auditing supervise now therefore and let impart this to you before you really get swinging on the subject of auditing supervision you should know good indicators just brrrrrrrr what im trying to tell you is you should know good indicators more by heart than bad indicators because if you find out that theres bad indicator present in the session believe you can always go to the textbook and try to figure out some more about it oh because i myself sometimes in undoing case will have fantastic comm lag oh that oh haha bhhuuu you know that kind of particular response after all youve been walking around the edges of this case for some little time and you knew there was bad indicator here you see you knew there was bad indicator but there could have been four or five responses to this bad indicator you could have done four or five things in order to make this bad indicator right itself you just didnt quite have the tail of the piece of string you couldnt quite pull this the right raveling and so forth well all right well thats undoing cases thats straightening up an individual case and all cases arent like that thank heavens and so on you finally realize oh the pcs goals are directly the pc is with pt problem weve run pt problems on this pc for some little time in order to straighten up pt why is it this pc always has pt problems oh so and so on and so on and so on and so on well its these pt problems all the time we keep straightening out pt problems pt problems they never straighten up on this pc oh oh well ron said one time or another if pc continues to have present time problems and always seems to have difficulty and you never can seem to clean up the present time problems then the pcs goals must be completely different than the auditors goals and the session must be total disagreement and it must be that the session itself is the pt problem pcs goals completely divergent from the auditors goals auditor trying to make pc survive pc trying to succumb auditor trying to make pc well pc sitting there trying to make husband guilty you get the idea must be divergence of goals here must be wildly divergent set of goals between what the auditors trying to do and what the pcs trying to do so we will remedy it now from that direction we will get heartto heart talk on this particular subject and all of sudden youll see that case unwind of course the bad indicator isnt present on the next case pc doesnt even have present time problem hes just sitting there talking happily so you say well i had such remarkable success with lisa jane in finding out divergence of goals between the so on and so on you see the bad indicator isnt present in this but you apply the remedy of the bad indicator and the case suddenly starts picking up whole bunch of bad indicators and you wonder whats going on here well you remedied case that was running in other words youve corrected the nonecessitytocorrect need to correct it and youre correcting it you get the difference between good indicators and bad indicators the auditor will ride hobbyhorse every once in while you always you always tend to ride hobbyhorse you have big win see wins ruin auditors man its tremendous crashing win you know and you found out that mrs snodgrass was putting rat poison in her husbands breakfast cereal because she actually had something or other about children so you get children straightened out on your next two or three pcs and then you find out that none of them straightened out on the subject of children see in other words you are remedying you are remedying nonexistent bad indicator so there are several things that you can do and err in but theyre all very good sense and the only thing i want to communicate to you is learn what an auditing session should look like and when i give you your list of good indicators for an auditing session snaffle on to it and when youre training people to audit hit them over the head with it you know these are the good indicators for session the good indicators see good indicators are more important than the bad indicators because auditing only happens in the presence of the good indicators bad indicators are used simply to reassume the good indicators therefore you must know your good indicators now when you get to be screaming genius and an auditing supervisor like you can say to this person like i am when you really get sharp as i am you see well trained then you can pick up the bad indicators and straighten them out but that requires genius just for now you go on with your good indicators and make sure that they continue in the session cultivate them you get this level of approach of course im giving you joke along with it i can see you now in desperation trying to keep cases from being corrected that dont need correction and trying to get cases corrected that desperately need correction but the person is sitting there the pc is dumped over bent sideways from the trunk you know and you didnt see how this could happen the person seems to be out boiling off knocked in the head every single session never can be really persuaded to come to the session in the first place and youre trying to convince this auditor you know theres some bad indicators present in this thing and you you really havent got the good indicators of session because session doesnt look like that oh doesnt look like that oh the pc is leaned over to the left you wait you wait one of the things thats very disappointing is to give tremendously effective auditing demonstration just glasssmooth you know every good indicator there you know just everything sharp you know everything present that should be there you know and realize that some students who were watching it had never seen it and they tell you what the pcs withholds were is the sole thing they learned out of the session it staggers you man you become staggered when you look at it because but then youd recognize that they dont know what the good indicators are what should the session have looked like so they dont know what was good session and what was bad session now youre going to tell this person get in there and run good session what do you mean good session you only mean good session of course if it has good its full of good indicators if its got the good indicators in it its good session as the indicators drop away as the good indicators drop away youll find bad indicators are starting to take their place and as the bad indicators come in youll find certain remedial actions have to be taken and when these remedial actions are taken your session snaps back to battery now this throws away the idea that some people are auditable and some people are unauditable i just look down your throat and say well after all youre an auditor how do you materialize all these good indicators in session well thats what youre being trained to do the standard operating procedures on which youre operating and so forth are all calculated to bring about these good indicators and continue them flowing in session its elementary as that now you wonder why joe blitz has such an awful lot of trouble with in the coaudit here and why is joe blitz having so much trouble and so forth you dont understand it well joe blitz doesnt know the pcs supposed to sit in chair see he doesnt know what he doesnt know what hes trying to make take place here so not knowing that of course he cant make it he cant create it the gains of auditing are astonishingly automatic these days astonishingly you have series of good indicators present in an auditing session and you audit the pc just so many hours and you use brilliance at all of any kind you just keep on and keep the good indicators in the pc wins and he all of sudden comes around you know and youre checking up their chronic headaches are gone and they now dont have to be operated on by dr sawbones and youll hear all of this stuff why when youre an old pro why you take this in stride you take this in stride because all you were doing was just standard auditing job and the good indicators were present and of course you expected good result and thats about the way it was theres nothing very spectacular about it from your point of view but it looks totally magical to this person you see all right how does it look so magical to them well of course they dont know anything thats going on because they have point of view with regard to the situation they just know theyve had this wonderful magical experience years and years and years after ive audited somebody ill occasionally get letter from them theyve had this fantastic and marvelous change and so forth and it changed the position and condition of their life and that sort of thing and they really didnt know what happened what happened well nothing happened very much except just more or less what was then at that particular current time standard auditing took place that wasnt any particular fantastic wandwaving went on or magic occurred there it was that was what occurred and if you fix your sights at good indicators and standard sessioning and continue those and then when bad indicators pop up take care of those take care of the worst one first thats the other little rule on the thing always take care of the worst one first ill give you an idea youve got dirty needle well i dont think id worry about dirty needle if the pc was throwing the cans down on the floor and screaming with bypassed charge of items arc break im sure i wouldnt be worrying about the dirty needle and if theres big bypassed charge possible in what youre running of course i sure wouldnt be worrying about the session mid i mean i wouldnt be worrying about the session arc break assessment much less mid ruds my god in the presence of an arc break start worrying about mid ruds thats something like you see this fellow sees this warehouse full of nitroglycerin burning you know and he goes and gets glass of water to throw on it of course each tool has its own position you see naturally you want to get the heaviest bypassed charge out of the way first get that out of the way then get the lighter bypassed charge session arc breaks out of the way and when youve got that all squared out why get something like little ow in something like that if youre really still patching this thing up and at some point you will by the way patch it up to point where the patching starts creating bad indicators you see auditing starts occurring or something you have to use good sense with regard to that but youll have very smooth sessions as result the results of scientology the results of scientology are terribly elementary in their action whats the good indicator with regard to an auditing question the good indicator is that the pc has received something to inspect he inspects it you know hes itsaing it and telling you what his insp and then he tells you what he has inspected and he answers the question fully as far as he is concerned and then you acknowledge now it doesnt matter whether its by repetitive that is to say you got the question fully answered by repetitive commands or you got the question fully answered by giving him one command and he took half an hour to answer that one command hes going through an electronic circuit and he finally comes out the right end of this electronic circuit and hes free of it hes inspected it in other words hes walked through the labyrinth of thoughts hes had crossed up on this particular subject and hes fully answered the question and now you can see this and so you respond now if at any time you cut his itsa you of course dont let him walk all the way through the labyrinth so not having walked through the labyrinth youll interrupt him someplace and he feels lost of course hes lost hes lost in the middle of an incomplete inspection and in this incomplete inspection its electronic materials that he actually is inspecting in the mind and it turns on dirty needle because you have cut his itsa now you know this so you let this person insp you give him something to inspect you let him inspect this and when he is finished you tell him he has inspected it by acknowledging it i dont care whether you did that by repetitive commands or otherwise thats the basis of all auditing there is other basis to auditing than that and that this this operation is taking place in the knowledge of certain mental mechanics and activities and theres certain types of questions you can ask and so on but the person who is answering these questions that are being put to him and so forth because he is undergoing conditions and hes doing actions which are bringing him up the line he will come up with higher iq and hell be brighter and hell be this and hell be that providing youre not auditing him during the presence of present time problem youre not trying to press ahead while he has an arc break providing these things are occurring providing you are getting tone arm action why the guy can recover from almost anything dont you see ive given you just in these last few words the really the basic essentials of auditing theyre just spit out that fast now if you can bring that about youve got all the good indicators present dont you see the bad indicators are absent when bad indicator shows up you immediately take the lightest necessary action quickest quickly to set it to rights you recognize it swiftly you take the action necessary to correct it youve got it corrected and then youre away and not making profession now out of this one bad indicator and youve got the session wheeling and its going and so forth and you keep that ball rolling and just the essentials which i just gave you keeping the pcs confidence built up in that youre not chopping him down all the time making sure the pc doesnt have pt problems making sure that youre not auditing him somebody over the top of an arc break this type of thing and my god youll emerge at the other end even at your lower levels of auditing you see you emerge at the other end with brandnew being you can keep you can keep doing this but of course if you dont know what auditing looks like then auditing is to marked degree quite downgraded do you see that well ive given you rather long lecture you can come back fifteen minutes late and well start class fifteen minutes late but i wanted to particularly go over some of the points of 1963 i thought you might be interested and amused tell you how it looked at least from my point of view and to wish you very happy new year
