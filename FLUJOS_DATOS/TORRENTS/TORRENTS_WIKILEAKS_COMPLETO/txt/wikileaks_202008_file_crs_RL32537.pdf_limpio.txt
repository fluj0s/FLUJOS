defense nuclear waste and cleans up contaminated nuclear weapons sites in the second session of the 108th congress the most controversial issues regarding these activities were whether to provide further exemptions for military readiness activities from certain air quality and hazardous waste cleanup requirements and whether to provide doe with the authority to classify certain radioactive ta nk wastes at nuclear weapons sites in idaho south carolina and washington in manner that would permit these wastes to be permanently disposed of onsite in those states the ronald w reagan national defe nse authorization act for fy2005 pl 108375 hr 4200 authorizes 135 billion for cleanup at active military installations and formerly used fense sites fuds 40 million more than requested the increase is for cleanup at fuds sites the law authorizes the administrations request of 246 million in new funds for environmental cleanup at base closure sites total funding fo r cleanup at these sites would be 322 llion including the use of unobligated balances and proceeds from land sales and leases from base closures funding for dods ot her environmental ac tivities is authorized under several larger accounts the law also authorizes 696 billion for does cleanup of nuclear weapons site s slightly more than re quested and provides targeted authority for permanent onsite disposal of radioactive tank wastes in idaho and south carolina the law does not includ the environmental exemptions from air quality and hazardous waste cleanup requirements that dod requested in addition to defense aut horization legislation the 108th congress completed action on the two fy 2005 appropria tions bills that fund cleanup and other environmental activities ad ministered by dod the department of defense appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108 287 hr 4613 provides 136 billion for cleanup at active military in stallations and fuds sites 10 million more than authorized and 50 million more than request ed the increase is devoted to cleanup at fuds sites as in authoriza tion legislation funding for dods other environmental activities is not specified but is provided under several larger accounts the military construction ppropriations act for fy2005 pl 108324 hr 4837 provides 246 million in new funds fo r cleanup at base closure sites the same as authorized and requested action was also completed on fy2005 appropriations for does cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites the c onsolidated appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108447 hr 4818 provides 703 billion for this activity subject to an acrosstheboard rescission of 08 an increase relative to fy2004 and the administrations request of this amount 292 million is allocated to the disposal of radioactive tank wastes this

liability act cercla commonly known as superfund nd the resource conservation and recovery act rcra cercla addresses the release or threatened release of hazardous substances in the united states and requires contamination to be cleaned up to level that is protective of human health and the environment 42 usc 9601 et seq rcra specifies requirements for storing and disposing of solid and hazardous waste and requires corrective action to clean up environmental contaminati on that occurs as result of storage and disposal practices 42 usc 6901 et seq with authorities provided by these statutes dod is also subject to state cleanup requirementsenvironmental activities on military lands dod administers five environmental pr ograms to comply with federal environmental laws on lands within its jurisdiction in terms of funding the two largest programs focus on cleaning up past contamination and on complying with pollution control laws and regulations that apply to daytoday operations at military installations three other programs have smaller budgets they focus on pollution prevention environmental technology nd conservation of natural and cultural resources1 while there are lineitem accounts in defense authorization legislation and appropriations bills fo r environmental cleanup th ere are lineitem accounts for dods other environmen tal activities instead they are funded out of appropriations for the following accounts operation and maintenance procurement military construction and re search and development dod allocates funding out of these accounts based on the availab ility of annual appr opriations and the competing needs of national security activities dod proposed total of 382 billion in funding for all of the above environmental activities for fy2005 17 milli on more overall than the amount of 380 billion in fy2004 among the individual programs dod proposed an increase in funding for compliance c onservation and pollution prevention and decrease for cleanup and environmental technology background information on each of these programs key f unding issues and the administrations fy2005 request are discussed below releva nt provisions in defense authorization legislation and appropriations for fy2005 are disc ussed later in this report environmental cleanup dod administers defense environmental restoration program to inve stigate and clean up hazardous waste sites at active and closed military installations and other former military properties located in the united states this program is divide d into two subcomponents the military munitions response program addresses the removal of unexploded ordnance uxo and other munitions on former training ra nges and the cleanup of munitionsrelated contamination the installa tion restoration program ddresses the cleanup of non munitions contamination at all other areas on military sites epa and the states are responsible for overseeing the cleanup of these lands to ensure that dod complies with applicable requirements2 the defense environmen tal restora tion program does not address cleanup at overseas military installations rather the commandinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32537crs4 3 the cleanup of contamination at overseas milita ry installations is subject to requirements specified in the status of fo rces agreement with each host nation these requirements are generally not as strict as cercla and rcra and their stringency varies widely from country to country 4 fuds sites are properties that dod owned or leased in the past and are now devoted to civilian uses many of the fuds sites were used during world war ii and prior years 5 department of defense defense envir onmental restoration program annual report to congress for

ce with applicable requirements of the host nation3 active installations and former military properties funding for cleanup at active and former military installa tions is authorized under five defense environmental restoration accounts in the annual aut horization bill for national defense and is appropriated to these acc ounts in the annual ppropriations bill for the department of defense three of these accounts reserve funding for the army navy and air force one devotes funding to more general category of defense wide sites and another is dedicated to cleaning up formerly used defense sites fuds4 for the past several years annua l appropriations for these five accounts combined has been around 130 billion fluctu ating somewhat from year to year for fy2005 the administration request ed 131 billion for the above accounts 34 million less overall than the fy2004 appr opriation of 134 billion among the individual accounts cleanup funding for ar my navy and air force sites would increase by varying amounts whereas th fuds account would decrease by nearly 68 million the adequacy of funding fo r cleanup at fuds sites has been contentious issue as some of these properties are now being used for civilian purposes that may present pathway of human exposure to contamination some fuds sites also were the location of fo rmer training ranges where unexploded ordnance and other munitions hazards may be present as of the end of fy2003 dod estimated that 2990 billion would be needed to complete cleanup at active military installations and fuds sites5 of this amount 1630 billion would be for the removal of unexploded ordnance and cleanup of munitionsrelated cont amination dod has not complete d its investigation of former training ranges under the military m unitions response program estimates of cleanup funding needs may increase in future years as the extent of safety hazards and munitionrelated contamination is determined and additional sites with unexploded ordnance are identified military base closures cleanup at base closure sites is authorized separately under the base r ealignment and closure bra c account in the annual authorization bill for national defense base closure sites are separate from fuds sites which were decommissioned prior to 1988 appropriations for base closure activities including cleanup are provide d under the brac

accounts have now been consolidated into one account the closure and realignment of military bases designated under these four rounds was complete in fy2001 since that time brac funds have only been used to pay environmental cleanup expenses in addition to appropriations to the brac accounts proceeds from the sale or lease of property on closed bases support cleanup of contamination on these lands total cleanup funding for base closure s ites has declined in recent years from 830 million in fy1998 to 344 million in fy2004 although funding has declined over the past several years dod continues to estimate s ubstantial funding needs for cleanup as of the end of fy2003 dod timated that 332 billion in additional funding would be necessary to complete ll planned cleanup actions at base closure sites6 funding needs for cleanup at base clos ure sites may rise in future years if additional military bases are selected for closure the national defense authorization act for fy2002 pl 107 107 authorized new round of base closings in 20057 the expense of closing and realigning dditional bases and the costs of cleaning up these bases for other land uses would cause funding needs for the brac account to rise the amount of funding that woul d be necessary to clean up additional base closure sites would depend on the type and extent of c ontamination and the actions that would be necessary to protect human health and the environment the degree of cleanup that is required depends on the intended land use of the property after it is transferred cleanup at ac tive military installations is typically based on industrial land use which allows the least stringen t cleanup standards to be applied the cleanup required at such inst allations could become more stringent if they were closed and transferred for other land uses that would present higher possibility of human exposure to contamination ch as residential development the adequacy of funding to meet clea nup needs at base closure sites has been contentious issue due to potential risks to human health and the environment and the publics desire to redevelop these properties for civilian uses the completion of cleanup is key to redevelopment because the land cannot be used for its intended purpose until it is cleaned up to the extent that it would be safe for that purpose in march 2004 the general accounting offi ce gao now renamed the government accountability office reported that 44 of the land on closed military bases had not been transferred for redevelopment as of the end of fy2003 gao stated that environmental cleanup has long been key f actor in slowing the transfer process8 the administration proposed to tinue the downward trend in cleanup funding for base closure sites in fy

register 60277 the exempti on was scheduled to expire in september 2004 based on past precedent it likely will continue to be renewed on annual basis as long as classified activities continue at this facility groom lake is the only military installation in the united states that receives an annua l exemption from an environmental requirement246 million for the brac account this amount is 124 million less than the fy2004 appropriation of 370 million dod proposed to allocate 322 million for cleanup at base closure sites in fy2005 usin g the funds that it has requested for the brac account along with unobligated funds from prior year appropriations and proceeds from the sale and lease of base clos ure properties this funding level is 22 million less than dods allocation of 344 million for fy2004 environmental compliance in general dod and all other federal agencies are required to comply with federal laws and regulations to control pollution to the same extent as any other entity however numerous federal pollution control statutes include exemptions for purposes of national security or for activities that are in the paramount interest of the united states9 epa and the states are authorized to take enforcement action against dod including the assessment of fines and penalties if the department does not comply with applicable requirements for which an exemption has not been granted the granting of such exemptions has been extremely rare resulting in dod being subj ect to pollution control requirements for most all of its routine operations10 the federal pollution control statutes that most commonly apply to routine military operations include the clean air act clean water act resource conservation and recovery act rcra and safe drinking water act common types of environmental compliance projects at military installations include 1 storing and disposing of solid and hazardous waste 2 replacing and upgrading wastewater treatment plants 3 monitoring the effec tiveness of wastewater treatment systems and 4 testing and replaci ng underground storage tanks dod did not begin to track the amount of funding spent on environmental compliance activ ities until fy1990 dod allocates funding for compliance from several accounts including operation and maintenance military construction and procurement dods budget for environm ental compliance peaked at 223 billion in fy1996 and there has been an overall dow nward trend in compliance costs since that time dod attributes this decline to the success of its pollution prevention efforts to reduce the generation of waste lessening the need for treatment and disposal and other compliance actions however dod estimates that it will need tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32537crs7 11 department of defense

require ments and various requireme nts applicable to navy training ranges as well as the need fo r greater funding to pay increased manpower costs for fy2005 dod estimated that it will need to allocate total of 167 billion to comply with applicable pollution control requirements at its installations 104 million more than in fy200411 pollution prevention the purpose of the pollution prevention program is to reduce or eliminate waste and polluti on as means to lower the costs of environmental compliance and to prevent fu ture cleanup liabilities as noted above dod attributes the overall downw ard trend in environmenta l compliance costs to the success of its pollution prevention efforts this program seeks to reduce 1 the use of hazardous materials 2 the production of solid waste and 3 the release of toxic substances air emissions and water po llution through this program dod also funds the implementation of executive orde rs on waste prevention recycling and procurement of environmen tally preferable products the pollution prevention budget has ranged from 340 million in fy1994 to 165 million in fy2004 dod allocates funding for this program from the accounts for operation and maintenance military construction and procurement for fy2005 dod planned to allocate 171 million nearly 6 million more than in fy200412 the increase would support navy programs to reduce water pollution from vessels environmental technology the environmental technology program supports the research and development of more efficient and less costly methods to manage solid and hazardous waste th efforts are aimed at helping dod to comply more easily with pollution control laws and regulations the program also supports the research and development of more effective and ss costly methods to clean up contamination in soil surface wa ter and groundwater integral to the cleanup of former training ranges th program supports the research and development of advanced technologies to detect unexploded ordnance some members of congress states environmental organizations and communities have advocated higher funding for the developm ent of detection technologies that would help to improve the accuracy and pace of identifying safety hazards for removal the environmental technology budget has ranged from 430 million in fy1993 to around 210 million in fy1997 and fy1998 dod allocates funding for environmental technology out of its resear ch development test nd evaluation accounts dod planned to allocate 186 million for fy2005 64 million less than in fy200413 the proposed decrease was due to the completion of several projects administered by the army to research new cleanup nd pollution prevention technologies conservation the conservation program ims to protect the natural historical and cultural resources of ove r 30 million acres of public land that dod administers activities funded under this program are necessary to comply withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32537crs8 14 ibid 15 the safe drinking water act does not impose time limit on exemptions from compliance under the endangered specie s act special committee shall grant an exemption if the secretary of defense finds it necessary for national security this committee may place time limit on an exemption but it is not required to do sofederal laws that protect such resources including the endangered species act and the national historic preser vation act the conserva tion budget has ranged from 180 million in fy2001 to 90 million in fy1997 dod allocates f unding for conservation from the accounts for op eration and main tenance military construction and procurement dod timated that it will need to allocate 169 million in fy2005 to comply with resource protection requireme nts and to support related activities nearly 28 million more than in fy200414 the increase in funding would be for the purchase of conserva tion easements on lands adjacent to military installations these lands would serve as buffers to ease the burden of habitat management on military installations as means of preventing encroachment on lands needed for training congress provide d the authority for this practice in the national defense authorization act fo r fy2003 pl 107314 for further discussion see crs report rl31456 defense cleanup and environmental programs authorization and appropriations for fy2003 by david m bearden military readiness issues prominent issue has been the extent to which requirements to clean up contamination control polluti on and protect natural res ources restrict the use of military lands for training central to this issue is whether environmental exemption authority should be expanded to preserve training capabilities congress included exemptions in several statutes to ensure that military training needs would not be restricted to the extent that national security would be compromised these exemptions provide the president with the authority to suspend compliance requirements for actions at federal facilities on casebycase basis such exemptions may be granted if doing so woul d be either in the paramount interest of the united states or in the interest of national security most of these exemptions are limited to one year but can be renewed15 dod argues that existing exemptions are too onerous and timeconsuming to obtain on casebycase basis due to the va st number of training exercises that it conducts on hundreds of military installations across the country dod also argues that the time limitations placed upon most exem ptions are not compatible with many training activities due to their ongoing or recurring nature instead dod favors modifications to numerous environmenta l statutes that would provide greater flexibility for conducting combat training and other readiness activities without restriction or delay howe ver some members of cong ress states environmental organizations and communities have opposed such modifications pointing to the lack of data to demonstrate the extent to which environmen tal requirements have restricted training exercises and compromised readiness overall they argue that expanding exemption authority without jus tification for its need would unnecessarily weaken environmental protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32537crs9 16 general accounting

ubliclibrarysusta inrrpirrpihtml 19 pl 107314 section 315 20 pl 108136 section 318the cumulative effect of environmental requirements on military readiness capabilities is difficult to determine due to the lack of system to comprehensively track individual cases in which training s been restricted or compromised in 2002 gao found that dods readiness reports do not indicate the extent to which environmental requirements restrict combat training activities and that such reports indicate high level of readiness overall16 however gao noted individual instances of environmental restrictions at numerous military installations and in light of this fact recommended that dods reporting system be improved to more accurately identify problems for training that might be attributed to restrictions imposed by environmental requirement s more recen t gao report found that environmental restrictions ar only one of several factor s including urban growth that affect dods ability to carry out trai ning activities and that dod continues to be unable to measure the impact of encroachment on readiness17 congressional action on environmental exemptions as part of its defense author ization proposals for fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 dod submitted readiness and range preservation in itiative rrpi to congress requesting targeted exemptions for military readiness activities18 dod proposed this initiative in response to its stated concern that environmental requirements have increasingly imposed restrictions on combat training exercises key component of military readiness th initiative originally proposed targeted exemptions for military readiness activ ities from certain re quirements under six environmental laws clean air act comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla endangered species act marine mammal protection act migratory bird tr eaty act and resource conservation and recovery act rcra thus far congress has provided modified versions of dods pr oposed exemptions from wildlife protection require ments under three of the above statutes these exemptions were conten tious and there was considerab debate prior to their enactment the national defense author ization act for fy2003 provided broad exemption for military readiness activities from the migratory bird treaty act19 see crs report rl31456 defense cleanup and environmental programs authorization and appr opriations for fy2003 the national defense authorization act for fy2004 provided an exemption from th designation of cr itical habitat under the endangered species act on military lands if certain conditions are met20 other provisions of that act provided br oad exemption from the marine mammalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32537crs10 21 pl 108136 section 319protection act for national defense21 the act also modified the definition of harassment of marine mammals as it applies to military readiness activities and required the consideration of impacts on military readiness in the issuance of permits for incidental takings see crs report rl32183 defense cleanup and environmental programs authorization and appropriations for fy2004 in defense authorization legislati on and appropriations for fy2003 and fy2004 congress did not provide the exemptions from the clean air act rcra and cercla which dod had requested none of the defense authorization and appropriations bills for fy2005 include exemp tions from these three statutes either as discussed later in this report while the exemptions that congress has granted were contentious to those concerned about the weakening of wildlife protections there has been broader opposition to exemptions from the clean air act rcra and cercla due to concern about risks to human health from the potential exposure to air pollution and hazardous substances as proposed by dod the clean air act language would have exempted emissions generated by military readiness activities from requirements to conform to state implementation plans sips fo r achieving federal air quality standards under current law activities of federal agencies which would increase emissions beyond limitations established in state s sip are prohibited unless offsetting reductions from other sources are made dod argued that this exemption would provide greater flexibility for transferring training operations to areas with poor air quality without the possibility of restri ctions on these operations due to the emissions that they would produce dod st ated that the impact on air quality would be minimal claiming that its emission are relatively minor compared to other sources states environmental organiza tions and public health advocates argued that the impacts on air quality could be greater and present risk to human health especially if localized hot spots of pollution were to develop in communities adjacent to military installations wh ere emissions were not controlled dods proposed exemptions from rcra and cercla would have defined solid waste and release in federal statute as not including military munitions on operational ranges whether environmen tal cleanup requirements under these two statutes apply depends on whet her substance is solid waste or whether there has been release of hazardous substance in effect the proposed exemption would have allowed munitions and munitionsrelated contamination to remain on training range indefinitely as long as the range remained operational dod stated that this exemption would codify existing federa l regulations under the military munitions rule and argued that it would not presen t greater risks to human health and the environment some member s of congress states environmental organizations and communities countered that the proposed language was broader than current regulation and that the definition of opera tional range would allow dod to designate practically any lands on military installation as such thereby exempting

to determine the extent to which such flexibility was needed and expressed concern that the impacts of the proposed exemptions on human health and the environment would be greater than dod had characterized issues were also raised in association with this hearing as to whether the house energy and commerce committee or the house armed services committee had jurisdiction over dods proposal subsequent to the contentious hearing debate exemptions from the clean air act rcra or cercla were not in cluded in fy2005 defense authorization legislation and appropriations bills cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites at the end of the cold war in the late 1980s the united states ceased its production of nuclear weapons however radioactive and other hazardous wastes generated from the production of nuclear weapons continue to pose risk to human health and the environment since the begi nning of the us atomic energy program the department of energy doe and its predecessor agencies have been responsible for managing the production of nuclear wea pons and related wast in later years doe expanded its efforts to include the nvironmental restora tion of radioactive sites and those with other hazar dous contamination in 1989 the bush administration established an environmental management program within doe to consolidate the departments efforts to clean up contamination from defense nuclear waste as well as waste from civilian nuclear energy research22 applicable requirements in carrying out the environmental management program doe is subject to requireme nts of the atomic energy act of 1954 cercla and rcra doe is not subject to external agency oversight of its compliance with the atomic energy act however epa and the states play significant oversight role in does compliance with cercla and rcra doe has signed numerous legally binding compliance agreements with epa and the states to perform cleanup activities and dispose of wastes according to specific deadlines which would fulfill the requirements of these two latter statutes cleanup status and costs much attention has focused on the amount of time and money needed to treat manage and dispose of defense nuclear waste and to clean up related contamination the waste management nd cleanup challenges are substantial doe reports that there are 114 large sites in 31 states and one us territory where the production of nuclear weapons and civilian nuclear energy research and development activities resulted in radi oactive and other hazardous contamination together these sites occ upy approximately 2 million acres which is equivalent to the land area of r hode island and dela ware combinedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32537crs12 23 congress previously authorized and appr opriated

account that funded multiple purposesaccording to doe all response actions were complete at 76 of these sites as of the end of fy2003 at cost of approxima tely 70 billion however most of the sites that have been cleaned up thus far are relatively small and are among the least hazardous the sites where cleanup remain s underway contain some of the most severely contaminated areas doe estimates that cleanup at the remaining sites will not be complete until 2035 at cost of 142 billion the greatest outstanding cleanup liabilities are at defens sites that were involved in the production of nuclear weapons appropriations accounts two appropriations accounts fund cleanup at defense nuclear waste sites the defe nse site acceleration completion account provides funding for activities that are directly involved in the cleanup of contaminated sites and the acceleration of site completi on the defense environmental services account funds ac tivities that indirectly support the mission of accelerated cleanup and clos ure such as policy development and coordination and the integration of mission activities across the complex of sites congress authorizes funding for these accounts in the annual aut horization bill for national defense and appropriates funding for thes activities in the annual ppropriations bill for energy and water development administrations cleanup reform initiative at the administrations request congress established these two accounts in fy2004 to focus funding on does cleanup reform initiative to lowe r costs and speed the pace of cleanup23 doe launched its cleanup reform initiative in fy2003 while there has been broad support for accelerating cleanup and reducing cost s questions have been raised as to how these goals could be achieved wit hout weakening environmental protection does initiative is based on assessing the risk of exposure to determine which cleanup remedies are selected risk is currently one of many factors that doe uses to select cleanup remedies altering the cu rrent process to use risk as the primary factor could result in decisions to contain waste on site as means of preventing exposure rather than removing it while containment can often be accomplished more quickly and at less cost the possibility of future exposure remains if the method of containment fails over time some members of congress states environmental organizations and communitie s have expressed concer n about this approach doe proposed to continue its cleanup re forms in fy2005 and requested total of 695 billion for the two above accounts of this amount 597 billion would have been allocated to the defense s ite acceleration comp letion account and 982 million would have been allocated to the defense environmental services account the total request for both accounts was approximately 350 million more than the fy2004 appropriation of 660 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32537crs13 24 department of energy doe order 4351

highlevel radioactive and other chemical wastes at the hanford site in washington the sava nnah river site in south carolina and at the idaho national engineering and envi ronmental laboratory ineel the volume of these wastes is substantial for example doe reports that at the hanford site there are over 50 million gallons of highlevel radioactive and chemical wastes stored beneath the surface in 177 tanks th tank wastes at hanford and the other two sites that are classified as highlevel radioactive wastes must be removed and safely stored in centralized geologic repository as required by the nuclear waste policy act nwpa for more in formation see crs report rl32163 radioactive waste streams an overview of waste classification for disposal by anthony andrews doe has proposed to speed the closure of the tanks at these three sites by classifying some of the waste as incidenta l to reprocessing and to dispose of it as lowlevel waste by mixing and immobilizing it with cement grout inside the tank doe issued this proposal under an inte rnal agency order order 435124 some members of congress states environmental organizations and communities opposed does proposal arguing that none of the tank wastes should be allowed to remain in place because of the possibility that the grout might not mix thoroughly with the waste to contain it safely and prev ent leaks however others asserted that methods to remove all of the tank residues would gene rate new hazardous waste stream that would need to be managed prope rly to prevent exposure there also could be significant risks of exposure to wo rkers who would remove the residues thus far doe has grouted highlevel ra dioactive wastes in two tanks at the savannah river site the natural resources defens council nrdc legally challenged does authority to dispose of these wastes in this manner in 2003 the us district court for idaho ruled that doe does not have the authority to classify the tank wastes at the savanna h river site or any other site as anything other than highlevel radioactive waste25 consequently these wastes would have to be removed and disposed of in centralized geologic repository as required by the nwpa doe appealed the 2003 ruling and on november 5 2004 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the above district court opinion ruling that the challenge to order 4351 was not ripe for

thus under the terms of the circuit court opinion doe may gage in activities pursuant to order 4351 and nrdc or others then would be free to bring suit if they believe those activities violate the law prior to the appeals court ruling the secretary of energy asked congress to enact legislation that would provide doe w ith statutory authority to classify some of the tank wastes as incidental to repro cessing at hanford sa vannah river and the ineel thereby exempting them from di sposal requirements for highlevel radioactive waste in the nwpa whether th wastes could be left in the tanks and

issues related to defense activities among the most controversial are provisions that in effect amend the nuclear waste policy act to provide targeted authority in south carolina and idaho for doe to classify certain radioactive wastes in manner that would allow these wastes to be permanently disposed of onsite neither the law nor the original house and senate bills included environmental

defense sites fuds that are now being used for civilian purposes the authorization is 40 million more than the administrations request of 131 billion the increase is devoted to cleanup at fuds sites for which 257 million is authorized out of the total 135 billion however the fy2005 authorization for fuds sites is 28 million less than the fy2004 appropriation of 285 million the law authorizes an

using funds from the brac acc ount unobligated funds from prior year appropriations and proceeds from the sale and lease of base closure properties the law also addresses the cleanup of groundwater contamination which is common at many military installations groundwater contamina tion often requires more time and money to remediate than soil or surface water contamination especially if the groundwater must be pumped and treated the law requires gao to conduct study of alternative t echnologies for the cleanup of groundwater contamination and to submit the study to congress by april 1 2005 the senate bill had included similar provision in c onducting the study gao is to identify current technologies used or fi eld tested by dod to remediate groundwater

the cleanup of perchlorate substance commonly used in munitions propellants this substance has been found in groundwater at numerous military installations across the country and has been detected in many public water supplies and private dr inking water wells30 consequently there has been significant public concern about the potential risks of perchlorate to human health there currently is not an enforceable federal or state drinking water standard for this substance that could be applied to clean ing it up the national academy of sciences nas is studying the health effects of pe rchlorate to assist epa in developing federal drinking water standard the st ate of california is in the process of developing standard as well and is awaiting the results of the nas study in the absence of

underway in the absence of drinking wa ter standard develop plan for remediation at sites where perchl orate is present in groundwater or surface water at levels that the secretary of defense determines pose hazard to human health and continue evaluating and prioritizing sites for cleanup without waitingfor the establishment of federal standard the senate bill included similar provi sion but did not identify who would determine whether contamination levels pose hazard to human health for the purposes of developing an interim plan for remediation until drinking

not indicate the scope sense of the house senate or congress expresses the opinion of that respective chamber on the matter at hand and is not legally binding32 consequently dod is not required to comply with the di rection provided in the sense of congress provision in the law whether dod could take the above acti ons would depend on various factors including the availability of appropriations cleanup provision relevant to base cl osure sites was not adopted in the conference agreement on hr 4200 the nate bill would have authorized dod to reimburse private owners of former military property for cleanup actions taken after the transfer of the land ce rcla generally requires dod to clean up contamination on base closure sites pr ior to transfer of the land and dod is retroactively liable for any cleanup actions that are needed after the transfer to remediate contamination that was not origina lly addressed33 the pace at which dod performs posttransfer cleanup on former military properties has been an issue among private owners of these lands w ho must wait for the completion of the cleanup before the property can be used fo r its intended purpose the authority that would have been provided in the senate bill would ve allowed dod to reimburse private owners who wish to pay for the cleanup themselves in order to speed the pace of remediation cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites the law authorizes 696 billion for the two accounts that fund doe s cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites slightly more than the adminis trations request of 695 billion of the authorization for fy2005 597 billion is allocat ed to the defense site acceleration completion account and 986 million is allo cated to the defense environmental services account the total authorization is 354 million more than the fy2004 appropriation of 660 billion most of the increase 286 million is author ized for activities to prepare for the permanent onsite disposal of certain radioactive wastes that are stored in underground tanks in the states of idaho nd south carolina wastes left in these tanks would be sealed in place with cement grout subject to state approval monitoring by the nuclear regulator co mmission and subsequent appropriations by congress discussion of appropriations for fy2005 is provided later in this report wastes removed from the tanks that are classified as highlevel radioactive wastes would be treated and stored for fu ture disposal in centralized geologic repository such as yucca mountain in neva da as required by the nuclear waste policy act pl 108375 doe s not provide the authority to grout tank wastes in washington state as the administration had proposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32537crs18 as discussed earlier the administrations request for the legal authority to leave some of the radioactive wastes in the tanks and seal them in place has been controversial the administration and some members of congress argue that providing authority for the grouting of radi oactive tank wastes would save costs and speed the closure of the tanks while fficiently protecting the environment by immobilizing the waste to prevent it from seeping into soil or groundwater other members states and environmental orga nizations have expr essed concerns about longterm risks to the human health and th environment if the tank grouting did not mix thoroughly with the waste to contain it safely and prevent leaks concerns about environmental risks have been strongest in the state of washington as over onethird of the underground storage tanks are known or suspected to have leaked radioactive wastes into groundwater at the hanford site which is located adjacent to the columbia river as noted above the tank waste disposal authority provided in pl 108375 excludes the state of washington and hanford in response to concerns about longter m environmental risks pl 108375 also directs doe to arrange for the national academy of sciences nas to study the radioactive and other hazar dous characteristics of wastes stored in underground tanks in washington idaho and south carolina does current plans to dispose of and monitor these wastes and alternatives for disposal the nas is required to submit final report to congress and doe on th findings and recommendations of this study within one year of entering this arrangement the law authorizes 15 million out of does defense environmental mana gement funds for the nas to conduct the study the house and senate bills included similar provisions to require this study but the senate bill would have aut horized lower amount of 750000 for it for further discussion see crs report rs21988 radioactive tank wastes disposal authority in the ronald w re agan national
