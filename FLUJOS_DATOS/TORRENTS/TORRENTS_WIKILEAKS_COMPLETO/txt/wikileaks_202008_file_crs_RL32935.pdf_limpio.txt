rosenberg american law division may 31 2005 abstract this report addresses congress oversight authority over individual federal judges or supreme court justices congressional oversight authority although broad is limited to subjects related to the exercise of legitimate congressional power while congress has the power to regulate the structure administration and jurisdiction of the courts its power over the judicial acts of individual judges or justices is more restricted for instance congress has limited authority to remove or discipline judge for decisions made on the bench article iii section 1 of the constitution provides that judges have good behavior tenure which eﬀectively has come to mean lifetime tenure for article iii judges subject to removal only through conviction on impeachment however impeachment of judge or justice requires ﬁnding that such judge or justice has engaged in high crime or misdemeanor thus an investigation into decisions or other actions by particular judge pursuant to an impeachment would appear to require some connection between an alleged high crime or misdemeanor and particular case or

oversightthe review monitoring and supervision of the implementation of public policy these oversight powers are based on congress authority to engage in effective inquiries and investigations to assure itself and the public that the laws are being faithfully executed 1 the first several congresses inaugurated such important oversight techniques as special investigations reporting requirements resolutions of inquiry and use of the appropriations process to review executive activity contemporary developments moreover have increased the legislatures capacity and capabilities to oversee and check the judiciary and the executive for instance public laws and congressional rules have measurably enhanced congress implied power under the constitution to conduct oversight 2 1 see crs report rl30240 congressional oversight manual by frederick m kaiser et hereinafter oversight manual 2 see generally oversight manual for several major reasons congress has shown an increasing interest in oversight since the late 1960s these reasons include the expansion in number and complexity of federal programs and agencies continued t

legislative purview of the congress such oversight can become particularly complicated as regards the other branches of government these congressional investigatory powers derive from congress various legislative authorities over those branches whether it be th power of the purse the power to organize the executive and judicial branches or the power to make all laws necessary for carrying into execution congress own enumerated powers as well as those of the executive such legislative and oversight powers can even extend to individual assessments of the performance of judges or justices such as might occur during judicial nomination process or during an impeachment proceeding for instance as is discussed below any number of oversight methods would be available to obtain information regarding particular judge or justice during nomination process these might include informal member contacts with the judge or justice congressional staff studies studies prepared by congressional support agencies or noncongressional entities and formal committee hearings to the extent that the cooperation of the executive or judicial branches is required to facilitate these processes these methods would generally be sufficient even if there were dispute between the branches as to access to information the threat of withholding consent to the nomination would be likely to lead to some accommodation of congressional requests however the question arises as to whether the congress has the authority to compel the judicial or executive branch to provide information on individual judges or their judicial acts one possibility is for the congress to establish statutory reporting requirements as is discussed below congress has by statute provided that the department of justice must provide information to congress on downward departures under the united states sentencing guidelines by individual federal judges as is discussed below justice rehnquist however has suggested that this provision know as the feeney amendm ent is violation of separation of powers further district court considering this provision has struck it down 3 more controversial option would be to attempt to compel judges and justices to respond to congressional oversight through the subpoena and contempt process for instance committees have the authority to issue subpoenas for testimony or documents refusal to comply with such subpoena is punishable as contempt of congress which could result in imprisonment for up to one year andor fine of up to 1000004 most often however the threat of contempt or the actual vote of committee or of the house itself has resulted in compliance before the referral for prosecution5 continued the increase in government expenditures and personnel including contract employees the rise of the budget deficit and the frequency of divided government with congress and the white house controlled by different parties major partisan disagreements over priorities and processes have also heightened conflict between the legislature and the executive 3 united states v mendoza cr 03730 dt slip op cd ca jan 12 2004 see infra vi other investigatory contexts 4 2 usc 192 194 see oversight manual 3637 if the refusal to comply is before subcommittee it must vote to hold the person in contempt and refer it to the full committee which in turn must vote out resolution accompanied by report directing the referral of contempt citation for prosecution if affirmatively acted upon by house the speaker or the president of the senate certifies it to the united states attorney for presentation to grand jury contempts of congress proceedings do not seek the contemnors testimony or documents they serve only to vindicate the authority of the house through punishment 5 it is thought that this occurs because the costs and uncertainties to the contemnor of seeking vindication in criminal continued

oversight method with respect to federal judges or justices seems unclear successful use of the criminal contempt mechanism by committee needs to overcome two formidable legal and practical obstacles first although the speaker or in the case of the senate the president of the senate may certify statement of facts of such contempt to the appropriate united states attorney whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action6 the department of justice has taken the position that congress cannot constitutionally direct that the executive initiate contempt prosecution in the instance of prosecution of judge for failure to comply with congressional subpoena for instance the department of justice may weigh pragmatic and legal factors eg likely unfriendly forum and the availability of the im peachment process as reasons to decline to prosecute second option might be for the full judiciary committee to seek house resolution authorizing it to bring civil action to compel compliance with the subpoena such an action if successful serves to either force the witness to testify or produce the documents sought or subjects the subpoenaed person to contempt of court for failure to comply with courts order the down side to this course as with the first option is that it takes place in forum likely to be sympathetic to claim of congressional intrusion on judicial inde pendence it does not appear that the house has ever enforced subpoena against sitting federal judge third option is utilization of the statutory judicial discipline process currently federal judges are subject to internal discipline proceedings within the judiciary these judicial discipline procedures are available to anyone including mber of congress who deems it appropriate to file complaint against federal district court judge judge of us circuit court of appeals bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge7 while this oversight option is not directly controlled by congress information derived from this process may ultimately serve as the basis for impeachment proceedings finally the committee might seek resolution of the house authorizing the judiciary committee to investigate the conduct of judge to ascertain whether formal impeachment proceedings might be appropriate8 continued prosecution of asserted constitutional or common law principles or privileges are too great 6 2 usc 194 7 the us court of federal claims court of international trade and court of appeals for the federal circuit are directed in 28 usc 363 to prescribe their own rules consistent with chapter 16 of title 28 usc establishing judicial discipline complaint procedures and mechanisms for investigation and resolution of such complaints if federal judge is convicted of felony under federal or state law and has exhausted his or her appeals or if the time for seeking direct review has expired and such review has been sought the judge may not hear cases until the pertinent judicial council decides otherwise and any service after that time may not be considered for purposes of computing years of service on the bench under 28 usc 371c 377 or 178 or creditable service under 28 usc ch 83 subchapter iii or 5 usc ch 84 8 in our constitutional history there have been 15 impeachment trials in the senate 11 against judges seven trials have resulted in convictions all against judges in addition to those impeachment investigations which have resulted in senate trials there have been number of instances in which the impeachment process has been initiated by the house of representatives but has not resulted in articles of impeachment being voted against the subjects of those inquiries at least 22 of those instances have been investiga tions initiated against judges see crs report 98186

matters within its constitutional purview these powers are acknowledged to extend to the judiciary and the operations of the courts but only up to point chief justice rehnquist in the context of recent congressional actions with respect to downward departures in sentencing by federal judges attempted to define that line of demarcation as follows we can all recognize that congress has legitimate interest in obtaining information which will assist in the legislative process but the efforts to obtain information may not threaten judicial independence or the establishe d principle that judges judicial acts cannot serve as basis for his removal from office it is well settled that not only the definition of what acts shall be criminal but the prescription of what sentence or range of sentences shall be imposed on those found guilty of such acts is legislative functionin the federal system it is for congress congress has recently indicated rather strongly by the feeney amendment that it believes there have been too many downward departures from the sentencing guidelines it has taken steps to reduce that number such decision is for congress just as the enactment of the sentencing guidelines nearly twenty years ago was the new law also provides for the collection of information about sentencing practices employed by federal judges throughout the country this too is legitimate sphere of congressional inquiry in aid of its legislative authority but one portion of the law provides for the collection of such information on an individualized judgebyjudge basis this it seems to is more troubling for sidebyside with the broad authority of congress to legislate and gather information in this area is the principle that federal judges may not be removed from office for their judicial acts 9 the chief justice acknowledged that this principle is not set forth in the constitution but was established in the impeachment trial of judge samuel chase in 1805 when the senate failed to convict chase the chief justice states that the acquittal represented judgment that impeachment should not be used to remove judge for conduct in the exercise of his judicial duties the chief justice reiterated his reliance on this principle in his most recent report to congress on the state of the judiciary 10 the chief justice does not define what he means by conduct in the exercise of his judicial duties for example this reference may be intended to suggest that the appropriate means for challenging judges decision on given case is not the impeachment process but rather the appeals process which affords the parties affected an opportunity for review of the judges decision and correction of errors in that judg ment in addition the reversal of lower court decision does not generally mean that the judge below had engaged in conduct rising to the level 9 remarks of the chief justice before the federal judges assn bd of directors meeting may 5 2003

statement are unlikely to be interpreted to mean that judge should not be impeached for criminal acts from the bench gross misconduct on the bench or abuse of his or her judicial office as review of the past judicial impeachments would significantly undercut such view it should be noted however that outside of the impeachment context the use of compulsory process against sitting judge has been extremely rare one such instance occurred in 1953 when house judiciary subcommittee subpoenaed federa l district court judge louis goodman to testify about allegations that judges and prosecutors had improperly interfered with grand jury investigation of misconduct of officials of the then internal revenue bureau judge goodman appeared before the subcommittee and refused to testify about the grand jury matters in question either in public or in executive session citing both grand jury secrecy rules which would allow such revelations only in j udicial proceedings and the independence of the judiciary after the judge read pair of statements into the record 11 the subcommittee questioned the judge but he continued to refuse to reveal matters pertinent to the grand jury proceedings after the close of the hearing the judges refusal to respond to the subcommittees inquiries was not further pursued in sum an evaluation of the limits on congressional investigatory oversight authority requires an examination of the contexts in which congress does have authority over the federal court there is little question that where congress is investigating the federal courts generally its investigatory authority is broad as congress has significant legislative authority over the structuring of the judicial branch 12 however where congress is investigating individual judges or justices then it would appear that congress may need to articulate legislative basis or some other constitutional 11 judge goodman read into the record two statements signed by the seven judges of the us district court for the northern district of california which indicated their refusal to comply with the subpoena and the reasons therefore you have summoned judge of the united states district court for the northern district of california to appear before your committee to testify at your current hearings the judges signing below being all the judges of the court are deeply conscious as must be your committee of the constitutional separation of functions among the executive legislative and judicial branches of the federal government the historic concept that one of these branches may dominate or unlawfully interfere with the others in recognition of the fundamental soundness of this principle we are unwilling that judge of this court appear before your committee and testify with respect to any judicial proceedings the constitution does not contemplate that such matters be reviewed by the legislative branch but only by the appropriate appellate trib unals the integrity of the federal courts upon which liberty and life depend requires that such courts be maintained inviolate against the changing moods of public opinion we are certain that you as legislators have always appreciated and recognized this as we know of instance in our history where committee such as yours has summoned member of the federal judiciary however in deference to the publicly avowed earnestness of the committee we do not object to judge goodman appearing before you to make any statement or to answer any proper inquiries on matters other than judicial proceedings investigation of the department of justice before the special subcommittee to investigate the department of justice hearings before the house comm on the judiciary 83d cong 1 st sess 175354 1953 reprinted in 14 frd 33536

art ii section 2 clause 2 the president appoints federal article iii judges and justices of the us supreme court by and with the advice and consent of the senate13 some of the broadest authority of the congress to investigate individual judges or justices would appear to arise during the nominations process although the use of subpoenas is unusual in the nomination and confirmation process other means of oversight can be utilized toward the end of informing congress as to the qualifications of the nominee these opportunities can arise in number of different procedural contexts the constitution appears to separate the appointments process into three stages nomination by the president alone consent or rejection by the senate and final appointment and commissioning 14 of the appointee by the president15as to the senates advice on the nomination presidents have varied as to the extent to which they have sought input from the senate on nominations frequently president fa ced with the task of making supreme court nomination will as matter of courtesy consult with party leaders in the senate members of the senate judiciary committee and senators from potential nominees home state particularly senators from the presidents political party 16 depending on the importance or contentiousness of particular nomination significant information may be gathered by both the executive branch and by outside groups on potential nominees access to such information by senator at this stage of the proceedings would be likely to be obtained informally the benefit of such information would be primarily for senators seeking to influence presidents decision as to prospective supreme court nominee efforts by senator to influence such decision may include both private consultation with the executive branch or with the expression of views in public forum whether in committee on the floor of the senate or in statements to the media the consent phase is generally more rigidly structured in recent years the role of the senate judiciary committee has usually consisted of three stages prehearing investigative stage 17 13 under art ii 2 cl 2 of the us constitution th president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and counsels judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law 14 under article ii 3 of the constitution the president shall commission all the officers of the united states 15 as noted in an 1837 opinion of the attorney general the senate cannot originate an appointment its constitutional action is confined to the simple affirmation or rejection of the presidents nominations and such nomin ations fail whenever it rejects them the senate may suggest conditions and limitations to the president but it cannot vary those submitted by him for appointment can be made except on his nomination agr eed to without qualifications or alteration 3 ops atty gen 188 1837 see also marbury v madison 5 us 1 cranch 137 15556 1803 dysart v united states

to make to the full senate on the nominee19 each of these stages would appear to represent an opportunity for congress to exercise extensive oversight later proceedings seem to present less opportunity for investigations following committee consideration nomination reported out of senate judiciary committee is placed on the executive calendar to be considered in executive session in the absence of vote to the contrary such executive sessions is open to the public under current practice floor debate on supreme court nominations are open to the public the press and since 1986 to live television coverage 20 however the increased contentiousness of the judicial confirmation process over the last three decades may be said to have fundamentally changed the nature of that process the accumulated precedents over these years arguably indicates that the senate or determined minority of that body has some leverage to obtain access to information regarding judicial nominees that is not ordinarily available to committee engaged in an investigatory oversight proceeding for instance when the president submits nomination to the senate the dynamics of the inquiry process may be different from that of an oversight investigation when faced with congressional request for information that is deemed privileged the president may have to weigh the price of sacrificing an executive privilege by providing the information sought against the risk that the nominee may not be confirmed the failed nomination of miguel estrada to the dc circuit court of appeals in 2002 is case in point senate democrats asserting an inability to evaluate his fitness and qualification for the office because of the sparsity of his public writings requested access to all his memoranda dealing with appeal certiorari or amicus recommendations during the five years he was an attorney in the solicitor generals office the administration refused to comply 21 during the confirmation hearing two senators presented for the record evidence of seven instances in which prior administrations had provided requested documents for nominees related to prior service in the department of justice doj which were claimed to be analogous to those being sought about estrada they involved the nominations judge frank easterbook to the seventh circuit judge robert bork and chief justice william rehnquist to the supreme court continued committee questionnaire to which the nominee responds in writing confidential fbi reports evaluation by the american bar associations standing committee on federal judiciary input from the nominees courtesy calls to individual senators on capitol hill news reports and other pertinent information 18 during confirmation hearings after opening statements nominee is likely to face intensive questioning on many issues including legal qualifications personal background past public activities and timely legal constitutional social or political issues 19 typically within week of the conclusion of confirmation hearings before the senate judiciary committee the committee will meet in open session to consider what recommendation to report to the full senate the committee may report favorably on the nomination may report negative recommendation or may report recommendation to the senate the senate may still consider nomination reported negatively or with recommendation traditionally at least since the 1880s it has been the practice of the co mmittee to report all nominations to the supreme court to permit the full body to consider regardless of whether or t majority of the committee opposes the nomination this permits the full senate to decide whether or t to confirm the nominee to the high court 20 for more in depth discussion of the supreme court nomination

reynolds to be associate attorney general judge stephen trott to the ninth circuit and jeffrey holmes to be assistant administrator at the environmental protection agency22 in response from the doj office of legislative affairs dojola dated october 8 2002 it was contended that disclosure of the memoranda demanded which were asserted to be confidential and privileged would have the effect of undermining the integrity of the decisionmaking process of the solicitor generals office sg this claim was said to be supported by the statements of seven past solicitors general by the fact that none of the 67 court of appeals nominees since 1977 who had worked at the sgs office had ever been asked for similar memoranda by the fact that none of the seven cited instances of disclosure involved appeal certiorari on amicus recommendation documents or other internal sg deliberation memoranda and because the deliberative nature of the documents sought had been recognized by the courts as authority for the executive to protect the integrity of such materials which would reveal advisory opinions recommendations and deliberations comprising part of process by which government policies are formulated 23 the memo asserted that as matter of law and tradition these privileges can be overcome only when congress establishes demonstrably critical need for the requested information citing senate select committee v nixon 24 the memo concluded with the further assertion that the existence of few isolated examples where the executive branch on occasion has accommodated committees targeted requests for very specific information does not in any way alter the fundamental and longstanding principle that memoranda from the office of the solicitor general and deliberative department of justice materials more broadlymust remain protected in the confirmation context so as to maintain the integrity of the executive branchs decisionmaking process 25 president bush never claimed executive privilege with respect estradas sg memos as did president nixon with the kleindienst nomination and president reagan with the rehnquist nomination and in the end allowed estrada to withdraw in the face of threat of filibuster26 the kleindienst rehnquist bork and trott nominations dismissed as irrelevant by the doj ola memo are nevertheless instructive kleindiensts nomination to be attorney general was on the brink of approval when newspaper article accused him by lying about his connection with corrupt deal to settle an antitrust case special hearing was conducted at which the committee received conflicting accounts as to whether white house aide had been involved in the settlement talks the white house counsel j ohn dean claimed executive privilege to prevent the aides testimony senator sam ervin threatened to filibuster kleindiensts nomination if the aide was not produced the threat led to an agreement for the aides testimony and kleindienst was confirmed year later kleindienst resigned during the watergate affair and later pled guilty to misdemeanor charge for lying at his confirmation hearing about president nixons intervention in the corrupt settlement

rehnquist to be chief justice the judiciary committee sought documents that he had authored on controversial subjects when he headed dojs office of legal counsel president reagan asserted executive privilege claiming the need to protect the candor and confidentiality of the legal advice submitted to presidents and their assistants but with opponents of rehnquist gearing up to issue subpoena the nomination of not only rehnquist but that of antonin scalia to be an associate jus tice whose nominations were to be voted on in tandem were in jeopardy president reagan agreed to allow the committee access to smaller number of documents and rehnquist and scalia were ultimately confirmed28 the dojola memo correctly states that the documents sought during the trott nomination had nothing to do with his work two senators used his nomination as vehicle to gain access to report prepared by dojs public integrity section regarding recommendation to attorney general meese that he seek appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the activities of former ambassador meese did not seek the appointment and refused the senators requests for the report on the ground of dojs longstanding policy not to allow access to internal deliberative memoranda it soon became clear that the trott nomination would be held up indefinitely unless the department yielded which it did and the senators hold was ended 29 the dojola memorandum appears to understate the nature and scope of the documents disclosed in judge robert borks nomination hearing louis fisher describes the justice departments understanding of the sensitive nature of documents turned over the justice department gave biden the documents some were forwarded such as memos from the solicitor generals office on the pocket veto issue others under seal by order of federal district court had to be unsealed and supplied to the committee few were converted to redacted versions deleting few sentences of classified material or in unclassified form the department explained that the vast majority of the documents you have requested reflect or disclose purely internal deliberations within the executive branch the work product of attorneys in connection with government litigation or confidential legal advice received from or provided to client agencies within the executive branch releasing such materials seriously impairs the deliberative process within the executive branch our ability to represent the government in litigation and our relationship with other ent ities yet the department waived those considerations to cooperate to the fullest extent possible with the committee and to expedite judge borks confirmation process when the senate judiciary committee issued its report on judge borks nomination it included fifteenpage memo that he wrote as solicitor general on the constitutionality and policy considerations of the presidents pocket veto power 30 the patterns observed in the engagement and resolution of information access disputes between congressional investigative committees and doj are analogous pertinent and in every respect 28 ibid at 7677 29 fisher supra at 79 30 fisher also documents several

during the senate confirmation process for judicial and doj nominations experience has shown that the investigative disputes are often resolved on the perceived legitimacy of each branchs claim based on past practice although the accommodation process between congress and the executive branch is conducted in highly political atmosphere the arguments made by each side are usually grounded in legal doctrine and rely heavily on their interpretations and past experiences at times the executive branch is able to persuade congress that particular request is insufficiently weighty sometimes based on the representations that the particular information being sought has never before been provided to congress the resolution in such cases is to allow executive briefing limited access to redacted documents or access but where the perceived need for the withheld documents or testimony is great which often means politically important congress reaction to withholding on such grounds is often to conclude that if the agency has produced such information or its equivalent before it can produce it again and that resistance must be based on desire to cover up something that congress would clearly want to see in series of investigations outside the nomination context particularly during the investigations of the clinton administration congressional committees built on succeeding acquiescences together with threats of contempt of congress votes to force doj to disclose documents at least in some form the disclosure during the campaign finance investigations of the freeh and bella memos to senate and house committees after bitter and assertive executive withholdings is agreed to have been significant event in the history of such confrontations that put the executive in difficult position for future attempts to withhold internal doj deliberative document in open cases 31 this shortly came to be realized in the confrontation over subpoenaed doj documents said to reflect ongoing corruption over period of 30 years in the fbis boston regional office that confrontation involved the agencys knowing acquiescence in the giving of perjured testimony by undercover informers which resulted in the conviction and imprisonment of four innocent persons for murder committed by the informants as well as the further knowledgeable acquiescence in at least 21 further murders over the next 29 years by the informants president bush claimed executive privilege to prevent disclosure of the documents asserting in his written claim the broadest immunity for internal doj deliberative documents the president ordered the release of the documents after the pubic hearing when it became apparent that the committee had bipartisan majority to sustain contempt vote in the committee and on the house floor 32 the investigative experiences are compelling but distinguishable from the confirmation context the distinguishing factor however appears to favor those seeking disclosure of nominees writings or communications in the investigativ context the ability of committee to force compliance rests on its apparent ability to muster majorities at the full committee and house floor levels as well as some public support for such an executive rebuke in the senate confirmation process much less is currently needed if 41 votes can be mustered and maintained to prevent 31 todd d

the choice of abandoning the nominee or compromising in some way on the disclosure of the documents as the rehnquist and kleindienst experiences demonstrate even presidential claim of privilege will not suffice if there is determined majority or minority and the president decides he must have the nominee perhaps one other element is needed the credibil ity of the claim of need for the documents and whether in the past analogous documents have been disclosed this is not question of legally binding precedent as in the adversarial litigation context it is simply credible past experience in political context the key distinguishing factor then is the confirmation context itself the president does not have the leverage he has in the investigative context there he can force majority votes in committees and on the floor and even if contempt citation is voted against an executive official the likelihood of an indictment be ing sought by us attorney is negligible the only wild card is the degree if any of political damage the president perceives he could sustain by his withholding action that appears to explain most of the disclosures in the investigative context currently in senate confirmation proceeding minority may prevail if it can sustain 41 votes experience has shown that if the president cannot bring political or public pressure to bear and wants the nomination he will have to effect some disclosure compromise or abandon the nominee g11g24g495g561g12g158g141g146g140g146g138g149g561g6g146g156g140g146g153g149g146g151g142g561 it is not clear if congress has authority to investigate and punish judges behavior outside of the impeachment process beginning in 1930 it was urged in scholarly writings and in congressional debates that an alternative to removal by impeachment could be discerned in the impeachment section of article ii and in the judiciary article of article iii although proposed from time to time congress never adopted such proposition however congress did address judicial discipline authority within the judicial branch the first 34 federal statutory judicial discipline procedures were enacted in the judicial councils reform and judicial conduct and disability act of 198035 33 despite recent concerns over the procedures appropriate for judicial nominees senate rules do not currently prohibit filibuster of judges of justices see dan balz last minute deal on judicial nominees wash post a1 col 4 may 24 2005 34 prior to the 1980 act discipline of federal judges except for impeachment was part of the general administrative authority vested in the judicial councils under 28 usc 332 unlike the judicial discipline procedures under the 1980 act and its successor 28 usc 332 did not define an express statutory structure through which complaints regarding federal judges could be addressed one other provision that may also be of interest first enacted in the act april 30 1790 provided that federal judge convicted of accepting or receiving bribe to obtain or procure the opinion judgment or decree in any suit controversy matter or cause depending before him shall be fined and imprisoned at the discretion of the courts and shall forever be disqualified to hold any office of honor trust or profit under the united states it did not speak to removal from office but only to disqualification from offices of trust honor and profit under the united states the current successor to this act is 18 usc 201 it should be noted that such disqualification is not mandated for instance judge robert f collins us district judge for the eastern district of louisiana was convicted on bribery charges under 18 usc 201b2 among others in 1991 he was sentenced to 82 months of imprisonment but disqualification does not appear to have been part of the sentence imposed united states v collins 972 f2d 1385 1395 5 th cir 1992 after exhausting his appeals judge collins resigned from office for an examination of the legislative history of

for investigation of particular judge or justice for instance if complaint alleges conduct that may rise to the level of impeachable offenses then the judicial conference can refer the matter to the house of representatives for whatever action the house deems appropriate an argument can be made that these judicial discipline proceedings can serve as the basis for judicial impeachment36 thus further providing basis for congress to oversee the process under the former 28 usc 372c procedure in 1986 1988 and 1989 the judicial conference of the united states transmitted to the house of representatives certifications of judicial council and of the judicial conference to the effect that judge harry claiborne judge alcee hastings and judge walter nixon jr respectively may have engaged in conduct that might be considered grounds for impeachment judges claiborne and nixon had been previously convicted of felony charges while judge hastings had been acquitted the national commission on judicial discipline and removal observed that the certifications with respect to the two judges who had prior criminal convictions were only formality congress implicitly acknowledged as much in 1990 amendment that permits the judicial conference to initiate and transmit such determination on the basis of the criminal record in the matter of judge hastings however the exhaustive investigation by special committee and subsequent report and certification by the judicial council coming as they did after the acquittal of hastings on criminal chargeswere undoubtedly critical to the houses willingness to proceed 37 continued discipline and removal created by the judicial improvements act of 1990 pl 101650 104 stat 5122 reported its findings and recommendations about the issues related to judicial discipline and removal of federal judges including both the statutory mechanism and the impeachment process am ong others the commission in its final report described the 1980 act as follows the judicial councils reform and judicial conduct and disability act of 1980 the 1980 act was the result of compromises both within the congress and between the legislature and the federal judiciary it was the product of dialogue that revealed to the judiciary congress concern that there be in place formal and credible s upplement to the imp eachment process for resolving complaints of misconduct or disability against federal judges and revealed to congress the judiciarys concern that any such system not prove to be cure worse than the disease in the end believing that misconduct in the federal judiciary was not widespread and sensitive to both institutional and individual judicial independence congress provided charter for selfregulation that followed closely model devised by the judiciary the 1980 act was however avowedly an experiment and key members of congress promised that it would be the object of vigorous oversight although congress was principally concerned with assuring public accountability in the 1980 act subsidiary goal was to help the house and senate in those cases where the act would not be adequate to the task and resort to the impeachment process would be necessary with large increase in the number of federal judges in the late 1970s some members of congress deemed it statistical certainty that there would be more instances of misconduct moreover even thoughor perhaps becausethere had not been an impeachment since 1936 it was hoped that in cases where impeachment might be warranted the acts process could lead to the development of

which allowed her to deviate from the random assignment requirement and send case to particular judge if she determined that at the time an indictment is returned that the case will be protracted and that the expeditious and efficient disposition of the courts business requires assignment of the case on nonrandom basis44 on november 17 1999 acting chief judge stephen williams dismissed the complaint as frivolous45 judicial watch petitioned for review of the dismissal on december 17 1999 on january 10 2000 representative howard coble chairman of the house judiciary committees subcommittee on courts and intellectual property filed letter in support of reconsideration detailing further instances of alleged improper assignments by the chief judge on february 9 2000 in response to chairman cobles letter the judicial council ordered the reconsideration of that part of the judicial watch allegation dealing with case assignments and determination whether special committee should be appointed to investigate the matter on february 16 2000 chairman coble filed formal complaint against chief judge johnson 46 with respect to assignments in several campaign finance cases on march 14 2000 acting chief judge williams authorized the special committee of the judicial council to investigate the complaints and thereafter the special committee retained joe d whitley as counsel to conduct the investigation47 after an extensive review and investigation of nine questioned assignmentstwo from the office of independent counsel involving webster hubbell and seven from the justice departments campaign financing task force the counsel reported that they had not found with respect to any case evidence that chief judge johnsons purpose included political intent to advance the interests of president clinton the clinton administration or the white house conclusion that was adopted after review by the special committee to the judicial counsel 48 the findings and conclusions of the report of the special committee were affirmed in memorandum opinion by the judicial council on february 26 2001 which dismissed the complaints49 while the proceeding did not result in any disciplinary action being taken against the chief judge it had 1 the appearance of thoroughly and publically ventilating the serious charges brought against the judge and 2 supplied the impetus for the repeal of local criminal rule 5710 c which since 1971 had authorized chief judges of the district court to deviate from the random assignment requirement chief judge longer has authority to specially assign cases 50 it also demonstrated that well founded official complaint by the house judiciary committee can trigger the statutory judicial discipline mechanism 44 local criminal rule

another circumstance under which congress could exercise its oversight authority over individual judges or justices would be in antic ipation of or during impeachment proceedings federal judges are among those civil officers of the united states who can be impeached for engaging in conduct amounting to treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors51 impeachment however is cumbersome process which takes time and resources away from other legislative business 52 but as has been indicated above53 while use of compulsory process against sitting judge outside the impeachment process is rare and legally problematic the issuance of subpoenas during the impeachment process including against judges has become more common and acceptable54 indeed the failure to comply with subpoenas during an impeachment inquiry could result in an independent article of impeachment 55 moreover federal rule of criminal procedure 6e3ci authorizes court to make disclosures preliminary to or in connection with judicial proceeding consistently and without an exception that we are aware of the courts have held that house investigation 51 the somewhat skeletal constitutional framework for the impeachment process can be found in the following provisions art i 2 cl 5 the house of representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment art i 3 cl 6 and 7 the senate shall have the sole power to try ll impeachments when sitting for that purpose they shall be on oath or affirmation when the president of the united states is tried the chief justice shall preside and person shall be convicted without the concurrence of twothirds of the members present judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor trust or profit under the united states but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment trial judgment and punishment according to law art ii 2 cl 1 the president shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the united states except in cases of impeachment art ii 4 the president vice president and all civil officers of the united states shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors 52 its cumbersome nature however arguably may be viewed as necessary to minimize the chance that so serious course of action will be taken lightly bazan supra footnote 8 at 22 53 see discussion supra ii limits on congressional investigatory authority over the judiciary 54

impeachment is appropriate in given instance rests solely with the house of representatives thus investigations preliminary and attendant to impeachments carry some of the broadest authorities to

individual falling within the constitutional category of officials who may be impeached such resolution sometimes called an inquiry of impeachment to distinguish it from an impeachment resolution of the type described above would usually be referred to the house committee on rules which would then generally refer it to the house committee on the judiciary see eg hres 304 directing the house

house investigating committee or suggestion from the judicial conference of the united states61 that the house may wish to consider whether impeachment of particular federal judge would be appropriate62 the senate also has unique role to play in the impeachment process as it has the authority and responsibility to try an impeachment brought by the house63 in addition should an individual be convicted on any of the articles the senate must determine the appropriate judgment either removal from office alone or alternatively removal and disqualification from holding further offices of honor trust or profit under the united states 64 for either body to base an investigation on the potential impeachment of judge or justice it would appear that an impeachable offense would ne ed to be at issue however what constitutes an impeachable offense has been the topic of considerable debate neither the federalist papers nor the debates in the constitutional convention nor the state ratifying conventions give us particular guidance on the standards to be applied to judicial impeachments beyond the constitutional language in article ii sec 4 of the us constitution65 conviction through the impeachment process for treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors is the constitutional standard for removal of president vice president or other civil officers of the united states treason is defined both in statute66 and in the constitution67 bribery while not defined in the constitution was an offense at common law has been statutory offense since the first congress enacted the act of april 30 1790 68 and is now codified at 18 usc 201 thus treason and bribery may be fairly clear as to their meanings but the remainder of the language has been the subject of considerable debate continued deschlers ch 14 1414 at 60512 it may be noted that the impeachment investigation by the house judiciary committee of president nixon in 1974 was pursuant to the authority in hres 803 hres 803 was reported out of house judiciary committee on feb 1 1974 authorizing and directing the committee on the judiciary to investigate fully and completely whether sufficient grounds exist for the house of representatives to exerci its constitutional power to impeach richard m nixon president of the united states of america called up as privileged debated and passed the house on february 6 1974 this resolution was privileged as it was reported by the house judiciary committee to which resolutions of impeachment had been referred and as it was incidental to consideration of impeachment this is an unusual procedure because normally resolutions providing for f unding from the contingent fund of the house are only privileged if called up by the house administration committee and resolutions authorizing investigations are normally privileged only if called up by the house rules committee 3 deschlers ch 14 153 at 62326 61 28 usc 35164 62 see

constitutional convention in 1787 indicates that criminal conduct70 was at least part of what was included in the treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors language71 however the precedents in this country reflect the fact that conduct which may not constitute crime but which may still be serious misbehavior bringing disrepute upon the public office involved may provide sufficient ground for impeachment for example judge john pickering was convicted on all four of the articles of impeachment brought against him including charges that he mishandled case before him in violation federal laws and procedures the alleged misconduct included 1 delivering ship which was the subject of condemnation proceeding for violat ion of customs laws to the claimant without requiring bond to be posted after the ship had been attached by the marshal 2 refusing to hear some of the testimony offered by the united states in that case and 3 refusing to grant the united states an appeal despite the fact that the united states was entitled to an appeal as matter of right under federal law however it should also be noted that the fourth article against him alleged that he appeared on the bench in an intemperate and intoxicated state in another example judge halsted ritter was acqui tted of six of the seven articles brought against him he was however convicted on the seventh which summarized or listed the first six articles the factual allegations upon which the seventh article was based included assertions that ritter while federal judge accepted large fees and gratuities and engaged in income tax evasion however the basis of the seventh article was that the reasonable and probable consequences of the actions or conduct involved therein were to bring his court into scandal and disrepute to the prejudice of said court and public confidence in the federal judiciary and to render him unfit to continue to serve as such judge this article was challenged unsuccessfully on point of order arguing that article vii merely repeated and co mbined facts circumstances and charges from the preceding six articles the president pro tempore ruled that article vii involved separate charge 69 as alex simpson jr amply demonstrated in his discussion of the constitutional conventions debate on this language and the discussion of it in the state conventions considering ratification of the constitution in federal impeachments 64 u pa l rev 651 676695 1916 confusion as to its meaning appears to have existed even at the time of its drafting and ratification 70 article 1 section 3 clause 7 appears to anticipate that some of the conduct within this ambit may also provide grounds for criminal prosecution it indicates that the impeachment process does not foreclose judicial action its phrasing might be regarded as implying that the impeachment proceedings would precede the judicial process but as is evident from the impeachments of judge claiborne in 1986 and of judges hastings and nixon in 1988 and 1989 at least as to federal judges and probably as to most civil officers subject to impeachment under the constitution the impeachment process may also follow the conclusion of the criminal proceedings whether impeachment and removal of president must precede any criminal prosecution is as yet an unanswered question 71 see the discussion of the

going beyond the criminality of the behaviour alleged in previous articles the house judiciary committee in recommending articles of impeachment against president richard nixon in 1974 appears to have premised those articles on the theory that president nixon abused the powers of his office causing injury to the confidence of the nation and great prejudice to the cause of law and justice and resulting in subversion of constitutional government that he failed to carry out his constitutional obligation to faithfully execute the laws and that he failed to comply with congressiona l subpoenas needed to provide relevant evidence for the impeachment investigation 73 the minority of the house committee on the judiciar in the report recommending that president nixon be impeached took the view that errors in the administration of his office were not sufficient grounds for impeachment of the president or any other civil officer of the united states 74 the minority views seem to suggest that under their interpretation of high crimes and misdemeanors crimes or actions with criminal intent must be the basis of an impeachment75 impeachment charges were brought against president andrew johnson involving allegations of actions in violation of the tenure of office act76 including removing secretary of war stanton and replacing him with secretary of war thomas and other related actions two of the articles brought against the president asserted that he sought to set aside the rightful authority of congress and to bring it into reproach disrepute and contempt by harangues criticizing the congress and questioning its legislative authority77 president johnson was acquitted on those articles upon which votes were taken another executive branch officer to go to trial on articles of impeachment was secretary of war belknap the articles alleged that he in an exercise of his authority as secretary of war appointed john evans to maintain trading post at fort sill nd allowed evans to continue in that position as part of an arrangement which provided belknap personal gain the arrangement allegedly provided that evans would pay 12000 annually from the profits of the trading post to third party who would in turn pay belknap 6000 annually belknap resigned before the senate trial on his impeachment and was not convicted on any of these articles it has been suggested that the impeachment provisions and the good behaviour language of the judicial tenure provision in article iii section 1 of the constitution should be read in conjunction with one another 78 whether this would serve to differentiate impeachable offenses for judicial officers from those which would apply to civil officers in the executive branch is not altogether clear during the impeachment

either improper judicial conduct or nonjudicial conduct amounting to criminal offense79 then minority leader gerald ford inserted in the congressional record memorandum taking the position that impeachable misbehavior by judge involved proven conduct either in the administration of justice or in his personal behavior which casts doubt on his personal integrity and thereby on the integrity of the entire judiciary80 during the douglas impeachment debate representative frank thompson jr argued that historically federal judges had only been impeached for misconduct that was both criminal in nature and related to their judicial functions and that such construction of the constitutional authority was necessary to maintaining an independent judiciary81 in the final report by the special subcommittee on hres 920 of the co mmittee on the judiciary of the house of representatives 91st cong 2d sess comm print sept 17 1970 as cited in 3 deschlers ch 14 313 the subcommittee suggested two concepts related to this question for the committee to consider these concepts shared some common ground as the subcommittee observed both concepts would allow judge to be imp eached for acts which occur in the exercise of judicial office that 1 involved criminal conduct in violation of law or 2 that involved serious dereliction from public duty but not necessarily in violation of positive statutory law or forbidden by the common law sloth drunkenness on the bench or unwarranted and unreasonable impartiality sic manifest for prolonged period are examples of misconduct not necessarily criminal in nature that would support impeachment when such misbehavior occurs in connection with the federal office actual criminal conduct should not be requisite to impeachment of judge or any other federal official while such conduct need not be criminal it nonetheless must be sufficiently serious to be offenses against good morals and injurious to the social body both concepts would allow judge to be im peached for conduct not connected with the duties and responsibilities of the judicial office which involve sic criminal acts in violation of law 82 thus it would appear that this common ground represented those general principles which the subcommittee deemed fundamental to conduct upon which impeachment of federal judge could be based this review of some of the precedents on the question of what constitutes an impeachable offense suggests that the answer to this question is less than clear criminal conduct appears to be sufficient ground whether the person involved is judge or member of the executive branch where the person to be impeached is the president or an executive officer conduct having criminal intent serious abuses of the power of the office involved failure to carry out the duties of that office and possibly interference with the congress in an impeachment investigation of the president or other executive official may be enough to support an article of impeachment as to federal judges the impeachment language might be read in light of the constitutional language providing that they serve during good behavior with this in mind judge might be vulnerable to impeachment not only for criminal conduct but also for improper judicial conduct involving 79 ibid 80 ibid ch 14 311 at 45255 81 ibid ch 14 312 at 45557 82 ibid ch 14 313 at 46364

investigate individual judges or justice without reference to either judicial nom ination an impeachment or judicial discipline84 on january 12 2004 in united states v mendoza 85 federal district court in california considered constitutional challenge to the feeney amendment to the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act of 2003 protect act which provides reporting requirements on the judicial decisions of individual federal district court judges in mendoza the court found that the requirement that the united states attorney general report district courts grant of downward departure under the united states sentencing guidelines to the house judiciary committee and the senate judiciary committee was an unconstitutional interference with judicial independence and violation of separation of powers 86 the doctrine of separation of powers is not found in the text of the constitution but has been discerned by courts scholars and others in the allocation of power in the first three articles ie the legislative power is vested in congress the executive power is vested in the president and the judicial power is vested in the supreme court and the inferior federal courts that interpretation is also consistent with the speeches and writings of the framers but while the rhetoric of the supreme court points to strict separation of the

valeo 88 the supreme court has reemphasized separation of powers as vital element in american federal government89 the federal courts have long held that the congress may not act to denigrate the authority of the judicial branch in the 1782 decision in hayburn s case 90 several justices objected to congressional enactment that authorized the federal courts to hear claims for disability pensions for veterans the courts were to certify their decisions to the secretary of war who was authorized either to award each pension or to refuse it if he determined the award was an imposition or mistaken the justices on circuit contended that the law was unconstitutional because the judicial power was committed to separate department and because the subjecting of courts opinion to revision or control by an officer of the executive or the legislative branch was not authorized by the constitution congress thereupon repealed the objectionable features of the statute 91 more recently the doctrine of separation of powers has been applied to prevent congress from vesting jurisdiction over commonlaw bankruptcy claims in nonarticle iii courts92 the mendoza decision did not deny the authority of the congress to require the judiciary to provide reports regarding the administration of the courts federal criminal law docket although criminal sentencing is traditionally left to the discretion of judges the united states sentencing commission was established by congress93 to limit this discretion by regularizing sentencing procedures94 thus for the last 15 years sentencing in federal courts has been governed by 87 for instance the supreme court has declared categorically that the legislative power of congress cannot be delegated united states v shreveport grain elevator co 287 us 77 85 1932 the categorical statement has never been literally true the court having upheld the delega tion at issue in the very case in which the statement was made the court upheld the power of the food and drug administration to allow reasonable variations tolerances and exemptions from misbranding prohibitions the court has long recognized that administration of the law requires exercise of discretion and that in our increasingly complex society replete with ever changing and more technical problems congress simply cannot do its job absent an ab ility to delegate power under

between two approaches to cases raising separationofpowers claims using strict approach in some cases and less rigid balancing approach in others nevertheless the court looks to test that evaluates whether the moving party usually congress has impermissibly undermined the power of another branch or has impermissibly aggrandized its own power at the expense of another branch whether that is the

sentencing guidelines during this time congress has passed numerous laws providing for review promulgation or amendment of federal sentencing guidelines applicable to particular offenses in addition the supreme court has recently held that to the extent that the guidelines increase the penalty for crime based on factors not submitted to jury that the guidelines are only advisory not mandatory95 thus congress would seem to have significant basis for oversight over the operation of the guidelines the mendoza court also upheld other portions of the protect act 96 the protect act97 was response to concerns over the frequency and magnitude of downward departures98 and continued citizens crime victims and others interested in the criminal justice process 28 usc 991 its purposes are to establish sentencing policies and practices for the federal criminal justice system thata assure the meeting of the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section 3553a2 of title 18 united states code b provide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct while maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken in to account in the establishment of general sentencing practices and c reflect to the extent practicable advancement in knowledge of human behavior as it relates to the criminal justice process and c develop means of measuring the degree to which the sentencing penal and correctional practices are effective in meeting the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section 3553a2 of title 18 united states code ibid 95 although the supreme court has upheld the guidelines in the face of arguments that they constituted an unconstitutional delegation of authority and an affront to the separation of powers the court also held that due process and the right to criminal jury trial require that any fact other than the fact of prior conviction that increases the penalty for crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt and for this reason the court in blakely v washington 124 us 2531 2004 found state sentence imposed by operation of legislative sentencing guideline

12 of the bill would enact longoverdue reforms to address the growing frequency of downward departures from the sentencing guidelines this is especially problem in child pornography cases much of the damage is traceable to the supreme cours decision in koon v united states 518 us 81 1996 in koon the court interpreted the sentencing reform act to require appellate courts to apply highly deferential standard of review to departure determinations by sentencing judges the court also disapproved the practice whereby appellate courts had held that any factor not explicitly disapproved by the sentencing commission or by statute could serve as ground for departure in an appropriate case as determined by the district court in its discretion under koon judges who dislike the sentencing reform act and the sentencing guidelines have significant discretion to avoid applying sentence within the range established by the commission and it is difficult for the government effectively to appeal in

the sentencing court and for the attorney general to require the court to increase the specificity of the order regarding downward departures the act requires the sentencing court to provide transcript of the courts statement of reasons together with the order of judgment and continued koons expansion of the permissible grounds of departures has led to growing trend of increasingly vague grounds of downward departures thus in fy 2001 departures on such vague grounds as general mitigating circumstances accounted for over 20 of all downward departures section 12 of hr 1161 would provide muchneeded and longoverdue reform by establishing that decisions to depart from the guidelines are to be reviewed under novo standard of review to that extent koon would be explicitly overruled while we enthusiastically support this measure we do not believe it goes far enough we strongly urge the subcommittee to include appropriate language that would overrule both of the key holdings in koon specifically the bill should include language that would prohibit departures on any ground that the sentencing commission has not affirmatively specified as permissible ground for downward departure
