longterm care refers to broad range of health and social services needed by individuals who lack the capacity for selfcare due to physical cognitive or mental disability or chronic condition resulting in functional impairments for an extended period of time the need for longterm care affects persons of all ages children born with disabling conditions such as ment retardation or cerebral palsy working age adults with inherited or acquired disabling conditions and the elderly with chronic conditions or illnesses such as alzheimers disease or severe cardiovascular disease spending on longterm care services is significant component of health care spending in the united states of th 156 trillion spent on personal health care services in 2004 1943 billion 125 was spent on longterm care services comparable in size to spending on prescr iption drugs longterm care expenditures include services in both institutional settings eg nursing homes and intermediate care facilities for individuals with mental retardation icfsmr and wide range of home and communitybased services ch as home health care services personal care services and adult day care the dominant payer in the us for longterm care services is medicaid meanstested program jointly funded by st ates and the federal government in 2004 medicaid paid for nearly onehalf of all longterm care expenditures 493 spending 957

other payers such as private insurers and other public and private sources covered the remainder from 19902004 longterm care expenditures grew slightly faster than expenditures for all personal health care rvices the average annual growth rates were 74 nd 70 respectively ov er this same time period funding for long term care has increasingly been paid by public sources and has increasingly been spent on home and communitybased settin gs in 1990 220 of longterm care spending went toward home and community based services this increased to 367 of spending in 2004 this trend has largel been driven by the increased spending within the medicaid program toward these types of services this report will be updated as dditional data become availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33357contents v r v i

longterm care expenditures as those expenditures reported in the nursing home and home health categories of the national health accounts data at httpwwwcmshhsgovstatisticsnhedefaultasp which represent freestanding nursing homes and home health providers this data is supplemented with information on medicare and medicaid hospitalbased nursing home and home health services nursing home or home health service is considered hospitalbased when the providers operations licensure governance and professional supervision are integrally linked or subordinate part of hospital the data used in this report is also supplemented with information on medicaid home and communitybased waiver programs the services described in this report may be provided for limited time period such as rehab ilitation to

organization for economic cooperation and development oecd has been working to develop common definition of longterm care to be able to compare longterm care expenditures across countries located at httpeuropa euintcommeconomy_finance events2005 workshop02057enpdf 4 the average length of stay in skilled nursing facility has been declining and is currently 24 days in addition recipients of home health services are increasingly in need of physical therapy services which could evidence rehab ilitation of an individua ls physical functioning versus services that provide an ongoing care as described earlier the data does not allow disaggregation of services based on the length of time the beneficiary received the service 5 it does not include medicare expenditures for longterm care hospitals or inpatient rehabilitation facilities 6 as discussed later in this report some outofpocket expenditures for certain longterm continuedit is also important to keep in mind that there can be tremendous variation in the types of services that are considered longterm care examples of longterm care services could include nurse administe ring medication contractor building wheelchair ramp onto home or nursing facility where person resides this variation creates significant challenges fo r researchers in evaluating longterm care services and expenditures and establis hing common definition of longterm care3 for example some argue that the medicare expenditures for skilled nursing facilities and home health services are postacute service that generally follows hospitalization and should not be categorized as longterm care4 others argue that medicare is an important payer in the c ontinuum of longterm care services since many nursing facility residents start with medicare paying for the cost of the service but after the medicare coverage period nds medicaid pays for these expenditures this report follows the latter argument and includes medicare freestanding and hospitalbased skilled nursing facility and home health expenditures as part of long term care services5 if these medicare expenditures were excluded longterm care expenditures would total 1569 billion 192 lowering of the 2004 total see figure 1 who pays for longterm care services formal longterm care services in the us are paid for by wide variety of public and private sources more than two thirds of longterm care spending is paid for by public sources ie medicaid dicare and other public programs the remainder is paid by private sources ie outofpocket expenditures private insurance and other private programs the largest payer of longterm care expenditures in the us is medicaid meanstested program jointly funded by th federal and state governments in 2004 medicaid paid 957 billion or 493

decline between 1997 and 2004 is the result of faster growth rate in all personal health care which averaged 72 per year during that period than in longterm care which averaged 41 per year as shown in

the average annual growth rate for ll personal health care serv ices between 1990 and 2004 was 70 the annual growth rate ranged from 53 to 102 per year during this period the highest annual rate of growth 102 occurred during the 19901991 period between 19911994 the growth rate of spending declined largely due to slower price growth and increased enrollment in managed care9 during the 1995 1999 peri od the growth ra for personal health care spending leveled off as 1 large segments of the population were enro lled into managed care plans 2 excess capacity among some service providers boosted competition 3 the economy as whole and specifically for medical servi ces had low rates of inflation and 4 medicare payment policies restricted payments for certain service providers10 the relatively level rate of phc growth did not last between 19992001 the annual rate of growth accelerated from 57 to 87 as consumers called for fewer restrictions on managed care hospitals facing less competition negotiated higher prices the price of certain services increased due to inflation and shortages of health care workers and medicare and medicaid spending increased11 in 2002 and 2003 the rate of growth declined slightly to under 8 per year due largely to slower growth in medicaid and medicare prompt ed by state fiscal constraints and expiring payment increases in medicare12 in 2004 the rate of growth increased s lightly 01 the growth rate in medicaid spending declined due to conti nued costcontainment efforts on the part of states however offsetting this decline was an an acceleration in the growth of medicare spending resulting in an overall increase in the rate of growth the higher growth rate in medicare spending was in part due to provisions in the medicare prescription drug and modern ization act of 2003 pl 108173 which established medicare transitional drug benefit for 2004 and provided payment increases for capitated health plans and ru ral providers this growth however also reflected the increased use of certain medi care services such as physician and home health services13 factors that influenced spending growth for longterm care services between 1990 and 2004 for longterm care spending the change in the annual growth rates between 19902004 have been somewhat more volatilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33357crs6 14 increases in medicare accounted for bout third of the increase in spending between 1994 and 1995 the remaining twothirds of the increase is divided relatively evenly among medicaid outofpocket and private insurance spending 15 k levit et health

this overall deceleration in the growth rate spending on medicare home health services was growing at an average annual rate of 374 during this period from 42 billion in 1990 to 151 billion in 1994 after an increase in the growth rate from 1994199514 the rate of growth for longterm care spending dropped significantly through 1999 the growth rate decline is largely the result of changes to medicare payment policies for home health and nursing facility services in addition cong ress and the federal g overnment took steps in 1997 and 1998 to curtail fraud and abus in medicare home health services from 19992001 longterm care spending growth accelerated from 04 to 67 this acceleration was due to 1 temporary payment increases for medicare nursing facilities 2 starting at the end of 2000 new payment system for medicare home health services and 3 increases in spending for medicaid longterm care services15 in 2002 and 2003 the growth rate for longterm care spending slowed to 51 and 53 respectively due to slower spending in medicaid because of state budget constraints and medicare because of changes to payment policies for nursing home and home health services in 2004 the growth rate for longterm care spending increased to 67 because of increased spending for home and communitybased settings under medicaid and increased spendi ng for medicare home health services16 the changing roles of longterm care payers across all payers the average annual grow th rate in longterm care expenditures was 74 between 1990 and 2004 however as described above the growth rates for different longterm care payers varied widely medicare and medicaid grew at an average annual rate of 130 and 85 respectively while private insurance spending and outofpocket spending grew at an average annual rate of 66 and 40 respectively17 collectively public sources grew at an annual average rate of 93 and private sources grew at an average annual rate of 42 between 19902004 these different growth rates have re sulted in shift in the proporti on of longterm care spending by type of payer from private to public payers in 1990 public payers including medicaid and medicare paid for about 55 of longterm care expenditures in 2004 public programs paid for approximate ly 71 of these expenditures figure 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33357crs7 illustrates the trend in expenditures from 19902004 by type of payer see appendix for detailed tables though in general the rate of spending growth by public payers was faster than that of private payers there were significant differences within each type of payer and between various time periods for example medicare and medicaid longterm care spending grew significantly in the early 1990s declined in the mid1990s due largely to medicare payment changes reaccelerated in the 19992002 period and slowed slightly in 2003 in response to stat fiscal constraints and the expiration of certain medicare payment provisions in 2004 the rate of growth in medicaid spending remained relatively low 62 however the rate of growth in medicare increased to doubledigits 114 for private payers the growth rates in longterm care expenditures also varied though less information is available to inte rpret the causes of this variation the annual average growth in outofpocket spending remained below 5 per year between 19902004 with the

personal care services25 in 1981 congress authorized the home and communitybased hcbs waiver pr ogram under section 1915c of the social security act the hcbs waiver program gave states the ability to provide wide range of services to individuals who woul d otherwise require the level of care in an institution unlike other medicaid progra ms available under the state plan the hcbs waiver program allows states to limit the number of individuals to be served and to target certain population eg pe rsons with developmen tal disabilities in july 2003 there were 275 hcbs waivers aut horized by the

which ma be directly related to persons longterm care needs but which are not provided by home health agencies are not included in this analysis howeve r these types of expenditures are counted as
