independent federal agency with its five members appointed by the president subject to confirmation by the senate it was established by the communications act of 1934 1934 act and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio television wire satellite and cable the mission of the fcc is to ensure that the american people have availableat reasonable cost and without discriminationrapid efficient nation and worldwide communication services whether by radio television wire satellite or cable although the fcc has restructured over the past few years to better reflect the industry it is still required to adhere to the statutory requirements of its governing legislation the communications act of 1934 the 1934 act requires the fcc to regulate the various industry sectors differently some policymakers have been critical of the fcc and the manner in which it regulates various sectors of the telecommunications industrytelephone cable television radio and television broadcasting and some aspects of the internet these policymakers including some in congress have long called for varying degrees and types of reform to the fcc most proposals fall into two categories 1 procedural changes made within the fcc or through congressional action that would affect the agencys operations or 2 substantive policy changes requiring congressional action that would affect how the agency regulates different services and industry sectors during the 110 th congress policymakers may continue efforts begun in the 109th congress to restructure the fcc

according to the government accountability offices gao analysis of fcc data between 2003 and 2006 the number of complaints received by the fcc totaled about 454000 and grew from almost 86000 in 2003 to high of about 132000 in 2005 the largest number of complaints related to violations of the donotcall list and telemarketing during prohibited hours the fcc processed about 95 of the complaints it received it also opened about 46000 investigations and closed about 39000 approximately 9 of these investigations were closed with an enforcement action and about 83 were closed with enforcement action the gao was unable to determine why these investigations were closed with enforcement action because the fcc does not systematically collect these data the fcc told gao that some investigations were closed with enforcement action because violation occurred or the data were insufficient the gao noted that the fcc assesses the impact of its enforcement program by periodically reviewing certain program outputs such as the amount of time it takes to close an investigation but it lacks management tools to fully measur its outcomes specifically fcc has not set measurable enforcement goals developed welldefined enforcement strategy or established performance measures that are linked to the enforcement goals the gao stated in its report that without key management tools fcc may have difficulty assuring congress and other stakeholders that it is meeting its enforcement mission the gao found that limitations in fccs current approach for collecting and analyzing enforcement data constitute the principal challe nge the agency faces in providing complete and accurate information on its enforcement program these limitations according to the gao make it difficult to analyze trends determine program effectiveness allocate commission resources or accurately track and monitor key aspects of all complaints received investigations conducted and enforcement actions taken

in september 2007 gao released study conducted in response to congressional request on the fccs rulemaking process specifically the gao studied four rulemakings as case studies to determine the extent to which the fcc followed the steps for rulemakings required by law including those related to public participation 3 1 gao report to the chairman subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet

take steps to ensure equal access to rulemaking information september 6 2007 available online at httpwwwgaogovnewitemsd071046pdf 3 the fcc generally begins the rulemaking process by releasing notice of proposed rulemaking or nprm and establishing docket to gather information submitted by the public or developed within the fcc to support the proposed rule outside parties are permitted to meet with fcc staff but must file disclosure in the docket called an ex parte filing that includes any new data or arguments presented at the meeting once the fcc staff has analyzed information in the docket and drafted final rule the commissioners vote on whether to adopt it the fcc chairman decides which rules the commission will consider and whethe r to adopt them by vote at public meeting or by circulating them to each commissioner for approval stakeh olders unsatisfied with rule may file petition for reconsideration with the commission or petition for review in federal court

process in the four case studies and most ex parte filings complied with fcc rules several stakeholders had access to nonpublic information for example in discussions with some stakeholders that regularly participate in fcc rulemakings multiple stakeholders generally knew when the commission scheduled votes on proposed rules well before fcc notified the public even though fcc rules prohibit disclosing this information outside of fcc other stakeholders said that they could not learn when rules were scheduled for vote until fcc released the public meeting agenda at which time fcc rules prohibit stakeholders from lobbying fcc as result stakeholders with advance information about which rules are scheduled for vote would know when it would be most effective to lobby fcc while stakeholders without this information would not the gao recommended that to ensure fair and transparent rulemaking process the chairman of the fcc take steps to ensure equal access to information particularly in regard to the disclosure of information about proposed rules that are scheduled to be considered by the commission by developing and maintaining 1 procedures to ensure that nonpublic information will not be disclosed and 2 series of actions that will occur if the information is disclosed such as referral to the inspector general and providing the information to all stakeholders

and crises must be available for public safety health defense and emergency personnel as well as all consumers in need the nations critical communications infrastructure must be reliable interoperable redundant and rapidly restorable20 fcc modernization the fcc shall strive to be highly productive adaptive and innovative organization that maximizes the benefit to stakeholders staff and management from effective systems processes resources and organizational culture g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g561 proposals for change at the fcc can be characterized as either procedural changes that focus on the manner in which the agency conducts its business or substantial changes that focus on the manner in which the fcc regulates the communications industry g18g152g157g142g151g157g146g138g149g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g138g149g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561 some of procedural changes under consideration would require new legislation eg sunshine rules while others could be achieved through internal fcc action g3g141g152g153g157g146g152g151g550g20g142g149g142g138g156g142g561g152g143g561g17g155g141g142g155g156g561 the fcc often adopts orders and issues press releas with summary of the order weeks or even months prior to releasing the order itself for example the triennial review which dealt with controversial issues relating to competition in the local telecommunications market and the 800 mhz order which dealt with controversial and technically complicated issues related to interference to public safety communications were released six months and one month respectively after they were officially adopted by the commission some congressional policymakers have discussed instituting shot clock which would require the fcc to issue the actual order within set time frame after it adopts the order and issues press release g21g158g151g156g145g146g151g142g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 under current sunshine laws21 only two commissioners may meet outside the construct of an official open meeting while such requirement in theory promotes open discussion of issues under consideration in reality most commission business is conducted by circulating drafts of orders for comment further the open meeting requirement may actually hinder discussion 20 ibid 21 the government in the sunshine act pl 94409 was passed in 1976 it requires that all federal agencies with units that work independently of each other hold their meetings in public session the bill explicitly defined meetings as essentially any gathering many federal agencies most notably the independent regulatory agencies including the fcc are headed by multiple commissioners these agencies make mo st of their decisions through discussions and voting by the board or commission members this law was created so that these meetings would be in the public domain for all to review additional information on this law is

the draft is significant in such cases it might be possible for further compromise if third or fourth commissioner could be involved in the discussion while the fcc cannot institute such changes without congressional amendment to current sunshine requirements it could be useful to study how other agencies which do not employ circulation as much as the fcc work through contentious issues on their agendas senator ted stevens chairman of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation has stated that he believes the current sunshine requirements push too much power to the staff and it does not allo w more than two commissioners to be in the same room at one time it really is the sunshine law gone awry 22 at february 1 2007 hearing on the state of the communications industry senator ted stevens mentioned that he and senator daniel inouye planned to introduce bill that would exempt the fcc from certain provisions of the government in the sunshine act which currently prohibits more than two commissioners from meeting to discuss pending issue in the 109 th congress hr 5252 reported out of the committee in june 2006 contained provisions that would have allowed all members of the commission or at least one member of the political party whose members are in the minority to meet in private g22g146g150g142g149g146g151g142g156g156g561 some of the basic work of the fcc affects the every day function of the telecommunication industry eg license transfers for mergers and sales and license renewals some policymakers have expressed concern that these processes take too long to complete similar to views concerning more complicated regulatory actions such as rulemaking proceedings these policymakers believe there should be strict time limit on how long these actions may take to complete such time limits they state would provide further operational certainty within the industry g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g150g142g151g157g561 enforcement of agency rules is currently the re sponsibility of the fccs enforcement bureau previously enforcement responsibilities were held by division within each bureau for example enforcement of slamming23 was done by division within what was then the common carrier bureau now called the wireline competition bureau some policymakers have questioned whether the current unified structure is more effective than the previous diversified structure and have suggested studying the issue g18g152g157g142g151g157g146g138g149g561g21g158g139g156g157g138g151g157g146g159g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561 while the changes discussed above could be made by the fcc absent congressional action other more significant changes would likely require the passage of legislation in fact the fcc 22 stevens to continue listening

telecommunications industry but it is still required to adhere to the statutory requirements of its governing legislation the communications act of 1934 title i of the 1934 act gives the fcc the authority to structure itself in the manner it believes will allow it to best fulfill its responsibilities however from practical standpoint the fcc may not be able to restructure to the extent needed to implement significant changes unless changes are made to the 1934 act itself some policymakers have been critical of the fcc and the manner in which it regulates various sectors of the telecommunications industrytelephone cable television radio and television broadcasting and some aspects of the internet these policymakers including some in congress and various interest group and think tank experts have long called for varying degrees and types of reform to the fcc some have called for significantly downsizing the agency by eliminating its regulatory functions and transforming it into an enforcement agency 24 others have suggested abolishing the agency and parceling out its functions to other agencies25 others still call for more regulation eg indecency for additional
