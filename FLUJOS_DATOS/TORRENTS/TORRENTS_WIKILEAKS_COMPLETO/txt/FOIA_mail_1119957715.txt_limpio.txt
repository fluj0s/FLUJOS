from michael mann mannvirginiaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re fwd re need help date tue 28 jun 2005 072155 0400 hi keith thanksyes we seem to back in the days of mccarthyism in the states fortunately we have some good people who will represent us legally pro bono and in the best case scenario this backfires on these thugs the response of the wording is likely to change dramatically after consulation w lawyers etc but any feedback on the substance would nonetheless be very helpful thanks for both your help and your support mike at 0548 am 6282005 you wrote mike just in and seeing this for time will digest but do not like look or implications of this at all keith at 1700 25062005 you wrote timkeithphil please see attached letter from the us house republicans as tom has mentioned below it would be very helpful if i can get feedback from you all as i proceed w drafting formal response thanks in advance for any help mike date sat 25 jun 2005 093649 0600 from

amavisdnew at fork9mailvirginiaedu mike there are broader implications of this so it is important to respond well it is pity you have to be the guinea pig after what you have gone through already but you have many supporters i would not advise legal route i think you need to consider this as just another set of referees comments and respond simply clearly and directly on the science side the key point is that the mm criticisms are unfounded although this may be difficult remember that this is not really criticism of you personally but one aspect of criticism of the foundations of global warming science by people both inside and outside of congress who have ulterior motives there may in fact be an opportunity here as you know we suspect that there has been an abuse of the scientific review process at the journal editor level the method is to choose reviewers who are sympathetic to the antigreenhouse view recent papers in grl including the mm paper have clearly not been reviewed by appropriate people we have strong suspicion that this is the case but of course proof because we do not know who the reviewers of these papers have been perhaps now is the time to make this direct accusation and request or demand that this information be made available in order to properly defend the good science it is essential that the reasons for bad science appearing in the literature be investigated the lever here is that the subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the house committee on energy and commerce is suggesting that your papers are bad science and asking their point 8e for the identity of people who reviewed your work in response it is completely fair and justifiable to point out that it is the papers that criticize your and related work that are bad science and that through the subcommittee you can request the identities of the reviewers of all of these critical papers starting with mm when you respond there are number of items that require direct response from you alone there are also number of scientific points where you could give multiauthored response there are many people who have expertise in this area and familiarity with the scientific issues who i am sure would be willing to join you i would be happy to do so at this stage however i would keep the group small few others could be added to the original email list nevertheless i took the liberty of copying your plea and the subcommittees letter to caspar ammann primarily because i think he can help with the scientific aspects better than most people after all he has been able to follow your method and reproduce your results he has shown the flaws in mms work he has investigated the bristlecone pine issue and he has made all his software available on the web the others who could be added at this early stage are ray bradley and malcolm hughes your coconspirators and perhaps phil jones keith briffa and tim osborn i do not know how powerful these alien opinions may be in the present parochial context but i note that the instigators of all this are canadians and that the science has national boundaries phil keith and tim are useful because they have demonstrated the flaws in the von storch work which is i assume the science paper that the subcommittees letter referes to word of warning i would be careful about using other independent paleo reconstruction work as supporting the mbh reconstructions i am attaching my version of comparison of the bulk of these other reconstructions although these all show the hockey stick shape the differences between them prior to 1850 make very nervous if i were on the greenhouse deniers side i would be inclined to focus on the wide range of paleo results and the differences between them as an argument for dismissing them all i attach also run with magicc using centralestimate climate model parameters dt2x 26 degc etc see the tar and forcings used by caspar in the runs with paleocsm i have another figure somewhere that compares magicc with paleocsm the agreement is nearly perfect given that csm has internally generated noise while magicc is pure signal the support for the hockey stick is not just the paleo reconstructions but also the model results if one takes the best estimates of past forcing off the shelf then the model results show the hockey stick shape tuning or fudging here this is totally independent analysis and critics of the paleo data if they disbelieve these data have to explain why models get the same result of course von storchs model results do not show such good century timescale agreement but this is because he uses silly forcing and has failed to account for the fact that his model was not in equilibrium at the start of the run the subject of tim osborn et als submitted paper this is pain in the but but it will all work out well in the end unintentional pun sorry good science will prevail best wishes tom michael oppenheimer wrote michael this is outrageous
