questions and crs report rs20710 title ix and sex discrimination in education an overview background the history of professional and amateur sports in the united states is replete with legal battles congressional investigations and regulatory and legislative actions the perception that sports is public trust and must be protected has resulted in congresss implementing public policy with the underlying objective of guaranteeing the public fair access to sports congressional and other governmental action over the last three decades has had several public policy objectives it has promoted parity in competition attempted to reduce racial and gender discrimination facilitated spectator access through television and diminished athlete exploitation in general it could be said that congresses prior to 1960 assumed the role of sports facilitator rather than the more modern role of sports regulator often content to let amateur and professional sports regulatory bodies monitor and correct problems within their sports after 1960 dramatic growth both monetary and in popularity of the sports industry television played huge role in that process and conflicts within the sports industry congressional research service the library of congress crs2 served to draw greater congressional attention often at the request of the sports industry itself the advent of televised broadcasting of sports events and the ever greater economic returns on sports activities combined to make sports and its problems like player strikes and team relocations more visible to the public and government officials the inability or unwillingness of major sports organizations to regulate and manage their own affairs properly was also coming into question the public image of sports as recreation and diversion was giving way to one of sports as big business the clash of these two different images of the sports industry became apparent with the establishment of the house select committee on professional sports in 1976 the select committee was charged with conducting an investigation into all aspects of professional sports for the express purpose of determining the need for legislation or other forms of government intervention all of the major professional sports were investigated congressional intervention it was determined might be required to reduce the detrimental impact of money on the intrinsic value of athlete competition during this same period amateur athletics also came under increased scrutiny president gerald r ford with executive order 11868 of june 19 1975 created the presidents commission on olympic sports this panel was charged with investigating the conduct and supervision of olympic sports and contributed to the development of the amateur sports act of 1978 this act restructured the united states olympic committee to lessen the ongoing conflict among various us amateur sports organizations the investigation was considered necessary because the conflict within the amateur sports industry was detrimental to american olympic efforts congress had passed title ix of the education amendments of 1972 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities receiving federal funding although title ix was not aimed specifically at sports it has become instrumental in promoting sports equality for female athletes at high schools and colleges around the nation it continues to be controversial and highly debated law the executive branch has also been active in making sports policy the federal communications commission the national labor relations board the department of labor the immigration and naturalization service the justice department and other federal agencies have all played key roles in amateur and professional sports issues over the last 30 years those who seek the intervention of congress the executive branch or the courts in the problems of amateur and professional sports do so because private sports organizations that control sports enterprises are sometime perceived either properly or improperly as unable or unwilling to protect the public interest in these matters in small way the tremendous growth in the monetary value of professional sports teams to owners and local communities rising player salaries and more effective player unions escalating television and cable revenues and increasing competition for limited sports programing demands for gender and racial equity and taxpayer investments in stadiums and us held olympic games have only raised the level of and potential for conflict in the sports world congress and other government institutions now find themselves playing the roles of regulators arbiters facilitators sports reformers and guardians of the public trust because of the ongoing popularity of sporting events the potential for great monetary rewards and conflict among the many competing actors in the sports industry congressional interest oversight and intervention in matters concerning the sports industry seem unlikely to diminish crs3 sports legislation in the 106th congress immigration s 262the baseball diplomacy act
