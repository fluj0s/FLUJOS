legislation to reauthorize and amend programs that were created or revised in the 1996 welfare reform law early in 2005 the senate committees on finance and h ealth education labor and pensions help reported their welfare reauthoriza tion legislation respectively s 667 and s 525 these bills have yet to see floor action and remain pe nding in the senate the house passed welfare reauthoriza tion as part of its spending budget reconciliation bill the hous epassed version of s 1932 the senatepassed spending reconciliation bill does not include welfare reau thorization provisions both the senate finance committee bill and the house reconciliation bill would reauthorize through fy2010 and revise the block grant of temporary assistance for needy families tanf they both revise tanf work participation standards aimed to require more families on the welfare rolls to work or participate in job preparation activities the senate committee bill would allow broad range of activities engaged in by recipients to count toward meeting these standards while the house bill would narrow the focus of activities to work or workfare outside of fourmonth period both the senate co mmittee and house reconciliation bills also would establish 200 million per year in gr ants to promote healthy marriages both the senate committee and house reconciliation bills would extend and increase funding for mandatory child care though the size of the funding increase is major difference between the two proposals 6 billion over five years in the senate committee bill and 05 billi on over five years in the house bill both would also reauthorize the child care and development block grant ccdbg increasing its authorization to 31 billion by fy2010 and would revise ccdbg rules including those related to making schoolr eadiness program goal and increasing the percentage of funds to impr ove the quality of child care both the senate committee and house reconciliation bills would revise the child support enforcement program to provide financing options for states to pay more collected child support to families on tanf or who have left the rolls generally federal and st ate governments keep child support collected for tanf families as reimbursement for their welfare costs the senate committee bill would provide partial fede ral funding for child support pa ssed through to families up to 400 per month for one child and 600 per m onth for two or more children the house bill would provide par tial federal funding to stat that increase the amount of passedthrough child support the h ouse reconciliation bill also would reduce federal funding to the states to operate their child s upport programs both senate committee and house bills would also blish responsible fatherhood programs to fund activities to increase the particip ation of noncustodial parents in their childrens lives the senate committee bill would provide 50 million per year in mandatory funding and authorize nother 26 million per year the house reconciliation bill would aut horize but not provide funding for up to 20 million per year this report w ill be updated as neededhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157contents

and house welfare reauthorization pr oposals have many similarities with both extending basic t anf funding at current levels through fy2010 and incorporating president bush s proposal to provide categorical marriage promotion grants2 both bills also raise tanf work participation standards though the two differ in terms of how much more work would be required and what activities count toward the participation standards tanf funding provisions both the senatecommittee and house bills have very similar funding pr ovisions although they do differ in some details thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157crs4 major differences between the two propos als are in the contingency fund and bonuses basic funding the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 entitled states to basic tanf block grant equal to peak expenditures in the pre1996 welfare programs during the fy1992 to fy 1995 period it also established maintenance of effort moe requirement th at states continue to spend at least 75 80 if state failed tanf work participation requirements of what they spent in these programs in fy1994 cash welfare caseloads were at their peak in the mid1990s both the basic tanf grant and the moe are legislatively fixed they did not change when cash welfare caseloads declined in the mid and late1990s nor did they increase when caseloads in some st ates increased during the recent economic slump neither the basic tanf block grant nor the mo has been adjusted for inflation both the senatecommittee and house pr oposals would continue both the basic block grant and the moe at their current f unding levels without inflation or caseload adjustment through fy2010 supplemental grants during the consideration of legislation that led to the 1996 welfare law fixed funding based on historical expenditures was thought to disadvantage two groups of states 1 those that experience relatively high population growth and 2 those that had hi storically low gran t levels relative to poverty in the state therefore additional funding in the form of supplemental grants was provided to states that met criteria of high population growth andor low historic grants per poor person supplemental gran ts have been provided to 17 states alabama alaska arizona arkansas colo rado florida georgia idaho louisiana mississippi montana new xico nevada north carolin tennessee texas and utah currently supplemental grants total 319 million per year both the senate and house proposals would continue supplementa l grants for the same 17 states at the current funding level through fy2009 unlike other grants which expire in fy2010 contingency funds the fixed basic grant under tanf also led to concerns of inadequate funding dur ing economic downturns t anf includes contingency fund which is designed to provi extra matching grants to states that meet criteria of economic need based on unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads and have state expenditures in excess of their fy1994 level the two bills differ substantially in their proposed revisions to the tanf contingency fund the house budget rec onciliation bill would continue the fund under existing rules with some relatively minor modifications allowing some additional state spending to count to ward meeting the fy1994 f unding level threshold and modifications to increase grants for states that qualify for funds for only part of the year the senate finance committee proposal fully revamps the contingency fund it would eliminate the requirement that states increase expenditures from their own funds bove the regular tanf moe level and would eliminate the matchinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157crs5 requirements instead it re quires that unspent tanf balances be below certain threshold to qualify for contingency f unds the senate committee proposal would base contingency grants on portion of the estimated cost of increased cash assistance caseloads it also would revise the criteria of economic need for state bonus funds current tanf law provides bonus funds to states that rank high on set of outcomes that seek to measure whether they are achieving the block grants goals it has high perform ance bonus of 200 million per year for states that rank high in achieving employment and certain other outcomes as well as second 100 million per year bonus paid to the five states with the greatest reduction in outofwedlock birth ratios that also have decline in abortions the senate finance committee bill scal back bonuses by eliminating the 100 million per year bonus for reductions in outofwedlock births and reducing and refocusing the high performance b onus on employment outcomes funding reductions are used to pay for grants to promote healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood initiatives see discussion of these initiatives below the house budget reconciliation bill eliminates both tanf bonuses in part to pay for grants to promote healthy marriage and in part achieving budget reductions uses of grants and program requirements federal tanf grants and moe funds can be used for wide range of benefits services and activities to assist lowincome families with children and to further tanf goals of reducing outofwedlock births and promoting twoparent families tanf grants can also be transferred to other block gr ant programs up to 30 of the grant can be transferred to the child care and development fund ccdf and to the social services block grant the limit on transfers to ssb g alone is set at 425 though annual appropriations have restored the ssbg tran sfer limit to its original limit of 10 set in the 1996 welfare law within the overall 30 limit federa l tanf funds may also be used as the state match for federal reverse commuter grants if the program benefits welfare families both bills would set the ssbg transfer limit permanently at 10 the house budget reconciliation bill would raise the overall transfer limit to 50 the senate finance committee proposal would reta in the current 30 transfer limit both bills include provisions to ease so rules regarding use of tanf funds both house and senate committee bills would allow states to use carryover tanf funds for any tanf benefit and service current law restricts the use of carryover funds for the provision of assistance narrow the definition of assistance to exclude all child care and transportation aid tanf funds spent on assistance trigger certain program requirements such as work requirements time limits assignment of child support paymen ts and data reporting under current regulations child care nd transportation aid for nonworking families is counted as assistance and triggers these requirements the bills would eliminate such aid from the definition ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157crs6 assistance freeing from these requirements nonw orking families that receive only child care or transportation aid work requirements both the senate finan ce committee b ill and the house budget reconciliation bill incorporate the bush administrations universal engagement proposal which requires states to develop selfsuffi ciency plan for all tanf adult recipients to monitor progre ss toward that plan the house budget reconciliation bill also requires states to end benefits full family sanction for families that fail to comply with work participation rules both the senate finance committee b ill and house budget reconciliation bill would substantially revise tanf work participation standards both bills would raise work participation standards that states must meet from the current laws standard of 50 to 70 raise the required hours of working to receive full credit and provide partial credit for participating families that do not meet the full credit standard and revise the list of activities that recipients may participate in for states to receive credit toward tanf standards however the bills differ in how they do these three things participation standards current law requires states to have specified percentage of their families with an adu lt recipient or minor head of household participating in creditable work activities the current participation standard is 50 states are subject to an additional participation rate standard for twoparent families currently 90 the participation rate standards may be reduced for caseload reductions not attributable to policy changes that occurred since enactment of welfare reform fy1995 this caseload re duction credit has had large effect on participation standards reducing the standard considerably from its statutory rate in fy2003 the standard was reduced to 0 for 20 states both the senate finance committee bill and the house budget reconc iliation bill would raise the work participation sta ndard for all families to 70 by fy2010 and eliminate the separate standard for twoparent families both bills would also change the credits that reduce these standards from their statutory rate ie reduce the 70 standard to lower rate but they do so in different ways the house bill would retain but revise the current law caseloa d reduction credit so that caseload change would be measured from more recent year rather than the prewelfare reform caseload level of 1995 u ltimately caseload reduction w ould be measured based on the most recent four years the house bill also includes provision to give an additional credit to states that achieved caseload reduction of 60 or more from fy1995 to fy2001 the senate finance committee bill retains the current caseload reduction credit for fy2006 and fy2007 but begi nning in fy2008 w ould repl ace the caseload reduction credit with credit for employed welfare leavers the bill would also cap all credits against the participation standard so that the minimum effective standard would be 10 in fy2006 20 in fy2007 30 in fy2008 40 in fy2009 and 50 in fy2010 there is such minimum effective standard in the house bill hours standards current law requires that family be considered participating only if it participates for minimum number of hours per week in ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157crs7 month under current law 20 hours are requi red for single parents with preschool child under the age of 6 and 30 hours are required for other families higher hours are set for the purposes of the two parent work par ticipation rate both the senate finance committee bill and the house budget reconciliation bill raise the hours standards the house bill incorporates 40hour workweek standard for full credit but would also provide partial credit for families with at least 24 hours of participation special lowerhour standard would be provided for single parents with preschoolers the senate finance committee bill also ra ises the hours standard for full credit but to lesser extent than proposed in the house bill single parents with preschool child would be given full credit for participation at 24 hours per week and other singleparent families w ould be given full credit at 34 hours per week partial credit for single parent families would be provided at 20 hours per week higher hours requirements would appl to twoparent families creditable activities current law lists 12 activ ities that may be counted toward tanf work participa tion standards the bulk of countable pa rticipation is in subset of core activities focuse d on work timelimited job search countable for six weeks in fiscal year 12 weeks if criteria of economic need are met timelimited vocational educational training 12 months in lifetime and community service and work experience in meeting the general 30hourperweek standard hours in educati onal activities are countable only for families who are also participating in at least 20 hours per w eek of core activities postsecondary education other than that considered vocational educationa l training does not count toward current law federal t anf work participation standards the house budget reconciliation bill nd the senate finance committee bill differ significantly on the ty pes of activities that are c ountable as core activities toward the participation standards the house bill narrows the list of core activities by eliminating job search and vocational education instead the bill would give states almost total discretion to define activities that would be countable for three months in 24month period four months to complete training but once those months are exhausted the only activities th at would count toward the core work participation standards are work onthejob training community service or work experience moreover since job search and vocational educati on would be countable as sole or primary activities only during the three or four months that the state would have discretion any w eeks of participation in job search reduce the number of weeks that vocational education counts toward th participation standards on the other hand the senate finance committee bill retains the current law list of core activities it too provides states additional discretion by permitting states to count an expanded list of activities for thr ee months in 24month period longer for rehabilitative activities however this additional discretion is provided in addition to rather than instead of six weeks of job search and 12 months of vocational educational training which are retained as core activities both the house budget reconciliation bill and the senate finance committee bill would give states additiona l discretion in defining ac tivities countable once familyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157crs8 has met the core work requirement gener ally 24 hours per week in core activities the house bill would allow states to define activities for families with at least 24 hours in core activities th senate finance committee b ill would allow states to count an expanded set of ac tivities for singleparent fa milies with at least 24 hours per week in core activities the senate finance committee proposal in cludes some additional options for counting participation in activities toward tanf work standards it would allow states to have up to 10 of their caseloa d enrolled in special program of two or fouryear undergraduate educa tion or vocational educationa l training this program is modeled after the parents as scholars program that has operated in maine using tanf moe funds it also allows for pa rticipation in reha bilitative activities for disabled persons including treatment of drug and alcohol abuse if they combine rehabilitation with at l east 10 hours of core activ ities and if the state develops collaborative relationship between agencies and entities providing rehabilitative services and the state tanf agency additionally the senate finance committee bill allows caring for disabled family mber to count as work activity under certain circumstances marriage promotion grants and family formation issues current law allows states to use tanf funds for any activity reasonably calculated to achieve tanf purpose one of the st atutory purposes of tanf is to end dependency of needy parents on government benefits and one of the stated means to end such dependency is marriage another of the statutory purposes of tanf is to promote the formation and maintenance of twoparent families promoting marriage is currently allowable use of tanf funds both the senate finance committee and house budget reconciliation bills would carve out special m arriage promotion grants from existing tanf funding both bills include 100 million in competitivel awarded matching funds for states territories and tribes for marriage promotion activities the bills would allow states to use other federal tanf funds or state funds as the match for these new marriage promotion grants both bills also would provide an additional 100 million for research and demonstrations the house budget reconc iliation bill would require that these funds be used primarily for marriage promotion the senate finance committee bill would require that 80 of these f unds be used for marriage promotion marriage promotion activities listed in both bills are public advertising campaigns on the value of marriage and skills needed to increase marital stability and health education in high schools on the va lue of marriage marriage education and marriage and relationship sk ills programs for nonmarried parents or expectant parents premarital ducation on marriage for engaged couples marriage enhancement and marriage skills training for married couples divorce education programs and marriage mentor ing programs programs to reduce the disincentives to marriage in needbased programs could be funded from these grants only if offered in conjunction with other marriage activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157crs9 3 child care provisions submitted to the house budget comm ittee by the committee on ways and means ie the mandatory child car funding provisions are found in title viii of the budget reconciliation bill whereas pr ovisions recommended by the committee on education and the workforce ie amendments to the ccdbg act are found in title ii both bills have requirements that grantees of marriage promotion grants consider domestic violence issues and that participation in marriage promotion activities be voluntary the senate committee bill also includes prohibition not in the house bill against states sancti oning families receiving tanf assistance for not participating in marriage promotion activities child care while the house budget reconciliation gislation consolidates package of provisions embodying child care reau thorization in single bill3 at this point on the senate side reauthorization provisions remain divided between the two bills s 667 and s 525 the caring for children act of 2005 the finance committee passed bill s 667 contains the proposed mandatory funding ppropriation for child care and development block grant ccdbg programs while the help committeepassed bill s 525 include s proposed discretionary funding authorization and all provisi ons relating to the reauthor ization of the ccdbg act therefore in the child care section of table 2 most provisions in the senate column are drawn from s 525 with the notable exception of the mandatory or entitlement funding provision whic h falls under the finance committees jurisdiction and is therefore included in s 667 summary of provisions included in both the house bill and senate committee legislation follows with more detail found in table 2 discretionary authorization the discretionary portion of child care funding is authorized by the child care and deve lopment block grant act as amended in 1996 under current law di scretionary ccdbg funding is authorized at 1 billion annually however actual appropriation levels determined during the annual appropriations proce ss have exceeded the authorized level eg fy2005 21 billion both the house budget reconciliation bill nd s 525 propose to authorize discretionary funding at 23 billion in fy2006 rising by 200 million each year up to 31 billion in fy2010 mandatory appropriation mandatory funding for the ccdbg was preappropriated in s ection 418 of the social security act for fy19972002 as part of the welfare law of 1996 pl 104193 series of temporary extensions have continued that funding at the fy2002 rate of 2717 billion since the close of fy2002 the most recent extensi on runs through december 31 2005 the house budget reconciliation bill propos to increase mandatory child care funding by 500 million over five year s fy2006 fy2010 appropriating 2917 billion for fy2006 2767 billion for fy2007 2817 billion for fy2008 2867 billion for fy 2009 and 2917 billion for fy2010 this reflects half of the 1 billion increase that had earlier been propos ed in hr 240 the senate committee bill s 667 proposes to increase mandatory funding by 6 billion over five yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157crs10 fy2006fy2010 appropriating 3617 billion for fy2006 3717 billion for fy2007 3917 billion for fy2008 4017 billion for fy2009 and 4317 billion for fy2010 puerto rico would receive 75 million of the 6 billion whereas under current law as well as the house bill pu erto rico receives mandatory child care funding authority to transfer tanf funds under current law states have the authority to transfer up to 30 of th eir annual tanf block grant to the ccdbg only 20 if they choose to transfer 10 to the social services block grant s 667 would maintain current law whereas the house bill would allow states to transfer up to 50 of their annual tanf grants to the ccdbg use of funds for direct services current law includes provision requiring given percentage of funds ppropriated under the ccdbg act to be spent on direct services s 525 would require th at after the reservation of setasides at least 70 of the funds remaining be used to fund direct services as defined by the state the house bill has comparable provision option to use excess funds for increasing payment rates s 525 would allow states that receive funding above their fy2005 levels to use portion of the excess to support payment rate increas for providers and to establish tiered payment rates on related note the bi ll s 525 would also add to the statute stricter requirements to set payment rates in accordance with biennial market rate surveys quality setaside current law requires that at least 4 of each states total ccdbg expenditures from all sources g mandatory disc retionary matching funds be used for qua lity activ ities described as providi ng comprehensive consumer education to parents and the public activities that increase parental choice and activities designed to improve the quality and availability of child care in the state both the house budget reconciliation bill and the help committees s 525 would

what is classified as quality activity in each categories of activities are outlined to in clude school readine ss activities including activities to enhance early literacy training and professional development for staff and initiatives or programs to promote or increase retention of qualified staff the categories reflect new emphasis on school r eadiness as goal of the ccdbg the senate committee bill s 525 also specifies that quality funds could be spent on evaluating and assessing the quality of programs and their effectiveness in improving overall school preparedness while s 525 clearly states that quality funds must be spent for any of the six listed purposes the house bill provides three broad categories similar in topic to those in s 525 with fourth more general category of other

specified elements addressing areas such as parental choice parental access consumer education licensing and health and safe ty requirements both the house budget reconciliation bill and the help

addressing special needs child care unlike the house bill s 525 includes provisions requiri ng that in their state plans states demonstrate that the process for redetermining eligibility occur more frequently than every six months with limited exceptions and also that the state plan describe any training requirements in effect for ch ild care providers the senate committee bill would also put into statute the requirement that the provider payment rates described in the state plan be set in accordance with statistically valid and reliable biennial survey of market ra tes without reducing the number of families served state plans would also be required to include the results of those surveys and to contain description of how the state will provide for timely payment to providers results of the survey would also be required to be ma available to the public later than 30 days after the surveys completion data collection and reporting requirements current law specifies set of data reporting requirements for states to collect in the administration of their ccdbg programs states collect data on monthly basis and submit to the department of health and human services hhs disaggregated data on quarterly basis an aggregate report is required to be submitted to hhs on an annual basis s 525 would retain the quart erly reporting in current law but would amend the list of

enforcement over the years the cse program has evolved into multifaceted program while costrecovery still remains an important function of the program other aspects of the program include service delivery and promotion of selfsufficiency and parental responsibility the cse program has helped strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services child support payments now are generally recognized as very important income source for singleparent families on average child support constitutes 17 of family inco for households that receive it 2001 data among poor families who receive it child suppor t constitutes about 30 of family income 2001 data both s 667 and the house budget reconc iliation bill would seek to improve the cse program and raise collections so as to increase the economic independence of former welfare families and provide stable source of income for all singleparent families with noncustodial parent although both bills share identical objectives with respect to simplifying cse assignment and distribution rules and strengthening the familyfirst policies star ted in the1996 welfare reform law the approaches used differ both bills would revise some cse enforcement tools and add others this section of the report does not discuss all of the cse provisions included in s 667 and the house bill for description of all of the cse provisions in s 667 as reported by the senate finance committee and the house budget reconciliation bill see table 2 in the last section of this report the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the senate finance committeereported bill would in crease federal outlays in the cse program by 628 million over the period fy2006fy2010 whereas the house budget reconciliation bill would reduce federal outlays in the cse program by 4899 billion over the period fy2006fy2010 the following two cse provisions in the house bill comprise most of the budget reductions ie savings phased in reduction of the matching rate for administrative expe nses from 66 to 50 which saves 38 billion over the fiveyear period and an elimination of the federal match when states spend cse incentive payments ie reinvest cse incentive payments back into the program saving 16 billion over the fiveyear period assignment of child support rights as condition of receiving tanf benefits family must assign their child suppor t rights to the state assignment ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157crs16 determine who has legal claim on the child support payments owed by the noncustodial parent the child support ssignment covers any child support that accrues while the family receives tanf bene fits as well as any child support that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits assigned child support collections are not paid to families but rather this revenue is kept by states and the federal government as partial reimburse ment for welfare benefits nonwelfare families who apply for cse services do not ssign their child support rights to the state and thereby receive all of the child support collected on their behalf an extremely important feature of the ssignment process is the date on which an assignment was entered if the assign ment was entered on or before september 30 1997 then preassistance and duringa ssistance arrearages are permanently assigned to the state if the assign ment was entered on or after october 1 1997 then only the arrearages which accumulate while the family receives assistance are permanently assigned the familys preassistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and the right to those arrearages goes back to the family when it leaves tanf unless the arrearages are collected through the federal income tax refund offset program under s 667 as reported by the senate finance committee the child support assignment would only cover any child s upport that accrues while the family receives tanf benefits this would mean that any child support arrearages that accrued before the family started receiving tanf be nefits would not have to be assigned to the state even temporarily and thereby an child support collected on behalf of the formertanf family for preassistance arrearages would go to the family the house bill includes similar provision distribution of child support distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid in accordance with the assignment rules in other words the distribution rules determine which claim is paid first when child support collection occurs the order of pa yment of the child support collection is of tremendous importance because in many cases pastdue child support ie arrearages are never fully paid tanf families while the family r eceives tanf benefits the state is permitted to retain any curre nt support and any assigned arrearages it collects up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits wh ich has been paid to the family the 1996 welfare law pl 104193 repealed the 50 required pass through and gave states the choice to decide how much if an of the state share some all none of child support payments collected on behalf of tanf fam ilies to send the family states also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family while states have discretion over their share of child support collections pl 104193 required states to pay the federal g overnment the federal governments share of child support collections collected on be half of tanf families this means that the state and not the federal government bears the entire cost of any child support passed through to and disregarded by fa milies as of august 2004 18 states were continuing the 50 or higher in one state passthrough and disr egard policy that had been in effect pre1996httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157crs17 both bills would provide incentives in the form of federal cost sharing to states to direct more of the child support coll ected on behalf of tanf families to the families themselves often referred to as familyfirst policy as opposed to using such collections to reimburse state and federal coffers for welfare benefits paid to the families however the approaches of the bills differ with respect to the amount of federal costsharing provided and whether to help states pay for the current cost of their cse passthrough and disr egard policies or to encourage states to establish such policies or increase the passthrough and disregard already in place under s 667 as reported by the nate finance committee the federal government would share in the costs of the entire amount of passthrough and disregard policies used by states s 667 would allow states to pay up to 400 per month in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family 600 per month to family with two or more children to the family and would not require the state to pay the federal government the federal share of those payments in order for the federal government to share in th cost of the child support passthrough the state would be required to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining the familys tanf benefit unlike s 667 the house bill is intended to provide states with an incentive to increase their passthrough and disregard policies the house budget reconciliation bill would allow states to increase the am ount of collected child support they pay to families receiving tanf benef its and would not require th state to pay the federal government the federal share of the in creased payments the subsidized child support passthrough payments would be the amount above any payments the state was making on december 31 2001 the house bill would limit the federal governments costsharing of the new pa ssthrough payments to the greater of 100 per month or 50 per month more than the state previously was sharing with the family in order for the federal government to share in the cost of an increase in the child support passthrough the state would be required to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining the familys tanf benefit former tanf families pursuant to the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 beginning on october 1 2000 states must distribute to former tanf families the following child support collections first before the state and the federal government

any arrearages that accrued before the family began receiving tanf bene fits any child support arrearages that accrue during the time the family is on t anf belong to the state and federal government one of the goals of the 1996 welfare reform law with regard to cse distribution provisions was to create distribution priority that favored families once they leave the tanf rolls thus generally speaking under current law child support that accrues before and after family receives tanf goes to the family whereas child support that accrues while the family is receiving tanf goes to the state this additional family income is expected to reduce dependence on public assistance by both promoting exit from tanf and preventing entry and reentry to tanfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33157crs18 s 667
