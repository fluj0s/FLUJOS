believes is based on questionable economic assumptions prev alent in the 1930s and likely fosters anticompetitive behavior r eport on the robinson patman act united states department of justice 1977 at 149general overview of united states antitrust law introduction there are two basic antitrust laws in the united states the sherman act and the clayton act both are enforceable either by the antitrust division of the department of justice the federal tr ade commission or private persons alleging economic injury caused by violation of either of them in addition the federal trade commission ftc act and the robinsonpatman act may also be utilized by the commission1 and private persons only the co mmission however ie neither the antitrust division nor private persons may enforce the ftc act together they spell out the conduct and ac tivities prohibited in economic market transactions there are also some statutes directed to specific industr ies or types of transactions which indicate the likely antitrust conseque nces for economic conduct in those areas this report briefly summarizes 1 the primary united states antitrust statutes and 2 some of the activities which are generally considered to be violations of those laws there is also some reference to the prohibition against unfair competition and the unfairness jurisdiction of the fede ral trade commission ftc there is not however any discussion of the extraterritori reach of the united states antitrust laws save the cursory material in footnote 4 subject which is beyond the scope of this brief report further the laws whose descriptions follow do not constitute all of the statutes which may be applicable to or implicated in antitrust issues but rather are those which are most often utilized in reading the information presented readers should bear in mind that the antitrust laws are concerned with the functioning of the marketplace ie competition and not the protection of any individual competitor httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31026crs2 2standard oil co of new jersey v unite d states 221 us 1 60 1911 and as the contracts or acts embraced in the provisio n were not expressly defined since the enumeration addressed itself simply to classe s of acts those classes being broad enough to embrace every conceivable contract or combina tion which would be made concerning trade or commerce or the subjects of such commerce and thus caused any act done by any of the enumerated methods anywhere in the whole field of human activity to be illegal if in restraint of trade it inevitabl follows that the provision necessarily called for the exercise of judgment which required that some standard should be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the prohibitions contained in the statute had or had not in any given case been violated thus it follows that it was intended that the standard of reason was intended to be the measure used for the purpose of determining whether in given case particular act had or had not brought about the wrong agains t which the statute provided board of trade of the city of chicago v united states 246 us 231 238 1918 but the legality of an agreement cannot be determined by so simple test as whether it restrains competition every agreement concerning trade every regulation of trade restrains to bind to restrain is of their very essence th true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress of even destroy competition see also

efficiencies generated through merger can enhance the merged firms ability and incentive to compete which may result in lower prices improved quality enhanced service or new products mergers that are

regulation report 348 41097 clayton act 15 usc 1227 section 4 15 usc 15 contains the damage provisions of the antitrust laws 15 usc 15a permits any person injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrus t laws to sue therefor and to recover threefold the damages by him sustained and the cost of suit including reasonable attorneys fee after the supreme court interpreted the words any person to include foreign governments5 the provision was amended in 1982 to restrict foreign states recovery of monetary antitrust damages to actual damages sustained plus costs and reasonable attorneys fees 15 usc 15b the limitation to actual damages was also applicable until late 1990 to monetary injuries sustained by the united states 15 usc 15a that limitation was removed by the 101st congress in hr 29 pl 101588 following much hearing testimony to the effect that the damage limitation made the federal government the antitrust victim of choice trebledamage recovery is now available to the united states as it is to private antitrust plaintiffs pursuant to 15 usc 15 section 7 15 usc 18 is probably the most prominent substantive provision of the clayton act whereas the sherman act was enacted to prohibit concerted activity which actually restrains trade this provision is directed at preventing activity in its incipiency which may tend to restrain trade the merger guidelines issued by the department of justi ce offer an indication of the ways in which mergers and acquisitions will be analyzed by the antitrust division and the ftc6 although they are not binding upon the courts they are considered to be persuasivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31026crs4 7in title ii of the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 pl 95435 8often the second

the clayton act in 19767 to allow the antitrust enforcement agencies the opportunity to examine poten tial mergersacquisitions prior to their consummation it is enforced by both th department of justice and the ftc as originally enacted the provision require d notification with certain enumerated exceptions of all merger or acquisition tr ansactions by persons in or affecting commerce in which either party had nets sales or assets of 10 million and the other party had net sales or ssets of 100 million 15 usc 18aa the reviewing agency had 30 days from the time of notification 15 days in the case of tender offers to review the proposed transaction which could not be consu mmated during that time unless the reviewing agency granted an early termination of the waiting period 15 usc18ab prior to the conclusion of that time the reviewing agency was authorized to seek second round of info rmation which extended the original waiting period by 20 days 10 days in the cas of tender offer 15 usc 18ae8 the focus of the current premerger notification provision is more clearly directed at the consequences of mergerac quisition transaction notification must occur when the transaction will result in the acquiring partys holding assets or voting securities 1 in excess of 200 million or 2 between 50 million and 200 million plus the assets or voting securities of the acquired party either 10 million or 100 million entity being acquired respectively by 100 million or 10 million entity the current provision also extends for merger transactions the period for review of material submitted in response to second request for informa tion from 20 to 30 days and establishes based on the size of the proposed transaction sliding scale of fees required in order for premerger review to begin the fee previously was 45000 irrespective of the size of the transaction the new scale begins at 450009 the penalty for failure to comply with the premerger notification statute remains at 10000 for each day during which person required to report is in violation of the provision10 robinsonpatman act 15 u sc 13 21a 13a 13b broadly the robinsonpatman act which is not technically considered an antitrust statute although its provisions amended the clayton act prohibits price discrimination it mandates that two or mo re purchasers of commodity from the same seller must be charged identical prices there are exceptions to the mandate however such that the act may be seen to prohibit only unjustified price differentiation there are also jurisdictional limits to the act

offenses are those for which there is justification as the supreme court has expressed it there are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use18 the kinds of activities which ar most generally found to be per antitrust offenses and are most likely to be criminally prosecuted include 1 horizontal price fixing 2 vertical price fixing sometimes referred to as resale price maintenance 3 bid rigging 4 market division customer or territorial allocation 5 boycotts concerted refusals to deal 6 tying arrangements if you wa nt x you must also take all of the per offenses as concerted activity in restraint of trade are violations of section 1 of the sherman act rule of reason any antitrustviolative conduct which does not consist of per offense is judged by the reasonableness of the activity even when an otherwise unlawful actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31026crs8 19mergers and acquisitions which by definition involve more than one entity are the exceptions which are most apparent see supra page 1 but even those transactions are most concerned with the antitrust lawfulness and the competitiveness of the resulting entityis found if it is also determined that the ac tion is ancillary to so lawful activity and that its procompetitive consequences outweigh its anticompetitive effects the action may well be found to be not unreasonable vi olation of the antitrust laws in other words the rule of reason involves balancing test there is not for example any per rule against monopoliz ation or attempted monopolization there is fault m onopolization ie situation exists in which there is some magic number beyond which firm may not increase its size or market share the determining factors will include the means by which those numbers were reached in other words the reasonableness of the actions which produced the final entity most rule of reason offenses involve single entity and do not usually violate section 1 of the sherman act
