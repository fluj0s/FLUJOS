agency of the federal government the federal bureau of investigation fbi has the authority and responsibility to investigate all violations of federal law that are not exclusively assigned to another federal agency the fbi is further vested by law and by presidential directives with the primary role in carrying out investigations within the united states of threats to the national security this includes the lead domestic role in investigating international terrorist threats to the united states and in conducting counterintelligence activities to meet foreign entities espionage and intelligence efforts directed against the united states the fbi is also vested with important functions in collecting foreign intelligence as member agency of the us intelligence community the fbi accordingly plays crucial roles in the enforcement of federal law and the proper administration of justice in the united states in the protection of the national security and in obtaining information needed by the united states for the conduct of its foreign affairs these roles reflect the wide range of the fbis current responsibilities and obligations which require the fbi to be both an agency that effectively detects investigates and prevents crimes and an agency that effectively protects the national security and collects intelligence the general objective of these guidelines is the full utilization of all authorities and investigative methods consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states to protect the united states and its people from terrorism and other threats to the national security to protect the united states and its people from victimization by all crimes in violation of federal law and to further the foreign intelligence objectives of the united states at the same time it is axiomatic that the fbi must conduct its investigations and other activities in lawful and reasonable manner that respects liberty and privacy and avoids unnecessary intrusions into the lives of lawabiding people the purpose of these guidelines therefore is to establish consistent policy in such matters they will enable the fbi to perform its duties with effectiveness certainty and confidence and will provide the american people with firm assurance that the fbi is acting properly under the law the issuance of these guidelines represents the culmination of the historical evolution of the fbi and the policies governing its domestic operations subsequent to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states reflecting decisions and directives of the president and the attorney general inquiries and enactments of congress and the conclusions of national commissions it was recognized that the fbis functions needed to be expanded and better integrated to meet contemporary realities continuing coordination is necessary to optimize the fbis performance in both national security and criminal investigations the new reality requires first that the fbi and other agencies do better job of gathering intelligence inside the united states and second that we eliminate the remnants of the old wall between foreign intelligence and domestic law enforcement both tasks must be accomplished without sacrificing our domestic liberties and the rule of law and both depend on building very 5 different fbi from the one we had on september 10 2001 report of the commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction 466 452 2005 in line with these objectives the fbi has reorganized and reoriented its programs and missions and the guidelines issued by the attorney general for fbi operations have been extensively revised over the past several years nevertheless the principal directives of the attorney general governing the fbis conduct of criminal investigations national security investigations and foreign intelligence collection have persisted as separate documents involving different standards and procedures for comparable activities these guidelines effect more complete integration and harmonization of standards thereby providing the fbi and other affected justice department components with clearer more consistent and more accessible guidance for their activities and making available to the public in single document the basic body of rules for the fbis domestic operations these guidelines also incorporate effective oversight measures involving many department of justice and fbi components which have been adopted to ensure that all fbi activities arc conducted in manner consistent with law and policy the broad operational areas addressed by these guidelines are the fbis conduct of investigative and intelligence gathering activities including cooperation and coordination with other components and agencies in such activities and the intelligence analysis and planning functions of the fbi fbi responsibilities federal crimes threats to the national security foreign intelligence part n of these guidelines authorizes the fbi to carry out investigations to detect obtain information about or prevent or protect against federal crimes or threats to the national security or to collect foreign intelligence the major subject areas of information gathering activities under these guidelines federal crimes threats to the national security and foreign intelligence are not distinct but rather overlap extensively for example an investigation relating to international terrorism will invariably crosscut these areas because international terrorism is included under these guidelines definition of threat to the national security because international terrorism subject to investigation within the united states usually involves criminal acts that violate federal law and because information relating to international terrorism also falls within the definition of foreign intelligence likewise counterintelligence activities relating to espionage are likely to concern matters that constitute threats to the national security that implicate violations or potential violations of federal espionage laws and that involve information falling under the definition of foreign intelligence while some distinctions in the requirements and procedures for investigations are necessary in different subject areas the general design of these guidelines is to take uniform 6 approach wherever possible thereby promoting certainty and consistency regarding the applicable standards and facilitating compliance with those standards hence these guidelines do not require that the fbis information gathering activities be differentially labeled as criminal investigations national security investigations or foreign intelligence collections or that the categories of fbi personnel who carry out investigations be segregated from each other based on the subject areas in which they operate rather all of the fbis legal authorities are available for deployment in all cases to which they apply to protect the public from crimes and threats to the national security and to further the united states foreign intelligence objectives in many cases single investigation will be supportable as an exercise of number of these authorities ie as an investigation of federal crime or crimes as an investigation of threat to the national security andor as collection of foreign intelligence 1 federal crimes the fbi has the authority to investigate all federal crimes that are not exclusively assigned to other agencies in most ordinary criminal investigations the immediate objectives include such matters as determining whether federal crime has occurred or is occurring or if planning or preparation for such crime is taking place identifying locating and apprehending the perpetrators and obtaining the evidence needed for prosecution hence close cooperation and coordination with federal prosecutors in the united states attorneys offices and the justice department litigating divisions are essential both to ensure that agents have the investigative tools and legal advice at their disposal for which prosecutorial assistance or approval is needed and to ensure that investigations are conducted in manner that will lead to successful prosecution provisions in many parts of these guidelines establish procedures and requirements for such coordination 2 threats to the national security the fbis authority to investigate threats to the national security derives from the executive order concerning us intelligence activities from delegations of functions by the attorney general and from various statutory sources see eg eo 12333 50 usc 401 et seq 50 usc 1801 et seq these guidelines part vtls specifically define threats to the national security to mean international terrorism espionage and other intelligence activities sabotage and assassination conducted by for or on behalf of foreign powers organizations or persons foreign computer intrusion and other matters determined by the attorney general consistent with executive order 12333 or any successor order activities within the definition of threat to the national security that are subject to investigation under these guidelines commonly involve violations or potential violations of federal criminal laws hence investigations of such threats may constitute an exercise both of the fbis criminal investigation authority and of the fbis authority to investigate threats to the national security as with criminal investigations generally detecting and solving the crimes and eventually arresting and prosecuting the perpetrators are likely to be among the objectives of 7 investigations relating to threats to the national security but these investigations also often serve important purposes outside the ambit of normal criminal investigation and prosecution by providing the basis for and informing decisions concerning other measures needed to protect the national security these measures may include for example excluding or removing persons involved in terrorism or espionage from the united states recruitment of double agents freezing assets of organizations that engage in or support terrorism securing targets of terrorism or espionage providing threat information and warnings to other federal state local and private agencies and entities diplomatic or military actions and actions by other intelligence agencies to counter international terrorism or other national security threats in line with this broad range of purposes investigations of threats to the national security present special needs to coordinate with other justice department components including particularly the justice departments national security division and to share information and cooperate with other agencies with national security responsibilities including other agencies of the us intelligence community the department of homeland security and relevant white house including national security council and homeland security council agencies and entities various provisions in these guidelines establish procedures and requirements to facilitate such coordination 3 foreign intelligence as with the investigation of threats to the national security the fbis authority to collect foreign intelligence derives from mixture of administrative and statutory sources see eg eo 12333 50 usc 401 et seq 50 usc 1801 et seq 28 usc 532 note incorporating pl 108458 20012003 these guidelines part vile define foreign intelligence to mean information relating to the capabilities intentions or activities of foreign governments or elements thereof foreign organizations or foreign persons or international terrorists the fbis foreign intelligence collection activities have been expanded by legislative and administrative reforms subsequent to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks reflecting the fbis role as the primary collector of foreign intelligence within the united states and the recognized imperative that the united states foreign intelligence collection activities become more flexible more proactive and more efficient in order to protect the homeland and adequately inform the united states crucial decisions in its dealings with the rest of the world the collection of information is the foundation of everything that the intelligence community does while successful collection cannot ensure good analytical product the failure to collect information turns analysis into guesswork and as our review demonstrates the intelligence communitys human and technical intelligence collection agencies have collected far too little information on many of the issues we care about most report of the commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction 351 2005 8 these guidelines accordingly provide standards and procedures for the fbis foreign intelligence collection activities that meet current needs and realities and optimize the fbis ability to discharge its foreign intelligence collection functions the authority to collect foreign intelligence extends the sphere of the fbis information gathering activities beyond federal crimes and threats to the national security and permits the fbi to seek information regarding broader range of matters relating to foreign powers organizations or persons that may be of interest to the conduct of the united states foreign affairs the fbis role is central to the effective collection of foreign intelligence within the united states because the authorized domestic activities of other intelligence agencies are more constrained than those of the fbi under applicable statutes and executive order 12333 in collecting foreign intelligence the fbi will generally be guided by nationallydetermined intelligence requirements including the national intelligence priorities framework and the national humint collection directives or any successor directives issued under the authority of the director of national intelligence dn1 as provided in part vhf of these guidelines foreign intelligence requirements may also be established by the president or intelligence community officials designated by the president and by the attorney general the deputy attorney general or an official designated by the attorney general the general guidance of the fbis foreign intelligence collection activities by dniauthorized requirements does not however limit the fbis authority to conduct investigations supportable on the basis of its other authorities to investigate federal crimes and threats to the national security in areas in which the information sought also falls under the definition of foreign intelligence the fbi conducts investigations of federal crimes and threats to the national security based on priorities and strategic objectives set by the department of justice and the fbi independent of dniestablished foreign intelligence collection requirements since the authority to collect foreign intelligence enables the fbi to obtain information pertinent to the united states conduct of its foreign affairs even if that information is not related to criminal activity or threats to the national security the information so gathered may concern lawful activities the fbi should accordingly operate openly and consensually with us persons to the extent practicable when collecting foreign intelligence that does not concern criminal activities or threats to the national security b the fbi as an intelligence agency the fbi is an intelligence agency as well as law enforcement agency its basic functions accordingly extend beyond limited investigations of discrete matters and include broader analytic and planning functions the fbis responsibilities in this area derive from various administrative and statutory sources see eg eo 12333 28 usc 532 note incorporating pl 108458 20012003 and 534 note incorporating pl 109162 1107 enhancement of the fbis intelligence analysis capabilities and functions has consistently been recognized as key priority in the legislative and administrative reform efforts following the 9 september 11 2001 terrorist attacks counterterrorism strategy should encompass specific efforts to enhance the depth and quality of domestic intelligence collection and analysis the fbi should strengthen and improve its domestic intelligence capability as fully and expeditiously as possible by immediately instituting measures to significantly improve strategic analytical capabilities joint inquiiy into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 s rep 351 hr rep 792 107th cong 2d sess 47 2002

the importance of integrated allsource analysis cannot be overstated without it it is not possible to connect the dots final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states 401 408 2004 part iv of these guidelines accordingly authorizes the fbi to engage in intelligence analysis and planning drawing on all lawful sources of information the functions authorized under that part include i development of overviews and analyses concerning threats to and vulnerabilities of the united states and its interests ii research and analysis to produce reports and assessments concerning matters relevant to investigative activities or other authorized fbi activities and iii the operation of intelligence systems that facilitate and support investigations through the compilation and analysis of data and information on an ongoing basis c oversight the activities authorized by these guidelines must be conducted in maimer consistent with all applicable laws regulations and policies including those protecting privacy and civil liberties the justice departments national security division and the fbis inspection division office of general counsel and office of integrity and compliance along with other components share the responsibility to ensure that the department meets these goals with respect to national security and foreign intelligence matters in particular the national security divisions oversight section in conjunction with the fbis office of general counsel is responsible for conducting regular reviews of all aspects of fbi national security and foreign intelligence activities these reviews conducted at fbi field offices and headquarter units broadly examine such activities for compliance with these guidelines and other applicable requirements various features of these guidelines facilitate the national security divisions oversight functions relevant requirements and provisions include i required notification by the fbi to the national security division concerning full investigations that involve foreign intelligence collection or investigation of united states persons in relation to threats of the national security ii annual reports by the fbi to the national security division concerning the fbis foreign 10 intelligence collection program including information on the scope and nature of foreign intelligence collection activities in each fbi field office and iii access by the national security division to information obtained by the fbi through national security or foreign intelligence activities and general authority for the assistant attorney general for national security to obtain reports from the fbi concerning these activities pursuant to thesis guidelines other attorney general guidelines and institutional assignments of responsibility within the justice department additional department components including the criminal division the united states attorneys offices and the office of privacy and civil liberties are involved in the common endeavor with the fbi of ensuring that the activities of all department components are lawful appropriate and ethical as well as effective examples include the involvement of both fbi and prosecutorial personnel in the review of undercover operations involving sensitive circumstances notice requirements for investigations involving sensitive investigative matters as defined in part vtin of these guidelines and notice and oversight provisions for enterprise investigations which may involve abroad examination of groups implicated in the gravest criminal and national security threats these requirements and procedures help to ensure that the rale of law is respected in the departments activities and that public confidence is maintained in these activities 11 i general authorities and principles scope these guidelines apply to investigative activities conducted by the fbi within the united states or outside the territories of all countries they do not apply to investigative activities of the fbi in foreign countries which are governed by the attorney generals guidelines for extraterritorial fbi operations bo general authorities 1 the fbi is authorized to conduct investigations to detect obtain information about and prevent and protect against federal crimes and threats to the national security and to collect foreign intelligence as provided in part n of these guidelines 2 the fbi is authorized to provide investigative assistance to other federal agencies state local or tribal

people the fbi shall fully utilize the authorities provided and the methods authorized by these guidelines to protect the united states and its people from crimes in violation of federal law and threats to the national security and to further the foreign intelligence objectives of the united states 2 choice of methods the conduct of investigations and other activities authorized by these guidelines may present choices between the use of different investigative methods that are each operationally sound and effective but that are more or less intrusive considering such factors as the effect on the privacy and civil liberties of individuals and potential damage to reputation the least intrusive method feasible is to be used in such situations it is recognized 12 however that the choice of methods is matter of judgment the fbi shall not hesitate to use any lawful method consistent with these guidelines even if intrusive where the degree of intrusiveness is warranted in light of the seriousness of criminal or national security threat or the strength of the information indicating its existence or in light of the importance of foreign intelligence sought to the united states interests this point is to be particularly observed in investigations relating to terrorism b united states persons shall be dealt with openly and consensually to the extent practicable when collecting foreign intelligence that does not concern criminal activities or threats to the national security 3 respect for legal rights all activities under these guidelines must have valid purpose consistent with these guidelines and must be carried out in conformity with the constitution and all applicable statutes executive orders department of justice regulations and policies and attorney general guidelines these guidelines do not authorize investigating or collecting or maintaining information on united states persons solely for the purpose of monitoring activities protected by the first amendment or the lawful exercise of other rights secured by the constitution or laws of the united states these guidelines also do not authorize any conduct prohibited by the guidance regarding the use of race by federal law enforcement agencies 4 undisclosed participation in organizations undisclosed participation in organizations in activities under these guidelines shall be conducted in accordance with fbi policy approved by the attorney general 5 maintenance of records under the privacy act the privacy act restricts the maintenance of records relating to certain activities of individuals who are united states persons with exceptions for circumstances in which the collection of such information is pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity or is otherwise authorized by statute 5 usc 552ae7 activities authorized by these guidelines are authorized law enforcement activities or activities for which there is otherwise statutory authority for purposes of the privacy act these guidelines however do not provide an exhaustive enumeration of authorized fbi law enforcement activities or fbi activities for which there is otherwise statutory authority and restriction is implied with respect to such activities carried out by the fbi pursuant to other 13 authorities further questions about the application of the privacy act to authorized activities of the fbi should be addressed to the fbi office of the general counsel the fbi privacy and civil liberties unit or the department of justice office of privacy and civil liberties d nature

april 5 1976 2 status as internal guidance these guidelines are set forth solely for the purpose of internal department of justice guidance they are not intended to do not and may not be relied upon to create any rights substantive or procedural enforceable by law by any party in any matter civil or criminal nor do they place any limitation on otherwise lawful investigative and litigative prerogatives of the department of justice 3 departures from the guidelines departures from these guidelines must be approved by the director of the fbi by the deputy director of the fbi or by an executive assistant director designated 14 by the director if departure is necessary without such prior approval because of the immediacy or gravity of threat to the safety of persons or property or to the national security the director the deputy director or designated executive assistant director shall be notified as soon thereafter as practicable the fbi shall provide timely written notice of departures from these guidelines to the criminal division and the national security division and those divisions shall notify the attorney general and the deputy attorney general notwithstanding this paragraph all activities in all circumstances must be carried out in manner consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states 4 other activities not limited these guidelines apply to fbi activities as provided herein and do not limit other authorized activities of the fbi such as the fbis responsibilities to conduct background checks and inquiries concerning applicants and employees under federal personnel security programs the fbis maintenance and operation of national criminal records systems and preparation of national crime statistics and the forensic assistance and administration functions of the fbi laboratory 15 ii investigations and intelligence gathering this part of the guidelines authorizes the fbi to conduct investigations to detect obtain information about and prevent and protect against federal crimes and threats to the national security and to collect foreign intelligence when an authorized purpose exists the focus of activities authorized by this part may be whatever the circumstances warrant the subject of such an activity may be for example particular crime or threatened crime conduct constituting threat to the national security an individual group or organization that may be involved in criminal or national security threatening conduct or topical matter of foreign intelligence interest investigations may also be undertaken for protective purposes in relation to individuals groups or other entities that may be targeted for criminal victimization or acquisition or for terrorist attack or other depredations by the enemies of the united states for example the participation of the fbi in special events management in relation to public events or other activities whose character may make them attractive targets for terrorist attack is an authorized exercise of the authorities conveyed by these guidelines likewise fbi counterintelligence activities directed to identifying and securing facilities personnel or information that may be targeted for infiltration recruitment or acquisition by foreign intelligence services are authorized exercises of the authorities conveyed by these guidelines the identification and recruitment of human sources who maybe able to provide or obtain information relating to criminal activities information relating to terrorism espionage or other threats to the national security or information relating to matters of foreign intelligence interest is also critical to the effectiveness of the fbis law enforcement national security and intelligence programs and activities undertaken for this purpose are authorized and encouraged the scope of authorized activities under this part is not limited to investigation in narrow sense such as solving particular cases or obtaining evidence for use in particular criminal prosecutions rather these activities also provide critical information needed for broader analytic and intelligence purposes to facilitate the solution and prevention of crime protect the national security and further foreign intelligence objectives these purposes include use of the information in intelligence analysis and planning under part iv and dissemination of the information to other law enforcement intelligence community and white house agencies under part vi information obtained at all stages of investigative activity is accordingly to be retained and disseminated for these purposes as provided in these guidelines or in fbi policy consistent with these guidelines regardless of whether it furthers investigative objectives in narrower or more immediate sense in the course of activities under these guidelines the fbi may incidentally obtain information relating to matters outside of its areas of primary investigative responsibility for example information relating to violations of state or local law or foreign law may be 16 incidentally obtained in the course of investigating federal crimes or threats to the national security or in collecting foreign intelligence these guidelines do not bar the acquisition of such information in the course of authorized investigative activities the retention of such information or its dissemination as appropriate to the responsible authorities in other agencies or jurisdictions part vi of these guidelines includes specific authorizations and requirements for sharing such information with relevant agencies and officials this part authorizes different levels of information gathering activity which afford the fbi flexibility under appropriate standards and procedures to adapt the methods utilized and the information sought to the nature of the matter under investigation and the character of the information supporting the need for investigation assessments authorized by subpart of this part require an authorized purpose but not any particular factual predication for example to carry out its central mission of preventing the commission of terrorist acts against the united states and its people the fbi must proactively draw on available sources of information to identify terrorist threats and activities it cannot be content to wait for leads to come in through the actions of others but rather must be vigilant in detecting terrorist activities to die full extent permitted by law with an eye towards early intervention and prevention of acts of terrorism before they occur likewise in the exercise of its protective functions the fbi is not constrained to wait until information is received indicating that particular event activity or facility has drawn the attention of those who would threaten the national security rather the fbi must take the initiative to secure and protect activities and entities whose character may make them attractive targets for terrorism or espionage the proactive investigative authority conveyed in assessments is designed for and may be utilized by the fbi in the discharge of these responsibilities for example assessments may be conducted as part of the fbis special events management activities more broadly detecting and interrupting criminal activities at their early stages and preventing crimes from occurring in the first place is preferable to allowing criminal plots and activities to come to fruition hence assessments may be undertaken proactively with such objectives as detecting criminal activities obtaining information on individuals groups or organizations of possible investigative interest either because they may be involved in criminal or national securitythreatening activities or because they may be targeted for attack or victimization by such activities and identifying and assessing individuals who may have value as human sources for example assessment activities may involve proactively surfing the internet to find publicly accessible websites and services through which recruitment by terrorist organizations and promotion of terrorist crimes is openly taking place through which child pornography is advertised and traded through which efforts are made by sexual predators to lure children for purposes of sexual abuse or through which fraudulent schemes are perpetrated against the public the methods authorized in assessments are generally those of relatively low intrusiveness such as obtaining publicly available information checking government records 17 and requesting information from members of the public these guidelines do not impose supervisory approval requirements in assessments given the types of techniques that are authorized at this stage eg perusing the internet for publicly available information however fbi policy will prescribe supervisory approval requirements for certain assessments considering such matters as the purpose of the assessment and the methods being utilized beyond the proactive information gathering functions described above assessments may be used when allegations or other information concerning crimes or threats to the national security is received or obtained and the matter can be checked out or resolved through the relatively nonintrusive methods authorized in assessments the checking of investigative leads in this manner can avoid the need to proceed to more formal levels of investigative activity if the results ofan assessment indicate that further investigation is not warranted subpart b of this part authorizes second level of investigative activity predicated investigations the purposes or objectives of predicated investigations are essentially the same as those of assessments but predication as provided in these guidelines is needed generally allegations reports facts or circumstances indicative of possible criminal or national securitythreatening activity or the potential for acquiring information responsive to foreign intelligence requirements and supervisory approval must be obtained to initiate predicated investigations corresponding to the stronger predication and approval requirements all lawful methods may be used in predicated investigations classified directive provides further specification concerning circumstances supporting certain predicated investigations predicated investigations that concern federal crimes or threats to the national security are subdivided into preliminary investigations and full investigations preliminary investigations may be initiated on the basis of any allegation or information indicative of possible criminal or national securitythreatening activity but more substantial factual predication is required for full investigations while time limits are set for the completion of preliminary investigations full investigations may be pursued without preset limits on their duration the final investigative category under this part of the guidelines is enterprise investigations authorized by subpart c which permit general examination of the structure scope and nature of certain groups and organizations enterprise investigations are type of full investigations hence they are subject to the purpose approval and predication requirements that apply to full investigations and all lawful methods may be used in carrying them out the distinctive characteristic of enterprise investigations is that they concern groups or organizations that may be involved in the most serious criminal or national security threats to the public generally patterns of racketeering activity terrorism or other threats to the national security or the commission of offenses characteristically involved in terrorism as described in 18 usc 2332bg5b broad examination of the characteristics of groups satisfying these criteria is authorized in enterprise investigations including any relationship of the group to foreign power its size and composition its geographic dimensions and finances its past acts and goals and its capacity for harm 18 assessments 1 purposes assessments maybe carried out to detect obtain information about or prevent or protect against federal crimes or threats to the national security or to collect foreign intelligence 2 approval the conduct of assessments is subject to any supervisory approval requirements prescribed by fbi policy 3 authorized activities activities that maybe carried out for the purposes described in paragraph 1 in an assessment include seeking information proactively or in response to investigative leads relating to i activities constituting violations of federal criminal law or threats to the national security ii the involvement or role of individuals groups or organizations in such activities or iii matters of foreign intelligence interest responsive to foreign intelligence requirements b identifying and obtaining information about potential targets of or vulnerabilities to criminal activities in violation of federal law or threats to the national security c seeking information to identify potential human sources assess the suitability credibility or value of individuals as human sources validate human sources or maintain the cover or credibility of human sources who may be able to provide or obtain information relating to criminal activities in violation of federal law threats to the national security or matters of foreign intelligence interest and d obtaining information to inform or facilitate intelligence analysis and planning as described in part iv of these guidelines 19 4 authorized methods only the following methods may be used in assessments obtain publicly available information b access and examine fbi and other department of justice records and obtain information from any fbi or other department of justice personnel c access and examine records maintained by and request information from other federal state local or tribal or foreign governmental entities or agencies d use online services and resources whether nonprofit or commercial use and recruit human sources in conformity with

paragraph 3c relating to foreign intelligence must be approved by special agent in charge or by an fbi headquarters official as provided in such policy 20 3 circumstances warranting investigation predicated investigation may be initiated on the basis of any of the following circumstances an activity constituting federal crime or threat to the national security has or may have occurred is or may be occurring or will or may occur and the investigation may obtain information relating to the activity or the involvement or role of an individual gr oup or organization in such activity b an individual group organization entity information property or activity is or may be target of attack victimization acquisition infiltration or recruitment in connection with criminal activity in violation of federal law or threat to the national security and the investigation may obtain information that would help to protect against such activity or threat c the investigation may obtain foreign intelligence that is responsive to foreign intelligence requirement 4 preliminary and full investigations predicated investigation relating to federal crime or threat to the national security may be conducted as preliminary investigation or full investigation predicated investigation that is based solely on the authority to collect foreign intelligence may be conducted only as full investigation preliminary investigations i predication required for preliminary investigations preliminary investigation may be initiated on the basis of information or an allegation indicating the existence of circumstance described in paragraph 3ab 11 duration of preliminary investigations preliminary investigation must be concluded within six months of its initiation which may be extended by
