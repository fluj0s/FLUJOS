particularly those most at risk of experiencing negative outcomes in adolescence and adulthood and the adults who support and guide them th origin of the modern youth mentoring concept is credited to the efforts of char ity groups that formed during the progressive era of the early 1900s to provide practical assistance to poor and juvenile justice involved youth including help with finding employment approximately 25 million youth today ar involved in formal mentoring relationships through big brothers big sisters bbbs of america and s imilar organizations contemporary mentoring pr ograms seek to improve outcomes and reduce risks among vulnerable youth by providing positive role models who regularly meet with the youth in community or sc hool settings some pr ograms have broad youth development goals while others focu s more narrowly on particular outcome 1995 evaluation of the bbbs program and studies of other mentoring programs demonstrate an association between mentoring and some positive youth outcomes but the effects of mentoring on particul ar outcomes and the ability for mentored youth to sustain gains over time is less certain the current administration has proposed ne w federal structured mentoring since fy2001 though the administration has also proposed phasing some of these services out beginning in fy2007 tw programs the mentoring children of prisoners mcp program and safe nd drug free schools sdfs mentoring program provide the primary sources of dedicated federal funding for mentoring services the mentoring children of pris oners program was created in response to the growing number of children under ag 18 with at least one parent who is incarcerated in federal or state correctional facility the program is intended in part to reduce the chance that mentored youth will use drugs and skip school similarly the mentoring program pr oposed for elimination for fy2009 by the administration provides schoolbased mentoring to reduce school dropout and improve relationships for youth at risk of educational failure and with other risk factors the administration has also supported pilot project the mentoring initiative for system involved youth misiy which seeks to identify and expand effective mentoring programs for youth in the juvenile justice or foster care systems congress appropriated funds for misiy only in fy2006 finally other federal initiatives support mentoring efforts incl uding the federal mentoring council and dedicated funding for mentor ing organizations like bbbs five bills have been introduced in th 110th congress

through informal and formal relationships with adults informal relationships are those that develop from young persons existing soci network of teachers coaches and family friends this report focuses on formal mentoring relationships for vulnerable youth these relationships are cultivated through structured programs sponsored by youthserving organizations faithbased organizations school s and afterschool programs volunteers in structured programs are recruited from communities churches and the workplace and undergo an intensive screening process youth eligible for services through

replacing youth s relationship with his or her parents some programs have broa d youth development goals while others focus more narrowly on particular outcome such as reducing gang activity or substance abuse or improving grades structured mentoring programs are often community based meaning that mentored youth and adults engage in community activities eg going to the museum and the park playing sports playing board game and spending time together outside of work and school other programs are characterized as school based because they take place on school grounds or some other set location like community center the colocation of mentoring programs in schools facilitates relationships with teachers who can meet with mentors and refer youth to

opportunities that promote their cognitive and emotional development origins of contemporary mentoring programs the origin of todays structured mentoring programs is credited to the efforts of charity groups that formed during the progressive movement of the early 1900s these groups sought adult volunteers for vul nerable youth defined at the time as youth who were poor or had become involve d in the then nascent juvenile court system5 these early organizations provided pr actical assistance to youth including help with finding employment and created recreational outlets the most prominent mentoring organization at the time big br others now known as big brothers big sisters of america continue s today as the oldest and rgest mentoring organization in the country with over 275000 youth ages five to 18 served in 5000 communities6 the contemporary youth mentoring moveme nt began in the late 1980s with the support of foundations and corporations including fannie mae commonwealth fund united way of america chrysler pr octer gamble and the national urban league7 in addition nongovernmental organizations such as one to one in philadelphia and project raise in baltimore were established by entrepreneurs seeking to expand mentoring rvices to vulnerable youth the federal government has supported structured mentoring programs and initiatives since the beginning of the contemporary mentoring movement at that time mentoring was becoming increasingly recognized by the government as promising strategy to enrich the lives of youth address the isolation of youth from adult contact and provide onetoone support for the most vulnerable youth particularly those living in poverty8 among the first projects undertaken by the federal government was youth mentoring

less than six months showed declines in functioning relativ to their nonmentored peers evaluation of mentoring programs some studies have found that formal mentoring programs in communitybased and schoolbased settings are associated with improved acade mic and behavioral outcomes for youth but that the effects of mentoring on particul ar outcomes and the ability for mentored youth to sustain gains over time is less certain examples of the positive effects of mentoring landmark study in 1995 of the big brothers big sisters of america program compared outcomes of eligible youth who were randomly selected to receive mentoring services the treatment group against those eligible outh who were randomly selected to remain on waiting list for mentoring services the control group the study found that 18 months after the youth were assigned to their groups the mentored youth skipped half as many days of school were 46 less likely than their control group counterparts to use drugs 27 less likely to initiate alcohol use and almost onethird less likely to hit someone14 2002 review of studies of major communitybased programs the 1995 big brothers big sisters eval uation and evaluations of

this study among the most rigorous scientific evaluations of schoolbased ntoring program found that mentored youth randomly selected into the treatment group made improvements in their first year in overall academic pe rformance feeling more competent about school and skipping school among other areas compared to their nonmentored counterparts randomly selected into the control group17 some outcomes do not improve or are short lived although research has documented so benefits of mentoring findings from studies of mentoring programs show that mentoring is limited in improving all youth outcomes the 2002 review of mentoring program ev aluations found that programs did not always make strong impr ovement in grades and that some negative behaviors stealing or damaging property within

to feel that they would start and finish college21 t h evaluation also pointed to weaknesses in the programs design such as high attrition due likely to the transitioning for some youth to middle

estimated that 15 million atrisk128 youth need mentor129 recruiting and retaining volunteers appears to be major challenge for mentoring organi zations including those funded through federal mentoring programs130 in its 2004 report of the safe and drug free schools mentoring program gao found that new grantees had more difficulty than established grantees in r ecruiting and supporting mentors131 similarly hhs reports that some mentors in organizations that receive mentoring children of prisoners funding have dropped out befo re being matched with outh because of the time and energy commitment mentoring entails132 while research on mentor recruitment and retention is nascent it reveals that mentor ing organizations tend to attract individuals who are middle aged educated and have children in their household and that word of mouth is among the top strategies for recruiting new volunteers133 further individuals are likely to remain in formal mentoring programs if they feel adequately prepared to serve as mentors according to the research on mentoring retention may be high when programs continually monito r mentoring relationships for effectiveness and respond to the needs of mentors to address the perceive d mentoring gap the corporation for national and community service has partnered with mentor to match three million youth with mentors by 2010 the campaign has also secured commitments from corporate and foundation partners for funding to suppor t research on mentoring programs and engage their networks of employees in mentoring the fede ral mentoring council is also undertaking efforts to recruit federal employees to serve as mentors related issue is that the mentoring gap may be wider for special populations mentoring programs primarily serve yout h ages 9 through 11 who come to the attention of parent or teacher rather than the most atrisk populations which include but are not limited to older youth runaway and homeless youth and

eligibility requirement 71 federal register 70369 december 4 2006 in foster care or the juvenile justice system134 according to 2005 study by mentor less than onefifth of mentors re ported mentoring youth involved in the juvenile justice or foster care sy stems or with parent in prison135 however most of these mentors said they would be willing to work with vulnerable youth populations recent efforts to recruit vol unteers for vulnerable populations are also underway as evidenced by two of the thr ee current federal mentoring programs that target youth involved in the foster care or juvenile justice systems and children with imprisoned parents the three recent doj mentoring grants target vulnerable youth including latino high school students that attend schools in areas with significant gang presence in addition provisions in th proposed foster care mentoring act s 379 are intended to help recr uit mentors for children in the foster care system these provisions would forgive the federal stude nt loan debt of mentors who serve 200 hours each year at 2000 each year not to exceed 20000 total nonetheless potential mentors may still be discouraged from working with youth facing serious personal difficulties in addition creating financial incentives fo r mentors may raise the concern that this type of mentor ing would not be strictly voluntary sustaining resources some organizations that receive federal mentoring grants report challenges with securing diverse sources of funding and expanding their programs because of limited funding136 while the safe and drug free schools mentoring program does not require grantees to provide match they are ineligible to apply for subsequent grants even in the last year of the grant cycle they may however apply for other department of education grants for whic h they are eligible andor apply for subsequent sdfs mentoring grants after the grant cycle ends for example grantees awarded funds in fy2007 are only ligible to apply for subsequent grant after fy2009 the final year of their grant this may lead to gaps in funding for organizations that rely on federal dollars to sustain their services according to the department of education grantees must wait to reapply for continuation grants because the agency would like to provide funding opportunities for new grantees and to encourage current grantees to secure other sources of funding137 to improve the prospects that organi zations continue providing mentoring services beyond the life of their grants th three federal mentor ing programs provide training and technical assistance to help grantees in becoming financiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34306crs40 138 based on correspondence with the us department of health and human services family and

proposes to amend section 261a of the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act of 1974 42 usc 5665a by dding the administrator shall expand the number of sites receiving misiy grants from 4 to 12 this proposed change appears to be drafting error section 261a does not currently authorize funding specifically for misiy or any other pilot project rather it authorizes funds generally for demonstration grants and projectssustainable138 for example the education velopment center is working with misiy grantees to develop strategies nd tools to secure additional financial resources edc has conducted preassessments of the gran tees to gauge their need for this type of assistance139 further pending legislation to reauthorize the safe and drug free schools program would enable gr antees to reapply for additional funding after their grant terminates the ment oring americas children act hr 2611s 1812 would enable grantees to seek additional funding specifically the act provides that in awarding grants the secretary mu st consider entities w ho have received prior grant funding only if they meet specific criteria i performance during the initial grant cycle was satisfactory in terms of program design and number of children served the bills do not specify which entity or persons are to determine if the performance was satisfactory ii the subsequent grant is to support expanded services to new geographic area or targ et population and iii the eligible entity demonstrates that it is able to provide 50 match to federal funds for all three years of the new grant the act would also require firsttime grantees to provide match of at least l0 in the first year at least 25 in the second year and 50 in the third year possible discontinuation of select federal mentoring funding funding appears uncertain for two of the three primary federal mentoring programs the administration has propos ed eliminating the safe and drug free schools program claiming that th program
