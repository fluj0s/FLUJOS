states have consid erable freedom to develop their own methods and standards for reimbursement of medicaid services congress has periodically intervened to modify the broad guidelines within which states operate and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms has used its regulatory authority to restrict certain state practi ces actual payment methodologies however are still left largely to the discretion of the states medicaid reimbursement policies play central role in determining whether beneficiaries have access to rvices of adequate quality as well as the nature of the services they receive because some provi ders such as safetynet hospitals and clinics and nursing facilities are h eavily dependent on medicaid funding payment levels can have broad effects on the livery system and community access to care in addition because medicaid is major co mponent of state nd federal spending decisions about reimburseme nt policies can have sign ificant budgetary effects for both hospitals and nursing homes dicaid payment rates in many states are below the actual costs facilities incur in providing care to medicaid patients payment rates for other kinds of providers such as physicians or dentists cannot be directly compared to costs however medicaid is often paying less for comparable services than medicare or private insure rs medicaid payment shortfalls have variety of possible consequen ces providers may engage in costshifting raising charges to private payers to make up their losses in addition the need to subsidize medicaid patients may reduce their ability to fund care for people with coverage at all some providers may adopt costcutting measures that potentially affect quality others may refuse to accept medi caid patients or limit the number they will treat since medicaid law has requirement prohibiting providers from doing so this report provides snapshot cap tured primarily through state plan amendments approved through november 2002 of the methods states use to establish payment rates for most major types of providers serving medicaid clients it also explores some of the critical issues affecting medicaid payments rate setting where available medicaid rates are compared to other payers such as medicare and private insurance this report will not be updated to assist congress to review policy alternatives and understand the current

their own methods and standards for reimbursement of medicaid services congress has periodically intervened to modify the broad guidelines within which states operate and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms has used its regulatory authority to restrict certain state practi ces actual payment methodologies however are still left largely to the discretion of the states medicaid reimbursement polic ies play central role in determining whether beneficiaries have access to rvices of adequate quality as well as the nature of the services they receive in addition because some providers such as safetynet hospitals and clinics and nursing facilities are heavily dependent on medicaid funding payment levels can have broa der effects on the delivery system and community access to care finally because medicaid is major component of state and federal spending decisi ons about reimbursement polic ies can have significant budgetary effects organization of this report this report1 begins with summary of basic federal requirements applicable to payments for all services and an overview of major developments in federal medicaid reimbursement policy over the last 20 year s this overview provides historical context for current policies and highlights some issues that have been perennial concerns for federal and state policymakers the next four sections of the report provide detailed di scussion of medicaid reimbursement for four basic categ ories of services or providers acute care including hospital i npatient and outpa tient services services of physicians and dentists and services of certain federally defined categories of hea lth centers and clinics longterm care including care in nursing facilities intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded

responsibility for range of covered services in return for fixed monthly payment per dicaid enrollee and prescription drugs for each service type these sections summarize states payment methodologies review current or recent policy issues and to the extent data are available compare medicaid payments to providers costs or to payments by other third parties the final section of the report describe s special federal payment rules for some specific classes of providers and explains how medicaid payments coordinate with medicare for individuals eligible for benefits under both programs use of state plan documents most of the statebystate comparisons of payment methodolog ies in this report are based on medicaid state plans and state plan amendments spas the state plan for medical assistance is th basic document each state initially submitted in order to obtain approval of its medicaid program major policy changes are reflected in spas that must also be approved by cm s spas can be pproved retroactively meaning that state can implement policy before cms has acted on its submission at the risk of denial of federal funding if the spa is ultimately disapproved cms maintains database of state pl ans and spa documents on its web site2 full state plans were captured in late 2000 with subsequent plan amendments added to the database as approve d spas reviewed for this document include all those approved through november 7 2002 what th is report provides then is snapshot of payment methodologies under each state plan as approved on that date these will not necessarily be the methodologies act ually in use in november 2002 because approval of amendments can be retroactive some state plan documents relating to reimbursement methods are lengthy and complex and some states ve filed numerous spas that repeatedly modify the same sections of the plan while every effort has been made to track the changes and identify the most current approved policy there are undoubtedly errors or omissions in very few cases it was impossible to ascertain states policy for particular service from the state plan and state regula tions or other documen ts were consulted in these cases which are identified in notes to the tables the policy described may be the one in effect at the time the state documents were obtained rather than in november 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs3 3 medicaid applicant who is in state provid ing optional coverage of the medically needy population and whos income or resources exceed the limits established by the state may spend down to eligibility by using the excess funds to pay medical billsoverview basic federal rules three basic federal statutory requireme nts apply to payment for all types of services methods and procedures for making payments must be such as to assure that payments are consiste nt with efficiency economy and quality of care cms relies on this provision as gene ral authority to regulate state reimbursement methodolog ies in particular this pr ovision is the basis for the upper payment limit upl regulations which require that medicaid payments for class of institutional providers not exceed in th aggregate the amount that would have been paid for comparable services under dicare principles r ecent revisions in the upl rules have had major effect on state finances this issue is discussed further below payments must be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are availabl to the general population in the geographic area this provision explicitly connects the leve l of medicaid payment rates with the willingness of providers to serve medicaid beneficiaries while payment levels are not the only factor affecting provider par ticipation there has been tension between cost containment and access to care throughout the history of medicaid providers must accept medicaid reimbursement as payment in full except for any beneficiary costsha ring amounts provided for by the state plan or any amount due from medically needy beneficiary with spenddown liability3 this means that provider cannot bill beneficiary when medicaids allowed payment is less than the providers charge for service in contrast medicare allows limited balance billing by physicians and some other providers private insurance rules vary plans with networks commonly restrict balance billing by network providers and permit it for outofnetwork services there is an additional set of basic rules for payment of institutional services including hospitals nursing facilities and interm ediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr rates must be determined through public process states must publish proposed and final rates including justifications and underlyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs4 methodologies and providers beneficiaries and the public must be given an opportunity to comment beyond these general rules actual paym ent requirements or methodologies are prescribed by law for only few types of providers such as disproportionate share hospitals dshs those serving high pr oportion of lowincome patients federally qualified health centers fqhcs which are public health service grantees and similar entities and hospices there are also specific rules relating to payment for prescription drugs all of these rules are described in later sec tions of this report major policy developments 19802003 over time federal medicaid reimbursement policy has focused on different and sometimes conflicting policy goals such as cost containment state flexibility and access to care congress has set specific minimum or maximum levels of reimbursement for some type s of services while providi ng only general guidelines for others it has sought to foreclose so payment schemes that have the effect of shifting financial burdens from states to the federal government it has acted to protect some specific classes of providers while enhancing states ability to bargain with others this section provides brief overview of major developments in medicaid reimbursement policy over the last two decades it is not meant to be legislative history but merely to highlight key issues and some of the sh ifts in congressional priorities and concerns the boren amendment until 1980 state medicaid programs were required to follow medicare reimbursement principles in paying institutional providers hospitals and nursing facilities under the medicare rules in effect at that time this meant that states were required to use retrospective reasonable co st system states continued to have to assure that rates provided access to care payment amounts were determined after services were rendered and were based on the actual cost s incurred by the provider in furnishing those services in what is known as the boren amendment the omnibus reconciliation act of 1980 pl 96 499 repealed this requirement for nursing facility services freeing states to establish new methodologies of their own the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 obra 81 pl 9735 applied the amendment to inpatient hospital services the new rules provided simply that pa yment rates for hospitals and nursing facilities had to be reasonable and adequate to meet the costs of efficiently and economically operated facilities for hospitals the law also required payment adjustments for disproportionate share hospita ls dshs nearly all states responded to the new flexibility by shifting from retrospective to prospective payment systems for both hospital and nursing facility services under prospective payment systems rates may be set in advance and may not be rela ted to the actual costs providers incur in furnishing services or the state may set ceilings and pay the lesser of actual costs or the ceiling amount states interest in these systems stemmed from concerns thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs5 4 the waivers are commonly referred to by the s ections of the social security act that set rules for themproviders paid on full cost basis had incentive to perform efficiently and might furnish unnecessary services while the boren amendment gave states the flexibility to develop new payment systems it also established benchmark against which those systems were to be measured the state was required to find and to provide assurances satisfactory to the secretary that its dicaid rates were reasonable and adequate in 1990 the supreme court affirmed that facilities had right to seek judicial review of the reasonableness and adequ acy of medicaid rates wilder v virginia hospital association 496 us 498 1990 the wilder d ecision merely settled the question of whether the boren amendment confe rred rights on providers that could be enforced in court even before this d ecision hospitals in some states had obtained court judgments that medicaid payments were inadequate following wilder numerous states faced suits by hospitals and nursing homes congress ultimately responded by repealing the reasonable and adequate test in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10534 some hospitals have conti nued to file suits relying on the requirement still in the statute that payments for all types of providers be sufficient to assure access to care obra 81 waivers obra 81 authorized the secretary to waive specified requirements of medicaid law so that states could operate innovative service programs two types of waivers were originally pe rmitted section 1915b freedom ofchoice waivers under which states could require beneficiaries to obtain services through primary care case manager or managed care plan or from limited set of contracting providers and section 1915c home and communitybased services waivers under which states could provide special serv ices generally nonmedical personal care and supportive services to limited populations of bene ficiaries who would otherwise need institutional care4 both types of waivers requi re periodic cms approval and are subject to costeffectiveness tests c ongress has since authorized several other waiver options number of states have used sec tion 1915b freedomofchoice waivers to operate selective cont racting systems under which be neficiaries needing specified service are restricted to limited set of providers whose payment rates are established by bidding or negotiation table 1 lists the selective contracting programs in effect as of september

their role in providing drug coverage to lowincome aged and disabled people other largevolume purchasers such as private insurers pha rmaceutical benefit managers pbms and hospital buying gr oups often get subs tantial discounts or rebates from drug manufacturer s to assure that medi caid programs received similar benefits the omnibus budget reconc iliation act of 1990 obra 90 pl 101508 required manufacturers to give rebates to states for drugs paid for by medicaid the rebate formulas are designed to assure that states pay the lowest price offered by the manufacturer to any other high volume purchaser in return the state must generally cover all the drugs market ed by the manufacturer there is ongoing debate over how th rebates are calculated and whether medicaid programs really are getting the best price rebates reduced medicaid drug spending by 20 in 20015 still spending for drugs is one of the fastest growing components of medicaid budgets restricting drug spending has been major focus of recent state cost containment efforts see the last part of this sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs7 disproportionate share hospit dsh payments provider donations and provider taxes in response to the 1981 requirement that hospital payment systems take account of the situation of dshs some states developed plans to make supplemental payments to these hospitals these plans potentially conflicted with the secretarys regulation capping aggregate medicaid re imbursement at medicare levels the consolidated omnibus budget reconc iliation act of 1985 cobra pl 99272 prohibited the secretary from limiting states payment adjustments to dshs until 1987 states were free to establish their ow n criteria for classifying facilities as dshs and to develop their own re imbursement methods for these hospitals the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 bra 87 pl 100203 defined certain facilities that states had to designate as dshs and set minimum payment requirements for them these requirements which have since been amended several times are described in the discussion of inpatient hospital reimbursement below the cobra provision that prohibited the secretary from limiting dsh payments meant that these were the only medicaid payments not subject to any form of upper limit beginning in the late 1980s states began to exploit this loophole by developing various financing schemes intended to draw ex tra federal matching funds state might make an extra payment to hospital claim federal matching and then recapture part or all of the payment by taxing the hospital alternatively the hospital might agree to donate part of the extra paym ent to the state or in the case of hospital operated by state or local governme nt the money could be recovered through an intergovernmental transfer transfer of funds from another state agency to the medicaid program or from local government to the state table 2 illustrates how typical provider tax or donation program might work in state whose federal matching percenta ge was 60 the state pays the hospital 100 the state reports the payment to cms and receives 60 in federal matching funds the hospital gives back 80 eith er as donation or because the state imposes providersp ecific tax on its payments the hospital is still ahead by 20 and the state has gained 40 to spend on ot her medicaid services or simply absorb into its general fund state could poten tially operate its tire medicaid program with actual state expenditures table 2 effect of typical provider donation or tax program

monthly in exchange for which they accept financial risk for providing defined scope of services to each enrolled beneficiary 7 cms managed care trends 19911996 at httpwwwcmshhsgovmedicaid continuedwhile these schemes could be used with any kind of provider payment the use of the dsh loophole was attractive because the state could pay and then recover any amount at all dsh payments rose from an estimated 569 million in 1989 to projected 8 billion or 12 of total medicaid spending by 1992 the medicaid voluntary c ontribution and providers pecific tax amendments of 1991 pl 102234 prohibited the use of most provider dona tions and phased out the use of provider taxes that were not broadbased that is taxes that were levied against providers medicaid receipts and not receipts from other sources the act did not restrict the use of inte rgovernmental transfers on the grounds that the federal government had authority to regulate these arrangements but instead sought to limit potential federal exposure by capping the total amount of dsh payments beginning in 1992 national aggregate dsh payment adjustments during each fiscal year were limited to 12 of total medicaid spending for that year high dsh states those whose pa yments were already above the 12 limit were allowed to increase their payments by more than the projected growth in their overall medicaid spending other states were allowed larger increases with each state receiving an allocation calculated to assure that aggregate national payments did not exceed the national cap the bba replaced this system of calculating dsh limits with fixed annual limits for each state these limits and subsequent amendments are described in the discussion of i npatient hospital re imbursement below the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra 93 pl 10366 further limited dsh payments by capping payments to any single facility the sum of regular and dsh payments to hospital could not exceed the sum of the hospitals costs for treating medicaid benefi ciaries and uninsured patients growth in managed care states have been contracting with hea lth maintenance organizations hmos or similar prepaid

2001after the use of provider taxes and donations was limited in 1991 states could still recover medicaid payments made to governmental providers through intergovernmental transfers states ability to use these mechanisms was limited by the cap on total dsh payments and on dsh payments to any one facility however states found that they could draw extra fe deral matching funds by exploiting the fact that upl limits were aggregate rather than facilityspecific table 4 illustrates how what came to be known as enhanced payment programs worked private hospitals have actual costs of 80 million while countyowned hospitals have costs of 20 million the state pays private hospitals 80 of their costs or 64 million meaning that it can pay the county hospitals 36 million and s till be within the aggregate upl of 100 million the shortfall in payments to the private hospitals might be made up through dsh payments which do not count toward the upl th state claims 60 million in federal reimbursement and the county hospitals re turn the excess payment to the state while the state has nominally spent 40 million on hospital services it has actually spent only 24 million while the

states faced budget shortfalls many states that improved their provider payments during periods of economic growth may now have cut bac k general paymen t methodologies how states decide the relative amounts paid to different providers fo r different services may or may not have been affected however states that have not changed methodologies may achieve savings by imposing uniform cuts or simply by granting rate increases below the rate of in flation in the cost of goods and services providers must buy therefore the discu ssions in this report of the adequacy of medicaid payment to assure access or qua lity may not reflect current conditions acute care hospital services medicaid payments for hospital services take three forms payments for services to indi vidual inpatients and outpatients lumpsum disproportionate sh are hospital dsh payment adjustments and in states with upl plans additional lump sum distributions in fy2001 dsh payments made up close to onethird of all direct payments to general or community hospitals incl uding inpatient and outpatient payments and half of payments to inpatient psychiatric facilities see table 13 comparable figures for upl plans are not available however the hhs office of the inspector general estimated that total upl payments to hospitals for inpatient and outpatient services were about 45 billion in fy2000 this would have been 14 of total inpatient nondsh and outpatient spending in that year this section describes st ates basic methodologies for establishing payments for individual inpatients and outpatients it then

payments meet hospitals costs for medicai d beneficiaries as well as whether dsh or upl supplements help hospitals that treat uninsured patients inpatient payment methods all states now use some form of prosp ective system as their basic method for setting inpatient hospital payments that is payment amounts per day or per case are fixed at the start of year and are generally not subject to retrospective adjustment on the basis of actual costs incu rred states may establish different rate for each participating hospital may use one rate for all hospitals in defined peer group or may have one statewid rate twothirds of th states have adopted some form of case mix adjustment under which reimbursement varies according to the intensity of services required or the expected resources used by each individual patient these adjustments discussed fu rther below can be applied regardless of the states method for setting basic rates some states systems allow additional reimbursement for outliers patients whose costs or length of inpatient stay are significantly higher than the average for comparable patients medicaid law requires states with prospective systems effectively all states now to make outlier adjustments for highcost or longstaying infants under one year old in any hospital and for children under six in dsh hospital11 table 9 based on an analysis of state medi caid plans shows the method in use and approved by cms as of november 2002 the table classes states according to whether hospitals receive hospitalspecific rates receive rates set for whole group of hospitals or for all hospitals in the state or are paid under some other method for states using some form of case mix adjustment the table indicates the method finally where applicable it identifies the facility characteristics states use in establishing peer groups of hospitals several general points about the table and the accompanying discussion should be noted the systems described in the tabl and in the following discussion are those used for most acute general hospitals in the state states may use different modes of paym ent for particular classes of facilities for example states may use prospective payment for acute general hospitals and reasonable cost system for psychiatric rehabilitation or other specialized hospitals some general hospitals for example those that are stateowned or small hospitals in rural areas may receive special treatment in addition states that negotiate ra tes with preferre d providers under selective contracting system may have separate paymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs17 methodology for emergency or othe r services obtained outside that system many states that use peergr oup or statewide payment systems provide hospitalspecific addons for certain categories of costs such as capital costs interest preciation and othe r costs related to owning physical facility and graduate medical education costs costs directly or indirectly related to traini ng residents in two states arizona and tenness ee nearly all beneficiaries are enrolled in mcos and some other states have very high rates of mco enrollment

established for each hospital using historic data on that hospitals medicaid costs and some form of fixed update factor for inflation hospital whose costs rise faster than the update will therefore lose money some states use an objective inflation index such as cmsreleased estimates of price changes for market basket of goods and services commonly purchased by hospitals often however annual updates are set by legislation and regu lation and may be higher or lower than actual inflation oregon uses update factors that vary inversely with each hospitals operating margin or profit the effect is to grant lower increases to hospitals earning profit on their medicaid patients of the states using hospit alspecific rates five use peer group ceilings the hospitals rate is based on the lesser of its own costs or some percentile of costs for similar hospitals hospital characteristics used to establish peer groups include size location presence of teaching program speci alized services for example pediatric hospitals and volume of medicaid services six states use statewide ceiling for all general hospitals based on percentile of all hospitals costs or in the case of arkansas legislatively fixed per diem limit 675 for 2002 finally three states use blend of hospitalspecific and peer group or statewide experience to set payment ceilings for example the operating cost component of io wa rates is based on 50 of the hospitals cost and 50 of the statewide average one effect of systems using ceilings is that while hospital with costs above the ceiling will lose money hospital with costs below the ceiling will receive rate derived from its baseyear costs it can earn profit only if it can reduce its costs still further it is not rewarded for being more efficient than its competitors wyoming provides incentive payments to hospitals with costs below the statewide ceiling two states georgia and idaho limit the losses that can be incurred by hospitals peer group

developed for medicare hospital reimbursement patie nts are assigned to one of 540 drgs on the basis of admitting diagnosis procedures performed presence of complications or other characteristics12 each drg has an assigned weight for example 08889 for an uncomplicated appendectomy or 97823 for liver transplantwhich is then multiplied by the fixed rate established for the hospital so if hospitals standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs23 rate were 5000 it would be paid 4445 for the appendectomy and 48912 for the liver transplant because medicaid patients may be di fferent from medicare patients the weighting factors established for drgs under medicare may not be appropriate for medicaid reimbursement most states using drgs have developed their own weights on the basis of medicaidspecific da ta some states use alternative drg classification systems such as the drgs developed for the civilian health and medical program of the uniformed serv ices champus or new yorks all

states have used 1915b freedomofchoice waivers to develop hospital contrac ting systems while two stat have systems under which medicaid and other payers use common reimbursement methods selective contracting under section 1915b state may receive waiver of medicaid requirements including the re quirement that benefi ciaries be allowed free choice of medical providers in orde r to allow the

services illinois operated similar system until 1991 alabama s program is statewide in the other states the waiver applies only in selected counties or areas however large share of beneficiaries live in the covered area except in emergencies or other exceptional cases these beneficiaries may use only hospitals selected for participation through system of competitive negotiation in ca lifornia and

beneficiaries and certain pregnant women participating in separate maternity care program13 multipayer systems beginning in the 1970s several states established allpayer hospital ratesetting systems in these systems all insurers or other payers in the state including medicare nd medicaid agreed to pay uniform rates or use standard reimbursement methodology for inpatient rvices only one state maryland still has an allpayer system in which medicare participates14 state ratesetting commission sets each hospitals allowable prices fo r specific service units such as day of routine care or particular laboratory test the prices are set at levels expected to result in target av erage charge per case fo r each facility key feature of the system is that every payer contributes to hospitals costs for treating uninsured patients in rhode island the state and blue cross jointly negotiate with the state hospital association an annual statewide ceiling t he maxicap on reimbursable expenses for the 12 voluntary hospitals in the state within this ceiling an operating budget is developed for each hospital and rates pa id by medicaid and blue cross are set to meet these budgets administrative daysswing beds under medicare small rural hospitals may enter into swing bed agreements with cms under which beds may be used either for inpatient hospital care or for care equivalent in intensity to that furnished by nursing facility costs are allocated and reimbursement adjusted to reflect the level of care furnished to each patient medicaid program may also allow for swing beds but only in hospitals that have entered into medicare swing bed arrangement the state may develop specific payment methodology for swing bed days of care at the nursing facility level or may pay at rate based on average payments for comparable services in freestanding nursing facilities the swing bed program assists hospitals that are underused and also helps to meet local shortages of nursing facility beds sometimes hospital which is not swing bed facility will provide care to patient at the nursing fac ility level of intensity becau place cannot be found for the patient in an appropriate facility and the patient cannot be discharged the days of inpatient care received by patients in this situati on are known as administrative days prior to 1997 medicaid payment fo r an administrative day was limited to the statewide average medicaid payment rate for day of care in skilled nursing facility most states have continued this practice despite the repeal of the provision in the bbahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs25 outpatient payment methods because hospitals furnish wide variety of services on an outpatient basis from emergency room visits to surgery to diagnostic tests many states use several different payment methodologies for exampl state might pay flat pervisit fee for clinic visit use fee schedule for surgery and pay on cost basis for some specialized services because states vary in their service definitions there is ready way of comparing methods for par ticular services across states table 10 attempts to identify the principal payment approach in each state with notes on variants in some states without depicting the full complexity of state systems about half of the states still base outpatient reimbursement largely on hospitalspecific costs of these 15 pay actual costs or prospective rates based on historic costs with limit on annual increases one state florida uses peer group ceiling comparable to those common in inpatient hospital and nursing facility payment another 11 states pay fixed pe rcentage of actual costs that is their systems explicitly pay each facility less than its costs one goal of such systems may be to discourage use of hospitals for services that could be rendered in noninstitutional setting sixteen states use fee schedules varyin g payment by the surgical or other procedures performed for at least some rvices several states pay the same rates regardless of whether the serv ice is performed in hospital or in physicians office again the aim is to avoid incentives for use of the more costly setting only four states have adopted sy stems comparable to medicares new prospective system for outpatient hospital rvices under this system services are classified into one of 383 ambulatory pa tient classifications apcs groups of services expected to require comparable re sources as in the inpatient drg system payment for each apc is at fixed rate time s weight that refl ects resource use for the apc relative to that of other apcs one state has adopted medicares system directly others use their own cl assification system or prices of the remaining states maryland uses the same allpayer system

least two obstetricians who are prepared to accept medicaid patients this requirement does not apply to childrens hospitals or to those that do not furnish nonemergency obstetrical care rural hospitals may use other attending physicians for obstetrical care minimum dsh payment in computing the amount of the supplementary payment the state must use one of three methods it may use the formula for comparable payments under medicare w ith special adjustments for childrens hospitals b provide for fixed payment increase or percentage increase for dshs plus an additional increase for hospitals whose medicaid utilization is more than one standard deviation above the statewide mean or c develop its own methodology which may vary payments to different types of hospitals so long as all hospitals of each type are treated equally and payments are reasonably related to hospitals medicaid or lowincome volume the paym ents are required even if they result in medicaid payments to hospital in excess of the hospitals usual charges to the public for similar services maximum payment to an individual hospital the dsh payment cannot exceed the sum of the hospitals costs for medicaid

could not increase faster than the rate of growth in the st ates overall medicaid sp ending other states were allowed to raise their dsh payments subject to an allocation system that would keep aggregate national payments within the cap the bba of 1997 replaced this formulaic allocation with table of specified allotments for each of the years fy1998 through fy2002 these allotments effectively froze states with very low dsh payments at their 1995 payment levels and required higherspending states to gr adually reduce their payments after 2002 each states annual allotment would increase at the rate of the medical care component of the cpiu bipa froze the allotments for fy2001 and fy2002 at the fy2000 levels meaning highdsh states w ould not have to reduce their spending so

shift away from costbased reimbursement that began in the 1980s aggregate medicaid payments to hospitals including regular i npatient and outpatient payments and dsh payments have consistently been less than the total costs hospitals incur in treating medicaid beneficiaries however the gap narrowed dramatically during the 1990s the only comprehensive source of da ta on medicaid hospital costs and payments is an annual survey of commun ity hospitals conducted by the american hospital association aha the survey includes questions about gross medicaid charges and actual medicaid payments received by each hospital hospitals charges are generally in excess of their actual co sts aha estimates actual costs for medicaid patients at each hospital by using that hospitals overall costtocharge ratio the estimate may be inaccurate if the ratio is actually different for medicaid and nonmedicaid patients it should also be noted that 35 of hospitals especially public and forprofit hospitals did not participate in the most recent survey values for these hospitals have been imputed table 15 shows payments by medicaid and ot her major payers as percentage of costs in 1991 through

regular and dsh payments equaled 98 of costs20 while this is significant improvement hospitals overall are still losing money on medicaid patients aha estimates that 73 of hospitals had negativ inpatient margins in 200021 one likely factor in medicaid losses is that states have been granting annual increases lower than the rate of inflati on study for oregons hospital association by lewin

included in the private payers category th costs allocated to medicare and medicaid include cmss allowed and nonallowed costs this note by medpac means that its method for estimating hospitals costs for medicare and medicaid patients does not take account of federal rules for determining whether specific costs are reimbursable hospital losses are not due solely to reimbursement thods coverage limitations also play role for exam ple under marylands allpayer system medicaid pays the same daily rates as medicare and private insurers however the state has imposed limit on the number of covered inpatient days the result is loss for uncovered days that is passed on to all payers in the form of higher rates22 hospitals and private insurers have ways contended that medicaid losses must be made up through higher charges to other payers phenomenon known as costshifting private insurers pay more than the costs of treatment for their enrollees while both medicaid and medicare pa less than cost what is striking is how much costshifting has diminished as table 15 shows charges to private payers were nearly 30 above costs in 1991 largely to compensate for medicare and medicaid losses by 2001 private payers paid 13 above costs some of the changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs45 23 the survey like the aha survey ascertains medicaid and selfpayother gross charges but not costs as in the aha data the estimates in the table assume that the medicaid and selfpayother costcharge ratios are the same as the overall costcharge ratio reported by the hospitalis probably attributable to pressure for lower prices from major managed care plans and other insurers but hospitals might have been more willing to accept lower prices from private payers because their losses from the public programs had dropped so much one final point to be made about the figures in table 15 is that the proportion of uncompensated care costs made up throug h state or local subsidies has gone from 196 in 1 991 to 122 in 2001 drop of more than onethird yet losses from uncompensated care have not risen proportionately as percent of total hospital costs the losses were 48 in 1991 and 53 in 2000 one possible explanation is that nonmedicaid subsidies we re partially replaced by ds h payments to safety net hospitals the possible role of medicaid in offsetting some hospitals losses from bad debts or charity care appears to vary by state table 16 is based on the 2000 annual member survey of the national association of public hospitals and health systems naph this organization chiefly represents large state and local hospitals few members are operated by priv ate nonprofit corporations but function as safety net providers treating substantia l numbers of medicaid and uninsured patients the table thus illustrates the experience of fe w major safety net providers in each state listed and may not be representative of all hospitals or even comparable safety net hospitals in each state23 the table first compares estimated costs for medicaid patients and medicaid revenues including dsh payments of the 20 states listed 10 were paying the reporting hospitals less than their medicaid costs in the other 10 states medicaid revenues exceeded costs sometimes substantially the table then compares costs and revenues for patients classed as self pay other this group is made up of all patients without private insurance medi caid or medicare including the uninsured and people with coverage through cham pus workers compensation and other sources offsetting revenues for this gr oup include various forms of nonmedicaid public funding such as local subsidies or state indigent care pools and other funding sources for the selfpayother popul ation in nearly all the states the reporting

govtdentistryworksmedlitigatehtml as of sept 2003in some states it appears clear that medicaid reimbursement is reducing the burden of uncompensated care louisiana is paying the responding hospitals

hospitals bad debt and charity care costs hospitals in several other states such as colo rado indiana and new mexico received considerably more in medicaid payments than their medicaid costs in these states however the medicaid payments and othe r public subsidies were insufficient to offset costs for uncompensated care the two states with the most respondi ng hospitals california and new york paid these hospitals amounts roughly equal to their estimated medicaid costs the 15 california hospitals rece ived 12 billion in dsh funds in 2000 or 64 of the states total dsh spending of 19 billion in new york the 12 hospitals received 407 million in 2001 or 34 of the states 12 billion in dsh spending but these payments were just sufficient to bring medicaid payments clos to medicaid costs with excess available to subsidize other patients physician and dental care medicaid payment levels for physician and dental care and their effects on provider participation and beneficiary access have been issues since the earliest years of the program states have commonly pa id independent practitioners using fixed fee schedules often at rates we ll below those paid by medicare or private insurers many physicians refused to accept medi caid patients or limited their medicaid caseloads leaving beneficiaries to re ly on more costly hospital outpatient departments and emer gency rooms as primary source of care medicaid payments to physicians and othe r providers are subject to the general requirement that payments be sufficient to attract enough providers to ensure that covered services will be as available to medicaid beneficiaries as they are to the general population obra 89 codified this requirement previous ly established only by regulation and established specifi c reporting requirements with respect to payment rates for obstetric and pediatric services to allow the secretary to determine the adequacy of state payments for th services these special reporting requirements were repealed by the bba but the requirement that payments be sufficient to assure access remains in the statute it has been the basis for numerous lawsuits by groups of physicians dentists and other providers24 this section provides data on payment levels for physician and dental services and summarizes some recent literature on how these paym ent levels affect access to carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs48 25 hawaii continues to use the reasonable charge method used by medicare before medicare adopted its own fee schedule the reas onable charge for specific service is the lowest of the providers actual charge fo r that service b the providers customary charge for comparable services or c the p revailing charge in the area fixed at the 75th percentile of charges for comparable services 26 this rate applies to individuals not enrolled in the arizona health care cost containment system ahcccs the managed care program that serves most medicaid beneficiaries in arizonaphysician payment every state except hawaii now pays physicians the lesser of actual charges or fixed fee sc hedule amount for each visit or procedure whether performed in offices hospitals or other settings25 states set these fee schedules in various ways some were originally based on physicians actual charges for services while others are set arbitrarily by the state or negotiated with provider groups others use systems comparable to medicares under which each procedure is assigned weight on resourcebased relative value scale rbrvs the weightings reflect relative physician work practice expenses and malpractice costs associated with different procedures brief physician office visit might have value of three an appendectomy valu of 150 the state then multiplies the different values by single standard dollar amount if unit is valued at 5 the state will pay 15 for the brief office visit and 450 for the appendectomy some states have adopted medicares scales while others use different weighting systems the effect is the same as under fee schedule except that the medicaid agency has an external reference for its pricing decisions however the schedule is blished basic rates andor inflation increases are fixed by the state and may bear relati on to what physicians ordinarily charge or what they are paid by medicare or private insurers table 17 compares each states medicaid rates in 2001 for selected procedures the rates are those reported by state medicaid directors in an annual survey conducted by the american academy of pediatrics aap the aap

the same state rate s under the medicare fee schedule are partially adjusted using geographic practice cost indices gpcis which reflect differences in the costs of practicing medicine in different areas sometimes there is one gpci for whole state in which case the medicare rate used for comparison is the statewide rate sometimes there are different gpcis for different parts of state in which case the medicare comparator is for the specific area noted in the table27 although states generally pay less than medicare for the listed services the gap varies considerably by procedure in states that have systems similar to medicares rbrvs but use different dollar multiplier to establish medicaid rates the ratio of medicaid to medicare rates will be roughly constant in other states that have assigned their own values to different pr ocedures rates may be far below medicares for some services and higher for others the payment gap tends to be larger for preventive office visits and for cardiac catheterization than for the other listed services the gap between medicaid physician paym ent rates and rates paid by private insurers is likely to be even greater studies done for the medicare payment advisory commission medpac estimate th at medicare physician rates were about 83 of average private rates in 200128 the relationship between medicaid feeforservice payment rates and physicians willingness to accept medicaid pa tients was extensively studied in the 1970s and 1980s but has receive d less attention recently perhaps because policy focus has shifted to access by

under medicaid does it vary by state journal of health care for the poor and underserved vol 14 2 2003 pp 208228a recent study by the center for studying health system change found that the proportion

relationship between these measures and relative physician payment levels the author suggests that capacity constraints the prevalence of medicaid managed care administrative rules and other market factors might play role29 similarly multivariate analysis of factors affecting access and use by dult beneficiaries in 13 states in 1996 found that those in states with aboveaverage medicaid phy sician payments were more likely than others to have usual source of care or to have had doctors visit in the last year30 one recent survey of pediatricians summarized in table 19 found that while nearly 90 had some medicaid patients only 61 accepted all medicaid patients seeking care part of the difference may be related to capacity nearly quarter of the respondents were not accepting all privat ely insured patients either while physicians clearly felt that payments we re inadequate over half reported that medicaid payments were insufficient even to cover their overhead leaving aside any compensation for the physicians time fewer than onethird said that they would see more medicaid patients if payments were raised on average pediatricians said that medicaid rates would have to exceed 82 of their customary charge before they would accept additional dicaid patients as table 18 showed the medicaid rate for well child visit was at or above 82 of the medicare rate in only four

national conference of state legislatures oct 2002as with physician payment there is wide variation among states however there appears to be somewhat more cons istency across different procedures within single state that is some of the stat are low payers and others high payers across the board it should be emphasized that the comparison here is not between what medicaid pays and what some insure r or thirdparty payer pays for the same service but between medicaid rates and providers charges private dental insurance plans also commonly use fixed fee schedul and these too may often be well below providers charges the differen ce is that while patients with private insurance may have to pay the balance dentists who treat medicaid patients must accept the medicaid rate as payment in full low fees probably play role in limited use of dental services by medicaid beneficiaries especially children some state plans offer little or dental coverage for adults one recent study found that fewer than one in five children with medicaid received dental visit over the course of year32 whether increasing fees would improve access is not certain res ponding to gao survey of 40 states that increased rates between 1997 and 2000 14 re ported increases in participation or utilization 15 reported increase and 11 indicated that not enough time had elapsed or the state did not have reliable data in states reporting changes the improvement was often marginal gao concluded that the size of rate increases was less important in explaining access improve ments than the absolute amount of the fees after the increase 2002 study by the national conference of state legislatures identified number of factors in dentist participa tion unrelated to medicaid reimbursement including stigmatization of medicaid beneficiaries and perception that they fail to keep appointments in addition the study noted that many practices are already at capacity with privatepay patients and have need to accept medicaid beneficiaries33 federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics under obra 89 states were required to cover services in federally qualified health centers fqhcs and to pay full r easonable cost for these services fqhcs include community health centers migrant health centers and health care for the homeless programs receiving funding fro m the health resources and services administration as well as centers that m eet the standards for grant but are not actually receiving federal funding states were also required under 1977 amendment to pay reasonable costs for services of rural health clinics rhc which provide services of nurse practitioners and physician assistants in medically underserved rural areas the bba provided for gradual phase out of mandatory cost reimbursement for fqhcs and rhcs with required reim bursement dropping to 70 of cost byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs60 34 in addition some states were already paying less than full actual cost s

clinic received per vi sit rate for 2001 based on its own average reasonable costs for 1999 and 2000 for later years this rate is updated by the medicare economic index mei used to update medicare physician payments for primary care the rate may be modified to reflect change in the scope of services provided by the facility the state and the center may agree to an alternative payment methodology but only if aggregate payments under the alternative method are at least equal to those that would have been made under the sta ndard met hod bipa continued the requirement that states ma ke supplemental payments to fqhcs and rhcs who are paid less than the minimu m by medicaid mco finally gao was required to report on whether rates should be periodically rebased or refined and on how to do so the gao report is not due until the end of 2004 but gao has already concluded that the new system is likely to pay many facilities less than their costs for several reasons first the initial 2001 rates were based on costs for the two preceding years with allowance for inflation34 second the mei index used to update the rates rises less rapidly than other measures of inflation and centers may have difficulty holding increases to these limits especially if they began with low pervisit rate gao suggests that it will be di fficult to develop system that assures the continued viability of fqhcs and rhcs while maintaining incentives for efficiency35 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs61 36 american health care association analysis of cms oscar data for 2002 at

s in 2002 67 of nf residents relied on medicaid as their principal payer36 thus ability to control growth in nf spending has an important effect on state budget s while the adequacy of medicaid reimbursement can determine whether facility can offer highquality care the tension between the competing goals of cost containment and quality assurance has been present almost since the be ginning of the medicaid program payment methods since the 1980 boren amendment allowed states to move away from medicares retrospective costbased reimbursement rules states have evolved very complex nf payment system s these systems commonly distinguish among direct patient care costs cost s for various operating support and administrative functions and capital costs such as interest rent and depreciation state may treat each compone nt differently for example payment to particular facility might be the sum of casemix adjusted fixed amount for direct care facilityspecific costbased payment subject to peer gr oup ceiling for other operating costs and fair rental value payment for capital costs the following discussion of payment methods cannot capture the full complexity of states systems instead it focuses chiefly on how states pay for the direct care component the actual delivery of services to individual residents by nursing staff obviously the totality of the state payment relative to costs can affect quality or access still payment system that has incentives to hold down administrative costs or that limits the rate of return on capital investment has different

state use of complex ceiling systems for nf cost containment in preference to simple rate cuts or freezes was driven in part by concerns about litigation during the peri od when the boren amendment

payment constraints43 with the repeal of the boren requirements acrosstheboard limitations may have greater appeal for states as table 24 showed many states limited general 19992000 rate increases to vels below average cost growth more may do so in response to current budgetary problems intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded until the 1980s most medicaid services fo r people with

the major change in the use of facilities to provide care for this population is that many residents ar now in smaller fac ilities or in facilities operated by local government or privat organizations

services respite care training for the family day treatment or other partial hosp italization and voca tional services45 there has been little study of how states pay for particular home and community services while reimburse ment methodologies for regu lar medicaid services are described in state plans methodologies for wa iver services are not instead they are described in individual waiv er applications and waiv er amendments which are maintained by cms regional offices and are not readily accessible occasional surveys of state waiver programs have not addressed reimbursement in part because service coverage and service definitions va ry so widely that crossstate comparisons are impossible46 even within state there ma be multiple waiver programs each with its own service definitions and paymen t rules finally agencies providers and researchers in this field often tend to think of medicaid as funding stream merged with other sources of funding fo r clients and do not focus on individual medicaid payment transactions given the complexity of waiver programs and the limits of available information on reimbursement full review of payment ru is beyond the scope of this report instead the following discussion provides illustrations of how different states pay for two key services personal care and case management these may serve to highlight some of the policy

the agencies earned only little more than the minimum wage48 some states vary payment not accordin g to whether services are performed by an agency or an individual provider but according to some measure of intensity for example louisiana pays slightly high er rate per hour of care for high need participants 1136 versus 1005 per hour of regular care marylands nonwaiver personal care program uses three daily rates for personal care based on the complexity of the beneficiarys needs nd informal support system 10 per day for minimal assistance furnished in one visit 20 for extensive help provided in one or two daily visits and 50 for constant supe rvision and assistance throughout the day there are concerns that daily as opposed to hourly rates give providers incentives to minimize the hours of care they provide however rates are set case studies found th at states often failed to increase them over time even to account for inflation one conclusion was that given the choice between increasing enrollment and raising rates states preferred to cover more beneficiaries as is the case for direct care workers in nursing homes low payment or wage rates for personal care workers have led to problems in recruiting and high turnover the problems are made wors if waiver limits on covered hours per individual mean that the work ers cannot even work fulltime49 in the 19981999 survey 61 of states reported recruiting pr oblems the authors suggest that supply problems may in turn lead to poor quality lack of access and ultimately premature institutional pl acement for participants high turnover may also mean limited training and lack of skills needed to pr ovide necessary support services as well as difficulty in establishing workerclient relationships few states have made additional payments to agencies that agree to pay higher wages however as table 23 showed of 28 states with wage passthrough programs only six had extended these prog rams to personal care services some states such as washington have also acted to improve direct payment to independent workers but only by 1 per hour leaving ra tes well below those paid to agencies at least one state new

beneficiary and conducting periodic rea ssessments of the beneficiarys needs and modifying the plan of care as needed51 while most waiver programs provide case management states differ in how it is structur ed and paid for some states use their own employees whether in the medicaid unit or in another unit such as the agency responsible for mrdd services some c ontract with agencies or individuals specifically to provide case management while others pay public or nonprofit agencies bundled rate that includes case management and service provision however case management is paid for recurring issue is whether the funding is adequate to hire suffi cient qualified personnel gao s reported that in 20 of 51 waiver programs reviewed by cms regiona l offices or state audits case managers were not providing ongoing assessment and monitoring of waiver beneficiaries or followup of changes in beneficiaries car needs was inadequate this may be due in part to the fact that managers in some states carry larger caseload than in others the variation may in turn be function of reimbur sement levels the state of washington pays area agencies on aging aaas to manage participants in both the ad and mrdd waivers the state treats case management as part of the aaas administrative budget ra ther than as service and thus allows fixed amount set at the start of the year the amount does not change even if caseloads rise in addition the annual budgets assume an average caseload per manager this has gone from 100 in the late 1990s to proposed 75 in fy2001fy2003 but some advocates say this is still too high for adequate contact and quality monitoring in new jerseys mrdd program budget s for countylevel community services offices assume three different levels of managers with different caseloads and visit frequency primary direct supervision of an individual living alone with caseload of 3545 and monthly visits program management of people in residential settings where

the payment in 2000 included 32 per day for services and 9 or 10 for administration the agency is at risk if average service costs for all clients exceed the allowance there are concerns that some agencies might treat the 32 figu re as an individual ceiling rather than an aggregate one to limit potential losses for clients with complex needs there is an exceptions process under which an agency

children or higherincome families enrolled through medicaid expansion waivers to enroll in mcos either statewide or in selected areas in other states enrollment is voluntary beneficiaries may choose between an mco and feefors ervice with or without primary care case management feature some states have mandatory enrollment in some geographic areas and voluntary enrollment in others federal medicaid law requires simply that prepaid payments to the entity be made on an actuarially sound basis until recently federal regu lations provided that state payments for enrollees in mcos could not exceed the feeforservice equivalent the estimated amount the st ate would have spent for comparable population not enrolled in the mco and c ontinuing to receive services on feeforservice basis this limit was similar to the adjusted average per capita cost aapcc formerly used in setting medicare hmo payments the use of the feeforservice equivalent as an uppe r limit was dropped in 2001 partly because some states had enrolled so many benefici aries in mcos that they longer had reliable data on feeforservice experien ce instead the regulations now provide detailed specifications of what would c onstitute actuarially sound payment rates under the new rules qualified actuary must certify that the states capitation rates have been developed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices rates must be based only on services covered under the states medicaid plan that is the state may not pay extra for services available under the mco contract but not provided to other bene ficiaries finally the state must provide cms with documentation of the basis for th rates and with an explanation of any incentive arrangements or stoploss reinsurance or other risksharing methodologies these contractua l options are explained belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs90 53 under fullrisk contract the mco assume s liability for most or all covered medicaid services contracts may have carveouts or exclusions for specific services such as mental health care or prescription drugs which the state buys in some other way in addition contracts commonly exclude longterm care servicesratesetting methods this section provides information on how states establish payment rates for mcos it relies on two national surveys 2001 survey by the urban institute that collected information from 36 of the 39 states with fullrisk mco contracts53 and 2003 survey of 41 states by the national academy for state health policy this survey included the 39 states with fullri sk contracts and two additional states alabama and south dakota that have prepaid contracts for limited services basic approach capitation rates can be established in three basic ways the state can simply set them administratively it can negotiate with plans or it can use process of competitive bidding table 30 shows the basic method in use in states in 2001 as the urban institute report poi nts out states may actually use mix of methods state that sets rates may also engage in negotiation while one that relies on competitive bids might have some limits on what bids will be deemed acceptable the urban institute report suggests that some states have moved away from competitive bidding because it is administr atively burdensome and the results are often subject to disputes states with rger numbers of enrollees are somewhat more likely to use administered ratesetting as are states with higher proportion of enrollees in commercial mcos table 30 principal approach to mco ratesetting 2001

county in the ushowever rates are established states commonly pay different amounts for different enrollees depending on enrollee characteristics most states use age sex and eligibility category to set rates somewhat fewer use geography possibly because some states have contracts that only cover one geographic area only few states consider whether an enrollee is in an institution or is dually eligible for medicare and medicaid this is presumably because many states do not enroll beneficiaries who are aged or disabled in mcos finally 18 states consider health status in plan payment of these

lowercost populations within each cell in state with very many cells data used to set rates for each cell might be statistically unreliabl and values could fluctuate widely from year to year54 federal regulations currently require that states make adjustments for eligibility category age sex and geography but allow state to explain why an element is not applicable inadequate sample size would be one acceptable explanation states are encouraged but not required to use adjustments based on health status or diagnosis reinsurance risk sharing and incentive payments while mcos agree to accept financial liability for the serv ices required by thei r enrollees there are number of reasons why it may be necessary to limit their potential losses on individual cases or in the aggregate firs t

national academy for state health policy for the congressional research service in 2003 new york reported both voluntary and mandatory state reinsurance programs one way in which mcos whether or not contracting with medicaid commonly limit losses is by purchasing re insurance sometimes known as stoploss coverage from commercial reinsurer the reinsurer assumes some or all of the liability when costs for an individual rollee exceed deductible amount such as 100000 or 250000 less commonly the entity might obtain aggregate reinsurance which limits its overall losses for the year for example the reinsurer might begin paying claims when the entitys costs exceed 110 of revenues in 2002 19 states reported that their risk contractors obtained commercial reinsurance six of these states required contractors to do so other states act as reinsurers themselves for example an mco contract might provide that the contractor will be liable for the first 25000 in costs for medicaid enrollee after which the state would assume liability of 13 states with these arrangements reinsurance was voluntary in six and manda tory in six one state reported both voluntary and mandatory coverage ven states provide what amounts to reinsurance by limiting contractors liability for enro llees with specific conditions such as hivhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32644crs94 55 federal regulations provide that total payments to the mco under risk corridor arrangement may not exceed what would have been paid under medicaid feeforservice for the services received by enrollees plus an ad ministrative allowance note that this rule relates to services actually furnished to rollees while the repealed feeforservice equivalent rule compared capitation rates to average expenditures for comparable non enrolled population 56 while there are rules prohibiting these practices they may be difficult to detect and there is long history of such abus under both medicaid and medicare 57 see page 93five states had contracts with risk corridors these work somewhat like aggregate reinsurance the contractor is liable for all costs up to some fixed percentage of its capitati on revenue costs above th limit are shared by the contractor and the state or may be assumed entirely by the state55 four states had risk pools in which multiple contractor s make payments usually per capita assessment into combined fund that is used to help pay for highcost cases finally there are four states that base their prospective capitation rates for year on projected feeforservice ex penditures for comparable population and recalculate those rates retrospectively if feeforservice costs are greater than expected nashp treats this as risksharing arrangement however it is different from the others in that it does not relate to the contractors actual spending finally state may provide supplementa l incentive payments to an mco for meeting specified performance targets for example providing more child health screenings under the early and periodic scr eening diagnostic and treatment program epsdt or the state may share savings with the mco that is it may split the difference between the mcos capitation ra tes and the estimated amount that would have been spent for the enrollees in th feeforservice program federal rules require that these arrang ements cannot provide payments greater than 105 of approved capitation rates must be offered equally to pub lic and private contractors and may not be linked to in tergovernmental transfers risk adjustment rate cells based only on age sex eligibility category or location can capture differences in aver age spending for entire population groups but cannot predict the level of risk represen ted by individual enrollees within each population defined by rate cell there can be significant variation in health status and likely costs this has two consequences first in states in which mco enrollment is voluntary the group choosing to enroll may have better or worse health status than the group choosing to remain in the feeforservice system if capitation rates are based on feeforservice experien ce overall payments to mcos might not reflect the level of risk they are ssuming second when multiple mcos are competing any one entity might be ove r or underpaid depending on the health status of the beneficiaries it enrolled this creates incentives to market to healthier beneficiaries andor promote disenrollment by sicker ones56 as mentioned earlier nashp reports that nine states have attempted to deal with this problem by adding risk adjustment to their ratesetting methods57 risk adjustment systems assign enrollees to some form of health status or diagnostic category capitation rates are increased or decreased to reflect higher or

more likely to drop out one reason might be that medicaid imposes special administrative requirements plans with few medicaid enrollees cannot justify the costs or they may fail to develop the care systems needed to effectively manage medicaid beneficiaries59 the commercial mco share of enrollment peaked in 1999 and has since been dropping this trend is not necessarily re lated to payment rate s this was period when many mcos were losing money and reevaluating their overall business strategies at one time it would have been assumed that declining commercial participation raised cerns about access and quality until passage of the bba most mco plans participating in medicaid were required to have commercial enrollees as well on the theory that employ ers and private enrollees were in better position to press for highquality care than medicaid beneficiaries if this was ever true since the passage of the bba states have arguably been at least as active in monitoring quality as private purchasers however even if increasing reliance on medicaidonly plans does not necessarily mean quality problems it is not clear how these plans will be affected by the current financial pressures on states as was shown in table 8 above about half of states with mco programs plan to freeze or reduce their capitation rates for fy2004 medicaidonly plans cannot shift sses to other

reasonable two separate limits on acquisition costs are used one for certain multiple source drugs those for which therapeutic equivalents or generic versions are available from three or more suppliers and one for all other drugs the limits are designed to encourage the substitution of lower cost generic equivalents for more co stly brand name drugs61 since 1991 pharmaceutical

plans to negotiate supplemental rebates with manufacturers in return for an exemption from prior authorization requirements instead of re taining the rebate the state would pass it on to pharmacies which would in turn give discounts to uninsured consumers the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers association phrma obtained an injunction blocking impleme ntation of the program partly on the ground that medicaid law prohibited maine from limitin g access to services by medicaid beneficiaries to benefit other citizens the supreme court lifted the injunction in may 2003 but did not actually rule that the program was legal it could still be subject to scrutiny by cms or lower courts71 pharmacy plus cms is sponsoring dem onstration program under which states may extend pharmacy benefits to
