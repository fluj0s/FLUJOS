bridge publications inc newsletter date the most desirable state the most desirable state in an individual is complete selfdeterminism such selfdeterminism may be altered and shaped to some degree by education and environment but so long as the individual is not aberrated he is in possession of selfdeterminism so long as he is selfdetermined in his actions he adjusts himself successfully to the degree that his environment will permit such an adjustment he will be more forceful effective and happier in that environment than when aberrated the basic individual is not buried unknown or different person but an intensity of all that is best and most able in the person the basic individual equals the same person minus his pain and dramatizations l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book the dynamics of life by l ron hubbard can fetus hear inside the womb medical researchers are always keen to announce new breakthrough or discovery recently great fanfare was made over the discovery that human fetus in the womb can actually hear and can distinguish its mothers voice there is still much controversy in the medical field over exactly what fetus can hear or how clearly it can distinguish sounds the question is why are medical researchers continuing to spend millions of dollars on subject that was fully researched and documented over fifty years ago the discussion continues as to whether parents should talk to their unborn child and whether they should play music to it if so should they play mozartor is rap good for fetus too any concerned parent would want to know exactly what things effect fetus and to what degree what are the effects on the fetus of physical accident to pregnant mother how does fetus react to marital fight does it make any difference whether an expecting mother is happy or sad should husband have sexual intercourse with his pregnant wife attempted abortion is not very nice subject the truth of the matter is that in these days of lax sexual morals it probably occurs much more than one realizes it is dark secret that many mothers carry with them hopeful that one will ever find out but what effect would an attempted abortion have on fetus since the fetus has many more perceptions than current science allows what effect does this have on the life of baby that survives his mothers attempt to kill him the particular breakthrough of fetus being able to hear has actually been around in published material for over fifty years in fact an ancient jewish religious text mentions that the fetus may smell the aroma of certain type of food and desire it in his book dianetics the modern science of mental health l ron hubbard lays out amongst other things the results of his research into the perceptions of fetus he documents with actual case studies the effects on fetus of such things as attempted abortions sexual intercourse with pregnant women loud noises and even the coughs and sneezes of an expecting mother he also explains how these things affect person in later life and what one can do to eradicate or cure any of these illeffects scientists at the university of florida recently conducted series of unique experiments on pregnant ewe designed to record exactly what sounds reach the fetal ear they concluded that fetus can hear but that as for music fetus is not going to hear the violins but they will hear the drums if this were true then it would seem that rap music would have more of an effect on fetus than mozart other research has established that fetus responds well to mozart which would indicate that fetus actually can hear violins in fact research from queens university in ontario has shown conclusively that fetus can distinguish its mothers voice from that of other women the questions remainshow much can fetus actually hear is it possible that fetus can hear words and record them the university of florida research which has received more that 1 million from the navy the national institutes of health and the march of dimes contributed to federal workplace safety guidelines that today limit the duration of extremely loud noise exposure for pregnant women this is undoubtedly good thing and the reasons for this are explained in mr hubbards book during his research in the 40s mr hubbard detailed the fact that person can recall exact conversations that took place while he was still fetus in his mothers womb as incredible as this may seem it certainly points to the fact that fetus has much higher and more accurate perceptions than previously supposed the
