used by the house by substituting the houses portion of the use of the capito l power plant natural gas for coal and to offset the carbon emitted from burning natural gas the house will purchase carbon offsets after taking into account the other changes made under the green the capitol initiative the house is offsetting 30000 tons of carbon through the purchase of carbon financial instrument contracts or carbon credits through ccx chicago climate exchange totaling approximately 90000 funding for the purchase of these carbon offsets is available in the chief administrative officers fiscal year 2008 budget26 for fy2009 the cao has requested 125000 for the purchase of carbon offsets the cao testified that he hopes the house will not need to purchase carbon credits to remain carbon neutral in fy2009 if however the purchase of credits is necessary then the chicago climate exchange like the new york stock exchange is marketplace where prices fluc tuate depending on supply and demand accordingly in the event that we need to purchase the same amount of carbon credits in fy2009 as we did in fy2008 we would expect potential increase in the purchase price27 natural gas in the capitol power plant the house has decided to stop using coal to generate steam in the power plant instead the house is working to use only natural gas to generate the steam necessary to operate the heating and cooling system in the house office buildings nd in the house portion of the capitol building28 because the house office buildings do not receive steam separately from other buildings the house has directed th architect to purchase additional natural gas so that the proportion of steam supplied to the house will longer be generated with coal and fuel oil29 in testimony before the house

43 percent natural gas 47 percent coal and 10 percent fuel oil32 additionally gao reported that to complete the green the capitol goal of using only natural gas to supply steam to the house would require 38 increase in the use of natural gas based on available data and key assump tions about the plants operation and future fuel costs we estimated that fulfilling the green th capitol initiatives fuelswitching directive would require th plant to increase its natural gas use by 38 percent relative to its baseline level of fuel consumption between 2001 and 2007 as portion of the plants total fu mix natural gas would increase from about 43 percent of overall energy input to about 60 percent of input using information from the aoc on its fuel xpenditures and fuel price

as it accomplishes nothing but makes you feel g ood about yourself113 to illustrate the point the minority leader referred to an article in the washington post that questioned the logic of purchasing carbon offsets and stated that the money the house spent may not have provided the perceived benefit114 the article traced where the houses money went in an effort to offset pollution some of the money went to farmers in north dakota for tilling practices that keep carbon buried in the soil but some farmers were already doing this for other reasons before the house paid cent other funds went to iowa where power plant has been temporarily rejiggered to burn more cleanly but that test project had ended more than year before the money arrived115 the washington post also quotes the ranking member of the house administration committee as saying this is just extra money in their pocket for something theyre already doing116 on january 14 2008 the ranking member of the house committee on energy and commerce and the ranking member of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations sent letter to comptroller general david m walker requesting that gao examine the carbon credits

administration on renewable energy and the capitol complex yes i am very skeptical about carbon offsets i could put it pleasantly but i might as well just put it bluntly the opportunities for scamming that thing are huge and the question i have been unable to get anybody to answer for when we have gotten into that area is how do you know that the person who plants tree in order to provide the carbon ffset would not have planted the tree anyway and indeed i have heard from some farmers who have said you know i just got an insight into major new income stream for because as i was out planting trees somebody came up and said can we buy the planting of your trees to sell as carbon offsets nd he said i would have planted the trees anyway but now i can get some money for doing something that would have happened anyway and when i raised that with some people they say oh well we are going to investigate that we are going to have to be sure that there is in fact real carbon offset rather than scam121 capitol dome opponents of the green the capitol in itiative are also dissatisfied with the process used to solicit and ev aluate proposals to relight the capitol dome the

drastically cut our energy consumption if speaker pelosi would like to upgrade the capitols lighting system at such an exuberant cost why doesnt she just come out and say it furthermore it would take more than 45 years to recoup the money spent on the new energy efficient systems design my question is this if it is not going to significantly cut energy consumption and it will actually cost more money in the long run what is the goal of such extensive and costly overhaul124 the house minority leader also stated his opposition to the cost of the design contract when he was quoted in washington post article everyone supports making the capitol more energy efficien t but we dont have to waste taxpayer dollars to do it this is ridiculous boondoggle125 the house minority leader restated his opposition in his july 29 2008 letter to the speaker in the letter the minority leader refuted the caos claim that relighting the capitol dome will save congress money mr beard claims that this effort will save money on lighting costs but in reality it will take the house more than 50 years to generate enough energy savings to finally recoup the cost of mr beards misguided design effort when

option of passing resolution creating more formal greening initiative the resolution could create program that includes input from both the majority and minority and considers the critiques of the

the passage of either concurrent resolution or bill could create more formal cooperative greening program that would compass activities in the house and the senate cooperation between chambers might encourage costs savings since purchasing services or goods in quantity of ten leads to lower prices additionally the passage of concurrent resolution or bill would allow the house and senate to
