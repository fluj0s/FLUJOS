flattening process lecture given on 19 march 1964 how are you today good thank you whats the date audience 19th of march 19 march 19 march 14 all right with you if i begin this lecture now what would you like to know about today anything you want to know well in view of the fact that you have preference ill talk to you about auditing and this is some of the basic knowhows of auditing somewhere along the line many an auditor lays aside some of his basic information on the subject of auditing he hides it under his emeter or something of the sort and starts doing something silly and then wonders all of sudden why hes having trouble and its very interesting how silly some of these things can be now there was subject called flattening process now this has been mostly forgotten its even part of the auditors code but it gets forgotten it gets forgotten and what you need to know about this what you need to know about this is that there are two aspects to ending process there are two aspects to this thing and they are both concerned with what are you doing with the process thats the main question what are you doing with the process well what you are doing with it tells you how to end it and how you can end it and these two things are youre trying to fix up the pc so he can be audited thats number one and number two you are trying to audit the pc and they give you two different endings now you can see at once that number one is basically concerned with rudiments you got present time problem well yeah i have present time problem so on so on and so on all right very good all right and i yeah i did i had an awful problem and so forth and well i guess it was mostly my fault cognition see serves as cognition all right you have present time problem you dont get any read on the meter you dont have anything and thats the end of that process what was the process well the process was just doing enough to cure the elsewhereness of the pc trying to get him into the room now if you dont know that there are two different directions in processing then you will seldom have pc in front of you to be audited and you will never finish cycle of action let show you what happens to cycle of action you start in prepcheck on gooper feathers you see you start in this prepcheck on gooper feathers thats the fuzz from peaches and you start this thing and you got it going in the session on the twelfth and you got it going and you got one or two buttons in and the pc comes into the next session with big present time problem about angeles or something so now you run process about the present time problem in angeles and you get couple of buttons in on that but he comes to the session the next time you see with an even worse problem you see about seattle so you audit the problem about seattle so forth well thats just because you as an auditor wouldnt know the purpose of your tools you got little hatful of tools that takes out of the road what is getting in your road in trying to complete cycle of action on your pc you have business whatsoever present time problem storm rain night income tax any other catastrophe see you have business whatsoever permitting any present time catastrophe to get in the road of your auditing well youve been presented with little kit and it says on it how to get the pc going in session and included in that is keying out knocking out destimulating getting rid of the things which have him so distracted that you cant go on now if you never use that kit you will do nothing but qanda you will do nothing but leave unflat cycles of action do you see what happens you get something started in session and the pc comes into session b and hes got present time problem about something or other and hes just had big cognition whats really wrong with his lumbosis is something or other so you audit this please please please please what in essence have you done you have mistaken your tools made complete bust as far as what youre supposed to be doing is concerned you got this big set of tools over here you understand and they got hydraulic highpressure drills and dump trucks and all that sort of thing thats all sitting over here you see and you got this little bunch of shiny instruments of some kind or other over here and theyre just supposed to get something out of the road fast see and the pc comes in oh i had this big cognition about once upon time in angeles wohwohwog youre halfway through this prepcheck on gooper feathers you see so look look look how idiotic it is you reach for these dump trucks and hydraulic drills over here to handle this problem about angeles oh man you know just sad its sad all you need is this little whisk broom see youre supposed to take this problem and this cognition and youre just supposed to take this little whisk broom the little kit over that comes in on top about half the size of the tool box on the hydraulic drill see youre supposed to take this little kit and you take out the little brush out of it and you go fzt ztt fzt thats the end of that process see and you put that back in again and you say all right now on the subject of gooper feathers on gooper feathers in this lifetime has anything been and were away you understand so its just basically making mistake in the purpose of the tools and therefore this leads an auditor into this kind of nonsense well hes always had trouble hes always had trouble with his back so for some reason or other were doing prepcheck on his back i dont say this is good process or bad process you see but were doing prepcheck on his back and were going to end this after five minutes on cognition hey whats this now that is we have shoved the hydraulic drills and the dump trucks over here and weve picked up this little tiny kit and weve got this thing thats bothered him all of his whole lifetime and weve taken this little brush out of the kit and weve gone flick flick and nothing happens see so we kind of brushed the brush off see and we take this other little thing and brush at it and nothing happens and we say well auditing doesnt work youre using the wrong pickaxe you see what i mean naw this is really you have to audit thing proportionately to the amount of trouble it has given the pc so there are two ways to end process and they all depend on what youre trying to do so were processing this guy on gooper feathers big prepcheck in progress its all compounded with all kinds of oddities ramifications and cognitions and its going on and on and on and on and on well now that is done only with one blunt instrument called tone arm and that tells you when it is flat and you frankly have to unflatten the whole subject before you flatten it hes got it beautifully suppressed thats tone arm flattening and today you only flatten with the tone arm while using dump trucks hydraulic drills and so forth youre handling the big case youre handling the big stuff of the case and you handle that by tone arm and that is how you end the process and that is the only way you end the process and that is auditing with an exclamation point thats mainsession auditing all done with the ta rudiment type auditing is simply there to have an undistracted comfortable pc who is happy about sitting in the chair and getting the main performance on and thats rudimenttype processing and what ive seen of your auditors reports what ive heard of your auditors reports in recent times i may be very unjustly cruel maybe i am being cynical and sardonic professorially sneeresque but the truth of the matter is i think you are using rudiment approach to mainsession processing i think youve gotten it mixed up to the point where you take the mainsession process the big prepcheck on and youre ending it as though it were rudiment process as though you were merely trying to get the pc to sit still so he could be audited how much auditing do you think youre really going to accomplish youre not going to accomplish very much because youre using the wrong ending so you take this big thing over here youre going to get rid of this bad back you see and on back has anything been suppressed see i dont think so pc says i would sit there with my eyes rather wide open as an auditor does your back bother you or doesnt it well yes it bothers dont you think someplace in your lifetime somewhere or another in your lifetime in some place or another theres po for instance you ever have any accidents with it when you were kid something like that you ever have anything going on you know restimulation the guy gives it away i guess i have must have because i have bad back now all right now you let repeat this question on bad back or on back now listen to carefully now lis lis listen to this auditing question listen now on back has anything been suppressed suppressed you got that now got the question all right now go ahead and answer that question got it now huh were away for the long haul man now this is the reverse thats the main session thats the big show way of getting this thing on the line see thats the way of getting it all squared now get this approach just get this other brushoff approach well you say your backs been troubling you all right is that present time problem yes it is heh come to think about it it is well good youve had cognition thats the end of the session do i make my pernt you got to get in there and sweat you know you can take one of these old youre going to see lot of auditing by lists this is moving up the first auditing by lists we saw was ow and so forth but there are many types of lists that can be designed and ive got this right on the assembly line for hgcs auditing by list its auditing by list not arc break assessments by list but you could use an arc break assessment sheet to audit by list you see but you do it differently its handled like old r2h was take each point that you get read on up with the pc see so you take this old ow this list of overts you know the old johannesburg the joburg see check list well do you know that by very carefully modulating your voice and making impingement on the pc being very careful not to make any impingement on the pc covering the questions in sort of throwaway tone of voice you see you ever stolen anything ah i guess not well thats fine thats flat nothing to that all right did you ever work under an assumed name of course you wouldnt i know that and so on i sort of got that well thats flat its all flat its all flat its all flat oh this fellows passed his prepcheck ive seen herbie here almost just growing sparks out of his head on the subject of checking out somebody who has been sec checked on that old joburg list you see keow as an auditor you should be able to make an impingement so the instructor checking the thing out with that altitude fixes the person who is being checked out for clean sheet you see with gimlet eye and says have you ever worked under an assumed name pow the meter blows up see the poor student says why didnt that happen to see you know thats flunk flunk flunk your checksheet is not complete youve got to do this whole case over again you know whats happened to you know how come how come well he didnt bother to restimulate anything to pick up that was how come well now in mainsession auditing that which fits between the start of the body of the session and the end of the body of the session that sort of stuff is laid in with club you purposely restimulate what youre trying to pick up you dont want this to end in hurry you want this auditing to go on for while now this auditing that occurs outside of the body of the session you know in the rudiments that is just well you dont have present time problem do you good ah thank you see thats the approach you use then you restimulate nothing well you look pretty good how are you doing oh youre doing all right all right is it okay with you if we start the body of the session i know you dont have that in your model session right now but im putting it down here as emphasis and maybe it ought to be put into model session to show you where the club fits but first before that starts you see thats just well all right well your tone arm is nice and loose here tone arm seems to be low rather and your needles nice and loose and everything seems to be okay nothing worrying you is it all right all right good good good im glad of that yeah all right oh you say you do have present time problem what was it about oh yeah yeah all right yeah all right all right good good all right well hows the presenttime problem now that didnt read all right now now is it all right with you if i we get to work here on this subject of gooper feathers that we were prepchecking now you had any thoughts about this since the last time i audited you there you know you gone over this in your mind any improvement at all on the subject of anything so forth oh you have huh restimulation see getting his mind getting his main concentration oh you have huh oh is that so yeah yeah yeah yeah tell you used to telling you used to have nightmares about this did you have nightmare about it or anything like that last night oh yeah yeah is that so well lets see wed gotten along here pretty well down on the subject weve gotten onto suggested here pretty well and i think your last answer to this had something to do with what what was your last answer to that oh yeah yeah yeah well that was on this subject yeah all right well heres the next question on that heres the next question on that on gooper feathers has anything been suggested you got that question all right good now on gooper feathers has anything been suggested all right and here we go watching that tone arm its just sitting there taking down the tone arm reads and keeping the pc going and the pc finally said well that isnt any more there it just that there isnt any more i havent got any more answers to that im protesting the question all right is this question being protested im sorry theres read there now what what else might we have run into on this you might run into something else there that you havent told or something like that did i miss an answer or something of this sort oh i did miss suggest answer oh all right well good thank you im glad we got that cleared up and heres your next question on gooper feathers has anything been suggested get the idea youre just keeping it in there man keeping that in the groove keeping that grinding on and on and on see tone arm action when do you leave it needle isnt flashing around anymore and the tone arm isnt blowing down on this particular subject well lets unload tone arms have tendencies to go very very quiet i give you something like twentyminute test thats little bit cruel on the pc sometime an auditor can tell when tone arm is flat it isnt moving also when you tend to flatten one of these things the meter starts to look gummy you can tell when theyre flat shift to your next question youre trying to cover subject in the main body of the session and you are trying to recover pc for your session in the rudiment approach so realize that there are two targets for auditing in session and that gives you two different endings you dont want this pc to be dispersed out of what you are already doing so you put in rudimenttype approach since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed well you spend fifteen twenty minutes getting in those since bmrs oh marvelous marvelous thats good now you can start in your main session but it is not with the same approach youre not doing the same thing i could be very cruel at this point and say well i want to congratulate most auditors because theyve gotten up to point now to where they are ready to learn how to run the body of session having handled rudi thatd be shade too cruel wouldnt it bitter bitter but i watch this i watch this consistently and i notice that auditors vary in this approach and they very often start treating body of session material as though theyre just rudiments and believe they dont do very much for pcs in fact they damage pcs how by leaving unflat cycles of action if you really want to lash pc around the telegraph pole man just start cycle of action after cycle of action and dont flatten any of them you just get enough cycles of action unflat on your pc and hell be in mess now let give you some idea of how to really sock pc lets take class vi not because we have to reach into that zone because that is the most brutal area where things stand up in tremendously bold relief you make some mistakes in that area and you know it you get the evidence immediately the little men in the ambulance backs up to the door dont you see and its quite embarrassing the neighbors talk you start to sort out goal but you dont sort it out and then you get interested in goal b but you never bring it to conclusion and then you wonder if somethings happening with the emeter because you dont seem to be able to get any reads in other words you really cant think of anything to ask the pc that gets read on it so you ask you start asking some questions about the emeter but you really dont clean up the subject of the emeter dont you see and then you wonder if theres any wrong goals that the person has had that are troubling him but you really dont find all of those and clean those up believe about that time the pc practically goes straight through the bottom of the chair he will be dealing with wog and hell be turning on pain he will be turning on dizziness the corners of the room will start going out of plumb on him he cant focus the auditor the winds of space start blowing his eyeballs into the back of his skull you know youve done it and what happened its just incomplete cycle of action followed by an incomplete cycle of action followed by an incomplete cycle of action followed by an incomplete cycle of action you really didnt do anything wrong you just didnt do anything complete and that all by itself will wind pc up in ball well now thats very exaggerated level but things stand out in such bas relief at that level that it brought around to inspecting the lower levels of auditing and i found out that the lower levels of auditing are peculiarly subject to this but its not so dramatic in other words it takes while for it to sneak up and you dont see it all in twenty minutes of auditing you see you see it over years worth of auditing you get lots less action and the pc is just feeling sort of groggy these days he just doesnt feel too good and so forth well if you were to take almost any pc in the place and say has any process ever been left unflat on you and you just ran that as process dont qanda with him and try to flatten any of the processes just run process has any process ever been left unflat on you and youll see your pc start brightening up somebody whos had quite lot of auditing hell start brightening up even though it is not serious on his case it is quite capable of producing considerable improvement or result hell give you the considerations concerning it just in the matter of fact of the question but its just repetitive question process now what do you think happens when you start prepcheck on gooper feathers and shift over to bad back before gooper feathers are flat and get into bad back and then get into this and get into that all kinds of oddball things start occurring the pcs ability to be prepchecked starts blowing up amongst other things pc cant be prepchecked easily anymore the auditing tool starts getting all blunted up and messed up oh i think thats quite remarkable the tool has been abused now you can put in bad comm cycle with an auditing tool also like prepchecking and get the tool very badly blunted up so that you can actually prepcheck prepchecking see prepchecking just put in all the prepcheck buttons on prepcheck on prepchecking and so forth you can do this several ways on suppress has anything been suppressed has anything been invalidated you know put in all the buttons on suppress there are several ways you could go about this just as general subject put in all the buttons you see as each button its quite remarkable ive seen case all hung up in mess on the subject of goals checkout and so forth till somebody was suddenly bright enough to say on suppress has anything been suppressed all of sudden its an operating button again quite remarkable revelation but the basic reason the button goes out is an incomplete cycle of action now you should as an auditor be very very well aware of this thing called cycle of action it predicates this one basis that things have point where they start that they have period when they continue and that there is point when they end now that is cycle of action its your createsurvivedestroy cycle of action its start change and stop actually you could put it down probably less effectively as philosophic definition but more workably as start and an action and stop see start and an action and stop you could be more explicit by saying start an action which then continues and then stop and that is cycle of action that is just in that whole line life is probably cruel because things seldom stop there is great deal of thought put into continuation continuance is one of the bugs that thetans are addicted to they like to see things continue and youve got actions going right now which began with the beginning of the universe and nobody has stopped them since see theyve never been stopped and that alone gives the longevity and mass of the physical universe actions which were begun were never unbegun you know or stopped time itself is probably some basic agreedupon postulate which nobody has ever thought the end of so youve still got time you see now these things of course are done by postulate but at low level an individual is subject to them and any case is subject to the cycle of action maybe he will get up to point sooner or later where he is above the cycle of action oh i say maybe yes undoubtedly class vi weve got all the stuff to put him there and you get such oddities as guy being able to move around in time this is one of the more peculiar aspects of highlevel action youre not fixed in time span you can widen your time span almost at will and there doesnt have to be anything there in the past time but you can be in that past time period and so on it gives you all sorts of involvements for instance you can be at the event while it is occurring by having been in the future and come back to it and undo it before it goes on its very confusing well because its confusing and because its upsetting lets take two armies fighting each other and army attacks army b so therefore army b knows that if it is in this position where it is being attacked at the time it is attacked why then it will be attacked so the thing to do is to be in yesterday and not march to that place and we very soon have generals out of job we have various things going awry game becomes very difficult to follow and trace so the thetan settles for the simpler life and that is what is is what will be will be inshallah see fate well what theyre involved with there kismet and everything else theyre just involved with the inevitability of cycle of action fatalism is the total subjugation of the individual by the cycle of action what will be will be if he starts going the car he will then go down the road and eventually the car will stop well they even have it rigged that way theyve got oil prices up to point where itll run out of fuel and theyve got tires to point where they wear out and the time payments will catch up with him and the skip men will come and get him something will stop this car in the main universe by friction and other conflicts particle traveling is acted upon until it stops in other words its all below the level of time everything is sort of geared up to follow in along the time if an action begins i mean single individual action not postulate like time if it begins it is sort of geared up to stop now there are some of these things have not stopped as i said moment ago which might be the composition of matter and such things as that but even those things have tendency to deteriorate as they go along now the point im trying to make here is that everybody is used to and in agreement with this thing called cycle of action you arent using it in your auditing because it is true i spoke to you the other day about gradient realities well its one of the realities and it reaches pretty high at case level its reality which fades out just before person can put some universal laws under control i mean its way up so the reality of the pc that you process is tied in from the very lowest to fairly advanced level with this thing called cycle of action and because the pcs reality is tied in with it violations of it bring about an unreality so if you want to tell him what can you find unreal just start busting his cycle of action as part of the auditing start process dont end it get process going drop it and the next thing you know he starts going all unreal on you youve got an agreement with him that he is going to get processed in certain direction to certain distance and then thats going to all come about hes still sitting in the middle of his bank not yet having asised all the material available on this and suddenly there he is parked there is nothing more done about it and hes got this mass now and these questions which he finished up quote finished up with since he didnt finish up and he carries those on over into the next process and then he never gets that finished so he carries on both of these now into the next process and he never gets that finished so he carries all three into the next process and youll find yourself all of sudden dealing with pc who is unflat on four processes well he wont smoothly asis anything for the only only for this reason because it looks very complicated to him its getting more and more complicated hes not getting free hes getting bogged down his idea of freedom is finishing up some cycles of action and let assure you that that is very very good observation well within his zones of agreement he knows that if he finishes his work he can quit see these are realities their truth is well its very funny to tell you this but their truth is limited but everybody agrees with it so therefore when you start snarling somebody up you have these two factors the mass he is mixed up with in his mind is restimulated but not asised so hes left with some mass hanging around and he carries this incomplete cycle of action over into the nextbegun cycle of action and he will start accumulating mass and start accumulating upsets and hell start getting loses now the idea of win is very closely tied in with the cycle of action very intimately this fellow wins ordinarily by having accomplished something you could even win to the point of having gone to point and then not having been destroyed when reaching that point so therefore you would have accomplished something you could even have negative approach you see well ive accomplished something i came downtown today and didnt get killed see even at that low level thats win now where does all that come from now what is the upper echelon to what ive just been talking to you about what is the upper echelon of this lets really have an esoteric flight here it comes under the heading of intention intention is part of the comm cycle but intention is senior to the comm cycle intention the ability to intend an intention contains in it every power the thetan has every power the thetan has the ability to throw lightning bolt the ability to hold something in position the ability to make something continue the ability to do away with something strength accomplishment power wit ability these things are all wrapped up on the one common denominator of intention intention when youre just half oh well when youre just halfshot as thetan and youve almost had it and you think youre on your last legs not in the condition youre in i mean but pretty bad off you know youre not yet wearing body youre probably packing around an effigy you have to be recognized and people have to say good morning to you or youre unhappy this kind of thing youre pretty gowed in with mass your own actual gpms are wrapped around your gullet your intention this is lowlevel skill this is not highlevel skill is quite good enough to for instance intend this crayon into the air in front of you to intend this emeter over to the other side of the desk this is lowlevel stuff im talking to you about guy is oh practically on his last legs when he can do this answering telephone one simply intends the telephone up into his vicinity where he is listening and can talk he intends it off the cradle up to his quote ear unquote and intends it back onto the cradle giving you straight stuff now this is almost recent time youve been able to do this in recent times it baffles you sometimes when piece of mest does not instantly and immediately obey you but thats simply intention thats lowlevel intention im not talking to you now about something very esoteric this would sound very startling and make newspaper reporter turn gray overnight but intend him in horizontal position outside the door five feet off the pavement and let him stay there for while and cool off i doubt hed write it because he of all people knows he couldnt do it but there is intention you get what i mean now by intention you intend something to happen and it happens the ability to intend and that is all there is to thetans power there is more to his power than that theres his ability to throw lightning bolt to set house on fire to make the roof fly off to turn planet upside down that is everything his intention so all you have to do to weaken thetan is to get in the road of his intentions foul up his intentions now if you can foul up thetans intentions you can weaken him now what do i mean by weaken him person picks up on monday fivehundredpound weight but on tuesday can only pick up threehundred pound weight between monday and tuesday he has been weakened right do you understand its this graphic its not the philosophic derivation of his morals become weak dont you know well on monday he can throw raw energy beam hundred yards on tuesday morning he can only throw one ten feet between monday and tuesday he has become weakened thats what i mean by weakened see and the way that is done is to give him loses on his intentions all youve got to do is foul up or counter or blunt his intentions and he becomes weaker weakness and strength in thetan and of course well his weakness is the only thing that holds him entrapped weakness is the only thing that keeps masses pulled in on him weakness is the only thing that keeps him pinned down you can only trap thetan when he is weak and you need only really be afraid of things that are very weak with of course the proviso of certain magazine editors they skip them leave them out of that category because theyve had it the main thing that we have to watch in this then in auditing is that we do not weaken the actual intention of the pc by blunting his actual intentions and in order to do this we must differentiate between his reactive intention his dramatization in other words and his own intention so we have the subdivision of the pc and his bank person who is dramatizing during an arc break actually is not intending anything they say this is simply bank dramatized do you see its all bank dramatized rowr rowr rowr rowr rowr he isnt intending anything that falls out then thats recording or something going off you see that is not his intention so we dont say that everything somebody must do we must validate you start validating the bank hundred percent and youve had it as an auditor but were talking about now the actual intentions of the person he intended to have twohourandahalf session and you give him threehourandahalf session you have blunted his intention he intended to get off this stuff about aunt hattie and you called the process flat long before it were flat so therefore you have blunted his intention you cant ruin pc im just talking about how smoothly you can audit you understand this because youre not going to spoil anybodys intentions or cave them in by auditing let assure you see but you can key in incidents on him and so forth where his intention is very badly blunted by simply taking an auditing cycle of action and not completing it in other words he intends so forth you intend so on you so on and there you go and you finish it off and you wind it up youve completed cycle of action that intention has gone through complete cycle of action then if you interrupt it halfway intention goals for the session goals for the session heres good point you get pc to put in goals for the session thats actually participating intention so i always work hard on giving pc goals for the session i almost work harder to give the pc his goals for the session than i do to give him session see i can give anybody session to cure anything or straighten him up see that doesnt worry but this pc sitting down there has just got through saying to feel better about my lumbosis ill put that in i wont take up the body of the session till ive got the oddball goal out of the road but i can any pc that is trying to break or stop or not go through with flattening and so forth putting in bunch of sideways goals could actually stop you from auditing or completing your cycle of action and roll himself up in ball reactive barrier can arise out of this situation so he puts in lot of oddball goals that dont have anything to do about the price of the thing ill still clean them up ill still clear them up but i take out the little kit you know the little kit with the little whisk broom i get those out of the road and notice the pc apparently has present time problem this is in r6 auditing this is not our ordinary auditing this is therefore any kind of auditing if youd pay attention to the pcs goals for the session at r6 when youre totally capable of getting hundred ta divisions you see in two and half hours well good heavens how much would it apply down at the levels when hes getting fifteen in twoandahalfhour session and lucky to get it see so this very definitely applies so heres heres the persons got goals for the session id look those things over pickety pow pow hes got present time problem here hahaha ho hohoho lets get the considerations for that present time problem are you i suppose you have present time problem here what what considerations have you had about that all right thats fine okay and you had bad neck been bothering you and so forth all right is that an r6 phenomenon is that from goals and it doesnt seem to be from goals gpms something else seems to have gone on here with regard to this what was the first you noticed this all right good all right well lets date this pow pow pow were doing about four and five minute process dont you see i mean were driving it right straight along the line we got the pc on it were just brushing this thing off see getting this out of the road but were doing this other thing were giving him the goal for the session see oh we got that out of the road we dated it the somatic blew and so forth you have to be quick on this kind of auditing hes made that goal for the session right there i havent even started the body of the session the session now is with since mid ruds and everything else that has happened is only thirtyfive minutes deep and were away into the body of the session on what i want to do hes already made his goals for the session you want to see the good indicators come in haha make sure the person gets any ptproblemtype of goal for the session and so forth get him win on it in the first five minutes of play then get down to something important oh yeah you say this takes very skilled very fast very tricky auditing you really have to know what youre doing to be able to get rid of somebodys lumbosis thats been keeping them up all night in the first ten minutes of the session whos getting rid of it we just keyed it out we just gave it swift kick so it isnt bothering the pc made his goal for the session too therefore his intention level is up so therefore hes more powerful in the session therefore he can look at his bank better see this thats why person makes progress while he has ptp his intentions are being blunted or overlooked and so he cannot rise superior to his bank so he makes progress what is ptp it is postulatecounterpostulate you could just as easy interpret this as intentioncounterintention you will not find present time problem where persons intentions have not been blunted something is fighting his intentions and he it seems to him that its of equal magnitude intention versus intention he has an intention somebody else has another intention these two intentions lock together and you get present time problem it tends to hang up in time and thats how you get time hangup basic time hangup intention counterintention lets look at class v for moment not because were teaching you anything about class v but because this is marvelous field of demonstration why do you think in the helatrobus and the trillionstwo and other implant areas oppose was in vogue it isnt even the actual gpm the actual gpm is subvolitional intention which is way downstairs it goes in with an axe everything inevitably brings about something else it doesnt matter what happens if something else is going to be brought about its very apathetic very low but these brisker levels more ambitious levels how did they knock out the power of thetan how could they possibly do anything to thetan well the implant means by using key goals like to go to stay to move to go away to forget to remember this type of goal all mucked up with innumerable variations of that goal serve as key intentions so what he intends to remember he of course will get nix to remember hed get an automatic and instant blunting of intention that was the intention of the implant very far from flawlessly works thetans transcend this stuff rather easily but there there is the woof and warp of implants and how they are done and why anybody setting up implants that are going to be successful would simply blunt intentions blunt intentions thats the whole thing so he says to move he immediately gets not to move see and then the implant gpms interact one against the other so if he gets the idea to stay then he feels he has to move and if he gets the idea to move then he feels hes got to stay so they counter oppose each other too so opposition or oppose is the keynote to an implant and this is the only way that theyre aberrative there is other reason bah the amount of mass and massschmass the thetan only keeps the mass of these things around because he cant get rid of them and hes automatically creating it and hes doing other things but an implant gpm has too little mass to be very upsetting to the individual but it upsets his ideas so he gets the idea to go and he gets the counterintention hits him in the face the way they civilize child for instance is to all they have to do is break all his intentions somebody talking about spoiling child or upsetting child thats very silly to say that by giving child everything you spoil the child or by being nice to child you spoil the child theyre just drawing longbow they couldnt be further from the mark its blunting every intention the child has and remember that there are reactive intentions and that there are analytical intentionstwo varieties so we let the reactive intention have its way child cries screams and throws tantrum we instantly give him what he wanted that validated the reactive intention the child wants to sit quietly and look out the window analytical intention so we get him busy doing something else by the time weve crossed these things in other words validated the reactive intentions by rewarding the child and obeying the reactions and blunted every analytical intention the child has well of course have weakened the thetan becomes susceptible to illness and that sort of thing simply because masses move in on him i mean very person who is weakened is unable to hold anything at distance so everything collapses on him you understand what im talking about this is terribly simple and there it evades understanding just by being in itself so idiotically simple so your pc has two types of intentions and one is totally reactive its just dramatization so we wont call it an intention we call it dramatization every time your pc dramatizes you let him have his way and every time your pc pleasantly nicely wants to do something analytically you blunt his intention after while youre going to have your pc practically spinny on the subject of auditing reaction he wont be able to handle things in session youll find the pc isnt cogniting youll find this and that and so forth theres many an auditor pays nothing attention to the pc until the pc starts arc breaking now the auditor knows something is happening so he decides to do something for the pc because the pc has arc broken but actually the pc has been sitting there auditing splendidly beautifully and smoothly his pcing is very nice and he sort of timidly brings up the fact that he would really like to you know hed really like to look at this engram hes seeing there just moment longer he brings this up he says its bothering him little bit he doesnt quite know what its all about its little bit of an origin you see it isnt going to take any time you dont give him an additional restimulation you say yes all right all right well whats it all about something like that soandso and soandso and soandso all right thats fine you get that out of the road and you go on dont you see but every time he says well i uh i dont know i dont really i dont really have any more answers to that question uh i uh well youre damn well going to answer the question see this is getting on to the borderline of intention dont you see so he kind of gets upset one way or the other the auditor doesnt pay any attention to whats going on there weve got an uncomfortable situation pcs intention cycles of action what hes doing and so forth theyre all kind of getting mixed up and the auditors paying attention to this because the pc is still in fairly sweet frame of mind you see when the pc finally loses you understand pc doesnt turn nasty pc gets overwhumped by his bank thats always the case and the pc own intentions having been blunted badly then loses control and the bank powered up overwhelms him and takes over control and on an automaticity starts blowing its head off going into all sorts of dramatization of one kind or other even though its just the dramatization of apathy bank is in dramatization well of course the auditor acts thats what we know as acting too late thats catching slipping situation too late gives you these explosive arc breaks they generally telegraph themselves way ahead but whats happened there is really the pc has become overwhelmed by his own bank youre not watching the pcs intentions now youre watching the pcs dramatization but you dont do anything about the pcs intentions you will eventually get the pcs dramatizations its quite an elementary situation its one which an auditor should understand now i spoke to you some time ago in lecture about what is win and what is lose just going over that cursorily win is accomplishing what you intend to accomplish or accomplishing the notaccomplishment of something you didnt intend to accomplish you get the idea you intended not to have any arc breaks and in the session you not had any arc breaks you understand well thats win see and lose is just exactly the reverse just exactly the reverse things you intended not to happen happened and things which you intended to happen didnt happen and thats lose and thats all win is and thats all lose is thats all so when we compare this situation to auditing we find out then that the auditors intention is valuable to the session and because hes less susceptible to dramatization from the bank in the pc since hes not really at all greatly susceptible to the bank in the pc its the pcs bank its not hitting the auditor and because the auditor is capable of standing outside that perimeter of potential dramatization the auditors intention in session is therefore senior to the pcs intention but if the pcs intention is totally neglected with regard to session we again get weakening of the pc and an encroachment of dramatization so the auditor intends to flatten off such and such process and the pc intends to take care of something else he has thought about overnight well that pc has been subject to dramatization because of restimulation youd be very foolish not to flatten out the original process because that was the original intention wasnt it that wasnt finished and yet the pc wants to do another one well this is going to hang him up with an intention loss whether he likes it or not and the auditor standing outside this perimeter of course can complete the cycle of action on which he began and that gives win to the auditor and the pc you follow this pcs analytical intentions then are valuable to session and they are very often expressed in the goals of the session and they are cared for accordingly thats the way it is now he intends to get certain distance and actually down deep he really intends to become ot hes never investigated this its running far too deep but way down underneath all the layers of god help us he intends to get to be ot thats for sure in other words he intends to recover he doesnt even though have enough analytical awareness of where he is going to know what he intends he intends freedom and return of power which is to say he intends freedom and return of intention well he now can go all the way he now can go all the way that is well within grasp if he walks along certain path and doesnt keep jumping off the cliff and so forth why he will arrive well therefore the intention for him to arrive is very sotto voce in him and an auditor with some experience and action on this intending him to arrive the auditors intention is actually more reliable than the pcs even though the pc is more deep and fundamental than the auditors why because every time he starts coming up the line this pc is going to shortcircuit into some direction fail to complete cycle of action someplace leave rock in the road somewhere or another and hell get some wild idea and well ive seen it happen man you this pc is supposed to be prepchecked on something or other in order to get something or other accomplished so that he wont always be coming to session with this gross ptp about his domestic affairs or something like this dont you see and somebody has decided to get this out of the road so they can proceed and hes thrown that all sideways and hes spent the night listing goals see well in the first place is the reason he listed goals had to do with the fact that his intention about his marital problem was being blunted so case advance is now reinterpreted into some kind of an escape from his present time problem so he doesnt know which way hes going he doesnt know what cycle of action hes on is he on the cycle of action of completing his present time problem with his domestic affairs or is he on the cycle of action of becoming free being well hes on the cycle of action of becoming free from his wife hes not on the cycle of action of becoming free being well something weird goes on when youve got this kind of thing happening hes on small perimeter hes on little cycle of action and hes using huge cycle of action potential to accomplish this little cycle of action you see hes using 20millimeter machine gun to shoot grasshopper see and of course he cant shoot this grasshopper because actually you cant get the muzzle depressed enough you get this kind of hes got freedom mixed up with escape he wants to fix it so he doesnt have to confront things any more all this kind of thing goes on and all that can get in an auditors road hugely im talking to you now about fine points you know in spite of all this you can blunder through you know im just giving you some fine points here you could get there somehow prepchecking the rough edge off of persons lumbosis and somehow or another this and somebody puts him together with sticky plaster because too many unflat processes exist on the case and then somehow or another you finally find the gpm and you get enough tone arm action out of the gpm to you get the idea to sort of cancel out some of the other sins and ills that have occurred in it youd get there somehow you could muddle through but these are the fine points these are the fine points of the business hes as weak as his intentions are blunted he will become as strong as his intentions are free the greatest holderbacker of intentions is the person himself because he puts himself in danger every time he has dangerous intention i think your international champions in boxing let us say or something like that probably have an awful time they probably educate themselves right out of hard punch merely because theyre walking through the society all the time itd be very very dangerous indeed for them to uncork hard punch in the bideawee cocktail bar see thats supposed to be reserved only for the stage see so heres an intention that is becoming narrowed and specialized they eventually become quite weak im not talking about something that you could measure by the diameter of the biceps the number of footpounds of punch deliverable you see theyre having to withhold this intention this intention has got to be very much pulled down theyve got to condition this intention if they have trainer and manager that tells them now only hit with your right hand during moments of something or other some fellow across as their opponent in the ring could stand there with his guard dropped the persons left hand in perfectly good condition to deliver the final blow that would end the whole match you see and yet would never strike the blow see his intention his intention now is far far too specialized and channeled now you ask fellow what restraints do you have to put on yourself in your everyday living youre going to get almost roaring automaticity see he has been taught that his intentions are dangerous to him hes been taught that he can get dangerous intention hes been taught as well that his intentions can get out of his control and he can accidentally intend something so every once in while you have somebody walking around in circles theres been fire in birmingham or something of the sort and there will be somebody walking around in circles worrying because he might have let an intention out from underneath his hat and started the fire in birmingham see and hell actively worry about this you see whereas the guy couldnt even warm up cup of coffee if he had stove see but thetans become very worried about this sort of thing and they become very protestive and one of the big games is to make somebody protest his intentions you see what are your intentions toward sir you see thats the standard girls question clarify your intentions and so forth wasnt it voltaire that won every argument before he even began it he said somebody had to define his terms before he could argue with him well thats very interesting but if you carried that little further youd find the guy would get so busy defining his terms that his intention to have anything else happening would be nil and you wouldnt find much of debate in progress here dont you see you must define your intentions or what youre doing society does this to us in scientology fortunately they dont know what our intentions are and frankly weve never really sat down and mapped it all out as to what our intentions should be which is probably the way it should be dont you see because therefore theres nothing to blunt nobody has ever expressed the matter thats sort of lazy way to go about it but they have all sorts of assignments to us in scientology as to what our intentions are they wouldnt believe our real intentions so well probably make them but we lose for instance world without insanity or war or something like that its perfectly valid intention well they consider this too highflown what are their intentions so they assign whole bunch of false intentions to the scientologists see well let them thats what makes their attacks look so silly because of course theyre fighting set of intentions which dont exist so it makes them look like theyre walking around talking to shadows or something like that it leaves us completely free and rather unwound into the battle the intention actually any broad intention we have is quite clear cut appears in many books but its way over their heads you see they cant figure they could blunt that intention because thats well you take war without i mean world without insanity you take this as an intention well thats good roads and good weather of course very unreal unaccomplishable anybodyd look this over they therefore couldnt have anything to do with that one of these days theyre going to be awful surprised see well have that intention moving see i even spent little time in on how would you handle vast numbers of insane and so forth see out of that original speculation we got scientology 0 processes by the way i mean theyre just an offshoot of that id hate to have to confess that to you but that was the body of research that came out of which is just destimulate the environment give stable datum for the environment so intention intention here is everything in case recovery if person is regaining his power or ability or something like that hes merely removing out of his road what blunts his intentions and what has blunted his intentions and thats really all hes doing so if we look this over with very critical eye we find out that the auditor going through almost any sincere job of auditing even if clumsily done will inevitably unblunt some of this pcs intentions they will be unblunted one way or the other and were talking about the upper esoterics of auditing how to keep auditing from blunting the pcs intentions you see well an intention is cycle of action any time you say do you add time so doingness intention or accomplishingness intention has time added to it the moment that you add time or doingness to the thing youve got cycle of action so an intention is at its highest echelon totally independent of time and the cycle of action intention is simply pure intention and is not necessarily tied into time at all you could just as easily make postulate in 1492 or in 2658 as you could in 1964 there isnt any intimate and immediate relationship but as the individual has gone down scale he has of course more and more associated his intentions with cycle of action you make the intention and then certain thing occurs or the intention goes across space as in communication you see and then it arrives at the other end and certain result therefore takes place at the other end so we have cycle of action we have the intention now worked into time and space so the intention originally is totally free of time and space and has nothing to do with it and in actual fact time and space have as their only reality the fact that they are made out of an intention doesnt matter whether this intention is an agreedupon intention or otherwise theres basic intention which gives us time and space so it is actually superior to all mest and youll have your fingers on something it doesnt have to be mest but as it comes down scale this becomes expressed to the pc particularly at the lower levels of case lower levels of cases this fellows having dreadful time exclamation point see hes just staggering through life man hes hitting both walls and walking backwards and falling on his knees every time he turns around well that individuals agreement with cycle of action means that an intention there are intentions any more there could however might be cycle of action see the intention has disappeared out of the cycle of action and you simply have this cycle of action when he goes down any further he goes down into pure chaos so therefore you can take person who is having terrible time and tell him to touch the wall and youve shown him an intention and shown him cycle of action you can shortsession him you can start session run session and end session ten minutes worth see then start another session run session and end session all youre doing is showing him cycle of action cycle of action cycle of action the auditing command cycle of action the auditors command the acknowledgment the answer the acknowledgment its cycle of action all youre showing him is youre demonstrating the existence of cycle of action cycle of action cycle of action any one of these things as they come through and eventually his own in the reason he cognites is his own intentions start to free up out of the obsessive mestiness of it all and he starts seeing things and he starts coming back to battery he starts adding up whats going on well now the only way the auditor can get in his road in all this of course is to foul up his own cycle of action the auditors cycle of action now we could foul this up one of the ways of fouling it up is to leave processes unflat or misinterpret what were doing with process were trying to get rid of this fellows lumbosis or lifetime problem here so we treat it like its rudiment we give it little dustoff and so forth well misapplication of tools well youre not going to get the intention clear because that back is not going to get better under that kind of treatment so the auditors intention is blunted the pcs intention to have better back is blunted everybody loses under that situation so our intention on the thing laid out if were going to have wins then we must validate analytical intention knock out dramatization and be very consistent with completing cycles of action even though its an auditing command or getting rid of his lumbosis and those are the factors with which you are dealing the auditor must flatten the process within the reality of what he is processing in other words within the reality of whats he got here hes got little problem thats been generated since last night so he stops auditing the back which has been going on for nine or ten years and starts using heavy artillery on this little problem that came up last night well he didnt complete the big cycle of action hes trying to make too much out of this other cycle of action hes misapplying his tools in other words hes working on this bad back and the only reason he gets last nights problem out of the way with his little dust kit is well just so he can go on and complete this bigger cycle of action youve got to keep the pc on the main chance youve got to flatten the big stuff that you start youre doing problems intensive i dont think you could prepcheck it in under ten or twelve hours if you did proper assessment on the thing youd ten or twelve hours id think thatd be long short haul to cover everything let us say from 1949 july on up to present time well how do you make it run that long well it isnt how long you make it run how much is there there well that depends on how much you impinge on the pc that depends on how much you make the pc work at it that depends on how hard you sweat over this particular action and how clean you keep the pc from arc breaks and how clean you keep his interim session difficulties the betweensession difficulties from interrupting you from doing cycle of action and for that kind of thing weve got little brushoff things we just destimulate this stuff the rudiment approach then the mainsession approach and therefore we can achieve the intentions of the pc we can achieve the intentions of the auditor we flatten process within the reality of what is there to be flattened and how much is there to be flattened how much are we tackling here well the fellow was always had little problem that had to do with hes always had this problem and so forth he thinks hes inferior well thats great thats great now youre going to handle this with rudiments process i dont think so the individual comes into session and he stubbed his toe outside the door and it hurts youre going to give this fourteenhour prepcheck so the magnitude of what youre trying to handle the duration of time of what you are trying to handle to large degree establishes how much time it is going to take you and how much heavy action you will have to take on it and how thoroughly youll have to flatten it and those are the establishing factors but when all out when all else is worked out youre trying to complete cycle of action and on the very badoff case that is all you can do that is the most basic process there is is simply get cycle of action completed and i imagine that an auditing question like this what did you have to eat for breakfast guy is having an awful time practically blindstaggers type pc you see and twoandahalf hours later with great deal of twoway comm and discussion and so forth he has answered the auditing question it sounds incredible doesnt it and yet you know the pc would have win pc would have big win you went in too high it should have been did you come to the session that wouldnt have taken so long to do but if you can get an auditing cycle completed you get win and if you dont get an auditing cycle completed whatever else you look at or what you think you are looking at youre going to get lose elementary as that so when the whole when the whole thing is squared away what youre trying to do as an auditor depends on what youre trying to handle in the pc the order of magnitude in terms of time and trouble and duration and so forth and that determines on what kind of flattening you use and the flattening of the main chance the big longterm one and so forth is done very arduously indeed its all done by ta its never done by anything else but ta and of course your little stuff that youre trying to get out of the road so you can keep on with your main action is just rudiments type kick off and you just flatten it to cognition or till it isnt bothering the pc and its out of the road and youre away you see why this is now you see how this is all right i hope you can have some wins on this thank you
