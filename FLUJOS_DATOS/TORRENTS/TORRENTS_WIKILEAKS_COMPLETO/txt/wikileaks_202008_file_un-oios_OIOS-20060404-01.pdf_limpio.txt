provides services not only to eca but also to united na tions staff in ethiopia in 1996 eca entered into an agreement with other united nations agen cies in ethiopia participating agencies to define the managerial and operational framework for unhcc 3 unhcc is headed by chief medical offi cer cmo at the p5 level who is supported by four professional p and 27 general service gs staff the cmo post which has been vacant since may 2001 is currently cumbered by the medical officer on spa as officerincharge oic unhcc incurred us14 million of expenditures in 2004 funded by contributions from eca participating agencies and other cash revenues the budget for 2005 was us18 million eca manages the unhcc fund and has established special account for this purpose 4 unhcc provides wide spectrum of clinical services including internal medicine pediatrics gynecology obstetrics cardiology and neurology for which unhcc hires some 23 consultant doctors in 2004 unhcc had pproximately 20000 health visits including around 1400 visits over the weekend or night 5 draft of the report was shared with th director of human resources and finance division in february 2006 who could not provide written comments but indicated that all the recommendations were accepted and are in the process of being implemented ii audit objectives 6 the overall objective of the audit was to dvise executive secretary of eca in his capacity as the chair of unhcc executive comm ittee on the adequacy of management and operation of unhcc this involved assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the arrangements for management and operating unhcc and b reviewing compliance with united nations regulations and rules and other administrative circulars iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit focused on activities in 2004 and 2005 the audit activities included review and assessment of risks and internal control systems interviews with staff and management analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records 8 the audit did not cover the quality of the medical expertise services which oios determ ined should be carried out by an expert in that field the audit rather exam ined whether unhcc has put in place m echanism for quality assurance iv audit findings and recommendations governance 9 the following governance structure was put in place in 1996 together with term s of reference operating procedures and representation from participating agencies an executive com mittee which approved the annual report and budget b the clinic advisory com mittee cac which advised the executive com mittee on the general policy and adm inistration recom mended the annual budget and financial statem ents and considered the adm ission of new participants and c the standing clinic technical subcom mittee which advised on f acilities services the minimum quantity and variety of drugs and technical changes im provem ents 10 whilst oios was pleased to note the crea tion of the governance structure it was not functioning as envisaged the executive com mittee and cac were neither m eeting on regular basis nor in accordance with the operating procedures which eca explained was m ainly due to scheduling dif ficulties b the staff attending the m eetings were often of lower grade than that envisaged in the operating procedures and did not have appropriate decision m aking authority c the review of m eeting m inutes for 2004 and 2005 m eetings indicated that there were duplications of the discussions in cac executive com mittee and d the standing clinic technical subcom mittee was never convened recommendation to stream line the governance structur for m edical services with view to enhancing its operational effi ciency and effectiveness eca should discuss and agree with other participating agencies the changes necessary to ensure regular and tim ely m eeting of clinic advisory com mittee cac and stream line operating procedure f or executive com mittee with which the executive com mittee could be called upon only when needed or replaced by written approval of the heads of participating agencies for any decisions m ade by cac rec 01 11 eca accepted the recommendation oios will close the recom mendation upon notif ication of agreed changes on the operating procedures f or clinic advisory com mittee and executive com mittee of unhcc b mandate and mission 2 review of m andate 12 unhcc had clear m andate to provide preventive and curative m edical services to united nations personnel and their dependents in addis ababa and in the opinion of unhcc this m andate rem ained valid 13 unhcc expressed the view that its presen ce and the variety of services it provided ensured the convenience and availability of certa in quality m edical services that were not readily available locally however this view was not supported by any current review of the role of unhcc in relation to other m edical facilities available in the local or regional environm ent there was also m echanism to keep under review how the m andate should be applied in practice for exam ple as to whether unhcc should focus on provision of high quality curative m edical services that are not av ailable in the local environm ent or f ocus on preventive health care services unhcc recognise d that it was not in position to justify the extent of its current service and its continue d need although unhcc saw the need for such review and m echanism and had hoped to have an external evaluation at the tim of the audit an action plan was yet to be prepared to address the issue recommendation to validate the m andate of eca ited nations health care centre and to ensure the united nations sta ff and their dependents in ethiopia are provided with the appropriate level of health care that takes account medical services provided locally and in the region eca should in consultation with the medical rvice division of united nations headquarters conduct baseline review of the m edical services the united nations should offer its staff in et hiopia and establish m echanism for reviewing the extent and level of rvices which should be provided rec 02 14 eca accepted the recommendation oios will close the recom mendation upon receipt of the result of baseline review of the m edical services the united nations should offer its staff in ethiopia b autonom of unhcc 15 whilst appreciating the decision m ade by the executive com mittee in august 2005 not to pursue unhcc autonom oios was concerned that the causes of the autonom issue had not been fully addressed the agreem ent with participating agencies did not clearly set out that unhcc operated under united nations regul ations and rules and did not clearly describe the adm inistrative arrangem ents for recruitm ent and procurem ent recommendation to ensure clear understanding of the status of eca united nations health care centre unhcc eca s hould specify in the agreem ent with participating agencies that unhcc is an integral part of eca and clarify that the m anagerial and operational arrangem ents fall under the united nations regulations and rules rec 03 3 16 eca accepted the recommendation oios will close the recom mendation upon receipt of the revised agreem ent with participating agencies c offering m edical services to the general public 17 unhcc had been offering services to ethiopian citizens which accounted for approxim ately 13 per cent of total visits in 2004 oios was concerned that this went beyond the overall objective of unhcc and could have negative im pact on services to united nations staff in addition ec had not clarified whether such service was legal under the host country agreem ent 18 oios is pleased to note that unhcc disc ontinued offering services to the general public in january 2006 and therefore recom mendation is raised c organiz ational structure roles and responsibilities of chief medical officer cmo and medical

around 30 st aff including consultant doctors head nurse adm inistration finance officer and other param edic functi ons such as laboratory and pharm acy the job description of the medical offi cer did not m ention m anagerial responsibility oios is of the opinion that delegation of m anagerial responsibility to medical officer would enhance the overall efficiency of unhcc m anagem ent

to ensure certain managerial responsibilities over the cons ultant doctors and other staff are delegated to the medical officer whic h would allow the cmo to pay m ore attention to the preventive prom otive aspect of unhcc operation rec 04 20 eca accepted the recommendation oios will close the recom mendation upon receipt of revised job descriptions of the chief dical officer cmo and the medical

currently undergoing its third recruitm ent exercise for the cmo post since 2001 and was hopeful this latest attem pt woul d be successful the reason for the past failures was the inability to attract
