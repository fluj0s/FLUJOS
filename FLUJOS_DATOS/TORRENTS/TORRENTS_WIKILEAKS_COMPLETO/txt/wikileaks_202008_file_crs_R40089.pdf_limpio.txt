22 usc 2151 et seq serves as the cornerstone for the united states foreign assistance policies and programs written passed and signed into law at what some consider the height of the cold war the act is seen by some today as anachronistic ironically when president kennedy urged the 87th congress to enact foreign aid legislation that would exemplify and advance the national interests and security strategies of the united states postworld war ii he described the existing foreign aid mechanisms as bureaucratic fragmented awkward and slow some have used the same language today nearly 50 years later to characterize the legislation he promoted there are indications that the 111 th congress may visit the issue of amending the current body of law that comprises foreign aid policy starting with

of 1961 pl 87195 22 usc 2151 et seq enacted at the behest of president kennedy sought to organize and implement us foreign assistance programs with commitment to longrange economic assistance to the developing world the president in special message to the congress on foreign aid delivered march 22 1961 described the us foreign aid programs emerging from world war ii as bureaucratically fragmented awkward and slow its administration is diffused over haphazard and irrational structure covering at least four departments and several other agencies the program is based on series of legislative measures and administrative procedures conceived at different times and for different purposes many of them now obsolete inconsistent and unduly rigid and thus unsuited for our present needs and purposes its weaknesses have begun to undermine confidence in our effort both here and abroad 1 president kennedy went on to note the declining prestige of the united states foreign aid apparatus and the negative impact of that decline on administering and staffing programs abroad the president also cited the uneven and undependable shortterm financing of programs and the resulting disincentive for longterm efficient pl anning congress and the executive branch worked together to enact the foreign assistance act of 1961 to address these shortcomings at time when much of the developing world was emerging as newly independent states when those new nations were without exception under co mmunist pressure and when the free industrialized nations found themselves in position to assist the lessdeveloped nations on longterm basis as they find themselves on the threshold of achieving sufficient economic social and political strength and selfsustained growth to stand permanently on their own feet 2 though the original foreign assistance act of 1961 lengthened the authorization time frame for funding development assistance to five years other programs were authorized for shorter periods the act still required occasional reauthorization legislation to renew programs beyond that original time frame and congress retained its role of appropriating funds the original act authorized the funding levels shown in table 1 t able 1 f or eign assistance act of 1961 as enacted p l 87195 22 u sc 2151 et seq 75 stat 424 progr am uthorization funding levels and duration

1985 congress regularly enacted new authorization legislation or amended the original act to update authorization time frames and to incorporate newer programs and authorities after 1986 however congress turned more frequently to enacting freestanding authorities that did not amend the 1961 act and included language in annual appropriations measures to waive the requirement to keep authorizations current thus sections in the foreign assistance act of 1961 in many instances do not refer to authorization beyond fiscal years 1986 and 1987 unless the program was added to the act by an amendment enacted after that period but programs are continued through appropriations 3 g17g157g145g142g155g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 few programs are established outside the statutory framework of the foreign assistance act of 1961 and thus are not included in detail in this report4 reimbursable military exports for example are addressed in the arms export control act and subsequent security assistance acts since 1985 the last year congress passed comprehensive reauthorization of the foreign assistance act of 1961 both congress and the president have promoted variety of specialized authorities in freestanding legislation some freestanding laws that authorize foreign aid or apply new conditions to aid authorized in the foreign assistance act of 1961 are shown in table 2 3 sec 10 of the foreign military sales amendments 1971 pl 91672 22 usc 2412 requires authorization before appropriations stating that money appropriated for foreign assistance including foreign military sales shall be available for obligation or expenditure1 unless the appropriation thereof has been previously authorized by law or 2 in excess of an amount previously prescribed by law the section however is routinely waived most r ecently in sec 653 of the department of state foreign operations and division j of pl 110161 121 stat 2342 which states funds appropriated by this act except funds appropriated under the headings trade and development agency and overseas private investment corporation may be obligated and expended notwithstanding section 10 of public law 91672 and section 15 of the state department basic authorities act of 1956 4 still other laws have been enacted to augment the foreign assistance act of 1961setting limitedterm conditions for aid otherwise provided for in the act pl 109159 for example which provides for the transfer to the republic of korea of obsolete or surplus items with military applica tion is freestanding law but draws on the presidents authority stated in sec 516 of the act to transfer excess defense articles similarly congress has enacted series of laws to transfer excess or obsolete naval vessels to u s allies congress has also enacted acts in recent years authorizing conditional aid to targeted populations or organizations in sudan north korea afghanistan and iran
