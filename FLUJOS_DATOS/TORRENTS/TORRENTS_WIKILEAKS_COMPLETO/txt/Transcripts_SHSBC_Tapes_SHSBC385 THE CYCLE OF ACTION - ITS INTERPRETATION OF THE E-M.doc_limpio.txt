the cycle of action its interpretation on the emeter lecture given on 9 june 1964 thank you how are you audience fine whats the date audience 9 june nine june 9 june ad 14 the year of the juggernaut you look pretty good you look numerous all right well today is very important lecture very important lecture since it applies to the young and the old new and the strained and various other categories and applies very very directly and instantly to the auditing procedure rather than to techniques and that is the cycle of action and its interpretations on the emeter this sounds authoritative enough doesnt it tis too i have never seen anybody get in as much trouble with as little an item as the auditor and the cycle of action this easily is the most confused area field the most misunderstood the most maligned the most defined upside down and backwards type of thing anybody ever had anything to do with well now just why youre having trouble with this and just why organizations are having trouble with this and just why this is such gruesome subject is because its all over the gpms and thats why you have to pay attention to it in the first place it aint natural and you scientologists being cut above the naturalness of normality of course buck against and see something slightly wrong in the whole idea of time and its forward progress you get some inkling very early on in the field of scientology you say well theres something wrong with time lot of you talk about it lot of you say well if i just had more time or less time it takes that mild form and on the other side of it you begin to look at time as some kind of weird taskmaster that you wot not of and want to do less with and one of the most interesting recent cognitions ive had in processing if you dont mind my mentioning something of that line was to find myself looking at zero or absence of time and i was in very interesting state there for while and i took look at this and i stared it straight in the eye and it was aboutat first i didnt know if i liked it because if you dont have time of course you dont have lot of other things and then i took look at this and i was trying to find out what was making pressure on my face and i found out there wasnt anything making pressure on my face there was just nothingness making pressure on my face and the pressure on my face was being made because there wasnt anything there do you understand completely negative look now i of course immediately invalidated this and said i know some of the end words and some this sort of thing and i know where these things live and therefore ive just gotten one of these into restimulation and so forth and i promptly and instantly tried to run this down and get this thing pretty well squared around and i was unable to spot it as any kind of gpm bricabrac what i had actually done was escape the time stream and it was very funny sensation very very peculiar but at the same time it was more natural than being in the time stream you get so habituated to being in the time stream that sudden cessation of it is uncomfortable i can remember the old story of the little girl who hit herself over the head with hammer continuously because it felt so good when she stopped you know another case little girl also that had perpetual howling migraine headache and had had it for so long that she didnt know what it was and an auditor turned if off and she felt awfully peculiar this was life without migraine headache you see and it was something brandnew that she was not used to at all now time of course is something that one should be able to move into out of up into the forward of and back into you know you should be able to straighten out yesterdays goofs in other words and at one time or another you were quite capable of doing so and then you slipped into the time stream and have been going down the line ever since now therefore i have somewhat of natural antipathy to the idea that time is there or that something has beginning middle and an end the beginning the middle and the end because that is athat is an authoritative action laid on by time well let show you something here you are processing in the physical universe through and across the agreement of the physical universe and you are making yourself very good show of going along with the time stream and if you do this you are then processing bank which lays the time stream in with an ax and you are trying to resolve subject which is to terrible degree cycles of action that is to say the bank is just cycle of action with exclamation points and youre trying to resolve this and unless you pay attention to this you j am the bank do you follow you j am the bank in other wordswell let say it this way the pcthe pc has got sliver in his finger and you dont pull the sliver out you say well there are slivers and you convince him that its actually because he has lot of reactivity on the subject of pain and discomfort and you sell him this bill of goods you see and you tell him the truth see you say well itsthe only reason youre experiencing this pain in your finger because of the sliver and so forth is you have some gpms and so on and thats the whole thing and so forth and there you are now do you feel better and hell say well why well you just processed him little too high now maybe you could explain this to an ot but then of course he wouldnt have sliver in his finger or if he did ithe could asis it see if youprobably the only thing wrong with the gropings of mary baker eddy and so forth is she was on cloud nine to the ninth see well maybe she could make some of that gap but her articulation of it brought about the nonsense of if you just notis it and say it isnt there it aint let point it out to you that it hasnt worked that is not broadly workable action it has enough workability so that it retains peoples interest its the little red flag hanging out they say theres something there we dont know quite what it is then they get it all mixed up with right thinking and power of prayer and living good life and get into the wrong end of the gpms and spin see nothing more dangerous than handling something you dont know what it is particularly anything with as much voltage as this stuff so therefore you enter the wrong end of the line dont you see try to go up too upscale and you say to the fellow well you obviously dont have sliver in your finger because actually thats manifestation which is created by compulsions forced off on you by the idea that blahblahsuh and so on and its actually the hundred and ninetyfifth series and you know glib you see hes still got sliver in his finger so you say to this fellow all right you shouldnt have to pay any attention to time you shouldnt pay any attention at all to the cycle of action because the cycle of action is just laid in by the bank and its your reactivity and has to do with the time stream and of course thats all above us people okay evaporate and by golly he doesnt you know well theres sense in feeling upset about it because he doesnt evaporate you see now particularly at lower levels youre processing straight across this thing called cycle of action and boy its in there with an ax the proper sequence and order of things the mind is fiendishly orderly thing most of you think of the mind as great confusion it isnt youre the one thats confused and the most orderly thing in the world is one of these reactive banks it is the most precise thing some old lady you know some old lady crotchety and so forth been living by herself for ninety years and so on and somebody comes down and puts tea caddy you know just one sixteenth of an inch crosswise on the table boy he has it well thats the reactive bank it reacts just about like that see it reacts terribly you leave out comma in it and it just gets very upset you see its fiendish precision of the thing and it all follows the same patterns and so forth and its very interesting your pc hes all very bloooahh well actually the pc has to come up through an ability to confront that much order hes below the ability to confront that much order hes in an awful state of confusion so hes got to come up through this state of order up to the other side of it and one of the most dominant factors of the bank is the cycle of actionthat things have beginning they continue and they end and that is one of the keynotes of order it hasreally the summation of the bank couldnt add up to anything more strenuously than that the whole bank is put together on this basis things have beginning they continue and they end so its wonder you have trouble with it now the auditor who is having trouble with it because he is below being able to face up to that much order thats one thing and the auditor who is having trouble with it because he cant get back down to that much order that would be another thing but equally failure to do so would produce gain in the pc now where the cycle of action is violated in the pc the order of his bank is violated and therefore it doesnt asis its that succinct its that glib statement can be made on the subject the situation then is that the road out is the road through and the road through is paralleled by the cycle of action so the road out follows the cycle of action and youll find this cycle of action manifested everywhere in processing and where the auditor chronically and violently disobeys turns sideways from and has nothing to do with the cycle of action hes in trouble because hes thrown the pc below the fiendish demands of the bank in other words the bank parallels this degree of order and where the auditor does not follow through that much order why the auditor does not get the pc through the bank because it is not parallel with the requirements of the bank its like trying to process somebody on his father when the difficulty is with his mother do you see so what you have to do what you have to doand this we have proven over long period of timethis is quite empirical by the way this was never derived this was something that just grew like topsy along with processing what you have to do is parallel this thing called the cycle of action and there is harm in your doing so there is detrimentthere is detriment to you for doing so and theres certainly detriment to the pc for going into that agreement that time and cycle of action exist in other words you dont get into troubleyou get out of trouble by agreeing that it exists so its for the nonce and for now it exists so therefore you find the cycle of action raising its head everywhere in processing and person who cannot approximate this cycle of action as an auditor gets his pc into continuous trouble and its not slight trouble it is enormous trouble it is just catastrophic because of course hes gone right straight up against the bank and run the bank wrong way to every time you dont process pc with attention to the cycle of action youre processing the pc against the bank so as result the bank will jam and you see that manifestation with high tone arm with badly acting needle and other such manifestations pc that is not running well has first and foremost had the cycle of action violated that you can be absolutely certain was the case pc isnt running well the first thing you can say about the pc is the cycle of action has been violated now you see well im not getting tone arm action on this pc all right the first thing we can say is the cycle of action has been violated of course this is rather broad general statement unless we know what else were talking about it could be rather meaningless because its almost well the sun isnt shining because thereit is cloudy day see its just the reverse of the coin so thats what you know now dont let hear of any of you back in an organization or in private practice or something of this sort sending query about some pcyou can send all the queries about pcs you want tobut dont send query about pc with blank flat staring look of whats wrong with this pc and accompany it with hundred and seventyfive started processes not one of them completed and say why does this pc have high tone arm ive exaggerated the hundred and seventyfive because i was too bored to count them but i did estimate that was something like the number of processes on case query which i just had last night im not lecturing you out of that particular case because its one of many they come in quite routinely and regularly so the first thing you know about casethats the first thing you know about case that isnt running right is that the cycle of action has been violated now we could go back little earlier than this we can say why isnt the case not running right but why isnt the case living right well the cycle of action is being violated now theres two ways cycle of action can be violated one is byand this is true of life not processing true of life not processingone way it can be violated is too slavish an obedience to it there one is out of agreement with the cycle of action in the first place and he is being forced by everything under the sun moon and stars to follow this particular cycle of action and he practically gets up to the brain ventilation point see he doesnt like it the fellow who gets up and goes to bum job you know that sort of thing all of the blessings of the machine age actually lie almost exactly in that zone that ive just been talking about you see well there is because power of choice is being overthrown now you must not really confuse power of choice and cycle of action now if cycle of action is being followed then against the power of choiceagainst the power of choice see the persons power of choice is being overwhelmed and overthrown and he is following cycle of actionwe set up quite conflict oddly enough there is the one zone where the persons power of choice can be overthrown and he can be somewhat improved this gives you the idea of what value the cycle of action has it is up there with power of choice well thats very highthats very high point power of choice the persons selfdeterminism the pc at cause dont you see this is power of choice and were ranking right along with it cycle of action because for while cycle of action will be fought by the individual and thenheres the trickby following cycle of action to point where he or she is used to it it will then begin to asis enough bank to compensate for the power of choice which will then return you see the trickiness of this see therefore you sometimes could force pc through 8c against his power of choice but only so long as you repeated the cycle of action if you were doing sloppy job of repeating the cycle of action processing the pc againstthis is not recommendation to process pc against his power of choice im just giving you order of magnitude if youd continued to use the cycle of action in orderly progress of commands the pcs power of choice would have been more freed than it would have been impeded because you would have asised more bank than you were piling up so it isnt the persons power of choice that gives him reactivity selfdeterminism is something that is imprisoned in reactivity cycle of action is the prison so therefore following and using cycle of action will bring about nothing but freeing of power of choice whether the pc consents to it or not you follow how this goes this is very intricate dont ever tell now that i recommended to you that you overwhelm the pcs power of choice im just telling you that the cycle of action is comparable so you have the determinism of the thetan practically versushis power of choice and his selfdeterminism is versus the fiendish cycle of action precision of the bank and this universe this is the way the thing turns its because having started here you inevitably get to there that makes this universe trap if you start in at five minutes of nine you certainly will arrive at five minutes after nine wherever you land in space you are certainly going to land at five minutes after nine in time thats for certain isnt it well look that is an overwhelm whichever way you want to look at it thats an overwhelm you dont have to do thing about it and as matter of fact there isnt anything you can do about it you take any human being and sit them down in chair at five minutes of nine and matter what they say matter what they do matter how they protest matter how many books they read or anything else they are inevitably going to arrive at five minutes after nine now you want to look at the biggest overwhelm there is in the universethats it you want to see what the total overthrow of power of choice must bethats it thats the one thing you cant do anything about now going from point in space to point b in space is something you can do something about you can kick like billyo you very often get dragged to point b willynilly but nevertheless youve said ayouve made an uproar about it see youve at least done that or kicked hell out of or done something do you see youve done something about it so that space transfer from to b in space is not necessarily the degree of overwhelm that time is in fact its such an overwhelm that possibly one or two of you until this minute had never recognized the inevitability of arriving at five minutes after nine it was just so natural well oddly enough there really isnt anything natural about it at all its the most unnatural proceeding anybody ever had anything to do with therefore that progress through time is paralleled by cycle of action and you can approximate time with cycle of action its very close to making time its very close to process you might call make some time and thats very funny process thats very funny process now therefore you can start the pc at and move the pc through to b and by distance confusion he has the illusion of moving through time time and space are very easily interchanged dont you see so sometimes you can move him from to b and just from to b or get him to move something from to b to b to b to bthis is very elementary processingand he all of sudden differentiates between distance and time well look thats step in the right direction do you see whats gotwhen i say differentiates what am i talking about but freeing his ability to see well that must have something to do with power of choice in other words he must be able to perceive something new here he must have new freedom of observation or he wouldnt have cognition cognitions only come about on freed perception or freed self or renewed selfdeterminism or whatever else you want to put on it as label you see the individual is beis coming loose from the trap hes that much looser from the trap than he was moment ago when he can say ah yeah the third bar is rusty well hes so much been in the trap before hes never noticed that the third bar was rusty well being able to notice that the third bar on the window is rusty is to that degree freeing yourself from the trap see youre just that much less the effect of the trap do you see that i found myself the other day being haunted by gpm i wondered if it was out of gear or had slid loose from its moorings or something of this sort and this was all very important because if i missed on this one as in any of them why ill wrap you around the telegraph pole and boy did i resent that for while you know cant privately get myself snarled up anymore if i snarl up it becomes big overt see and i freed that and that was the end of that but anyway i was taking look at the situationi still feel that way but not so violently anyhow i was taking look at this confounded gpm that was busy floating around and so forth i couldnt place it anyplace and i knew it belonged somewhere and so forth but it didnt make any sense where it was going and i suddenly realized that i was restimulating it this was something new and i sat back and i said well what do you know huhhuhhuh bronx cheer get lost you know felt tough felt like vixie out here chasing an imaginary burglar that she was sure wasnt one you know anyway i was restimulating it it was the effect of mei wasnt the effect of it interesting interesting view now what am i saying in essence there what am i stating in essence there i was enough freed from its overwhelm that i could perceive what was happening to it instead of what was it doing to now this isyou see this typically all the time in overt actmotivator sequence if somebody walks in off the street all he can talk to you about is overwhelm overwhelm overwhelm overwhelm you see you know oh life has done in man its just kicked my oh ayouhoo its lyingoh its terrible itsyou know i looklook broken neck you know looklook at those hemp marks all around my neck and so well did in you know ruinedim wrecked you know and as i was talking to you about obliquely itthis is quite mechanism for holding somebody down you just tell him all the time hes overwhelmed you see and tell him he never can be free and hes really had itwronged you know its trap well lot of you when it first came out on ow flinched at invading the personal privacy of an individual to this degree you thought well thats something and some of you were too enthusiastic but what in essence were you actually doing there you were just turning the tide you were saying to this felwe didnt care what crime he was reporting we were trying to find something hed done on his own free will that he then had to restrain and couldnt own because this is the mechanism one does things which he then cant own up to and therefore caved in on because of it see he cant take responsibility for his own acts dont you see and ow in its purest essence has never really been well understood since all it is isits not lesson in morality its not lesson in being good it is simply lesson in what power of choice have you exerted in life and you probably could approach the fellows worst crime just on that gradient and that understanding you could say what have you caused but unfortunately with great many pcs you get lot of gobbledygook how hard it is to get the individual to admit his first overt the first time he ever admitted an overt not the first overt he ever did thats lost in antiquity but just to get him to admit for the first time that he did something that wasnt quite nice well of course youre striking into the middle of societys effort to get him to restrain admission of this which is big overwhelm and youre getting him to own up to the fact that hes been cause now you can do some interesting things with this because he owns up and says he was cause and then he immediately says he wasnt cause because it was justified and then he comes around to point eventually where he says it was cause because i did it but then it was justified of course every time he says its justified hes saying that its not power of choice who have you shot for reason at all see now that auditing question would be little bit too high but is actually the essence of the question the reason why you use an overt of course is youre going up against the social mores as the point of overwhelm you just choose this as the point of overwhelm so therefore at lowerlevel processing you are choosing the society as the point of overwhelm when youre running ow and you want the individuals revolts against this overwhelm as an expression of his power of choice now some point of agreement with society can be found somewhere in that that will undo attention from society ill scale it all down to lower iv processing you could ask some question like this what social activity or what third dynamic activity have you gone along with you oddly enough would find that this is an auditing question which weirdly enough would eventually bring up overt acts it would be quite magical you say whatwhat social activities what customs what beliefs have you gone along with he starts naming them off and the next thing you know gives you an overt act well that overt act is nothing more than freeing himself from the straitjacket that hes been following along the social planewell thats fairly innocent one but it does people lot of good and is very good lowerlevel processing ow agreementsnot disagreementsagreements communication things that are real subjective realities these sort of things theyre all pretty terrific you could put those into the same rationale but how is the individual getting free well the individual is getting free to the degree that he can step back and look at it the individual can look at the situation he is in and to that degree is free of it when he can really look at it hes really free of it well now lets apply all this to the sixth dynamic and well get much more subtle level much less easily perceived by the ordinary human being and that is what ive been talking to you about time freedom from the time span and freedom from cycle of action now this is so woven into the pc regardless at what level he is that even your social addresses you know what social agreement have you had what have you done to society how have you exerted your selfdeterminism against societyyou know getting him to admit himself as cause someplace or another now all of that by the way is all very very very junior to the sixth dynamic matter who hes shooting hes standing on mest firing across space dont you see and his action is measured against time i dont care what act hes doing i dont care what hes agreeing with i dont care whats happening to him if hes in this universe thats whats going on in other words hes in total slavish agreement with the sixth dynamic so when youre processing this person if you violate that to an enormous degree he wont know what it is that is being violated its being violated to such degree that he cant tolerate it his tolerance of that violation is terrible do you understand what i mean youre processing this individual maybelets take the social unit or something like that that were processing him about is his family well lets not even take society lets take his immediate family see well what family custom have you gone along with or something like this we dont care what were taking up and if you violate the cycle of action on the sixth dynamicits clear up here at level vi auditing seebut if you violate it down there at level i it responds on the emeter you violate the cycle of action now how could you violate the cycle of action well you have to understand how many cycles of action there are and there are quite few of them they categorize on an expanding perimeter lets take this as the first cycle of action is the auditing comm cycle why do you call it comm cycle because it is cycle of action and that is the first one which you see badly expressed on the lowlevel pc on the meter this is the first one that shows up on the meter you see i dont care what youre processing this pc on hes nowhere near level vi you see hes not doing anything about time or something of this sort youre trying to find out if the desk is real or something you know or if hes got an auditor and yet this cycle of action is so insidious that it weaves itself straight into that question youre asking and you wont be able to get away with it it isnt something you can get away with and that is what is so fiendish about it its point in auditing that cant be violated if its violated you get lack of success thats your dirty needle you say to the fellow well what have youwhat did you do to your father and he says well i uh and you say well weve been into all that tell something about your mother you have an instant needle manifestation instant itll be right there staring you in the face the young and beginning auditor is always mystified why emeters have such nervous needles he blames them for all sorts of things and so forth and yet it is just this violation continuous violation of the auditing comm cycle and it gives him dirty needle and that dirty needle is expressing the jamup of energy in the pcs bank by reason of the violation of the momentary cycle of action that auditing comm cyclewhen you violate the auditing comm cycle it will jam up energy in the pcs mind and that registers on the needle as little bzzzt in other words you dont have to go out and be very esoteric about this you can grab anybody off the street put him on meter say well whats your name and he said oh my name well its well i dont want that dirty needle see you asked him question and you didnt let him answer it and you didnt acknowledge when he did and right away you got dirty needle this is pure tyranny and is something that many auditors shudder against and when they are first presented with the facts of the case that they are making the dirty needle you never saw so many flinches and winces in your life they cut and run oh i couldnt be its just the quality of this pc oh its not the quality of the pc its that the auditor violated the auditing comm cycle and that produced disagreement with that very powerful being called the reactive bank and when it produced this to thisjust to this degree disagreement with its mandates concerning cycles of action section 1 paragraph and whoever shalt violate this will get one awful pain in his gut period you know real proclamation all right the auditor says well all right now what is your name oh thats all right im sorry i uhi dont need it on this form dirty needle see the meter measures energy manifestations taking place in the pcs bank of course we know the bank is something the pc is making all by himself unassisted but this is not popular theory with somebody who is being subjected to very heavy psychosomatic illnesses you say well youre doing it all yourself and youre liable then to have violated many more things than cycle of action his awareness then is not up to the point of recognition of the reality of things in other words youve given him eight thousand gallons of reality and youve given him one erg of attention with which to perceive it and im afraid they would have to be comparable youd have to have eight thousand units of reality and youd have to have eight thousand units of freed attention to perceive it with do you see its got to be comparable so you cant come alongits athe reverse by the way is true just speaking in that line you give somebody hundred thousand units of attention and you give him thousandth of unit of reality and hes liable to consider it unimportant you process somebody up high enough and you say now lets take this conflict between russia and the united states you know and hed say yeah well what about it well its terrible problem well whohuh you have sort of taken him by storm you see you have said something is an enormous reality but he has an enormous attention factor to put on it dont you see and he cant see it as an enormous reality he can very easily be persuaded to discount its importance and think it is very unimportant you got the idea so you could actually get the reverse but when you get the amount of attention available and the amount of thing to be perceived comparable why then it is perceivable but when you tip this thing wrongly either waywell this fellow can understand everything there is in the whole world of science and some little kid comes up to him and asks him why he cant tie string to the end of the kite or something like this this fellows brains go really creak trying to get down to this point you see where he can explain to the kid something about this kite you know and hes liable to become very esoteric about it before he gets through and hes liable to miss it completely in other words hes got too much freed attention on the subject in order to regard or concentrate it you see so this thing can be in reverse but when you take the pc who has onethousandth of an erg of attention and hes being overwhelmed by hundred billion cubits to the hundred billionth power of reality hes got attention to confront it with and you violate this one little thing that you can violate see there arent lot of things you can violate theres this one little thing you can violate violate this cycle of action bang there it is right straight on your meter now there are fantastic numbers of things then that you could violate that wouldnt express itself on the meter it would just be beyond his level of reality you wouldnt get those expressed but cycle of actionif you ask question hes supposed to answer the question and youre supposed to acknowledge the questionis builtin mechanism that is so solid its like putting the engine in rollsroyce you know its just builtin instant response you say what is your name oh i dont need your namedirty needle do you follow this well there it is in its most elementary and stupid form see i could make an appeal to some auditors who get dirty needles rather regularly to take it in its most elementary and stupid form and perceive it that it is simply that theyre causing dirty needle by not following out cycle of action they dont even have to worry about why theres cycle of action if they just followed that out they wouldnt have dirty needle lets take the next cycle of action next cycle of action process im just giving you broad categories here lets take process by the way weve been very successfulive been very successful in teaching people this i shouldnt be snarling about it at all because it isnt point of loss as far as im concerned as soon as i properly defined cycle of action as something that began and continued and ended that elementarily and so forth peoplepeople have been doing much much better with it and theyre not now assigning all kinds of wild reasons to why their pc is misbehaving on meter but maybe this lecture will give you little broader insight into it now the process cycle of action is not expressed on the needle it is expressed on the tone arm the tone arm is what is being expressedexpressing here your tone arm starts to move on given subject pigs pigs tone arm moves all right what about pigs pigs pigs they grunt tone arm moves pigs they are in sties tone arm moves pigs farmers raise them pigs i dont like pork pigs hey what do you know i was once jewish hey yeah pigs yeah what do you know more tone arm action well now please plot exactly what happened here because there is nice example the guy gets back and he sorts out youd think at first glance cause he just puts himself at cause over pigs he eventually moves up so hes got cause on the subject of pigs and hes not involved with pigs and pigs are not overwhelming him and his tone arm action ceases more tone arm action well youve started continued and ended cycle of action on the subject of pigs thats the lot and when you get down to looking this thing over you find out that any subject addressed has to be continued in its address to point where the pcs on top of it and at that moment the tone arm will cease to move now if the pc can get on top of it at all the tone will move if slightly it will move well weve got the parity here weve got the subject which has overwhelmed the pc and weve got the pc with enough attention to regard this subjectenough attention to regard the subject potentially thats howthats what you mean when you say i audited him over his head in other words he never under gods green earth could have gotten on top of this subject and it wouldnt have given tone arm action either see but it just so happens that if hes potentially got at any given instant enough attention or power of choice or selfdeterminismwhatever you want to call itto get up on top of this subject with some processing he will climb as long as the ta is in motion and will cease to climb the moment he has become free of it and that is expressed on the tone arm thats your tone arm talking ill go over that again if its real to him at all it will register on the tone arm even if slightly it will still register on the tone arm were not really interested in processing things that only register on the needle pc has tendency to become overwhelmed because you very often have too slight needle action mark v is too powerfulwell actually needlea needle action on the oldtime mathison was tone arm action on the mark v dont you see youd alreadythe pc had to be hit with truck to get thisthe needle to move dont you see its not true so itswhats changed here is not your viewpoint or understanding of the subject whats changed here is the quality of the meter youre using and the mark v and its equivalents such as the azimuth meter and so forth give you very very fine point here and if you start just following its needle you findwill find yourself misgauging what the pc can get on top of because it will read things that he couldnt quite get on top of dont you see so you follow the tone arm you dont follow the needle the only precaution you want to take is follow the tone arm you assess by tone arm you go down long list of things to audit on this pc youre checking off parts of his life or something like this you want to look for one that moves that tone arm even if itsonly moves it 01 you want something that moved that tone arm while you were busy keeping your needle at set see you wanted motion there now if you got that motion the rule follows that the pc has potentially got enough attention to get on top of that overwhelm you have found something that is overwhelming the pc and you have found that he potentially can get on top of it he isnt on top of it but he potentially can in other words youve found wall that he can walk up see youre notyoure not sending him up the side of the empire state building with slippery leather shoes see youre giving him something he can climb therefore he will process to wins providing you dont leave him in state of halfoverwhelm with regard to this thing because if you leave him in state of halfoverwhelm in regard to this thing its got him halfoverwhelmed youve only dug him half out and then you go find new subject and you dig him half out of this new subject and then you go find new subject and dig him half out of this subject youve got three halfoverwhelms multiplied and they make total overwhelmed pc you see this now your cycle of action there is simply basically expressed bywhen you start to get the pc on top of something get him on top of it and he will object seriously to not being brought on top of it were not interested in whether he objects or not at this particular moment were merely interested in the meter responses and what is the meter response eventually it will be frozen meter that meter will be frozen in other words you found some subject he could have gotten on top of and you just raised him up to point where he was still overwhelmedyou didnt flatten your tone arm action in other wordsand then you found another subject that he got half on top of hes still overwhelmed by that one now you go find another subject that he could getand get him half on top of that one where hes still overwhelmed youve got three overwhelms and three overwhelms dont make right pc man you never bring him out to where he can say hey theres rust on the third bar see thats all youre trying to do and at the moment when he says theres rust on the third bar the high probability is youve lost your tone arm action at that point there is limit to which you can carry tone arm cycle beyond its point of flatness heres this very vividthat if it took you ten minutes to flatten the tone arm action out of something and you then went for two hours to see if it were flat something is liable to become impatient around here or upset you see because youve misestimated the length of time of this tone arm action now that isnt the direction that people err however but im just putting it in as fact in passing the direction where the error takes place is it takes them an hour to get some good tone arm action on this subject and then they drop it yaaaow they got it in plain view where it was in good and properly and horribly and meanly and viciously overwhelming the pc see where he had it in full view you know you sort of got him as if you had stroboscopic picture of the thing you know the tiger is halfway through the air you see and hes standing there wondering whether hes going to be able to grapple with the tiger or not you see were just at this point of paritywhos going to win lets run another process lets leave another tiger jumped half through the air see you can only do few of these and youll run out of chips because youre going up against the cycle of action of the bank as well as the selfdeterminism of the pc pcs trying to win on this one and so forthyoure going up against that but youre basicallywhats causingwhat makes the arm lock up which is what were interested in is because youre going up against the cycle of action of the bank in other words youve violated the cycle of action of the bank an action was begun and it was not complete and he is hung in the middle of the action and that locks up the ta and you can go down line of auditors and just spot where this has happened where its happened where its happened where its happened and some of those auditors will tell you that nothing is happening in the session they will also tell you that nothing has happened with the pc well if youre unlucky it happened with his last auditor and the auditors reports were fragmentary and illegible if youre unlucky could get pretty grim in other words now the trick here is to find out when the tone arm action ceases the trick is not even really to find out something that will move the tone arm people bang their brains out over this how do we find something that moves the tone arm you had better find what has moved the tone arm if youre having to ask yourself this question of what has moved the tone arm and the tone arm isnt moving and the person has been processed for while then you had jolly well better ask yourself the reverse question what has moved the tone arm and process out of nothing but the persons folder and auditors reports dont ever start new action on this pc i dont care if the tone arm action that youre flattening was noted in 1958 man flatten it whatever it is that you can find that ever moved the tone arm flatten it and just keep this up and youll move him out of all these unfinished cycles of action and the bank will unjam its as elementary as that every new action that you start without completing these old actions in auditing is liable to produce greater jam your jobyour job is very simple to this degree but you ask yourself very often the wrong question when you face pc on whom youre trying to get tone arm action you ask yourself what will get tone arm action on this pc and you respond accordingly and youd love some tests of some kind or another youd like some of this youd love assessments youd like new process or so on youre at the wrong end of the business thats the simple one thats the simple one you can take anybody off the street and have them sit down and pick up the meter electrodes and talk just let them talk for few minutes and youre going to get tone arm action of some kind or another this would be very peculiar human being that you didnt note some tone arm action rattledyrov goffgoff woofwoof vaolvlaow blaowblaowblaow somewhere along the line theyre going to get tone arm action you make note of it thats subject you process the trouble with it is it doesnt lookmake you look very professional and it doesnt seem to be very adroit its not adroit is car in motion is it stopped i mean its just about as much judgment involved in it as that the guy goes rattledybang rattledybang somebody says well i really dont like to have to go down toprocessing person on itsa i really wouldnt know how tohow to untangle somesome pc without just plain itsa i wouldnt ask them any auditing questions i dont know how to ask them any auditing questions i havent got anything to ask them well im not going to make the mistake of saying i know all about this pc even when i have sixth sense along this line im not still going to make that mistake im going to make the pc hand the first thing that is real to the pc because i can see lot more wrong with the pc than the pc can see wrong with himself man dont ever downgrade your observation pick it up say this is very interesting that fellows got gobbledygookitis hes got his rhombolis on backwards dontdontdont downgrade your ability to look but you dont know which of those things is real to the pc and what will tell you what will tell youall these things are perfectly truebut what will tell you is that tone arm very nicely and how does it tell you well it tells you with just plain itsa and thats all the test you need thats all the test you need thisim talking about just casual practice of running pcs and he says rattlerattle bongbong yowpyowpyowpyowpyowp or something like that andor he says well i never do like to talk to people im very sorry and ive always been this way ive just never liked to talk to anybody and so forth well hes running ahes running an out of communication process and we mustnt let him go along very long that way because thats out of agreement and thats going to run him wrong way to after while and we can let it go along long enough to find something to dive in on but then we dive see well what part of your grandmother were you in favor of you know youll find very often will produce far more tone arm action than he has been getting on parts of his grandmother that he wasnt in favor of you see there are all kinds of stunts along this line you process in the direction of arc of course you dont preconceive that you know all about the case before its opened its yeep and you let theyou take the easy course see you dont work at it so hard what you get tone arm action on flatten well how about unwillingness to flatten it ah well i alreadyyouve already have seen pcs recover on 8c when they were being dragged across rooms and their fists planted against walls in other words this cycle of action is the only zone or area where you can overwhelm to any degree the preclears power of choice you mustnt overwhelm his power of choice in any other zone or area see dont evaluate for him dont do these other things to overwhelm his power of choice but finish that cycle of action brother over your dead body does it end you know when he comes into session the next day well thatsthatprocess we were running yesterday we were getting tone arm action it was traveling all over the dial seeprocess we were running yesterday i dont know i mean i had headache and i had headache all night and i didnt feel so good last night and i dont really think we ought to finish that process all right good well im sorry you felt that way and so forth say you felt bad and so forth now exactly what agreement you had about your grandmother did we take up yesterday that made you feel that way see you dont have to finish the cycle of action with an ax you can be pretty smooth about the whole thing and you go right on and you run that until weve got the tone arm down here and it is 275 still and the needle starts to tighten little bit and we say good well that cognition you had little while ago made you feel lot better didnt it yes as matter of fact it did we end the tone arm cycle of action you see five minutes before we finish the test see we spotted where it ended not where we stopped processing see theres lot of little tricks involved in this sort of thing makes youbut theyre just the tricks of slippy auditor see its how do you fit things into this cycle of action you goofed youve been going all morning long and that tone arm hasnt moved bit and that process is so flat and you say you know this thing is not going to pick up any further it hasnt got any more kick left in it its dead and ive processed him all this time and so forth i would not be beyond that process which we finished yesterday afternoon i would not be beyond saying that see id say well im sorry weve been plugging away at this this morning here because apparently we finished that yesterday afternoon oh we did oh as matter of fact i had feeling that we did oh yeah yeah and rahruh mmmm mmmm yeah he finished the cycle of action when it finished with perfect truth and your tone arm suddenly loosens up and the pcs willing to talk about something else see all right now theres the meter manifestation of flat ta and thats what the thing is registering and thats what the thing is supposed to do and thats where its supposed to go and thats how you can handle it dont run things that dont give you ta but if theyre not giving you ta then something must have been run that gave ta what was it oh well we dont have his auditors reports because this is our first or second session in life well something gave ta life does not keep good auditors reports id say he was inhad been in some other practice that gave him ta not some esoteric zone of livingness see id say it was some other practice id say it was right in here along the line of scientology see see were culminating long line of practices there are plenty around man right away id be askingi couldntcouldnt get any ta motion off of this character he could itsa like crazy and i didnt get any ta motion there was action there was action on this pc id say what the hell what theexcuse my french but where we go from here whats this whats what i wouldnt be asking for brandnew wonderful process id be asking this other question if i dont get ta action on the pc i dont ask what will get ta action on the pc i ask what has gotten ta action on the pc and i assume immediately that it is some analogous practice some similar practice right away i start watching that needle nowand this is where you use meter manifestationi start watching that needle like hawk maybe im not going to get ta but that needles going to give clue man ill crank that sensitivity right on up here 128 and so forth and sit right on top of this thing keeping it very nicely centered and watch it like hawk all right now what other zones of mental practice have you been near so on and so on have you ever been psychoanalyzed you ever been to psychiatrist have you ever been to psychologist did you ever study graphology you ever been in the field of phrenology have you ever had your horoscope read so forth clink horoscope all right all right all right now we found out what gave ta action its process unflat in horoscopy you see the rationale with which you can go and by golly you know you can untangle more cases in less time if youre slippy this way than you can shake stick at you dont have to go upstairs and fly ten thousand feet up flat on your back in some wild pose all you have to do isif you dont get ta action on the pc then all you have to do is find out what gave him ta action that wasnt completed you can trace that back ordinarily in his auditor reports because theres been some sort of lowlevel goof and thats your usually your standard action just go back through those auditors reports choose objectivetype processes as the first choice when youve gotwhen youve got thirty processes that produced ta action none of which were flat all of which were left with lots of ta action on them then you have to make some sort of choice amongst all this mess as to where you pick up the threads of this case because it isnt necessarily the first one that will respond again although that is the best possibility but it isnt necessarily true so if youve got to make power of choice and be right on the button every time such as in case advisingdifferent than auditing youre auditing youre advisingtheres slightly different way to do it if you were auditing youd simply pick up the first one and search it out and see if you could still get ta action on the first one that produced ta action see but if youre advising some auditor to do this you dont have then the continuing assessment of what youre doing see theres lottheres big difference between sitting there in the drivers seat as the auditor see and banging away andwell you could shift gears very rapidly you find out that is blind alley man you know so therefore you can cut little bit closer to the edge of the road you see in other words you can say well now look at there that first process that seems very unlikely you see that that would produce ta action because that process is six or seven years ago very unlikely well lets take alets take threeminute flier at it see which because youve got the pc on the other end of the meter you can say well how about this boiling eggs producing headache this meter doesnt do thing you see then you can say well im sorry i brought it up see you can go on to your next process see but when youre advising auditors or advising cases and so forth you cant do that you have the disadvantage of the pcyou got pc in front of you you see youve just got folder or something like that and you got the auditors advice so what you have to do then is play it surer see you play it more positively you play it on sure bet you dont take chance in other words you play it certain and you can be absolutely certain that any unfinished objective process which gave tone arm action will reproduce tone arm action if flattened in other words the objective process is the one thats most likely to have stuck the guy in tone arm action because its right here in the physical universe isnt it and its closest to the sixth dynamic so therefore tone arm actions not flattened on objective processes are the most likely to have been hung up and therefore the most likely to complete their cycle of tone arm action if resumed subjective processes are the least likely in other words you had subjective process how about your fathers screaming at you or from where could you scream at your father or something youre playing bet there that is just little bit wider bet see you cant at all be sure that some other process didnt move in sideways on this one and knock it appetite over tin cup see maybe it got covered in some other terminal run that was run the following year see and just in passing the pc cognited on it and there it went as an earlier process and maybe that cycle of action finished in some other fashion or way dont you see couldve so youre not quite so sure when youreso when youre advising cases and so forth you take the surer bets you never play doubtful one you always give it the business you know you dontyou dont hand them rifle and say well i hope this works you dont play it that way you handle them mortar that any fool could handle see and you say you drop the cartridge in the barrel here you know and it fires and youreyou know that mortar will fire see in other words youve got some guy whos having an awful time youve got some auditor whos having an awful time with him you say well run 8c and make sure that you continue to finish every cycle of action which you begin on the pc as command well you know thats going to produce something in other words you just run your heavy sure bets all the time you know you neveryou never do any fringe effects over here see its always brute certainty that you have to go on and an auditor that will do that and so forth gets very soon an enviable reputation as an adviser of auditors of course all hes really doing is advising the certainties and if those auditors are left to their own devices they might get themselves into trouble or out of trouble by handling lot of fringe stuff but theysomebody might delicately wander his way through something you see that he could never have been advised through dont you see so when youre advising auditors to do something always tell them exactly whats right down the middle of the highway never dream up some little process which goes wiffawackle and you woffawockle see your best bet in doing that is just to take the pcs folder and find somewhere in it an unfinished cycle of action and tell the auditor to complete it and if youre dealing with very new auditors and so forth always remember when they come back and tell youas they almost inevitably will that it didnt work that they didnt do it thats little maxim that goes along with this which is quite interesting to know and it saves any auditor advising auditors from broken heart more times than you could count and the way you pull that trick is you say well exactly what did you do well i did just like you said all right good what did i say and what did you do oh uhi dont know what did you say very embarrassing moment for the guy you seehe justhe doesnt remember what you said yet it didnt work thats hard bitter experience talking you see never let yourself be boxed around into thinking that your advice is good find out if it was taken make sure in the first place that the advice you give is very sound advice and your best gag on any old cases around is to haul out any old fragment of folder theyve got anyplace from anywhere and find some unflat tone arm action and have that exact tone arm action flattened thats your best advice now thats therefore meter manifestations now those are meter manifestations for level iv now im going to give you meter manifestations additional for level vi and how they compare at level iv because they are different you are accustomed to tone arm action requiring quite little time to flatten they require some time to flatten lets say the tone arm action on some process required two sessions to flatten three sessions to flatten something like this you see you get accustomed to that at level iv auditing and below you dont realize at first with level vi that youre looking at the exact same manifestation happening in the space of ten to fifteen seconds youre flattening the tone arm action on an item more broadly you flatten all the tone arm action on gpm now when youve finished an item there isnt anything else there because that was the basic woof and warp of what was giving all the commotion anyhow and you can flatten an item in ten or fifteen seconds and thats all the tone arm action there is and there isnt any more tone arm action to be had thats it now you actually dont even really see all the tone arm action that happens on that in the first place it couldnt register on the tone arm or the needle its blowing out there in space it isnt necessarily blowing up against the pc i mean you can thank your stars that it isnt blowing up against the pc i see these level vi coauditors gettinghave seen the elephant from that laugh but it flattens quick and thats all the tone arm action there is there and you spend any more time monkeying with that and do you know youre getting tone arm from elsewhere now possibly you hadnt recognized it all of you that youre getting tone arm action from the next bank or the next item or youre getting tone arm action from someplace else and you sit there and let that pc cognite on endlessly and yapyapyap and finish ahwahwahwahwahwahwah all of sudden youre going to get higher and higher ta and its going to get stickier and stickier and youre going to wonder what youre doing well you finished the cycle of action but then you started to drag in charge from something else thats carrying that cycle of action beyond the point where it can be carried and i warn you that it is very very brieften to fifteen seconds it can go up to minute but thats unlikely thats very unlikely for instance i see all the tone arm action i could possibly see go out of an itemi mean it just goes i dont know i say fifteen secondsim being very generous very generous im allowing for slow freight its gone well now its just as though as you came in the front door with dirty needle and you see you go out the back door with dirty needle in other words its the first manifestation observed in below level iv auditing but it happens to be the last manifestation observed at level vi auditing because you overflatten ta action and it is not present you get an exaggeration of the dirty needle called tocky needlea new one on youand this crazy tocky needle pc in the bank is so sensitive to invalidation that it will turn on crazy sharpedged ticketytock that it lookslooks like small rock slam not real dirty needle but it looks like small rock slam and thats sort of the level vi dirty needle see call it tocky needle and you try to take more tone arm action out of an item or out of bank than is there or you try to find something wrong in the bank that isnt wrong and youll see this great big dirty needle now its expressing tone arm action completed the dirty needle expresses tone arm action prevented from completion you got the difference but this is not saying that this is saying hey you idiot the tone arm action is all finished in this area how come youre still hanging around bud and its just marvelous that the needle will tell you that on meter its just marvelous that it will tell you that but it will its just like neon sign its nice great big reaction its not little dinky reaction like dirty needle because of course youre dealing with somebody whose bank is freeing up and who is much freer and in better case condition and its great big exaggerated action now you can drive that needle and the longer you go the more it will tocketybock and you can finally drive it to stuck needle stuck ta takes quite little while to do soyou have to be quite genius at it you know but it will ticketytock and bop and bap and tocktock and its just having ball and you say i wonder what all this commotion is about youd better ask this pertinent question am i invalidating the correct lineup hooooh smooth see just like that going tocktock bockbock baghbichbach bich bich bah bah bah gug bah baow baow well all right are there any itemsany items ive left charged behind did that bankdid that bankwas that really flat did it really join in at this point ticktock tock tock bahgbahgbahg bighbaghbagh bighbahgbahgbuh baghbahgbahgwhat the hell is going on here you know whoawhoa whoawhoawhoa betsy you see whats going on you say am iam i knocking about correct lineup smooth yeah well then give the next item so thatsthats where you begin the next cycle of action so if youwhen youre dealing with the thing that enforces cycle of action upon the pc and upon life it then objects to one being overrun the only objection you get then is insisting there is more cycle of action than is there if youve got the cycle of action out of something it raises hell that youre putting one in and what it resists is created cycle of action you try to create any new cycles of action on this pc that arent there to be created and man it just raises the living billyo with the bank now remember you came in the front door and thats when you failed to complete cycle of action that was there remember this is totally overwhelmed pc and that immediately went bzzzt bzz bzzz bzzz bzzz bzzz dirty needle drzzzzzzzzzzz see every time you saidthis pc his bank is now insisting there are cycles of action to be completed at every turn you must complete your cycle of action see weve got everything overwhelmed here with cycle of action you know okay all right you get up to the other end of the thing when youre undoing the thing that creates the cycle of action the only thing that raises the devil is making new cycle of action or extending the existing cycle of action and then that just raises the devil with the meter and you can see meter like thisnow i can tell if an item has been left charged without ever asking question about it because the new item called doesnt behave right it doesnt behave well the thing doesnt fall right and it just doesnt go and you say well we left some bring about wrong is it in the first pair the second pair the third pair the third pair reads thats good call the third pair does the one thats thereoppterm bring about the terminal bzzzztbvoop falls and so forth all right lets take up this new item and now you find it reads right you can get very alert to this without doing very much examination your items arent reading so you must have left something charged well lets rapidly find out what we left charged get the charge off and get back to what were doing all right now supposingthats the best laid plans and thats what you would do see supposing now you hadnt left anything charged ill give you the other thing see give you the other manifestation see you just get lousy read on something of this sort and it itself has been suppressed or invalidated or you hung around too long before you said it and you sayyou say oh have i left an item charged little bit of read on that was it the first ticketytock ticketytock boodibopbzzztblurrpblurrrpblooop all right would you please give the next item you understand handy little jimdandy meter mechanism then god bless meter pc will get all kindshes always getting the idea that the bank he is running went in between two other banks earlier he inevitably will get this kind of an idea why because the bank he is running is always the last bank in existence so it of course appears to be where the present time bank was once so therefore appears to be whereyou see where another bank was do you follow this now hellalways liable to get well i wonder what this is you know huhhh were supposed to be down here at this one and yet actuallyand you know i feel like this one should have come between couple of other banks hmmm and he comes into session you know i feel ncketytock bock bock and you say itbankbank was in the correct position all right now give the next item on the line oh was it so what do you know thats the end of that you just never saw meter cool off so fast turns into gorgeous flow youve got your ba steps in youve got everything in there isnt any charge left on it you see you couldnt get it with an electric shock machine see so you say all right now lets check this and lets make sure this is flat now this thing wah wah twah twah twah ticketytock bopbop thud bing that tells you right now that you have overridden the pin its disgrace to have overridden the pin its only disgrace if you see that manifestation not to unload right where you are because its invariable it means that youre invalidating correct lineup it means youre taking more charge than is there it means that youre trying to extend the cycle of action beyond its logical conclusion and thats all the bank now objects to at level vi is the cycle of action being extended beyond its end now i dont want to do the same thing with this lecture so thank you very much
