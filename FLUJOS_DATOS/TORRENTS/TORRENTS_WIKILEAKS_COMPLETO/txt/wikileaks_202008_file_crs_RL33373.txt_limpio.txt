resources science and industry division oil industry profit review 2005 summary the increase in world oil prices that began in 2004 and continued into 2005 led to increasing revenues and net incomes for all sectors of the oil industry in 2004 and continuing into 2005 increasing world demand led by china india and the united states created tight market in both oil production and refining at time where spare capacity was already at historically low levels in addition in 2004 and 2005 world political events including the war in iraq political unrest in nigeria and the political climate in venezuela among others contributed to market psychology that pushed up prices in the us domestic market the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita continue to be felt both in oil production and oil refining the hurricanes also contributed to the profitability of the oil industry in the us market however while profits were high the oil market demonstrated its ability to supply consumers as feared shortages associated with the hurricanes were very limited the profits of the five major integrated oil companies accounted for three quarters of all the profits earned by the integrated oil companies in this group oil production led the way as the most profitable segment even though production of oil and natural gas generally declined on percentage basis the percentage growth in profits for the independent oil and gas producers was even higher than the integrated oil companies their total profit however was only about 15 of the profit of the integrated companies independent refiners and marketers earned 92 profit increase in 2005 compared to 2004 valero the largest firm in this group and the largest refiner in the united states led the way with 99 increase in profit and earned almost two thirds of the profit of the group as whole high levels of profit coupled with declining growth rates for profit appear likely to continue in 2006 the potential volatility of the world oil market

industry profit review 2005 the average spot market price for west texas intermediate wti reference grade of us crude oil was up 365 in 2005 compared to 2004 refinery capacity utilization rates ran in excess of 90 for much of the year and two hurricanes katrina and rita struck the us gulf coast the location of major portion of the us oil production and refining industry as result of these and other domestic and world oil market conditions the oil industry as whole brought in record revenues and earned record profits in 20051 in 2005 the oil industry recorded revenues of 162 trillion of which 81 was accounted for by the five major integrated oil companies profits for the industry totaled almost 140 billion 76 of which were earned by the five major integrated oil companies with the largest company exxonmobil earning over 25 of the total profit although the financial results for the industry were at record levels the performance of the various sectors of the industry as well as individual companies within those sectors varied leaving some firms as relative underperformers compared to the industry leaders this report analyzes the industrys profit performance in 20052 while recent profits in the oil industry are of interest to investors analysts and public policy specialists among others longer term perspective is important in understanding the performance of the industry for example as recently as 2002 the financial picture in the oil industry was far different with declining earnings in key sectors such as refining the oil industry historically has been cyclic with periods of high earnings often followed by sharp declines driven by movements in the world price of crude oil for this reason projections of future industry performance based on current performance are likely to be mistaken integrated oil company profits integrated oil companies operate in both the upstream exploration and production and the downstream refining and marketing segments of the industry among the integrated oil companies listed in table 1 the five largest companies are usually identified as the major oil companies or supermajors exxonmobil is the largest such company its profits in 2005 were almost third larger than either of its largest competitors royal dutch shell and bp 1 this report explicitly analyzes the production refining and marketing components of the

return on sales and return on equity are presented in table 1 in an advertisement appearing soon after the oil companies announced their 4th quarter 2005 financial results the american petroleum institute api sought to compare the returns earned in the oil industry to other american industries3 they compared return on sales in the oil industry to returns earned in seven other industries as well as us industry as whole for the period october 2000 through september 2005 they found that the oil and natural gas industry earned only 03 more than industry as whole and was ranked sixth of the eight covered industries just above the average for all us industry4 the integrated oil companies earning returns of 82 on sales in 2005 exceeded the historical api rates of return by over 41 since calculating return on sales dilutes the effect of growing total profits of the industry due to higher prices and growing revenues another standard percentage measure of profitability return on equity is presented this measure indicates the success of the company and industry in earning profit by utilizing the invested capital of the owners the shareholders of the company this measure is widely used by 3 for example the new york times january 30 2006 p a11 4 banks led with returns of 173 followed by pharmaceuticals at 162 real estate at 108 health care at 77 software and services at 76 oil and natural gas at 58 utilities at 52 retailing at 34 and all us industry at 55 crs4 investors and financial analysts in evaluating the performance of firms seeking access to capital markets by this measure the integrated oil companies returned 268 in 2005 over three times the return on sales the industry leader exxonmobil earned 3255 these rates of return are likely to assure these firms and the industrys position as desirable investment as long as the price of oil remains high6 table 3 downstream results of the integrated oil companies 2005 net income product sales 000 bd company 2005 change

and 3 disaggregate the upstream and downstream performance of the integrated oil companies in 2005 tables 1 and 2 show that upstream net income growth led overall corporate net income growth for most of the companies and they earned almost 50 of their total net income from upstream activities although oil and gas production was up by less than 1 for each product in oil three of the four largest producers experienced declining output in natural gas four of the five largest producers experienced declining output due to the hurricanes and other factors table 3 presents financial results for the downstream activities of the integrated oil companies for 2005 while product sales were down by 28 net incomes were up by 139 exxonmobils performance was enhanced by its ability to increase sales while its major competitors suffered declines in sales ranging from 36 to 8 refinery operations were affected by hurricanes katrina and rita and other special 5 exxonmobils return on assets another common profit measure was 174 in 2005 6 the key question for investors and others is whether these returns will continue in the future something unknowable crs5 factors7 for example the bp refinery at texas city was out of operation in the third quarter 2005 due to an explosion and fire8 the effect of these events was that despite high refining margins several firms were unable to take full advantage of the earning potential that was available because of unexpected plant closures while it might appear from the data in table 3 that contrary to popular belief refining and marketing were underperformers in 2005 the results must be set against the performance of 2004 while net income grew by only 139 in 2005 this followed net incomes that had increased by 967 in 2004 allowing refining to lead industry profits in that year9 in other words the increases of 2005 were above and beyond the gains made in 2004 hurricanes katrina and rita also affected downstream profitability while the effects of the hurricanes served to raise refining margins and product prices they accomplished that by closing substantial fraction of the area capacity refinery utilization rates dropped to 75 at the beginning of october 2005 from 97 at the end of august 2005 many of the major refiners including exxonmobil conocophillips chevron shell bp and valero all had refineries that were forced to close as result of damage to the facility or to support infrastructure the result was that many companies were not able to take advantage of the high margins and profits because their facilities were nonoperational the high returns to operating refineries did provide an incentive to companies with damaged facilities to get them back on line as quickly as possible independent oil and gas producers table 4 presents financial results for 2005 for the independent oil and gas producers their revenues were only about 4 of that of the integrated oil companies but their net incomes were over 14 of that of the integrated oil companies with the exception of devon and andarko which lost 134 and 139 of their oil production respectively as well as 74 and 231 of their natural gas production all the companies in this group were able to expand output however the declines posted by devon and andarko led the group as whole to show decline of 28 in oil production but 24 increase in natural gas production 7 crs report rs22233 oil and gas supply issues after katrina and rita by robert l bamberger and lawrence kumins for more on the effects of the hurricanes 8 jeff gosmano upstream drives

1608 compared to the fourth quarter 2004 however the performance of the firms was also affected by asset acquisitions and relinquishments10 independent refiners and marketers valero is the leading firm among the group of independent refiners and marketers valero accounted for 58 of the groups revenue and 64 of the groups net income after its acquisition of premcor valero became the largest refiner in the united states with total capacity of over 22 million barrels per day over 13 of total us capacity the acquisition of premcor by valero contributed approximately 800000 barrels per day

changes from 2004 independent refiners and marketers benefitted from the same set of market conditions that affected the integrated oil companies these factors include refinery outages as result of hurricanes katrina and rita wide price spread between high quality light sweet crude and lower quality heavy sour crude high product prices and high throughput at their operable refineries it was reported that refiner margins exceeded 30 per barrel in september 2005 as result of hurricane katrina gasoline prices on the new york mercantile exchange reached peak equivalency of 122 per barrel while crude oil also high priced was just above 70 per barrel this 52 spread between crude oil and petroleum products was key factor in the profitability of the entire refining industry in the fourth quarter of 200511 the independent refiners and marketers earned one third of their 2005 profits in the fourth quarter of 2005 2006 profit outlook crude oil prices finished the first quarter of 2006 above 65 per barrel residual effects from the hurricanes still inhibit domestic production of crude oil and natural gas and although it is likely that high prices have slowed the pace of demand growth to some extent oil market conditions remain tight these factors suggest that profit levels are likely to remain high in the oil and natural gas industry at least through the first quarter of 2006 and possibly throughout the year unless the world price of oil unexpectedly declines 11 matt piotrowski refiners close 2005 with stellar profits oil daily vol 46 56 march 9 2006 pp 89 crs8 unless there is sharp worsening of market conditions profit growth rates although not necessarily profits themselves are on track to decline markedly in 2006 given the high profit growth rates attained in 2005 these rates are likely to be sustained only by rapidly rising prices in the oil and petroleum product markets even though profits may remain at historically high levels this outcome might be interpreted as disappointing by the financial community affecting the ability of the oil companies to attract capital for risky projects through the financial markets the positive net income performance of the oil industry developed so quickly and the magnitudes were so large in 2005 that they seemed to perhaps overcome plans to use the money as result the major firms in the industry built up their cash reserves with exxonmobil chevron and conocophillips the three largest integrated us oil companies together holding over 40 billion in addition special dividends were paid to shareholders and stock repurchase plans were common in the industry this year may see the beginning of new investments in the industry resulting from the earnings of 2005 time lags between earnings and increased investment activity are not uncommon in the oil industry because many of the companies in the industry have global perspective investment may or may not take place in the united states in addition the balance between refining investment and exploration and production will also likely reflect the profit expectations of the industry even if investment takes place outside the united states it will still contribute to world capacity in world market that is linked and interdependent increased oil production and refining capacity anywhere in the world can benefit the us market in terms of potential supply availability and relative price stability conclusion while the oil industry recorded high profits in 2004 they increased to record levels in 2005 combination of factors from political unrest to the effect of large hurricanes tightened the oil and petroleum products markets driving up prices but not resulting in widespread shortages for consumers the industry approaches 2006 with financial position that could result in expanded investment and capacity either in the united states andor worldwide expanded capacity is likely to reduce the near term ability of the industry to maintain the profit levels of 2006 but may be necessary in the longer term for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33373
