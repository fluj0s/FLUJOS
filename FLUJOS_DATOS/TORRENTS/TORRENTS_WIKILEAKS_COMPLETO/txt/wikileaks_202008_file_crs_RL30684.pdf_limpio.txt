foreign sales corporation fsc tax benefit for exporting wto issues and an economic analysis summary the us tax codes foreign sales corporation fsc provisions permit firms that sell their exports through qualified sales subsidiaries fscs to exempt somewhere between 15 and 30 of their export income from federal tax the purpose of the provision is to stimulate us exports economic theory suggests that fsc probably does increase us exports by very small amount but beyond this fscs other economic effects are probably surprising to many noneconomists first because of the exchange rate adjustments that fsc triggers it also increases us imports so that its effect on the us balance of trade the value of export s minus the value of imports is probably negligible crs estimates based on 1996 data suggest that fsc increases the quantity of exports by range of 2tenths of 1 to 4tenths of 1 it increases the quantity of imports by range of 2tenths of 1 to 3tenths of 1 based on 1996 trade flows these estimated changes amounted to 720 million to 123 billion of exports and imports alike another economic effect of fsc is perhaps more important small transfer of economic welfare from the united states abroad that occurs when part of the tax benefit is passed on to foreign consumers as reduced prices for us goods fsc is the statutory descendent of the domestic international sales corporation disc provisions enacted in 1971 disc delivered tax benefit of the same general size as fsc however several us trading partners charged that disc was an export subsidy in violation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt fsc was enacted in 1984 as replacement for disc that was designed to be gatt legal recently however the european union eu has charged that fsc itself contravenes gatts successor the world trade organization wto agreements and filed complaint with the wto in october 1999 wto panel supported the eu under wto procedures fsc must be brought into wto compliance by november 2000 absent compliance the eu could request compensation from the united states or ask the wto to authorize retaliatory measures in november 2000 congress passed and the president signed legislation designed to replace fsc with wtocompatible export tax benefit the legislation provides tax benefit for exports of the same general magnitude as fsc but its statutory mechanics differqualifying exports for example need not be sold through subsidiary corporation and matching amount of income from foreign operations would potentially qualify for the tax benefit the eu has stated it does not believe the new tax benefit to be wtocompliant it has asked the wto to rule on whether the replacement provisions are wtocompliant and if they are not to authorize retaliatory tariffs this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684contents how fsc works and its place in the us tax system 1 us treatment of export income without fsc 2 the fsc provisions 3 fsc

fsc tax benefit for exporting wto issues and an economic analysis the reason for the pending legisla tion that would alter the current tax codes fsc provisions is fscs difficulties with the wto us trading partners in the eu have argued that fsc is an export subsidy in violation of the wto agreements and in 1999 wto panel supported those claims clearly an understanding of the current legislations context requires look at us tax laws and how they relate to the wto agreements this reports presentation of the fsc issue begins there with brief overview of the us international tax system the mechanics of fscs partial tax exemption and how fsc fits into the overall us tax structure fsc was enacted as replacement for the disc tax benefit which itself was challenged as prohibited export subsidy shortly after its enactment in 1971 the current controversy thus has long history and the report continues by looking at discs problems with the general agreement on tariffs and trade and how fsc was designed to address challenges under gatt the discussion then turns to the current wto dispute and describes hr 4986 the proposed replacement for fsc under consideration in congress but fsc is an instrument of economic policy and full understandi ng of the current legislative context requires economic analysis the second part of the report thus uses economic theory to assess fscs impact on exports the balance of trade and us economic performance according to this analysis fsc has at most negligible impact on the balance of trade increases both exports and imports by extre mely small amounts and perhaps most importantly results in very small transfer of economic welfare from the united states to the foreign consumers who benefit from the reduced us prices that fsc affords how fsc works and its place in the us tax system the complaint against fsc by the eu is based on fscs place in the us tax system as explained below in more detail the wto agreements define export subsidies in part as the forgoing of taxes that are otherwise due thus to understand the fscwto controversy and the forces shaping both fsc and its replacement to get an idea of taxes otherwise due it is useful to look at the us international tax system and how fsc fits into ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs2 1 for information on the sales source rule see us library of congress congressional research service tax benefit for exports the inventory source rule crs report 97414 by david l brumbaugh washington 1997 6 p us treatment of export income without fsc first the overall structure the united states generally operates tax system based on residence that is it looks to the residence of corporation or individual in order to determine whether it has jurisdiction to tax the entity in question in the case of corporations firms that are chartered in the 50 states or the district of columbia are subject to us tax on their worldwide income regardless of whether the income is earned domestically or abroad if however firm is chartered abroad the united states only applies its taxes to the foreign corporations us source income it does not tax foreign firms on their foreignsource income the socalled deferral principle complicates this structure corporations are legal not economic entities thus us firm can operate abroad through foreign chartered subsidiary corporation that is not subject to immediate us tax on its foreignsource income again under the residence principle foreign corporations are subject only to us tax on their us income us taxation of the subsidiarys income is delayed until it is remitted to the us parent corporation as for example dividends another complication is the us foreign tax credit provision designed to alleviate doubletaxation of foreignsource income us tax law permits firms to credit foreign income taxes they pay against us taxes they would otherwise owe the credit is limited however to those us taxes that would otherwise apply to foreign source and not domestic income as result of this limit us taxpayers who have paid foreign taxes on foreign income at relatively high rates may well have an excess of foreign tax credits that they cannot use with these preliminaries aside we can now look at export income first it is clear that absent fsc us corporation that sells its exports abroad directly is likely to be subject to us tax on its export incomeus corpo rations are generally subject to us tax on their worldwide income immediately however we note an exception firms that have the excess foreign tax credits described in the preceding paragraph can use those credits to shield export income deemed to be from foreign sources from us tax us rules for sourcing income further in some cases permit up to half of firms export income to be allocated to foreign sources accordingly us corporations in these circumstances can exempt up to half their export income from us tax even without fsc indeed the magnitude of this benefit variously called the export source rule the inventory source rule and the sales source rule is greater than that available from fsc so that firms that have excess foreign tax credits are likely to structure their operations to use it instead however firm must have excess foreign tax credits to use the source rule benefit suggesting that it cannot be used by firms that pay few foreign taxes for one reason or another1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs3 2 the income in question is foreign base company sales income as defined in section 954d of the internal revenue codewhat of firms that use neither the source rule nor fsc again if the exports are sold directly by us corporation they are subject to full us taxation because of the residence principle but what if the exports are marketed abroad through foreign subsidiary that is what if us corporation first manufactures the export products ships them to foreignchartered subsidiary corporation which then sells them to foreign consumers as described above the deferral principle may come into play since foreign corporations are not subject to us tax on foreignsource income to the extent firm can allocate profits from its exports to its foreign subsidiary the profits would not be taxed by the united states until they are remitted to the us parent firm but in some cases deferral may be ruled out for exports even if they are sold through foreign corporation the us tax code contains set of provisions known as subpart f that identifies certain circumstances in which income earned by foreign subsidiaries is subject to us tax on current basis in the hands of the subsidiaries us shareholders one type of income for which subpart f potentially restricts deferral is certain sales income from transactions between related corporationsa type of income that could include income from export sales2 in sum absent fsc some us export income can use an even larger tax benefit under the source rule but only if the exporting firm has surfeit of foreign tax credits absent either fsc or the export source rule export income earned directly by us corporations would be subject to full us taxation some export income earned through foreign subsidiaries could benefit from postponement of us tax under the deferral principle but in some circumstances deferr would be ruled out under subpart f without fsc in other words some but not all us export income would be subject to us tax we next look at how fsc modifies this structure the fsc provisions in general exporters use the fsc benefit by selling their products through speciallyqualified subsidiary corporations fscs eligibility for the benefit and the size of the benefit are determined by 4 types of rules rules for qualifying as fsc rules identifying the type of fsc export income that is potentially eligible for the tax benefit rules dividing income between the fsc and its parent and rules stipulating the portion of the fscs eligible export income that is taxexempt first qualifying as fsc fscs are required to meet certain requirements related to their organi zation abroad they must be chartered abroad or in us possession must have more than 25 shareholders must maintain an office outside the united states where it maintains permanent set of books and meet certain other organizational requirements next qualifying income even if firm sells its exports through qualified fsc only revenue that qualifies as foreign trading gross receipts can generate tax favored profits in general these receipts are required to be from the sale or lease ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs4 3 these requirements for foreign presence were adopted in response to an understanding approved by the general agreement on tariffs and trade council holding that country need not tax foreignsource income as long as arms length pricing is used to allocate income among domestic firms and their foreign subsidiaries as noted below hr 4986 drops the foreign organization and the foreign manage ment requirements but retains the foreign economic process rules 4 the joint tax committees explanation of the original fsc legislation states that the administrative pricing rules were intended to approximate arms length pricing us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of the deficit reduction act of 1984 joint committee print 98th cong 2d sess washington us govt print off 1984 p 1054 export property the definition of export property includes most types of us products but specifically excludes several items inclu ding most intangible assets such as patents copyrights and trademarks oil and gas goods whose export is prohibited property that the president has determined is in short supply and raw timber in addition the tax exemption for income from exports of military property is limited to half the exemption that would otherwise apply fsc is only treated as earning foreign trading gross receipts if it conducts certain management activities or economic processes abroad3 examples of management requirements include the fsc maintaining its principal bank account outside the united states having board of directors that includes at least one person who is not us resident and holding all shareholder meetings outside the united states foreign economic process requirements are met if fsc participates in activities such as advertising arrangement of transportation transmittal of invoices and receipt of payment processing of orders and assumption of credit risk next allocating qualified income between fsc and its parent firm can use one of three alternative rules to divide net income the international norm for allocating income between related entities is method known as arms length pricing which divides income between firms using hypothetical prices that would be charged if the firms were actually not related and the fsc provisions do permit firms to use arms length pricing to divide parent and fscs income but presumably an independent sales firm operating abroad would be able to appropriate little of the profit from the production of exports in the united states if it charged marketdetermined prices its profit would be based only on the value added by its own sales and ancillary activities contributed by its own foreignbased factors of production presumably then little of the profit from us export sales could be attributed to fsc using arms length pricing and little benefit could be derived from fsc notwithstanding the fscs tax exemption the fsc rules however provide two alternative administrative rules for allocating income4 under one of the administrative methods firm can allocate to its fsc 23 of the combined parentandfsc export income under the second administrative metho d firm can allocate to the fsc an amount equal to 183 of gross export receipts subject to the limit that more than 46 of the combined taxable income can be allocated to the fsc returning to the rules governing the sales corporations themselves the part of fscs income that is tax exempt depends on the incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs5 5 the result occurs as follows firm can always choose to use the 23ofcombined income rule and exempt 15 of its income from tax 23 x 1523 15 or if firm has rate of return on sales that is large it could allocate more than 23 of income to its fsc using the 183ofgross receipts rule and exempt percentage greater than 15 the fsc rules provide however that the amount exempted under the gross receipt rule cannot exceed twice the amount exempted under the 23 rule thus under these two rules the exemption can range from 15 to 30 conceivably firm could also use arms length pricing to exempt up to 30 of income but is likely that the exemption under arms length pricing would be smaller than 15 assuming that nonexempt income is subject to the top corporate tax rate of 35 the exemption range is the equivalent to reducing the tax rate on fsc income to range of 245 ie 130 x 35 to 298 ie 115 x 35 6 the purpose of the deduction is to prevent multiple layers of corporate tax income taxallocation method an exporter elects to use if firm uses arms length pricing 30 of the fscs income is exempt from us tax if it uses either of the two administrative methods 1523 of the fscs income is tax exempt 1623 if the parent exporter is noncorporate taxpayer the interaction of the income allocation rules and these exemption fractions dictate the size of the fsc benefit see the appendix for details an exporting firm using fsc can exempt at least 15 of export income from us tax but more than 30 having set forth rules for allocati ng income the final part of the benefits statutory mechanics is specification of the part of allocated fsc income that is exempt if arms length pricing has been used to allocate income between parent and its fsc 30 of foreign trade income is exempt if either of the two alternative rules have been used 1523 of foreign trade income is tax exem pt note the combination of the rules for allocating income and the fractions of income specified to be taxexempt produce particular arithmetic result us exporter can use fsc to exempt somewhere between 15 and 30 of export profit from us tax5 from the preceding sections discussion of us export taxation without fsc it is clear there are still several loose ends first even though fscs are required to be foreign corporations the united states ordinarily taxes foreign corporations on their ussource income however the fsc provisions explicitly provide that fscs exempt income is to be treated as foreignsource income thus placing it beyond the us tax jurisdiction second subpart fs restric tion on deferral for certain types of sales income would potentially subject some fsc income to current taxation in the hands of the us parent corporation the fsc provisions exclude fsc income from subpart f finally the us tax law permits corporations to deduct at least part of dividends received from other corporations from their taxable income6 dividends from foreign corporations ordinarily do not qualify for the deduction raising the possibility that even exempt fsc income could be subject to us tax when the fsc pays dividends to its parent the fsc provisions however provide that us corporations can claim 100 deduction for dividends from fsc

washington 1983 28 p fsc and the world trade organization disc fscs antecedent the current fscwto controversy has its roots in the legislative antecedent of fsc the us tax codes domestic international sales corpo ration disc provisions first enacted in 1971 like fsc disc provided tax incentive to export although its design and mechanics were different in certain respects disc was enacted as part of the revenue act of 1971 public law 92178 it was thought that tax incentive for exports was desirable to offset the tax codes deferral benefit which posed tax incentive for us firms serving foreign markets to invest abroad rather in the united states to offset export tax incentives other count ries offered their firms to provide stimulus to the us economy7 in some respects the mechanics of the disc provisions were parallel of the deferral tax benefit disc was designed to offset while applying to exports rather than foreignsource income firms availed themselves of the disc benefit by establishing specially qualified subsidiary corporations discs that were exempt from us tax and by selling their exports through the subsidiaries in reality discs could be little more than paper corporations and still qualify for the tax benefit since the discs were tax exempt firms obtained tax deferral for income that was retained by the disc rather than distributed the size of the benefit was partly dependent on how much export income could be allocated to the taxexempt disc for tax purposes like the subsequent fsc provisions firms could use either arms length pricing or several alternative administrative formulas to allocate income to the disc where it was protected from tax in contrast to fsc income disc income was taxed when distributed to its parent firms receive dividendsreceived deduction that applies to fsc income however part of the income could be retained by the disc indefinitely and the parent could obtain the use of its discs funds by means of producer loans from the disc to the parent thus while disc was technically tax deferral it had the same economic effect as flat exemption such as fscs further the various statutory parameters of the disc provisions the income allocation rules and requirements for distributions resulted in tax benefit of the same magnitude as that of fsc8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs7 9 mcguire j michael the gatt

the wtos institutional predecessor was the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt multilateral trade treaty that was designed to reduce or eliminate restrictions on free trade restrictions such as tariffs nontariff barriers to trade and subsidies the united states and its major trading partners were signatory to gatt and in 1972 shortly after discs inception several nations of the ec submitted complaint to the gatt council arguing that disc was an export subsidy and therefore contravened article xvi of the gatt the united states however filed counterclaim holding that the territorial tax systems of 3 eec countries france the netherlands and belgium themselves conferred export subsidies under territorial tax system nation does not tax the income of its corporations if that income is earned by corporate branch located abroad as for disc itself the united states argued that because disc conferred mere deferral of tax rather than an outright exemption it was not in violation of gatt9 in 1973 the gatt council convened panel of experts to study the eecs complaint the gatt panel issued its reports in 1976 it found that elements of both the territorial system and of disc constituted prohibited export subsidies under gatt however the eec and the united states both objected to the panels finding and the debate continued to simmer until 1981 in 1981 solution was reached albeit as it turned out temporary one the gatt council adopted the panels report together with an understanding the understanding held that countries need not tax income from economic processes that occur outside their borders territorial tax systems in other words do not by themselves contravene gatt the understanding also held however that arms length pricing must be used in applying the territorial system to exports10 the meaning of the understanding itself shortly became an item of contention and during 1982 debate occurred in the gatt council over how the understanding applied to disc the eec continued to argue that disc was an illegal export subsidy the united states never conceded that disc was subsidy but the issue was becoming more serious and threatened breakdown of the dispute resolution process11 the us treasury thus proposed what eventually became the 1984 fsc provisions the provisions were designed to achieve gatt legality by providing an export tax benefit incorporating elements of the territorial tax system countenanced by the 1981 understanding httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs8 12 caplan bennett and matthew chametzky domestic

united states tax treatment for foreign sales corporations report of the panel p 1fsc and gatt to see how fsc was meant to achieve gatt legality we return to the 1981 understanding and the basic fsc mechanics outlined above the understanding held that country need not tax foreignsource income and as noted above the united states does not tax the foreign source income of foreignchartered corporations it taxes foreign firms only on income effectively connected with us trade or business the fsc provisions require fsc to be chartered abroad hence qualifying as foreign corporation and further provide that portion of fscs income is foreignsource income not effect ively connected with trade or business within the united states as described above fscs are also required by the tax code to conduct certain activities abroad hence the fsc provisions seem to emulate territorial systems by exempting foreign income from us tax the countries of the eec were still not fully satisfied of fscs gattlegality even before fsc was signed into law the eec expressed concerns about certain of the new provisions design features for example whether country can operate territorial system that is confined to just exports and wheth er the administrative pricing rules can accurately allocate income12 still the controversy was generally below the surface until november 1997 when the european communities component of the european union eu requested consultations about fsc with the united states thereby taking the prescribed first step in the dispute settlement process established under the new wto13 the united states and the eu held consultat ions without reaching solution and in july 1998 the eu took the next step in the wtoprescribed process by requesting establishment of panel to examine the issue the panel was formed and made its findings public on october 8 199914 findings of the wto panel article 31a of the wtos subsidies and countervailing measure s scm agreement prohibits subsidies contingent on export performance in turn article 11 of the agreement defines subsidy to include cases where government revenue that is otherwise due is foregone or not collected under these

foreign sales corporations report of the panel p 275 16 ibid p 271by permitting fscs to use administrative rules rather than armslength pricing to allocate income according to the eu there are three fsc exemptions that result in forgoing of taxes otherwise due one is fscs exemption from the us tax codes subpart f provisions as described above subpart f denies the deferral benefit to certain types of income earned by foreignchartered subsidiaries of us firms absent this forgiveness for fsc the requirement that fscs be incorporated abroad and their devotion to sales income might place many fscs within the purview of subpart f and negate the fsc benefit while the united states generally does not tax foreign corporations on foreign income it does apply its taxes to their income that is effectively connected with the active conduct of us trade or business the fsc provisions explicitly state that part of fsc income is not effectively connected the ec maintained that this was second exemption the ec maintained that third exemption was the availability of the 100 dividendsreceived deductio n applicable to fsc dividend payments ordinarily dividend payments received from foreign corporations are not eligible for the deduction the united states maintained in its submission to the wto panel that fsc is not an export subsidy in doing so it maintained that because the 1981 understanding held that countr need not tax foreign economic processes the fsc exemptions were countenanced by the understanding in addition the united states argued that footnote footnote 59 to an illustrative list of subsidies contained in annex i to the scm agreement likewise established that foreign economic processes need not be taxed the panels report generally supported the ecs complaint finding that fsc is indeed an export subsidy in violation of the scm agreement according to the panel the exemptions identified by the ec indeed established forgiveness of taxes that would be otherwise due the panel however did not pronounce on the applicability of each of the exemptions ident ified by the ec finding instead that viewed as an integrated whole the exemptions provided by the fsc scheme represent systematic effort by the united states to exempt certain types of income which would be taxable in the absence of the fsc scheme15 the wto panel rejected the applicability of the 1981 understanding to fsc finding that it cannot provide guidance in understanding detailed provisions of the scm agreement which did not exist at the time the understanding was adopted16 the panel also rejected the argument that footnote 59 countenanced fsc finding nothing in footnote 59 which would lead us to conclude that member that decides that it will tax income arising from foreign

agreement on agriculture more specifically the ec maintained that fsc violated commitments made by the united states in the agreement to limit agricultural export subsidies the panel also supported the ecs complaint in this regard18 the united states filed an appeal with the wtos appellate body as permitted under the dispute resolution procedures the bodys decision on february 24 2000 essentially upheld the panels findings under the wtos dispute procedures the united states initially had until october 1 2000 to bring its system into compliance with the wto rules failure to do so might ultimately result in the wto sanctioning retaliatory measures by the ec against the united states19 the united states and eu however agreed on an extension of the deadline to november 1 proposed replacements for fsc on may 2 2000 us deputy secretary of the treasury stuart eizenstat met in london with european trade commissioner pascal lamy and presented him with an outline of proposed replac ement for fsc in general the proposal would have replaced fsc with tax benefit for export income of the same magnitude as fsc along with tax exemption for income from matching amount of goods produced abroad it was on this added exemption for foreignsource income that the united states apparently based its argument that the proposal met wto requirements as noted above the wto panel ruled that fsc was not wtocompliant because it provides tax exemption that is contingent on exporting in making the proposal the united states maintained specifically as described above by its terms the proposed elective regime would apply both with respect to export foreign sales involving us manufacturing and nonexport foreign sales involving foreign manufacturing thus the proposed elective regime would not be export contingent in law20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs11 21 financial times may 30 2000 p 12 22 bna daily tax report may 31 2000 p gg1 23 in contrast to hr 4986 however the may proposal would have only applied to income from manufacturing hr 4986 is also unlike the may proposal and unlike fsc in that it does not require firms to set up subsidiary sales corporations to use its tax benefiton may 29 the eu notified the united states that it would not accept the proposal21 the administration indicated that it would nonetheless work with congress to enact proposed replacement by the looming deadline22 hr 4986 in november 2000 congress approved and the president signed hr 4986 the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of 2000 the measure was passed by wide margin and received bipartisan support the bill contains the essential elements with few differences of the may proposal like the may proposal the bill replaces the fsc benefit with tax benefit of similar magnitude also like the may proposal and unlike fsc hr 4986 matches its tax benefit for exporting with tax benefit for like amount of income from foreign operations23 however unlike both the may proposal and fsc hr 4986 does not require firm to sell its exports through foreignchartered corporation to qualify for the benefit hr 4986 begins by exempting extraterritorial income from us tax but continues by defining extraterritorial income and chain of other concepts in way that confines its exemption to firms us exports and matching amount of income from foreign operations the initial link in the chain of definitions is qualifying foreign trade property which is generally products manufactured produced grown or extracted within or outside the united states generally this is the full range of us exports but the bill explicitly excludes the same items as fsc certain intangibles oil and gas raw timber prohibited exports and property in short supply unlike fsc however military products would apparently qualify for the same benefit as other exports and unlike the parallel fsc concept of export property qualifying foreign trade property can be partly manufactured outside the united states however not more than 50 of the value of qualified property can be added outside the united states the next link in the chain is foreign trading gross receipts which the bill defines as income from the sale or lease of quali fying foreign trade property and which parallels the fsc concept of gross receipts as with fsc firm would only be treated as earning foreign trading gross receipts if it conducts economic processes abroad however fscs foreign management requirements see page 4 above would be dropped the bill next defines foreign trade income as taxable income attributable to foreign trading gross receipts the bill terms specified part of this foreign trade income qualifying foreign trade income and grants such income tax exemption the bill sets qualifying foreign trade income and thus the exclusion equal to either 12 of foreign trading gross receipts 15 of foreign trade income or 30 of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs12 24 firm can always choose to exempt 15 of income from tax alternatively if its return on sales is sufficiently high it could use the gross receipts method to exempt up to twice that amount from tax the range of exemption in other words is 1530income attributable to the foreign economic processes undertaken under the foreign trading gross receipts requirements the rule exempting 30 of income is similar in its effect to the fsc rule that applies to firms that use arms length pricing as with fsc and the may proposal before it the arithmetic result of these rules is that firm can exempt somewhere between 15 and 30 of qualified income from us tax24 as noted above in contrast to fsc hr 4986 does not require firm to sell its exports through foreignchar tered corporation to qualify for the benefit since us corporation could qualify for the exemptio n directly the special dividends receiv ed deduction language in the fsc provisions is not necessary the bill also contains language that foreign corporation that uses the benefit can elect to be taxed like us corporation this mechanism apparently rules out the application of subpart f which applies only to income earned by firms that are foreign corporations for tax purposes the path of fsc legislation through congress took number of twists and turns after the house approved hr 4986 the senate finance committee approved the fscrepl acement bill on september 19

different than that of the house the senate bill denied dividendsreceived deduction in cases where the taxfavored exports were sold through subsidiary on october 26 the house passed modified version of its fsc provisions containing compromise with the senate version of the bill the compromise was passed as part of larger bill tax cut and small business bill hr 2614 however president clinton stated that he might veto hr 2614 for reasons not related to fsc and the senate did not act on hr 2614 instead on november 1 the senate passed the fscreplacement provisions as standalone version of hr

provisions rather than the compromise version that was subsequently passed as part of hr 2614 the version of hr 4986 passed by the senate therefore could not be sent to the president without additional house action the house passed the new standalone bill on november 14 and the president signed it into law pl 106519 the eu has stated it does not believe the new tax benefit to be

congress joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 20002004 washington us government printing office 1999 p 15economic effects of fsc fscs ultimate economic effects are probably very small increases in both exports and imports little if any change in the balance of trade and very small transfer of economic welfare from the united states abroad we begin our analysis however by an assessment of the size of the tax incentive that fsc provides to exporters size of the fsc benefit the fsc benefit produces its economic effects by reducin g the rate of return before taxes required of investment in the export sector with fsc export investments can be undertaken that would otherwise have return too low to be profitable fsc thus attracts added investment to the export sector and fscs impact on trade and us economic welfare follow as result in looking at these effects we first gauge the size of fscs incentive to invest in the export sector exactly how much does fsc reduce the rate of return required of investment in the export sector tax economists use particular type of effective tax rate termed marginal effective tax rate that measures the incentive effect of taxes on investment marginal effective tax rate consists of the percentage by which taxes change the rate of return required of new marginal investment table 2 below presents marginal effective tax rates for corporate exporters without tax benefit and with the maximum and minimum fsc benefit ie the 15 and 30 exemptions effective rates are presented for average fsc users in general and for average manufacturing and nonmanufacturing exporters the effective tax rates show that the maximum fsc benefit cuts an exporters tax burden by about one quart er or 87 percentage points at minimum fsc reduces tax burdens by 4 percentage points or about onetenth the tax rates also show that the magnitude of the reduction in the tax burden on investment is relatively even across the different industries an explanation of how the effective tax rates were calculated is presented in the appendix second way of gauging the size of the fsc benefit is its revenue loss its cost to the us treasury in terms of forgone tax collections according to the most recent estimate by the joint committee on taxation the cost of fsc in terms of forgone tax revenues is 27 billion for fiscal year 200025httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs14 table 1 marginal effective tax rates for exporters using fsc product class fsc benefitmaximum fsc benefitminimum fsc benefit all products 350 273 310 nonmanufactured goods320 253 284 manufactured goods 354 276 314 source crs calculations see the appendix for methodology and assumptions fscs impact on trade and the economy again the fsc exemption reduces the rate of return required before taxes of investment in the export sector and thus attracts investment to exporting as consequence us exports are probably higher than they would be without fsc how much higher depends on the extent to which export supply increases in response to the tax benefit that is how much of the tax benefit us suppliers pass on to foreign consumers as lower prices and on how responsive foreign purchasers are to reduced prices for us exports beyond this effect however traditional economic analysis indicates that fsc produces set of effects that are perhaps surprising to noneconomists first because of theoretical exchange rate adjustments the fscinduced increase in exports is diminished and the value of us imports also are increased sales of us import competing industries thus fall economic theory indicates that as result while fsc increases the overall dollar value of us trade it does not change the balance of trade the value of imports minus the value of exports or reduce the us trade deficit the theoretical exchange rate adjustments work as follows fsc increases foreign purchases of us exports but to buy the us products foreigners require more dollars the increased demand for us dollars drives up the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets making us exports more expensive this partly offsets the effect fsc has in increasing us exports but also makes imports to the united states cheaper which causes us impo rts to increase the net result is higher dollar value of both imports and exports but change in the overall balance of trade this result is perhaps better seen by stepping back from the exchange rate mechanisms and recognizing that when country runs trade deficit it is using more goods and services than it produces to do so it must necessarily borrow from abroad by importing more foreign investment than it exports countrys trade deficit in other words is mirrored by deficit on capital account and countrys trade balance changes only if the balance on capital account changes thus if wehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs15 26 as discussed for fully below see page 16 fsc may actually reduce us flows of capital abroad if so fsc may have the effect of increasing the us trade deficit 27 as noted above fsc increases both imports and exports the overall level of trade if fsc were to operate in isolation this increase in trade would reduce economic welfare in second way by causing the us economy to inefficiently specialize in the items it exports and under produce goods that compete with items the country imports but in view of other trade distortions that work in the opposite direction it may be premature to conclude that fsc causes an efficiency loss 28 in its november 1997 report on fsc the treasury department estimated that in 1992 fsc increased exports by 3tenths of 1 percent and imports by 2tenths of 1 percent thus agreeing with the estimates here in terms of the order of magnitude of fscs effects see us department of the treasury the operation and effect of the foreign sales corporation legislation july 1 1992 to june 30 1993 washington 1997 p 15 29 at 1999 trade levels the percentages work out to an 830 million to 142 billion increase in exports as well as imports and 770 million to 115 billion transfer of welfare abroadassume that fsc does not change the balance on capital account it cannot change the trade balance26 another effect of fsc is on us economic welfare traditional economic analysis indicates that fsc reduces overall us economic welfare fsc does so because as it increases us exports at least part its tax benefit is passed on to foreign consumers in the form of lower prices this price reduction can be viewed as transfer of economic welfare from us taxpayers in general to foreign consumers27 these effects however are probably quite small table 2 below presents crs estimates based on fsc data for 1996 the most recent available according to the estimates the quantity of us exports is between 2tenths of one percent and 4 tenths of one percent higher than they would be without the provision the maximum and minimum figures in the range depend on whether it is assumed firms received 15 tax exemption from fsc or 30 exemption28 based on figures for total exports in 1996 this range translates into an increase in the value of us exports ranging from 720 million to 123 billion the quantity of imports are an estimated 2tenths of 1 to 4tenths of 1 higher than they would be without fsc the transfer of economic welfare from the united states to foreign consumers is an estimated 118 billion to 214 billion29 detailed explanation of the method used in deriving these estimates is contained in the appendixhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs16 table 2 fscs estimated impact on exports imports and economic welfare percent change in the quantity of exports and importschange in dollar amount based on

including changes in capital flows between the united states and abroad and changes in economic efficiency it is doubtful however that consideration of these factors would change the qualitative results of the analysis or appreciably alter the quantitative results fsc may well reduce the flow of us capital abroad for the following reason exports by definition can only be produced in the united states it follows that provision such as fsc that provides tax benefit to export investment encourages us firms to invest in the united states rather than abroad and given that exports serve foreign markets it is possible that if not for fsc many fscusing firms would operate abroad if it is the case however that fsc reduces the flow of capital abroad the effect of the change would be to reduce us exports and increase imports the reduced demand by us investors for foreign assets denominated in foreign currencies would drive up the price of the dollar in currency markets making us exports more expensive and imports cheaper the magnitude of the change in investment flows however is likely quite small another effect is that of fsc on economic efficiency as described above fsc increases the level of both us imports and exports in short it increases the level at which the united states trades with the rest of the world taken alone this effect would reduce the efficiency of the us econo my fsc would be encouraging the united states to over trade to over specialize in the production of the goods thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs17 30 calculations using rough estimates of the amount of capital in the export sector suggest that even if all fscs efficiency changes produce welfare gains those gains would be negligible substantially less than 1 billion per year 31 hartman has pointed out that for funds that are already abroad the incentive to invest abroad does not depend on taxes that apply upon repatriation and only on the tax rate on domestic investment versus foreign investment the proposal would therefore apparently not affect the incentives faced by funds originating abroadit exports in isolation this effect would add to fscs reduction in economic welfare that stems from the transfer of the tax benefit to foreign consumers but fsc does not in fact operate in isolation it might be argued that fscs increase in the overall level of trade mitigates shrinkage in trade that results from what tariffs and nontariff barriers are in place it also might be argued however that the added taxes that are imposed to make up for fscs revenue loss cause economic distortions and inefficiencies that make the net improvement in efficiency if any quite small30 effects of fscs possible replacement as noted above under hr 4986 firms could use fsc to exempt somewhere between 15 and 30 of export income from tax for most exports therefore the benefit under the bill would be the same as under fsc in the case of military sales however the maximum benefit would increase because the proposal does not contain fscs language limiting the benefit for military property to 50 of the exemp tion perhaps more important difference in the effect of hr 4986 would stem from its extension to certain amount of foreignproduced goods thorough analysis of the provision would require fullblown discussion of the economics of investing abroad and is beyond the scope of this report however few preliminary observations can still be made first regardless of how low hr 4986 might reduce us tax on foreignsource income where high foreign taxes apply they would at least neutralize any added us incentive to invest in hightax foreign countries second as described above in the discussion of the us tax structure see page 2 us tax on income earned by foreignchartered subsidiaries is generally not subject to us tax until it is repatriated to the united states parent firm as dividends foreignsource income receives deferral of us tax as long as it is reinvested abroad the deferral principle thus poses an incentive for us firms to invest abroad in countries with low tax rates in the case of investment originating in the united states as opposed to reinvestment of foreignsource earnings the magnitude of deferrals benefit and incentive to invest abroad is greater the longer the income from the investment is expected to be reinvested abroad for investment whose stay abroad is expected to be short hr 4896 may increase the tax incentive to invest abroad beyond that posed by deferral31 as described above see page 17 changes in capital flows may induce changes in the trade balance if hr 4896 does indeed increase us investment abroad it may have the additional effect of reducing the us trade deficithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs18 32 us

revenue by 15 billion over 5 years32 this revenue loss is in addition to the revenue that would be lost by retaining the fsc program business views support for fsc can be found in the business community possible reason for the divergence in business views from those of economists may be perspectives economic analysis looks at the impact of fsc from the perspective of the economy as whole taking into account its full range of effects and adjustments in all markets supporters of the provision however are frequently businessmen whose exporting firms would likely face declining sales profits and employment if fsc were to be eliminated for economists there is denying that fsc boosts employment and increases incomes in certain sectors of the economy and that its repeal would cause shortterm dislocation in those sectors but fsc also results in contraction of other parts for example firms that compete with imports and transfers economic welfare to foreign consumers the business community also generally supports hr 4986 the national association of manufacturers for example has endorsed the bill33 fsc and valueadded tax rebates fsc has occasiona lly been defended on the grounds that it counters subsidies provided to foreign producers by their own governments purported subsidy that is sometimes cited is the practice among european and other countries of rebating the value added taxes vats that would otherwise apply to export sales the rebates work as follows under vat tax is generally applied at each stage of production to the valueadded by that particular stage when firm in vat imposing country makes an export sale it receives rebate of all the vat that has been paid with respect to the good at every level of production at the same time when vatimposing country imports an item it generally applies its vat to the full value of the import economists have long held that such border adjustments do not distort trade and are in fact necessary if exported goods are to be part of the same relative price structure as other goods in the importing country34 parallel might be drawn with sales taxes imposed by us states that apply to goods imported from other states but not to goods exported to other states like the border adjustments with vats these adjustments do not distort tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs19 35 for surveys of the literature

some economists sometimes referred to as new trade theorists have applied models of market imperfections to international trade and have concluded that in some cases government intervention in trade might improve countrys economic welfare for example in markets where only few firms compete for profits strategic trade policy such as an export subsidy might shift profits from foreign firm to domestic one or external economies such as knowledge spillovers might recommend subsidy for the industry in which the economies occur these policy prescriptions however have been met with considerable skepticism among trade economists for variety of reasons first the theory that supports strategic trade is not robust for it to work requires variety of special assumptions second more appropriate way to address external economies that within countrys own border s may be to apply subsidy in the domestic economy rather than the international one third as an empirical matter cases where export subsidies can improve economic performance may well be quite limited and finally groups that can benefit from subsidy may coopt subsidy that is initially welltargeted so that its aim ultimately fails35 perhaps more importantly for fsc even if developments in trade theory were to support export subsidies in certain circumstances they likely do not support broadly available benefit such as fsc

discount rate is weighted average of that for debt and equity as follows 1 rfi au p fe 1 1 where r is the real aftert ax discount rate f is the share of investment financed with debt i is the nominal

depreciation rate and z is the present value of depreciation deductions claimed over the life of the asset the expression states that firms will invest up to the point where the rate of return of marginal investment is expected to produce stream of revenue and tax deductions over its lifetime whose present value is equal to the assets acquisition cost the rental cost is interpreted as the rate of return required of marginal investment under this condition solving 2 for the rental cost produceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30684crs22 3 crd auz au 1 1 subtra cting the economic depreciation rate
