identifies three concepts that are critical to the success of the ic across wide range of future scenarios safe bets and suggests that these concepts merit attention in the ics longer term planning efforts including the nis intelligence planning guidance and other guidance documents the first concept is the development of sensing and learning environment capable of handling massive amounts of

isecretrel to usa fvey secretrel to usa fvey u introduction the quadrennial intelligence community review qicr 2009 used scenariobased analysis to help the intel ligence community ic consider how to best minimize strategic surprise and manage institutional risk to meet challenges that may emerge by 2025 crel drawing on the national intelligence councils global trends 2025 world transformed qicr made three key assump tions about the future landscape for intelligence first other actors will increase in power and relevance relative to the united states second the information environment will radically transform in scope complexity and intensity with intelligence targets operating seamlessly and simultaneously between the physical and virtual worlds third customers and the ic workforce will be digital natives with different operating models and expectations for how to perform and leverage the business of intelligence u concepts for intelligence in 2025 in this landscape certain organizing principles for performing intelligence functions concepts in this reportcould help turn future challenges into opportunities qicr identified three concepts safe bets that appear critical to the success of the ic across wide range of possible futures and therefore merit consideration in todays long term planning activities crel sentient enterprise is an ic that creates sensing and learning environment for humans and intelligent machines to analyze exabytes of data in nearreal time to generate and test hypotheses autonomously process and evaluate insights to cue collection and selfupdateselfcorrect crel segmented customers differentiated services envisions an ic postured to provide more customized tools products and services to an expanding set of customers with different styles and end uses crel in responsive presence the ic has an expeditionary intelligence capacity to deploy small teams to hostile physical or virtual environments with minimal infrastructure while readily drawing on more diverse and instantly collaborative analytic expertise to guide operations and directly leverage the insights gained u strategic hedges are concepts deemed highly relevant in some possible futures but less relevant in others which the ic may need to develop as circumstances warrant crel technology acquisition by all means envisions the ic aggressively employing mix of overt means clandestine penetration and counterintelligence tactics to address severe us technological erosion vis√†vis nearpeer competitors and global corporations crel in human terrain in the virtual world the ic confronts environments dominated by nonstate actors requiring uncon ventional human collection methods with more flexible sets of analytic partners to track highly empowered cyberimmersed individuals and groups crel money mastery describes an operating concept that requires the ic to compensate for the possible loss of access to reliable financial and economic data at the global national and sector levels by penetrating corporations foreign finance ministries central banks and market participants to create an economic operating picture srel conclusion four broader implications arise from the qicr 2009 first the ic will have to manage highly fluid relation ships to deal with the dynamism of more competitive national security environment second it will need to manage singular operational architecture to deal with the new ways that greater volume of information will flow third the ic will need to main tain strong information and identity assurance to address the likely erosion in its technological advantage and the new dynamics of the digital medium fourth the ic will need to change the role of the intelligence officer to deal with dynamic external envi ronment and adapt to new customer needs to posture the ic to deal with these implications qicr suggests the value of further study by appropriate ic elements in the areas of policy regulation and law

intelligence community ic assesses the most challenging issues it could face beyond the standard planning cycle this process is known as the quadrennial intelligence community review qicr u qicr 2009 was scenariobased strategic planning activity that looked out to the year 2025 and consid ered alternative future environments ie scenarios missions the ic might be called on to perform and the concepts and some illustrative capabilities that would be needed to fulfill those missions this final report summarizes the key findings and recommends next steps to help position the ic to address the challenges of the future u methodology u the qicr 2009 applied best practices of scenario planning used in both industry and government using as starting point global trends 2025 transformed world produced by the national intelligence council nic qicr developed four scenarios that were signed to be divergent plausible challenging and rel evant to the ic these scenarios are not predictive but illustrate the range of possible challenges we might confront qicr organized the scenarios along two key dimensions of uncertaintythe relative importance of the nationstate and the extent of global coop erationand then incorporated additional relevant features of possible future environments gleaned from seven recognized geostrategic scenario sets developed by public private us and foreign sources see the qicr scenarios report january 2009 for full discussion of the scenarios u the scenarios served as the basis for analysis of missions the ic might be asked to perform in support of national objectives and the concepts and capabili ties the ic would need to perform these missions the four scenarios are summarized in the figure on page 2 each scenario implied core set of missions for the ic that was not exhaustive but highlighted the key mands customers would likely place on the ic in 2025 beyond the array of established intelligence activities crel world without the west

for the ic crel brics bustup as the united states struggles to maintain its world standing amidst competing and insular blocs the ic is predomi nantly focused on economics and commercial science and

corporations as the purveyors of traditional state functions the ic focuses on uncovering economic financial and corporate ground truth as well as on providing early warning on outbreaks of infectious disease and natural disasters u qicr developed concepts to illustrate how todays operating model will have to change for the intel ligence enterprise to remain effective qicr identified two sets of concepts concepts that were critical to the success of the ic across all the scenarios were labeled safe bets indicating that we should begin planning for their eventual adoption concepts that were critical to only one or two scenarios were deemed strategic hedges implying that we should experiment with them and consider longlead development of essential elements while monitoring ongoing events to assess whether more aggressive action is appropriate u the qicr process also delineated sample capabili ties to clarify the intent and impact of these concepts for activities people technology etc these capabilities are not meant to be either definitive or exhaustive but rather serve as starting point for further analysis u key assumptions crel based on the nics global trends 2025 study the qicr identified three key assumptions that set the context for the future posture of the ic first the united states will remain among the most prominent u qicr scenariosquadrennial intelligence community review final report 2009secretrel to usa fvey secretrel to usa fvey 3forces in world politics but the relative ascent of other state and nonstate actors across the full range of power dimensionsmilitary economic technologi cal and socialwill place new and different demands on the ic crel the proliferation differentiation and sophistication of actors in global politics will make it far more difficult to access targets whether in the physical or virtual world maintain consistent and continuous presence and influence populations srel with more tenuous us techno logical leadership in key sectors such as biotechnology nanotechnology and computing the ic may have less unilateral advantage in critical intelligence capabilities eg penetrating encrypted informa tion networks srel the ic will increasingly rely on information and communication technology that is at least partly of foreign origin rendering critical ic func tions more vulnerable to attack or manipulation in increasingly hardtodetect ways crel the second key assumption about the world in 2025 is the transformation in the information and thus cyber environment specifically in the volume velocity and variability with which information flows between and among individuals groups and states this new environment will be enabled by two paral lel and reinforcing phenomena the incorporation of sensors and processors into many more items from weaponry to foodstuffs and almost universal access to inexpensive networked computing and communica tions technologies as such there will be an exponen tial increase in the amount of data of all types poten tially available to the ic its us government customers hostile governments and adversary nonstate actors information will also move at ever increasing speeds and it will exist in greater ranges of formats that change more frequently crel most intelligence targets will increasingly operate simultaneously in the physical and virtual worlds requiring the ic to adopt seamless ap proach between the two domains as well crel balancing intelligence with the protection of privacy and civil liberties will be even more chal lenging in 2025 the ic will need socially constitu tionally and politically acceptable ways to handle exponentially more information matter what future comes to pass in many cases meeting the challenge will come down to more effective data management automated analysis of anonymized data could detect threats much earlier without infringing upon privacy rolebased access could help mitigate the risk of abuse crel the third key assumption about the operating environment of 2025 is that ic customers and part ners will be digital natives and will have signifi cantly different set of expectations of the ic they will tend to behave in two fundamentally different ways both of which contravene current orthodoxy u having grown up with the likes of wikipedia facebook flickr and google earth customers will be accustomed to building their own context derstanding and in many cases technical details u customers will be much less reliant on official intermediaries and much more comfortable reach ing out directly to networks

further exploration and potential investment some of these concepts will be critical across the full spectrum of possible futures and thus are termed safe bets because they merit the most urgent attention for further development and investment other concepts will be highly relevant in narrower range of future operating environments although aspects of the concept may have wider ap plication these concepts are termed strategic hedges and merit further exploration for investment in the event that future developments point toward their increasing importance together these concepts and their associated sample key capabilities highlight how the management organization and practice of intelligence must evolve to cope with the range of alternative futures the ic may confront the ic will need

enterprise u in 2025 electronic data will have increased ex ponentially as massive amounts of stored data have accumulated and access to mobile communications and networked sensors have become ubiquitous the volume velocity and variability of data will pose enormous search and knowledgemanagement chal lenges driving the ic toward nonlinear processing and autonomous organization of critical information virtual interactions will be integral to daily communica tions for millions of benign purposes but hostile actors will also use this medium as means to build ideologi cal and financial support and for planning and execu tion of operations in addition signals of threats may be few weak or conflicting because of the ability to shelter activity from domains that require signature crel the concept of sentient enterprise postures the ic for this circumstance creating sensing and learn ing environment capable of identifying and respond ing to voluminous simultaneous and continuous inputs the sentient enterprise will track and manage thousands of exabytes of data every day 1 exabyte is the equivalent of 100000 times the library of gress which holds 19 million books enabling iterative assessments in real time not days or weeks the data it manages will be universally discoverable accessible and usable by humans and machines equally indeed the humanmachine interface will allow the individual to interact directly with unified information architec ture the enterprise will be able to continuously and autonomously process evaluate and act on new data without regard to structure or format the enterprise will log expert users interactions with the data while gleaning new insights from more generalist users by so doing the entire enterprise will create share and advance corporate knowledge in rich and seamless interplay where machines and humans learn togetherufouo the sentient enterprise will have the ad ditional benefit of freeing intelligence professionals from mundane tasks so that they can focus on activi ties reliant on human judgment analysts will be able to allocate much more of their time to the front and back ends of the intelligence cycle

foundations for these concepts might be laid into the next several planning and programming cycles crel collectively these findings imply four broader implications for how to posture the ic to deal with the range of uncertainty in 2025 first the ic will have to manage highly fluid relationships to deal with the dynamism of more competitive security environment and the fluidity among partners sources and targets this will require the ic to accept more risk despite increasingly complex counterintelligence and security challenges crel varying patterns the ic will need to maintain both enduring partnerships grounded in deep trust and shared interests as well as marriag of convenience that are ephemeral and ad hoc relationships with foreign partners in particular will have to be much more variegated and extend to unorthodox allies be they states or nonstate actors crel range of partners the ic will need to more aggressively leverage outside expertise foreign and domestic governmental and non governmental across all facets of the intelligence enterprise from collection to security to technol ogy development reliance on outside expertise will require commensurate level of vigilance in the form of effective counterintelligence to ensure the integrity of information and systems are protected equally important the ic will have to recruit train educate mentor and retain suf ficiently sized cadre of intelligence professionals capable of sustaining rigorous dialogue with ex ternal experts finally the ic will need to continue developing products and services for state local and tribal governments as well as the private sec tor recognizing that these customers have special ized information needs and generally do not have access to classified information systems crel changing roles unknown attributes the ic will need ways to deal with partners whose roles vis√†vis us security interests change rapidly partners or sources in one dimension may very well be intelligence targets in another addition ally the ic will have to deal with actors who more actively conceal their physical locations nationali ties true identities and true purposes the ics operating

continued access to and effective use of space will likely serve as critical enabler to provide important collection and communication capability to work across this divide although it may be challenged in scenarios where states or corporations compete for primacy in space achieving such an architecture will be more difficult if and when us rivals attempt to mili tarize space andor endeavor to increase significantly the risk to us spacebased intelligence assets at the same time the ic will need to maintain visibility into offthegrid activity that has digital signature or very ambiguous physical signature but that can still have disproportionately large effects crel dynamic interaction the ic will need an architecture capable of adapting quickly as threats and issues emerge and readily cueing collection and operations often across the physical and virtual domains crel few conflicting or weak signals the ic will need to synthesize data from multiple often novel sources to identify threats or opportunities in particular the ic will need to anticipate detect understand and place into context digital signals that have few if any physical manifestations srel recommendation appropriate elements of the ic should assess the organization and structure of the intelligence enterprise to ensure it will support the kind of operational architecture necessary to deal with the transformed information environment of 2025u third the ic will need to change the role of the intelligence officer to deal with dynamic external environment and adapt to new customer needs the ic will need officers trained in multiple fields from technology to methodology to allsource analysis with many filling multiple roles at the same time the workforce model will need profound reassessment in at least two dimensions crel building wellrounded experts ic personnel will still need specialized training in cluding in languages but they will require deeper understanding of context to perform their jobs initiatives like joint duty will need to be greatly expanded and complemented with an array of velopmental educational and training activities crel crosstraining the ic will need to prepare intelligence professionals for careers in which the distinction between analyst and collec tor is increasingly irrelevant particularly in virtual worlds at the same time the ic will need to build teams to bring range of skills to bear on complex problems because some degree of individual specialization will persist u recommendation appropriate elements of the ic should review how to adapt the workforce management model to promote flexibility responsiveness collabora tion and appropriate incentives and rewards srel fourth the ic will need to maintain strong information and identity assurance to address the likely erosion in our technological advantage and the new dynamics of the digital medium which will introduce new risks to our it infrastructure and new methods of denial deception and misdirectionquadrennial intelligence community review final report 2009secretrel to usa fvey secretrel to usa fvey 21 srel declining it security the ic will have to operate in an environment where computing infra structure is more difficult to secure advanced cryption is far more pervasive and our cryptologic advantages may persist only in niches where we have focused resources to achieve breakthroughs indeed the ic may not be able to provide compre hensive security for its entire it infrastructure and may have to use such offsetting strategies as hide in plain sight srel digital deception the ic will need to op erate in an increasingly virtual operational environ ment where denial deception disinformation and hostile collection will intensify the risks posed to collection systems and analytical methodologies recognizing the difference between clandestine adversaries and nonthreatening interlocutors will require new sets of knowledge skills and abilities from our humint security and counterintelli gence cadres srel identity assurance the ic will need ro bust ways to discover manage and protect identi ties as many more people use multiple online personas and leverage increasingly sophisticated anonymizing techniques it will need approaches to mitigate this challenge by taking advantage of linked identities and entities providing web of potentially identifying information to cue social network analysis crel recommendation appropriate elements of the ic should assess the information and identity assurance capabilities of the ic to ensure it will be able to meet the digital challenges of 2025 u in conclusion qicr 2009 highlights the urgency to begin developing new approaches to prepare for an uncertain future elements of the national intelligence program foreign intelligence services state local and tribal governments and industry are encouraged to consider these insights in conducting their own longterm planning efforts the rigor with which qicr 2009 developed these ideas to mitigate strategic and institutional risk must now be translated into meaning ful agenda items for the ic and its partners to carry
