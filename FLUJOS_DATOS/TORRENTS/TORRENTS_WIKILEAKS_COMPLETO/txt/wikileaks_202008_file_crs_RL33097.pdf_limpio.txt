illegally between official po 86 of these aliens were mexican nationals because the vast majority of people apprehended each year by the usbp are mexican nationals the agency categorizes aliens as mexicans or other than mexicans otm over the past three years otm apprehensions have more than quadrupled nationwide and have been centrated along the south texas border the reasons for this dramatic increase and its geographical concentration in texas are not altogether clear the number of people entering the c ountry illegally between poe and the concomitant proliferation of human and dr ug smuggling networks can present risks to national security due to the everpresent threat of terrorism terrorists and terrorist organizations could verage these illicit networks to smuggle person or weapon of mass destruction into the united states while the large number of aliens attempting to enter the country illegally could poten tially provide cover for the terrorists additionally the proceeds from these smuggling networks could potentially be used to finance terrorism the issue of otm apprehensions has received publicity recently for many of these reasons wh ich were highlighted during congressional testimony by dhs thendeputy secretary admiral james loy when he stated that qaeda is considering infiltrating the southwest border due to belief that illegal entry is more advantageous than legal entry for operational security reasons otms apprehended along the southwest border by the usbp between official poe cannot be returned to mexico because mexico will not accept

present in the united states continuously for the twoyear period immediately prior to the date of determination of inadmissibility33 the expedited removal authority recently granted to the united

that bears close temporal and spatial proximity to illegal entries at or near the border accordingly the expedited removal authority granted to usbp agents only applies to alie ns who are discovered

been detained and is in the regu lar removal process however according to congressional testimony by dhs officials thus far in fy2005 over 70 of aliens in the regular removal process were not detained and were instead released with notice to appear nta before an immigration judge only 30 of those who were released actually appeared at their hearing and only 15 of those who appeared at their hearings and are ordered removed but are not detained appeared for their removal42 aliens placed in expedited removal are subject to mandatory detention but many of those subject to expedited removal do not have criminal records multiple reentries or other characteristics that would make them subject to mandatory detention absent determination of expe dited removal if there is bed space available aliens encountered by the usbp who are subject to expedited removal and who do not have another reason to be mandatorily detained may be released on their own recognizance despite the legal requirement that they be detained43 according to congressional testimony the er prog ram has returned more than 20000 otms44 to their nations of origin since september 200445 usbp chief david aguilar recently maintained that in those sectors where er has been implemented the reducing impact of er on otm apprehension ra tes as compared with other sectors is clear chief aguilar also noted that secretary chertoff has approved the expansion of er to additional border patrol sectors upon satisfactory completion of training and within the parameters of available detention space46 however given the mandatory detention require ment associated with er it does not appear that there are currently enough detention beds to ex pand the program to every usbp sector on september 14 2005 dhs announced that it is expanding expedited removal authority throughout the southwest border47 it is unclear how this expansion will be implemented given the current lack of detention resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33097crs10 48 if the same person is apprehended multiple times attempting to enter the country in one year each apprehension will be counted separately by the usbp in generating their apprehension statistics this means that pprehension statistics may overstate the number of aliens apprehended each yearother than mexican apprehensions apprehension statistics have long been used as performance measure by the usbp however the number of apprehen sions may be misleading statistic for several reasons including the datas focus on events rather than people48 and the fact that there are reliable estimates for how many aliens successfully evade capture this makes it difficult to establish firm correlation between the number of apprehensions in given sector and the num ber of people attempting to enter through that sector while caution should be ta ken when attempting to draw conclusions about the efficacy of policy initiatives ba sed solely on appreh ensions statistics they remain the most reliable way to codify trends in illegal migration along the border overall otm apprehensions figure 1 shows the overall number of otms pprehended by the border patrol over the past nine years the number of otm apprehensions remained relatively stable from 1998 to 2002 averaging almost 37000 year over the sixyear time period apprehensions increased by 33 from fy2002

texas border dallas morning news july 16 2005 51 from immigration and customs enforc ement congressional affairs june 16 2005 the dramatic increase in the number of otms being apprehended may be of concern to congress for several reasons first the rapid increase in otm apprehensions over the past two years suggests that for some reason many more nonmexican immigrants may be attempting to enter the c ountry illegally today than in the past it is also possible that the usbp has become increasingly effective in apprehending otms this phenomenon is too recent for any indepth analysis of its causes to exist but there are several plausible scenarios that have been the focus of the increasing popular press coverage of the issue for example the otm increase may be due to the ramping up of forcement measures at poe as the us visitor and immigrant status indi cator technology program usvisit49 system has been implemented at our nations airports and some land poe it is possible that an increased number of nonmexican aliens have decided that their best option for entering the country is the land border betw een poe rather than through the regular immigration process at poe another possible cause for the increase could be the growing number of gangs specializing in smuggling human beings across the mexican border into the united states as the usbp has increased the num ber of agents assigned to the southwest border making the border crossing more difficult and demanding for unauthorized aliens there is growing evidence that num ber of smuggling netw orks have sprung into existence to accommodate the increased demand these networks can be formal or informal spanning from sophisticated or ganizations that alter vehicles and other conveyances to conceal human beings or dr ugs to the coyotes that guide migrants across the border for fee there have been some reports that the more organized groups have focused on otms because th ey can typically charge more to non mexicans one of the main groups smugglin g aliens and drugs into the united states from mexico is known as zetas nd contains many exmembers of the mexican military according to the federal bur eau of investigation fbi recent fbi bulletin reportedly noted that fbi intelligence indicates that zetas are becoming increasingly reportedly involved in systematic corruption as well as alien smuggling including smuggling special interest aliens into the united states50 other criminal groups involved in cro ssborder smuggling include the mara salvatrucha or ms13 gang which has established growing presence in cities across the united states third possible reason for the influx of nonmexican migrants may be the growing international awareness that loophole may exist in the immigration system while mexican and canadian nati onals can be voluntarily returned across the border nonmexican nationals must be re turned to their nation of origin or some other third country that will accept them mexico will not accept otms apprehended by the usbp along the border51 however dhs does not have sufficient detention bed space to accommodate every otm that is apprehended so the majority of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33097crs12 52 as quoted by tim gaynor nonmexican immigrants swamp texas border city reuters news may 30 2005otms that are apprehended are released on their own recognizance or on bond into the interior according to border pa trol spokesman from the rio sector word is out that we are unable to detain the other than mexican crossers and they are exploiting bottleneck in the system52 otm apprehensions along the southwest border the southwest border has long been the flashpoint for illegal immigration into the united states each year on average 97 of the overall apprehensions made by the usbp occur along the us border with mexico while the vast majority of the people apprehended by the usbp have historically been mexican as figure 1 shows the number of otms attempting to ente r the country illegally has increased significantly in the last two years figure 2 breaks down the number of otms apprehended by the usbp over the past four years which is the period of time during which otm apprehensions have surged ong the southwest borders usbp sectors in fy2005 84 of all otm apprehensions occurred along the texas border with the mcallen sector alone accounting for 49 of overall otm apprehensions the concentration of otm apprehensions in xas generally and in mcallen specifically is intriguing because it contrasts with overall usbp apprehensions figures nationwide arizona accounted for 51 of all apprehensions along the southwest border in fy2004 and for 76 of the overa ll national increase in apprehensions between fy2003 and fy2004 in fy2004 the mcallen sector accounted for only 8 of all apprehensions made but for 35 of all otm apprehensions in fy2005 mcallen accounted for 12 of all apprehensi ons but for almost half of all otm apprehensions indeed in fy2005 more ot ms were apprehended in mcallen sector than mexicans the first time this has ever happened figure 2 otm apprehensions by southwest border

allowed to stay in the united states national public radio morning edition july 11 2005figure 2 demonstrates the clear and rapi d escalation in otm apprehensions in the rio laredo and mcallen s ectors in texas from fy2002 to fy2005 otm apprehensions increased by 1010 in rio 385 in laredo and 604 in mcallen the increase in otm apprehensi ons along much of the texas border thus clearly outstrips overall increase in otm apprehensions nationwide there are variety of causes for this disparity in the migration patterns between mexican and nonmexican nationals the in crease in otm apprehensions along the texas border may be related to the lack of detention bedspace in texas some have speculated that news of this shortfall in detention space in texas which leads most otms to be released on bond with notice to appear before an immigration judge has been circulating in cent ral and south america and s led otm aliens to enter the country along the texas border acco rding to united states border patrol usbp agents published account otms do not attempt to avoid capture but rather turn themselves in freely knowing that they will be released you see them otms cross over the river together in line and come around like snake to where the patrol agents flash light is and just give themselves up53 another possible cause for this phenome non may be geographical south texas is the nearest us border for migrants crossing mexico from central america and thus the most easily accessible in eff ect migrants may be choosing the shortest route to the border and thus are being funne led into south texas while this does not explain the rapid increase in otm apprehensions it could explain why otm apprehensions are concentrated in south texas yet another possible explanation for th concentration of otm apprehensions along the south texas border may be that there are currently more smuggling networks operating along the texas border these smuggling networks reportedly take advantage of the lack of detention bedspace along the texas border according to usbp supervisor interviewed by national public radio lot of times smugglers educate their groups of aliens and they tell them that if theyre arrested by the border patrol and they are issued these papers to walk they will pick them up again after they are released and continue their trip to wherever they are going54 lastly it may be that over the last coupl of years these networks have turned their attention to the smuggling of otms in stead of drugs crs analysis of cbp data shows that the majority of drugs seized by usbp agents occurs along the texas border figure 3 illustrates this point by showing the pounds of cocaine seized by usbp agents along the southwest border from fy1999 through february 2005 figure 3 shows that the majority of the cocaine seized by usbp agents over this period of time has been along the texas border the laredo and mcallen sectors in texas in turn are the hotspots along the southwest border for cocaine smuggling the same relationship holds true for heroin smuggling along the southwest border for marijuana smuggling texas as whole continues to lead other states in

control initiative abci largescale multidisciplinary initiative that seeks to coordinate federal state and local authorities to control the arizona border abci is specifically aimed at stopping cross border smuggling operations by detecting arresting and deterring all groups seeking to bring people drugs weapons and other merchandise into th country illegally56 source crs analysis of cbp data this analysis suggests that there is network of smuggling organizations operating along the texas border that have been bringing drugs into the united states interestingly comparison of figure 2 and figure 3 reveals that while otm apprehensions have been increasing in the rio laredo and mcallen sectors since 2002 the amount of cocaine being seized by usbp agents in those sectors has been decreasing it may be that over th last couple of years these networks have turned their attention to the smuggling of otms instead of drugs this relationship may give credence to those who argue th at smuggling organizations are highly adaptable and will substitute the goods th ey smuggle in order to maximize profit this would likely be of concern to cong ress given the everpresent threat that terrorists may leverage these smuggling or ganizations to bring weapons or people into the country however this relati onship may be due to other factors for example the workload generated by the dramatic increase

apprehended at the border over the same period not surprisingly the number of brazilians being apprehended at the bor der has received large amount of popular press coverage brazilian otm apprehensions the increase in brazilian otm apprehensions may be attributed to variety of factors first nonimmigrant visa issuances to brazilians seeking to ente r the united states legally have dropped significantly in the past decade from roughly 500000 in 1997 to 100000 in 200259 crs does not currently have data on visarefusal rates for brazil the visarefusal rates could demonstrate whet her the demand for visas in brazil has declined during this period accounting for the decrease in vi sa issuances or whether the demand has remained stable but fewer visa s have been issued this decrease in visa issuances has taken place during period of severe economic stagnation in brazil meanwhile in 2000 mexico dropped its entry visa requi rements for brazilians faced with increasing difficulty in acquiring visas to enter the united states legally and souring economy in brazil many brazilians appear to be exploiting their ability to enter mexico without visa using mexico as jumping off point to enter the united states illegally60 second information about us otm procedures appears to have been disseminated widely in brazil this may be due in part to the brazilian soap

to usbp supervisor in texas brazilians seem to know the process it seems to be common knowledge that they wont be immediately deported62 lastly there appear to be wellorganized smuggling networks in brazil which specialize in bringing brazilians into the united states these networks sometimes operate legal storefronts as travel agencies charging roughly 10000 for doortodoor tran sportation from brazil to us cities such as boston and atlanta typical jour ney would involve flying to mexico city traveling either by airplane or bus to the c ity of reynosa and then crossing the border illegally

rapidly over the past few years although th countries do not have visawaiver agreements with mexico making their entry into mexico more complicated the rapid increase in otm apprehensions from these

otms from special interest countries are to be processed more carefully by the usbp in addition to the normal background checks that are conducted the usbp is to notify the fbi the joint terrorism

while the threat of terrorist infiltration along the southwest border may be ev erpresent the actual numbe rs of people from countries known to harbor terrorism trying to ente r the united states has been declining somewhat some might suggest that the declining rate of apprehensions for special interest otms is due to the post 911 security enhancements in the united states which have discouraged aliens from thes countries from attempting to enter the country illegally others could point out that regardless of the decline in special interest otm apprehensions the threat of terrorist infiltration along the southwest border is quite real and is exacerbated by the number of human smuggling networks operating there it is unclear how many aliens of any nationality much less from

are in order to detain otms being pprehended by the usbp related issue involves determining the geographical dist ribution of dro detention beds one of the reasons for the surge in otm apprehensions along much of the texas border may be the severe lack of detention beds in that region which leads most otms apprehended there to be released as table 1 showed over 90 of otms apprehended in the mcalle n and rio sectors are released on their own recognizance by the usbp due to lack of detention bedspace alternatives to detention another issue concerns whether ever otm that is apprehended should be detained given that the majority are not criminal aliens or whether there are viable alternatives to detention th at can be pursued to track the whereabouts of noncriminal otms after they have been released into the interior in order to ensure that they appear for their hearings or removal pro ceedings dhs is currently piloting the use of several altern atives to detention such as the use of electronic tracking bracelets and telephonic voice recognition and the inte nsive supervision appearance program which combines electronic bracelets with home and work visits and weekly

ve1998gg98081pdfprocedures since their troubles in seekin g entry over the past seven years under existing expedited removal procedures at poe have been reportedly well documented77 the available detention bedspace curren tly poses severe constraint on the usbps ability to implement er throughout the southwest border especially in the mcallen sector which alone has aver aged almost 6000 otm apprehensions month in fy2005 dro will not have enoug h detention beds to accommodate every otm that is apprehended even with the additional 4000 beds scheduled to be provided in the fy2006 appropriation at issue for congress is whether the expansion of er that has been announced gi ven the lack of detention resources that are available is the most efficient mechanism for stemming the flow of unauthorized otms into the united states some have stated for example that the limitations on the new expanded authority are too rest rictive and would make the procedures applicable only to minute fraction of the illegal flow78 dhs on the other hand claims that expanding expedited removal between the poe will deter unlawful entry and provide dhs officers with tool to be tter secure and improve the security and safety of our nati ons land borders given the manda tory detention provision of er and the current lack of detention bedspace congress faces consideration of the level of funding and detention space necessary to expand the program throughout the southwest border processing times and costs er was originally used by the ins in official poe because people attempting to enter the country at poe can be denied entry and in effect immediately turned around and sent back to the country they came from er was seen as convenient mechanism for expediting the removal process between poe however the er process is more complicated because otms apprehended between poe are already in the united states illegally they cannot be denied entry although the i na stipulates that people apprehended by immigration officers can be returned to third countries eg returning braz ilian citizen to mexico this is contingent on number of stipulations laid out in ina 241 b2 discussed in more detail earlier in this report according to ice mexico currently does not accept the return of otms apprehended by the usbp between poe because the otms cannot be returned to the country they crossed into the united states from mexico they must be returned to their country of origin orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33097crs24 some other third country that will accep t them although the er process is demonstrably quicker than the regular removal process the mandatory detention feature means that otms apprehended by th usbp under er must be detained for the entirety of the time it takes to return them on average 32 days in addition to bearing the costs of detention the us g overnment must also provide transportation usually an airline ticket for the otms to return to their nation of origin or some other third country as the usbp begins expanding er to the entire southwest border possible issue for congress coul d involve whether dhs has the budgetary manpower and detention resources in place to effectively implement this expansion usbp focus on arizona because the majority of overall apprehensions made by the border patrol occur in arizona and specifically in the tucson sector the usbp has focused much of its efforts on securing that part of the border to that end the tucson sector has the largest number of usbp agents assigned to it and is the focal point for the multi agency arizona border control initiative however the texas border and specifically the mcallen sector far outst rip the rest of the country in otm apprehensions the otm apprehension and drug seizure data crs analyzed suggest that these networks are currently operatin g more robustly along the texas border than the arizona border this analysis however is tempered by the reality that apprehensions and seizure st atistics and trends do not n ecessarily reflect the actual trends of people and drugs coming across th border given the everpresent threat posed by alqaeda and other terrorist or ganizations threat that has been underscored by the recent events in l ondon possible issue for congress may be whether the current deploy ment of usbp resources is adequate for homeland security or whether additional agents and resources should be provided for the texas border conclusion the number of otms being apprehended by the usbp has more than tripled over the past three years the majority of these apprehensions have occurred along the texas border and have co from four nations hondur as brazil salvador and guatemala due to lack of dete ntion bedspace in fy2005 more than 70 of otms apprehended were released on their own recognizance into the interior with notices to appear before an immigration judge of those released into the interior only 30 showed up for their hearings to address this issue dhs announced that it is expanding the expedited removal program that allows the department to remove apprehended aliens without the opportunity of formal hearing before an immigration judge however aliens apprehended through the er process must be mandatorily detained and dhs does not currently have the detention resources to accommodate the rapidly increasing numbers of otms that are being apprehended given the continuing threat posed by terro rists and terrorist organizations the drastic increase in otm apprehensions during the past three years may be of concern to congress consequently the main issues th at may be of intere st to congress involve the resources available to dro and the usbp including the number of available detention beds and their geographic alloca tion whether there are viable alternatives to detention and what th appropriate number of usbp agents should be
