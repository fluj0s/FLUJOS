prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 in 2004 congress approved the most comprehensive reform of the us intelligence community since it was created over 50 years ago principal among enacted changes was the establishment of new position of the director of national intelligence dni to manage the intelligence community ic some observers have questioned whether the act provides the dni the authority necessary to effectively implement congresss 2004 intelligence reforms others assert that the dnis authorities are significantly stronger than those of the former director of central intelligence dci but suggest that the dni has failed to aggressively assert the authorities he has been provided in 2007 dni michael mcconnell acknowledged his authorities are stronger than those of the dci and conceded that he had not issued certain guidance to the ic clarifying the new authorities nevertheless he argued effectively managing the ic would require additional authorities on top of the ones congress agreed to in 2004 in response to the dnis assertions the senate intelligence committee strengthened dni authorities in the fy2008 intelligence authoriz ation bill s 1538 srept 11075 authorizing the dni to conduct accountability reviews of significant ic failures address interagency information sharing deficiencies and approve interagency funding of national intelligence centers similarly but on more limited basis the house intelligence committee also strengthened certain dni authorities in its version of the fy2008 authorization bill the committee however said it was disappointed that the dni had not assumed more directive role in coordinating the ic despite these differences in emphasis senate and house intelligence committee conferees agreed to accord the dni several new authorities hrept 110478 president bush however vetoed the legislation citing among other concerns the limitations the legislation imposed on terrorist interrogations conducted by the central intelligence agency while both committees included in their respective fy2009 authorization bills enhancements that were virtually identical to those each chamber approved the year before and the house approved its version the full senate did not act on authorization bill reported by the senate intelligence committee and thus congress did not approve an fy2009 intelligence authorization bill in examining the dnis current authorities it is clear that they are stronger than those that were available to the dci but whether they are sufficient to implement the 2004 intelligence reforms mandated by congress will continue to depend on several factors including the degree to which the authorities themselves are adequate the dnis willingness to assert those authorities and the extent to which the dni receives presidential and congressional support this implies an important oversight role for the 111 th congress this report will be updated as new information becomes available

reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 hereafter the intelligence reform act there was considerable media speculation at the time as to whether the new dni would have the authority necessary to effectively manage the intelligence community long viewed by observers as more of loose confederation of 16 separate intelligence entities than an integrated community on january 22 2007 ambassador negroponte was nominated as deputy secretary of state and retired admiral j michael mcconnell was confirmed as his successor on february 7 2007 historically the director of central intelligence dci had three primary responsibilities that were codified in the national security act as amended first the dci was responsible for providing national intelligence as opposed to tact ical intelligence for military commanders to the president and other senior officials and w here appropriate to congress second the dci served as head of the intelligence community with authorities to establish priorities for collection and analysis to develop and present to the president the annual budget for national intelligence programs and within tightly prescribed limits to transfer funds and personnel from one part of the national foreign intelligence program nfip renamed the national intelligence program nip under the intelligence reform act to anothe r and third the dci served as head of the central intelligence agency cia directing the collection of information by human sources supervising the wideranging analytical efforts of the cia and when directed by the president undertaking covert actions many outside observers members of congress and various commissions over the years argued that the dci position was unworkable they contended that dcis frustrated by the challenges involved in managing the entire intelligence community focused narrowly on the cia and that the result was an illcoordinated intelligence effort that has poorly served the nation some also asserted that dcis lacked adequate legal authorities to establish priorities and to ensure compliance by intelligence agencies beyond the cia in particular it was suggested that major intelligence agencies in the department of defense dodthe national security agency nsa the national reconnaissance office nro and the nationalgeospatial agency ngahave been more res ponsive to the needs of the military services than to the requirements of national policymakers and finally some obs ervers while conceding that dci authorities under the national security act were limited nevertheless contended that dcis failed to fully assert their authorities particularly when their priorities conflicted with those of the secretary of defense viewed by many as the dominant voice in the intelligence community because of the secretarys control over an estimated eightyfive percent of the intelligence budget in july 2004 the 911 commission the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states recommended that the dci position be replaced by national intelligence director to manage the national intelligence program and oversee the agencies that contribute to it in response number of bills were introduced and after extended deliberations congress approved and the president signed on december 17 2004 the intelligence reform act it established the new position of dni along with separate head of the cia having accepted this principle however there were significant differences of opinion about the particular authorities that should be given to the dni especially with regard to the preparation and execution of the budgets of the large intelligence agencies in dod these differences were addressed by

g344g561provision in the act section 1018 requiring that th president issue guidelines to ensure that the dnis authorities are exercised in way that respects and does not abrogate the statutory responsibilities of other departments such guidelines have been issued some maintain that this reflects the fact that in asserting his existing authorities the dni has not done so in way that has caused dod or other agencies housing intelligence components to call for the issuance of the guidelines the intelligence reform act assigns to the dni two of the three principal responsibilities formerly performed by the dci the dni will prov ide intelligence to the president other senior officials and congress and the dni will head the intelligence community but unlike dcis the dni will not oversee the cia rather the act establishes the new position of director of the central intelligence agency dcia who will report to the dni the act also restates the major responsibilities of the dcia which include 1 collecting intelligence through human sources and by other appropriate means but with police subpoena or law enforcement powers or internal security functions 2 correlating and evaluating intelligence related to the national security and providing appropriate dissemination of such intelligence 3 providing overall direction for and coordination of collection by human sources outside the us in coordination with other government departments 4 performing other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the president or dni may direct formulation that some observers believe is intended to encompass the planning and carrying out of covert actions and 5 under the dnis direction coordinating relationships between us intelligence services and those of other countries

reportedly told conference of federal officials that he lacks sufficient authority to lead the 16agency intelligence community because except for the cia he has direct line management authority over the remaining 15 agencies since each is part of another cabinetlevel department 1 the same month the administration proposed to congress fy2008 intelligence authorization act containing several new dni authorities also in april as part of new initiative to improve integration and collaboration within the intelligence community dni mcconnell announced 100 day plan that included proposal to revise

acknowledged that intelligence community leadership had not fully defined those authorities in guidance to the intelligence community3 such an acknowledgment may suggest recognition by the dni that he

areas including in those of personnel tasking and acquisition arguably most important the act enhanced the dnis control over the budgets of the intelligence communitys 16 agencies according to one observer the dci had been pressing his nose against the glass looking in having never possessed the dnis budget clout 21 other observers acknowledge that the act provided the dni more authority but question whether this enhanced authority will be sufficient and whether the dni will aggressively assert it in any case g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561 the

management and budget omb shall apportion or direct the flow of congressionally appropriated funds from the treasury department to each of the cabinet level agencies containing intelligence community elements 22 this change is designed to strengthen the dnis control over intelligence community spending if for example an agency fails to comply with certain of the dnis spending priori ties the dni can withhold that agencys funding dcis had such authority second the dni is authorized to allot or allocate appropriations directly at the subcabinet agency and department level providing the dni additional control over spending23 if departmental comptroller refuses to act in accordance with dni spending directive the law requires that the dni notify congress of such refusal 24 dcis had such

g350g561did not extend beyond the intelligence community whereas certain of nctcs authorities by contrast extend across the executive branch36 some observers suggest that the new and enhanced authorities described above could be interpreted differently by different agencies they note that section 1018 of the act requires that the president issue guidelines to ensure that the dnis authorities are implemented in in manner that respects and does not abrogate the statutory authorities of other departments although such guidelines have not been promulgated as was noted earlier some observers believe that if such guidelines were to be issued they could serve to weaken the dnis authorities

intelligence reform act that cover complex relationships among disparate agenci with their own statutory authorities in such situation much will undoubtedly depend on how the dni understands his position and on the patterns of cooperation and deference that are set in his tenure congress may be especially interested in the relationships between the dni and the defense department and the law enforcement community whether the dnis authorities under the act are sufficient to meet the demands of effective management remains to be seen what is more clear however is that the statute provides the dni substantially more authoritynot only in regard to the budget but also in the areas of personnel tasking and acquisitionthan dcis have had under the national security act of 1947 as amended just how much more overall authority the dni will actually wield will depend on several factors among them 1 will the dni aggressively assert the new authorities 2 will the president and congress back the dni if he does 3 and will the dni successfully establish transparent intelligence community budget process that will permit him to make and effectively enforce informed budget decisions 36 see the
