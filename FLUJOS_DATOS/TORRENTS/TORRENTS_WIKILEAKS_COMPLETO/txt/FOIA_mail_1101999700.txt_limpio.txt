ben santer santer1llnlgov dear toms chris and ben if largescale is important as said by tom w i cant see how microclimatic issues that roger goes on about can be that important maybe when you all meet at the delightful chicago airport hilton you can remind him of spatial degrees of freedom is the noaa tsurf used the new smith and reynolds 2005 spatially infilled surface dataset if this is the case maybe ben could do plot of noaa minus hadcrut2v i have plot that david parker produced of smith and reynolds 2005 over land and jones and moberg 2003 land as smoothed global averages from 1880 prior to about 1960 the sr dataset is always about 015 warmer than jm this looks likely due to infilling with 6190 averages ie zeroes over the antarctic and some continental interiors of s america africa western china and australia where there are obs pre early 1950s 1956 for the antarctic sr should be ok for 197999 and be very similar to hadcrut2v cheers phil at 2331 01122004 roger pielke wrote tom one issue to sort out with respect to vtt remains whether there are unrecognized biases in the surface data this issue is very much relevant if as seems the case from phil joness email the raw data that has been used has such large overlap among the different surface analyses if this is the case there are not three independent assessments of surface temperature trends moreover unlike the msu data there are inhomogeneities associated with the diverse locations of each surface monitoring site which have microclimate changes over time this issue is also very much tropical issue as this is where large land useland cover change has occurred in the satellite era photographs rather than written documentation would really help in this assessment as we have proposed roger roger pielke sr

version of chapter 4 chris et i do not see this as high priority we are supposed to be looking at vtt uncertsdiffs in individual data sets are relevant of course but what is currently missing is map maps of sfc vs trop trend diffs we are meant to be addressing problem that we have made clear at the global and tropix scale but just where are the problem areas i think carl showed us such map previously we need this or similar or more in the report since it really is the crux of the problem ideally we need sfc minus msu lotrop sfc minus midtrop uah b and rssc to at least look at and decide which isare best to show i imagine this will have some bearing on roger pielkes concerns re lulc if the biggest differences are over the oceans and from memory this is the case worst in the sh then sorting this out would arguably be more important than sorting out lulc effects it would be hard to argue albeit not impossible that teleconnections from lulc in eg north america or even the amazon basin are responsible for trend diffs over the south pacific in ch 1 there is correlation map this is pretty useless in my view altho it would be interesting to compare the correl map with an equiv trend diff map ch 3 has maps of the trends at sfc mid trop strat so we are close to trend diff map but even those who might be brilliant enough to produce the trend diff map in their heads will be thwarted becoz the mid trop map in ch 3 uses the average of uah and rss good grief this really is carrying political correctness too far please please john l et replace the mid trop panel in 3623 by separate panels for rss and uah the next in my list of related wishes is map of the rss minus uah trend diffs d eyeballing b c and d together could be interesting i would put these things right at the top of my wish list for chicago tom folland chris wrote tom can you get russ vose to look at the issues of data overlap and local and regional similarity my original suggestion was to compare trends over 19582003 and 19792003 at each grid point in the two data sets and also over larger regional areas this would go to the heart of any differences in the context of this report is easy to do and can be plotted on pair of maps with third difference in trend map for each period where differences are large more detailed look at the data can be done it might even show up errors even the first analysis on its own should give enough information to sharpen up well the current speculative text and can be done perhaps in parallel with nrc review chris professor chris folland head of climate

be careful the method of combining the data can matter very much it is just that despite our different methodologies the results are similar on large scales i know we could use other methods and the differences are more significant eg first differences homogenization of ships etc tom roger pielke wrote hi phil thanks for the quick feedback this helps lot with best regards roger prof phil jones
