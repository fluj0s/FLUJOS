accounting act of 1921 pl 6713 established for the first time the requirement that the president annually submit budget to congress the presidents budget referred to officially as the budget of the united states government consists of estimates of spending revenues borrowing and debt policy and legislative recommendations detailed estimates of the financial operations of federal agencies and programs and other information supporting the presidents recommendations initially the 1921 act required the president to include in his budget information for the upcoming fiscal year as well as for the most recently completed and current fiscal years under the 1921 act the deadline for submission was set as the first day of each regular session of congress the deadline was changed in 1950 1985 and 1990 but always required that the budget be submitted either in january or february under current law 31 usc 1105a the president is required to submit his annual budget on or after the first monday in january but later than the first monday in february budgets during the administrations of presidents harding coolidge and hoover were submitted in december during the administrations of president franklin d roosevelt and subsequent presidents budgets were submitted in january or february as soon as the presidents budget is received the house and senate begin working on the annual appropriations bills revenue measures and other budgetary legislation the aim of the two chambers is to complete legislative action on the budget by the beginning of the fiscal year later in the session but sometimes such action is not completed until weeks or months after the fiscal year has begun origin of the midsession review for nearly half century after the 1921 act took effect presidents submitted their annual budgets to congress in toward the beginning of the session but were not required to update the budget submissions later in the session as the federal budget became larger more complex and more dynamic congress felt greater need for more extensive and updated budgetary information from the president this view was expressed by the house rules committee in its report on the legislative reorganization act of 1970 pl 91510 crs2 very often as the appropriations process moves forward conditions relating to the presidents budget change frequently members are not fully informed about such changes and what effect they will have on the total budget official executive pronouncements are made subsequent to the budget submission supplementary budgetary information is presented firm foundation except the january budget is available in the congress this inexact imprecise and haphazard system must be substantially improved if the congress is to analyze effectively the presidents program and with any degree of accuracy forecast the expenditure and revenue levels of the national government1 the legislative reorganization act of 1970 made several changes in the federal budget process in response to congresss need for more budgetary information from the president chiefly by requiring that his budget cover not just the upcoming fiscal year but the four ensuing fiscal years in addition section 221b of the act requires the president to submit to congress an update of his budget in the middle of the legislative session the requirement which was first effective in 1972 is codified at 31 usc 1106 see the appendix for the current text of the statutory requirement the update commonly is referred to as the midsession review but sometimes is referred to as the supplemental summary of the budget it often is printed as house document subsequent modifications congress and the president have made two changes since 1970 pertinent to the requirement for midsession review first in conjunction with change in the start of the fiscal year from july 1 to october 1 made by the congressional budget act of 1974 pl 93344 the deadline for submission of the midsession review was changed from june 1 to july 152 the second change pertained to the budget enforcement procedures established on temporary basis by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 commonly referred to as the grammrudmanhollings act under section 241 of the act the president was required in the preparation of his annual budget to adhere to statutory deficit targets that were enforced by sequestration section 242 of the act 99 stat 1063 extended the same constraint to the preparation of the midsession review the restriction expired at the end of fy1995 along with the deficit targets themselves 1 hrept 911215 to accompany hr 17654 in us code congressional and administrative news 91st cong 2nd sess 1970 vol 3 p 4427 2 section 501 88

occurred on average it involved delay of about three weeks 217 days figure 1 shows the number of days that the midsession review was submitted before or after the july 15 deadline for each year from fy1980fy2009 figure 1 number of days midsession review submitted before or after july 15 deadline fy1980fy2009 circumstances of delayed submission the submission of the midsession review was noticeably delayed ie for more than 15 days in four instances during fouryear stretch of the reagan administration covering fy1985fy1988 for fy1994 and fy1998 under the clinton administration and for fy2002 under the george w bush administration the circumstances surrounding the delayed submissions in these four instances are discussed in more detail below president reagan fy1985fy1988 during the first three years of his administration president reagan submitted the midsession review either on time or more than 15 days late during the next four years of his administration however growing and persistent deficits made his relationship with congress on budgetary matters especially turbulent marked by delay and gridlock in all phases of legislative action on the budget the midsession reviews for four consecutive years fy1985 fy1988 were submitted between 22 and 46 days late crs6 on september 29 1987 the balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 title i of pl 100119 was enacted which in part amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 to modify the sequestration process requirement was added that the president include in the midsession review preliminary sequestration estimates as well as the economic and technical assumptions that would be used in the initial sequestration report for the fiscal year due in august the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the 1987 act noted for fy 1989 and beyond the presidents july 15 midsession budget report must provide an estimate of the deficit excess and net deficit reduction computed using the economic and technical assumptions that he will use in the initial sequestration report for that fiscal year it is imperative that the director of omb actually deliver this midsession report by july 15 when he issues the initial sequestration report he is required to use those same economic and technical assumptions3 the increased significance given to the midsession review by virtue of this change in the sequestration process probably accounts in part for the improved record of submission beginning with fy1989 president reagans midsession review for that year was only 13 days late the improved record of submission continued for all four years of the george h w bush administration covering fy1990fy1993 the requirement under the 1985 balanced budget act was effective for three years fy1989fy1991 but was terminated under revisions made by the budget enforcement act bea of 19904 president george hw bush used the mid session review for fy1992 and fy1993 at his own initiative as vehicle for apprising congress of the status of legislation under two new enforcement tools established by the bea of 1990 discretionary spending limits and payasyougo paygo requirement covering revenues and mandatory spending president clinton fy1994 on july 15 1993 the clinton administration notified congress that it would delay the submission of the midsession review for fy1994 so that it would reflect the impact of the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1993 which was then pending before the house and senate on that date the administration provided preliminary midsession estimates of the deficit president clinton signed obra of 1993 into law on august 10 as pl 10366 and transmitted the midsession review for fy1994 to congress on september 1 48 days late president clintons action stirred controversy in congress because some members wanted an updated assessment of the budgetary situation before voting on the conference report on obra of 1993 on july 20 1993 the senate tabled an 3 see p 53 of hrept 100313 september 21 1987 increasing the statutory limit on the public debt 4 the bea of 1990 is title xiii of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 signed into law on november 5 1990 crs7 amendment by vote of 56 to 43 offered by senator pete domenici to hr 25 the hatch act reform amendments5 senator domenicis amendment stated it is the sense of the senate that the president should submit the supplementary budget as required by law later than july 16 and the requisite information therein required but in event later than july 26 1993 senator larry craig discussed various patterns in the timing of submission of the midsession review during years in which the house and senate considered reconciliation legislation6 president clinton used the midsession review for fy1994 in part to recount the actions that led to the enactment of obra of 1993 and to discuss the features of that act he used the midsession review for fy1995 and subsequent years to discuss the status of legislation under the discretionary spending limits and the paygo requirement president clinton fy1998 as had been the case for fy1994 the submission of the midsession review for fy1998 was delayed until after congress completed action on reconciliation legislation the delay in this case until september 5 1997 was the longest incurred during the 26year period 52 days unlike the experience for fy1994 however the delay was not accompanied by controversy in may 1997 the clinton administration and congressional leaders reached agreement on plan to balance the budget by fy2002 on july 31 and august 5 president clinton signed into law the two reconciliation acts that implemented most of the balancedbudget policies the delayed issuance of the midsession review for fy1998 allowed president clinton to render final accounting with respect to the budgetary impact of the two measures which amounted to 247 billion in savings over five years yielding an estimated surplus of 63 billion for fy2002 president george w bush fy2002 the issuance of the midsession review again was associated with controversy in 2001 although probably more for its contents than the timing of its release president george w bush submitted his transition budget for fy2002 to congress on april 9 his budget recommended among other things that congress enact 10year tax cut of about 16 trillion while at the same time preserving the entire surplus in the social security trust funds in may congress adopted the budget resolution for fy2002 hconres 83 affirming its commitment to somewhat smaller tax cut about 135 billion and to preserving the social security surplus the onbudget surplus which excludes the transactions of the social security trust funds was estimated at that time to be about 5 the final disposition of domenici modified amendment 597 is found in the congressional record of july 20 1993 at pages s89208924 and s8951 senator domenici offered and then modified the amendment on july 15 see the congressional record of that date at pages s8795 and s8808 respectively 6 see his remarks in the congressional record of august 5 1993 at pages s10523s10529 crs8 30 billion for fy2001 and 48 billion for fy2002 these amounts represented the resources that could be allocated during the remainder of the session for additional defense spending and other budget priorities principally under reserve fund procedures without violating the pledge to preserve the social security surplus following the adoption of the budget resolution the house and senate agreed to revenue reconciliation measure providing the recommended level of tax cuts president bush signed it into law on june 7 as pl 10716 during the remainder of june and into july the house and senate focused on the consideration of the regular appropriations bills the fy2002 midsession review was issued on august 22 38 days late while the house and senate were in recess it indicated that owing largely to unexpected weakness in the economy the estimates of the onbudget surpluses for fy2001 and fy2002 had dropped to 1 billion for each year7 accordingly the amount available for allocation to defense spending and other priorities had been reduced significantly the returning house and senate faced the prospect of completing action on the regular appropriations measures for fy2002 with less than month before the beginning of the fiscal year on october 1 and under much tighter budgetary constraints than had previously been assumed circumstances of accelerated submission in 1998 president clinton submitted the midsession review for fy1999 nearly two months 50 days early on may 26 in february 1998 the presidents budget for fy1999 estimated 10 billion deficit for the current year fy1998 the mid session review revised this estimate to surplus of 39 billion the presidents reestimate for fy1998 and subsequent years paralleled significantly improved reestimates made by the congressional budget office and private forecasters the prospect of the first surplus in nearly three decades and growing surpluses in the following years sparked congressional interest in acting on sizeable taxcut legislation during the session president clinton argued instead that the budget surpluses should be reserved until changes could be made in the social security program to strengthen its longterm financial soundness according to some members of congress the issuance of the midsession review may have been accelerated to strengthen the presidents hand had the president waited until the july 15 deadline they assert the surplus estimates might have been much higher fueling even greater interest in the taxcut proposals to which he objected 7 the congressional budget office issued the budget and economic outlook an update on august 28 indicating that the onbudget surplus for fy2002 had fallen to 2 billion and had become an onbudget deficit of 9 billion for fy2001 crs9 appendix statutory requirement for midsession review of the presidents budget 31 usc 1106 sec 1106 supplemental budget estimates and changes before july
