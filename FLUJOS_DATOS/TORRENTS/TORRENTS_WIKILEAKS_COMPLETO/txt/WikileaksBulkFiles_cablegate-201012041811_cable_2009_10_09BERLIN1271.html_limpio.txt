schaeuble cdu asserted that the weapons serve as deterrent other foreign policy issues discussed included support for afghanistan and turkeys accession to the eu source said that chancellor merkel cdu may push to complete the negotiations by october 18 but noted that the fdp is in hurry he provided emboffs with list of the membership of the negotiations plenary and working groups as well as timetable cabinet composition will only be decided at the end of coalition negotiations end summary westerwelle firm on removal of nuclear weapons 2 cnf formal coalition negotiations between guido westerwelles free democratic party fdp chancellor merkels christian democratic union cdu and the christian social union csu on coalition agreement began on october 5 fdp strategist shared with emboffs and visiting senior germany desk officer october 7 information on issues discussed during the first two days of these negotiations as well as the negotiations schedule and working group makeup source serves as his partys notetaker for the negotiations and has been longstanding close embassy contact 3 cnf source said that on october 5 negotiations included discussion on arms control in general and removal of the remaining nonstrategic nuclear weapons from german soil he said that federal interior minister schaeuble argued that the weapons serve as deterrent to iran note regarding schaeuble source commented that he is neurotic in that he sees threats everywhere he questioned whether schaeubles influence is as great as it once was and whether he will stay in his position end note according to source westerwelle asserted that nuclear weapons on german soil do not serve as deterrent against iran since they could not reach iran he said that westerwelle underlined that president obama is moving forward toward nuclearfree world and that he wants germany to be in the lead source said that chancellor merkel quipped in response that germany is not that important in this regard the world would hardly take notice if there were action on this matter according to source merkel wanted to avoid discussion of this topic source also said that there was criticism of social democratic party foreign minister steinmeier that he did not respond adequately to president obamas prague speech in which he discussed arms control in response to poloff query source said that the issue of removal of nuclear weapons is very important to westerwelle and that he could well seek to include something specific in the coalition agreement turkeys eu membership afghanistan transatlantic relations 4 cnf source said that turkeys accession to the eu was also discussed with general agreement that turkey is not ready for membership and could not fulfill membership criteria source said that there was agreement that decision would have to be reached on this issue within the next four years in any case westerwelle also spoke against any type of automatic decision in favor of membership for turkey there was also general agreement that the eu is not ready for new members at this time beyond croatia 5 cnf afghanistan was also an issue but source only noted that there was general agreement on the need to continue efforts in afghanistan source also stressed that the three parties support strong transatlantic relations and continuity in foreign policy the devils in the details whats the rush 6 cnf source assessed some differences in merkels and westerwelles approach to the negotiations although he also noted that the atmosphere was very friendly and relaxed he observed that merkel preferred less detail and more general provisions whereas westerwelle was interested in detailed agreement that would guide the coalition over the next four years in addition source noted that merkel is trying to push the negotiations along since she would like to have the new government in place before she travels to washington in early november and before the eu summit at the end of october source indicated that westerwelle might try to use merkels desire for speed to his advantage in the negotiations while he did not indicate that the fdp would prolong negotiations intentionally he noted that the fdp was in hurry to complete them ministries divided among parties last 7 cnf regarding the possible makeup of the cabinet source said that decisions will be made until the end of coalition negotiations and that the current membership of working groups should not be seen as an indication of who will end up in which ministry see ref b source also said that the coalition agreement may only say which ministerial posts go to which coalition parties without any names being given the names would only be provided later perhaps after the chancellor is voted in by the bundestag source noted that only two positions are certain angela merkel will be chancellor and guido westerwelle will be vice chancellor he added that westerwelle will most likely also become the next foreign minister he then commented that during october 5 negotiations economics minister zu guttenberg demonstrated his interest in foreign policy and hermann otto solms fdp showed he could play an increasingly important role in the financial area source provided emboffs with the names of those serving in the plenary rounds of the negotiations and schedule of when those rounds will take place plenary members from the cdu chancellor merkel interior minister wolfgang schaeuble chancellery chief thomas maziere education minister annette shavan cducsu caucus chief volker kauder cdu general

fdp deputy chair rainer bruederle deputy minister president for nrw andreas pinkwart deputy chairperson bundestag education committee cornelia pieper bavaria state chairperson sabine leutheusserschnarrenberger comment 8 cnf westerwelle has made the removal of nuclear weapons from germany one of his flagship issues in the foreign policy arena and has raised this in various fora in the past it is not clear how hard he will push to have specific provision on this included in the coalition agreement judging by sources description of the discussion merkel would rather have more general provision regarding disarmament included and preferred to avoid prolonged discussion on this issue 9 cnf the cducsu is the only party that still supports german participation in the nato nuclear share and the deployment of us nuclear weapons in germany while the cducsu leadership is willing to fight for the current policy it is concerned that the ongoing nuclear posture review could significantly change us policy on the deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in europe putting it at significant political disadvantage visavis the rest of the german political establishment in fact senior chancellery officials have already requested that they be prenotified about any possible change in us policy ref c we expect that in these coalition negotiations the cducsu may hedge their bets against possible us policy change by agreeing to language that commits the next government to seek consultations on this issue at nato with the caveat that any decision must be made by the alliance as whole and must take account of the large number of russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons oriented against nato member states post will seek meetings with source after the plenary negotiation rounds to see if additional readouts are possible 10 cnf fdp source is young upandcoming party loyalist who has offered emboffs internal party documents in the past excited with his role as fdp negotiations notetaker he seemed happy to share his observations and insights and read to us directly from his notes he also provided copies of documents from his negotiations binder murphy
