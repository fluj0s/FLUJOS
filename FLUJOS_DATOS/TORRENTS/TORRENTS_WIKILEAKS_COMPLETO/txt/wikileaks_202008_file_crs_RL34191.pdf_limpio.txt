past several years high oil and gas prices instability in many oil producing countries and concerns about global climate change have heightened interest in ethanol and other biofuels as alternatives to petroleum products reducing oil dependency is goal shared by the united states and many countries in latin america and the caribbean region com posed primarily of energyimporting countries in the region brazil stands out as an example of country that has become net exporter of energy partia lly by increasing its production and use of sugarbased ethanol on march 9 2007 the united states and brazil which together produce almost 70 of the worlds ethanol signed memorandum of understanding mou to promote greater cooperation on ethanol and other biofuels in the western hemisphere the countries agreed to 1 advance research and development bilaterally 2 help build dom estic biofuels industries in third countries and 3 work multilaterally to advance the global development of biofuels many analysts maintain that the united states would benefit from having more energy producers in the region while brazil st ands to further its goal of developing ethanol into globally traded commodity in addition to these economic benefits some analysts think that an ethanol part nership with brazil could help improve the us image in latin america and lessen th influence of oilrich venezuela under hugo chávez however obstacles to in creased usbrazil cooperation on biofuels exist including current us tariffs on most brazilian ethanol imports while some members of congress s upport greater hemispheric cooperation on biofuels development others are wary of any cooperative efforts that might negatively affect us ethanol producers the energy diplomacy and security act of

prices and cerns about global c limate change have heightened interest in etha nol and other biofuels as alternatives to petroleum products the western hemisphere produces mo re than 80 of the worlds biofuels led by brazil producing sugarbased ethanol and the united states producing corn based ethanol1 some have argued that incr easing biofuels production in latin america could bolster energy security reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote rural development in the regi on others are concerned about the huge investment outlays and government subsid ies needed to build up nascent biofuels industries skeptics also worry about th potential negative effects that increased biofuels production may have on the environment labor conditions and food prices in the region the united states and brazil the worlds largest ethanol producers have recently agreed to work together to pr omote the use and production of ethanol and other biofuels throughout the western he misphere increasing usbrazil energy cooperation was top agenda issue when president bush visited brazil and when president lula visited ca mp david earlier this year on march 9 2007 the two countries signed an agreement to 1 adva nce research and deve lopment bilaterally 2 help build domestic biofuels indus tries in third countries and 3 work multilaterally to advance the global development of biofuels2 many bush administration officials and members of congress note that the new biofuels partnership with brazil may help improve the us image in latin america and diminish the influence of president ch ávez in the region in the past few months the usbrazil biofuels agreem ent has already had significant political effect in latin america ethanol diplomacy appears to be helping brazil reassert regional leadership relative to oil rich venezuela under hugo chávez3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34191crs2 4 ethanol can also be produced from petrochemi cal feedstocks but such fuel is generally

yacobucciincreasing biofuels cooperation with braz il and other countries in latin america may prompt challenges to existing us trade energy and agriculture policies for example us tariffs on foreign ethanol impor ts may prove to be an obstacle to us brazil energy cooperation in the 109th congress legislation was introduced that would have eliminated current tariffs on foreign ethanol while some members support ending the ethanol tariffs othe r members of congress support further extensions of the ethanol import tariffs some have also proposed using tariff duties collected on foreign ethanol imports to fund advanced ethanol research and production within the united states this report examines the opportunities nd barriers related to increasing us cooperation with other countries in th hemisphere on biofuels development focusing on the usbrazil agreement it provides background information on western hemisphere energy challenges th ethanol industries in brazil and the united states and the biofuels potential in the region it then raises number of policy issues that congress may choose to consider related to bolstering the development of ethanol and othe r biofuels in latin america biofuels definition the term biofuels generally refers to motor fuels produced from agricultural commodities or other biological materials such as agricultural and municipal wastes the most widely used biofuel is ethanol both in the united states and worldwide an alcohol usually produced from the fe rmentation and distillation of sugar or starchbased crops such as sugarcane or corn4 ethanol can also be produced from cellulosebased materials such as pere nnial grasses and trees although the technology to produce cellulosic ethanol is in its infancy nd commercialscale cellulosic ethanol plants have been constructed5 other biofuels include biodiesel and other renewable diesel fuel substitutes produced from vegetable oils or animal fats such as soybean or palm oil nd butanol produced from various biological feedstocks6 biofuels have severa l potential benefits relative to petroleumbased fuels first the use of biofuels can reduce emissions of some pollutants relative to gasoline or diesel fuel second most bi ofuels lead to lower emi ssions of greenhouse gases than petroleum fuels some can lead to s ubstantial greenhouse gas reductions third biofuels can be produced domestically to displace some petroleum that wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34191crs3 7 in 2006 the united states produced roughly 54 billion gallons of ethanol as opposed to roughly 200 million gallons of bi odiesel the production of all other biofuels was even less 8 biodiesel and other renewable di esel fuels must be used in diesel engines which play larger role in transporting goods in those c ountries where diesel engines play larger role in the lightduty vehicle market renewable diesel fuels could play larger role 9 for background on energy challenges facing countries in the

security testimony by karen harbert assistant secretary for policy and international affairsotherwise be imported finally some biofuels can reduce overall fossil energy consumption given that much of the energy needed to grow the feedstock plant material is supplied by the sun there are also many potential drawbacks to biofuels first in nearly all cases biofuels are more expensive to produce than petroleum fuels second infrastructure limitations can lead to even higher costs for biofuels than for conventional fuels third biofuels have their own potentia l environmental drawbacks including increased emissions of some pollutants nd the potential for increased greenhouse gas emissions in some cases depending on th particular biofuel when the entire production process is taken into account while both the united states and brazil as well as many other countries are studying and investing in many differe nt biofuels this report focuses on ethanol supply and use for several reasons 1 ethanol production and consumption far exceeds that of other biofuels7 2 ethanol can be and is used as direct blending component with gasoline and gasoline engines are dominant in passenger automobiles and light trucks8 and 3 current mandates in both brazil and the united states favor ethanol use eith er directly or indirectly biofuels potential solution to latin americas oil dependency9 while oil and gas producers such as ve nezuela mexico argentina bolivia colombia ecuador nd trinidad and tobago are ne t energy exporters most latin american and caribbean nations are net energy importers countries that rely on oil as their primary energy source are particularly vulnerable to increases in global oil prices in many caribbean island nations oil accounts for more than 90 of total energy consumed in central america oil dependency ranges from an estimated 51 in costa rica to 7378 in sa lvador honduras and panama and to 84 85 in guatemala and nicaragua10 many latin american

program known as petrocaribe launched in 200511 his government has also reached preferential energy agreements with south american countries such as argentina bolivia and ecuador in d ecember 2005 mexico perhaps in an attempt to act as countervailing force to vene zuela in the region initiated the meso american energy integration program piem with central america the dominican republic and colombia12 as part of the plan mexico will supply the bulk of the crude oil to be processed by new oil refinery in either guatemala or panama which will be used primarily to satisfy central americas energy needs given declining oil producti on levels in both venezu ela and mexico and the unstable political environment in bolivia major natural gas producer in the region some analysts have pointed to biofuels as potential solution to latin americas petroleum dependency producing biofuels would so argue allow oilimporting countries in the region to reduce energy costs and the need for imported oil the western hemisphere produces more than 80 of the worlds biofuels led by brazil producing ethanol from sugar and the unite d states producing ethanol from corn biofuels proponents argue that the clima surplus of arable land and excess production of sugarcane and other potentia l biofuels crops make parts of latin america ideally suited for an expanded biofuels industry13 the potential is greatest in tropical countries that have high cr op yields and low costs for land and labor characteristics that are present in severa l countries in central america and the caribbean14 an april 2007 study by the interamerican development bank idb blueprint for green energy in the americas reports that some latin american and caribbean countries have shown great inte rest and promise in the development of biofuels beyond brazil which has been the leader in ethanol development and production the study also highlights seve ral other countries with potential for biofuels development the study also suggests ways the idb could support the development of biofuels production in the region including support for biofuels development fund the development of regu latory frameworks and research and development15 regional highlights from the idb study include the following central america the bulk of ethanol production in central america involves reprocessing hy drous ethanol from

ethanol producers in 2006 the united states was the largest pr oducer of ethanol with almost 49 billion gallons followed closely by brazil with 45 billion gallons together the two countries produced 69 of ethanol in the wo rld prior to discussing the usbrazil memorandum of understandi ng on biofuels this section provides background information on ethanol production nd usage in the two countries ethanol production process us ethanol is generally produced and c onsumed in the midwest close to where the corn feedstock is produced18 in brazil são paulo state is the key area for sugarcane and ethanol production where integrated sugar plantations and mills produce refined sugar and fuel ethanol re gardless of the feedstock the main steps to ethanol production from sugar or st archbased crops are as follows the feedstock eg corn or gar is processed to separate fermentable sugars yeast is added to ferment the sugars the resulting alcohol is distilled resulting in wet or hydrous ethanol and for use in gasoline the distilled alc ohol is dehydrated to remove any remaining water resulting in dry or anhydrous ethanol to produce ethanol from cellulosic materials considerably more physical and chemicalenzymatic processing is necessary to separate fermentable sugars that can then be converted to ethanol this add itional processing adds significant costs making cellulosic ethanol currently uncompetitive with corn or sugarbased ethanol us ethanol industry and market the united states is currently the larges t producer and consumer of fuel ethanol in the world in 2006 the united states c onsumed roughly 54 billion gallons of fuel ethanol most of that ethanol 49 billi on gallons was produced in the midwest from corn smaller amount was produced dom estically from other feedstocks eg sorghum or imported directly or indirectly from brazil over 99 of us ethanol is blended into gasoline ethanol is bl ended into gasoline at up to the 10 level e10 although much is blended

sugar cane brazilian ethanol plants tend to be integrated with sugar plantations and sugar mills depending on market forces these plants have the capacity to shift some pr oduction from sugar to ethanol or viceversa brazilian government support for ethanol began in 1975 when presidential decree established the brazilian national cohol program proa lcool originally established mainly as way to support the brazilian sugar industry from collapse in sugar prices proalcool set production target of 3 billion liters some 08 billion gallons in 198021 the second phase of the progra m established in

because most ethanol is produced from f ood crops either corn or sugar there is concern that increasing biofuels produc tion could lead to higher food prices38 in the case of corn most corn in the united st ates is used for animal feed higher feed costs ultimately lead to higher prices for poultry hogs and cattle the price of corn is also related to the price of other comp eting foodstuffs such as grains and soybeans in 2006 the expansion of cornbased ethanol production led to sharp rise in corn prices which some predicted would lead to higher us and world food prices in fact the futures contract for march 2007 corn on the chicago board of trade rose from 250 per bushel in september 2006 to record high of over 437 per bushel in february 2007 some analysts predict that if high oil prices continue increases in global biofuels production may push corn prices up by 20 by 2010 and 41 by 202039 on the other hand commodity prices are dependent on many other factors besides the demand for biofuels crops corn prices have fallen slightly in the past few months since growers began predictin g record crop yields for 2007 while wheat prices have soared because of w eatherrelated producti on problems in many countries40 since most us households do not spend large percentage of their budgets on food they may be able to absorb any increases in food prices that result from

they maintain that the availability of arable land especia lly in latin america will allow plenty of space for biofuels production without encro aching upon other crops in brazil for example less than 9 of the countrys tota l planted area is dedicated to sugar they further argue that the foodve rsusfuel debate may be more applicable in the case of corn than in the case of sugar as recent expansion in ethanol production from sugarcane has not significantly affected global sugar prices42 environmental concerns while there are significant potential benefits from biofuels in terms of reduced petroleum consumption and reduced ai r pollution there are also potential environmental drawbacks these include the potential for increased greenhouse gas emissions higher levels of surface water contamination and increased pressure on land and water resources greenhouse gas emissions one of the key environmental concerns over biofuels is their effect on overall gr eenhouse gas emissions depending on the production process biofuels can either lead to net increase or decrease in greenhouse gas emissions throughout the fu cycle relative to petroleum fuels because ethanol contains carbon combustion of the fuel necessarily results in emissions of carbon dioxide co2 the primary greenhouse gas further greenhouse gases are emitted through th production and use of nitrogenbased fertilizers used in corn production as well from fuels used in the operation of farm equipment and vehicles to transport feedstocks nd finished products however because photosynthesis the process by which plan ts convert light into chemical energy requires absorption of co2 the growth cycle of the feedstock crop can serve to some extent as sink to absorb so fuelcycle greenhouse emissions recent studies on energy consumpti on and greenhouse gas emissions have concluded that cornbased ethanol resu lts in 13 to 22 lower greenhouse gas emissions relative to gasoline43 ethanol from other feed stocks can lead to even lower greenhouse gas emissions for exampl sugar requires fa r less fertilizer to produce than corn and less processing is necessary to prepare the feedstock for fermentation net greenhouse gas emissions from sugarcanebased ethanol could be as much as 56 lower than gasoline and cellulosic ethanol could reduce emissions by 90 relative to gasoline44 ethanol production processes themselves can also lead to air quality concerns for example without proper emissions c ontrols ethanol plants produce emissionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34191crs19 45 jose moreira water use and impa

but greater mechanization would likely come at the cost of fewer jobs for cane cutters because of the favorable missions profile of ethanol from noncorn feedstocks there is growing interest in moving u s biofuels consumption away from corn ethanol to either imported sugarcane ethanol or domestically produced cellulosic ethanol water contamination another key environmental concern surrounding ethanol is its effects on water quality in the united states corn requires significant amount of chemical inputs runoff from fertilizers and pe sticides finds its way into streams and other surface waters potentially leading to algae blooms and other problems in brazil key problem has been the discharge of nutrientrich waste from ethanol production vinasse directly in to streams or indirectly through soil contamination although legislation has been introduced to address this problem lax enforcement of environmental standards in brazil mean that pollution from ethanol production will likely conti nue to be problem45 water consumption in addition to concerns over water quality water consumption may also become an environm ental concern especially in the united states currently brazilian sugar and u s corn production do not require large amounts of water inputs however as f eedstock production especially us corn expands into drier areas more water may be needed putting additional pressure on already stretched water resources land usesoil quality concerns have also been raised about the effects of agricultural production for biofuels on land resources for example in the united states corn has generally been rotated with soybeans to promote soil quality however as corn production for ethanol ex pands much of the land that had been in rotation is shifting away from soybean production this could lead lower concentrations of soil nutrients increasing the need for fertilizers and other chemical inputs and while cellulosic biofuels in general appear more sustainable some concerns have also been raised about their sustainability especially if environmentally sensitive areas eg conservation reserve program land are used for bioenergy production in brazil concerns focus

production often displaces other existing agricultura l activities net job gains may be minimal they also assert that unless governments make concerted effort to ensure that smallscale producers have
