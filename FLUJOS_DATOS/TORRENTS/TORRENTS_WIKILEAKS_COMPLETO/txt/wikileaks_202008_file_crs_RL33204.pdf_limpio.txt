provides the facilities for buyers and sellers to trade commodity futures contracts openly and reports any market transactions to the public as result of this activity futures markets function as central exchange for domestic and international market information and as primary mechanism for price discovery particularly for storable agricultural commodities with seasonal production patterns the us department of agriculture usda plays critical role in monitoring and disseminating agricultural market info rmation commodity markets rely heavily on usda reports for guidance on us and international supply and demand conditions the release of usda supply and demand timates has the potential to substantially alter market expectations about current and future commodity market conditions and are therefore closel watched by market participants in general certain characteristics of ag ricultural product markets set them apart from most nonagricultural product markets and tend to make agricultural product prices more volatile than are the prices of most nonfarm goods and services three such noteworthy characteristics of agricultural crops include the seasonality of production the derived nature of their mand and generally pr iceinelastic demand and supply functions in addition wheat rice corn soybeans and cotton each have certain unique structural

crops wheat rice corn soybeans and cotton1 according to the us agricultural census these five crops accounted for 67 of harvested crop land in the united states in 20022 certain common characteristics make general description of market price formation relevant across this diverse set of commodities each of these crops is produced annually under modest conditions they are all storable for long periods of time potentially spanning several years they all move from farm to market in bulk form and they are all actively traded on at least one of the major commodity futures exchanges which facilitates hedging and forward contracting in addition fre quently several or in some cases all of them compete for the same crop land in production thus indirectly linking their prices across markets this report begins by briefly introduc ing some economic fundamentals common to most agricultural commodity markets this is followed in the second section by discussion of the role of futures mark ets in price determination of storable agricultural commodities with seasonal pr oduction patterns the third section reviews the important role provided by the us depar tment of agriculture usda in monitoring and disseminating agricultu ral market information the release of timely information facilitates price discovery and helps to level the playing field between small market participants and the large multinational agribusinesses the fourth and final section highlights some of the differences unique to each of these commodities that make pri ce determination in each ma rket somewhat differenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs2 agricultural commodity market fundamentals market structure and prices price p represents the equilibrium point where buyers ie demand and sellers ie supply meet in the marketplace figure 1 new market information eg crop failure in foreign market wi despread animal disease outbreak major revision to previous crop production estima etc can alter the expectations of market participants and lead to new equilibrium price as sellers revise their offer prices and buyers revise their purchas bids based on the new information an outward shift in demand from the market equilibrium due for example to news of foreign crop failure raising exp ectations for increased us exports would raise the price p as demand moves to th right along the supply curve similarly an outward shift in supply from the market equilibrium due for example to an upward revision in the planted acreage estimate by usda raising expectations for higher production would lead to lower pr ice p as supply moves to the right along the demand curve both of these hypothe tical price changes would only be short term in the longrun producers would alter their planting decisions in light of the new price expectations the speed and efficiency with which the various price adjustments occur depend in large part on the market struct ure within which commodity is being traded common attributes of mark et structure include the following the number of buyers and sellers more market participants are generally associated with increased price competitiveness the commoditys homogeneity in terms of type variety quality and enduse characteristics greater product differentia tion is generallyquantityprice p d1s ds1 pprice quantitydemand shiftsupply shift d2s2figure 1 price represents the equilibrium of supply and demandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs3 associated with greater price differences among products and markets the number of close substitutes more close substitutes means buyers have greater choice and are more price sensitive the commoditys storability greater storability gives the seller more options in terms of when nd under what conditions to sell his products the transparency of price formation eg open auction versus private contracts greater transparency prevents price manipulation the ease of commodity transfer between buyers and sellers and among markets greater mobility limits spatial price differences artificial restrictions on the market processes eg government policies or market collusion from major participant more artificial restrictions tend to prevent the price from reaching its natural equilibrium level some restrictions eg import barriers limit supply and keep prices high wh ile other types of restrictions eg market collusion by few large buyers may suppress market prices whats behind market price differences the general price level of an agricultural commodity whether at major terminal port or commodity futures exchan ge is influenced by variety of market forces that can alter the current or ex pected balance between supply and demand many of these forces eman ate from domestic food feed and industrialuse markets and include consumer preferences and the changing needs of end users factors affecting the production processe s eg weather input cost s pests diseases etc relative prices of crops that can substitu in either production or consumption government policies and fact ors affecting storage and tr ansportation international market conditions are also important pending on the openness of countrys domestic market to international comp etition and the degree to which country engages in international trade local supply and demand conditions differences in grain and oilseed prices throughout the world reflect differences in local supply and demand conditions as well as differences in local market struct ures in general grain and oilseed prices are lower in the inland producing regions where they are in surplus and higher in grain and oilseed deficit densely populat ed and port regions where demand exceeds local production similarly for cotton prices are lowest in the production zones and highest around processing centers and textile mills product characteristics todays market participants tend to be very sophisticated buyers who carefully compar the price of different agricultural commodities

depend on commoditys particular variety quality or enduse characteristic more than the overall supply of the ge neric commodity for example flour processor may base wheat purchase decisions primarily on the specific variety of wheat and its particular milling and baking characteris tics yarn or textile manufacturer may select cotton based on its fiber color st rength or length depending on the

handling network include onfarm storage trucks railroads barges and grain elevators including county subterminal and ex port elevators complex web of local supply and demand conditions determines how and when commodities move through this network price changes at any point along the chain can result in shifts to alternate transport modes or routes as gr ain marketers search for the lowestcost method of moving grain between buyer and seller for grains and oilseeds prices at the local country elevator are derived from central market price less transportation and handling costs country elevator managers watch the prices in several markets whether processing plant feedlot export terminal or futures exchange to determine where the demand is the greatest then deduct transfer costs to the higherpriced market in determining the bids they can offer local producers in competitive markets transfer costs loading or handling and transportation charges are usually the most important factors in determining spatial ie locationbased price differentials in the international marketplace transfer costs include barriers to trade such as tariffs and quotas the more it costs to transport commodity to buyer the less the producer will receive and vice versa price differentials between regions cannot exceed transfer costs for very long as marketers will quickly move commodities from the lowpriced markets raising prices there and ship them to the higherpriced markets lowering prices there3 from the farm to the processing plant or export terminal trucks trains and barges compete and complement one anothe r in moving grain to successively larger elevators shipping distance often determines each modes particular role trucks traditionally have an advantage in moving grain for shorter distances less than 250 to 500 miles and therefore f unction primarily as the short haul gatherers of grain product railroads have co st advantage in moving grai n long distances but barges

agricultural sectors see crs report rl30612 agriculture in the wto member spending continuedeconomists and market analysts agree that inexpensive barge transportation helps hold down rates charged by the rail nd truck transporta tion industries any disruption to the agricultural transportation network generally results in higher transportation costs throughout the system as the demand for transportation services shifts to alternate modes and rout in search of the next best means of moving production to market for example weather event that dramatically slows or severely limits barge traffic on the mississippi river will have the effect of raising barge freight rates as the demand for barg services exceeds th eir supply higher barge freight rates for grains will in turn shift these commodities to alternate uses feed food industrial or stor age to alternate transport modes rail or truck or to alternate trade routes eg to the atlantic via the st lawrence seaway or overland to canada mexico or alternate ports along the gulf coast or as far away as the pacific northwest because truck and rail are significantly more costly than barge transport shifting bulk commodities to truc k or railbased routes can substantially raise the cost of moving grain and result in widening basis and falling prices in interior positions government policies several of the major field crops grown in the united states including wheat co rn barley sorghum oats rice soybeans peanuts and cotton receive support under different types of government programs5 annual direct commodity payments have averaged over 18 billion in the united states during the eightyear period 19981999 to 200520066 the intended function of government programs vary from dir ect price support under commodity loan provisions to conservation management because of their influence on peracre returns government programs play an important role in the crop selection and marketing decisions of agricultural producers the degree of influence of government programs varies greatly from commodity to commodity but in general government programs increase the incentives to produce the crop receiving support as result the supply of governmentsupported crops available to the market tends to be larger than the supply actually demanded by the market under the supply and demand conditi ons that would prevail in the absence of government programs the conse quence of oversupply is lower price the united states is not alone in th support it provides through government programs to its agricultural sector7 most of the other

protection via tariffs quotas and other import rest rictions statesanctioned monopolies eg the canadian wheat board rural infrastructure development or agricultural research rather than direct payments key role of market information commodity prices reflect the equilib rium between supply and demand at particular location for given moment in time however the market equilibrium and its associated price level are constantly changing as new information is received by market participants the tremendous breadth of relevant information spanning global markets would appear to give an advantage to the large multinational agricultural based companies such as cargill archer daniels midland and bunge that have employees monitoring crop and market c onditions in all of the major grain and oilseed producing countries worldwide ho wever there are three principal sources of market information described briefly below that at least partially offset the information advantage of the large multinational agricorporations agricultural commodity futures markets commodity futures markets function as central exchange for domestic and international market information and as primary mechanism for price discovery because they reflect domestic and international market conditi ons futures contract pri ce movements implicitly convey information about international supply nd demand conditions this pricebased market information function is described in more detail below in the section commodity futures markets us department of agriculture usda usda attempts to level the information playing

usdas market information reporting process is described in more detail below in the section usda market information private news services in addition to usdas commodity market information activities

unlike cash markets which deal with the immediate transfer of goods futures market is based on buying or selling commodity contracts at fixed price for potential physical delivery at some future date8 agricultural commodity futures contracts are traded on several commodity exchanges in the united states and overseas appendix tables 1 and 2 each exchange publishes information on th months for which futures contracts are available the contract size deliverab grades trading hours contract period minimum price fluctuations daily price limits and margin information9 futures contract specifies the gr ade quality amount and c onditions for product delivery including acceptable delivery locations as well as the delivery month in most cases various product grades are deliverable in lieu of the contracts base grade or type but subject to price premiums andor discounts the contr act specifications are written to ensure that they closely mirro r cash market conditions and the months of trading are usually selected because of their significance in the crop marketing year10 futures exchange provides the facilities for buyers and sellers to trade commodity futures contracts openly then reports any market transactions to the public most futures exchanges publish daily information on the open high low and closing price of active futures contracts as well as on their volume reported as either the number of contracts or the total of physi cal units such as bushels traded and open interest the total number of futures contract s that have been entered into and not yet liquidated by an offsetting transaction or fulfilled by delivery11 as result of this activity futures markets function as central exchange for domestic and international market information and as primary mechanism for price discovery the reliability of futures markets price discovery function is dependent on the volume of daily transactions thinly traded markets as indicated by low volume are more susceptible to price manipulation than are heavily traded ones in such situations prices on the futures market may not accurately reflect either pricehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs8 12 douglas gordon performance

such forward contract prices are made relative to specific futures contract price eg march forward contract for the sale of wheat in july may set the eventual sale price at 5 cents under the closing price of the july cbot wheat ct hedging involves the purchase or sale of futures contract as temporary substitute for cash transaction that will occur later to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example producer may sell harvesttime futures contract at planting time as hedge against the risk that market prices will fall before the crop is ready for market 14 commodity trading manual board of trade of the city of chicago 1985 pp 113124behavior in the cash market or expectations about the future12 it is not unusual for distant contracts that is futures contracts whose delivery date is year or more in the future to experience very low volume publicly announced futures prices also pl ay critical role in facilitating seasonal market operations because they provide forum for forward contracting and hedging13 regional and local grain elevators rely on futures commodity exchanges for hedging grain purchases and generally t their grain bid prices at discount to nearby futures contract in areas of surp lus production such as for corn in the corn belt or at premium in ficit production areas such as for corn in north carolina as result cash prices and futures contr act prices are strongly linked ie both prices contain much of the same information about market conditions speculators ie any person or entity that buys or sells futures contracts to profit from anticipated commodity price changes in their favor provide an important function in futures markets by expanding both the trading volume and liquidity of daily futures market transac tions today speculators including private investment funds comprise the majority of market participants the presence of many speculative buyers and sellers tends to dampen extreme price volatility and allows hedgers to buy and sell in large volume with ease14 as result of speculation and hedging most futures contracts ar settled without actua l delivery of the commodity the price basis key price relationship between the local cash price and the price for the nearby futures contract is called the basis the basis is defined as the difference between the cash price of particular commodity at specific location and the nearby futures contract ie closes t contract month for that commodity for example the basis for soft red wheat in peoria illinoi s on given day in june would be the difference between the cash price in peoria and the july futures contract price at the chicago board of trade cbot as quoted on that same day under normal suppl and demand cond itions the basis for storable commodity is negative reflecting the transportation cost associated with moving the commodity from the local market to the delivery point specified by the futures contract and the carrying charges storage interest and insurance costs associated with holding thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs9 15 for geographic mapping of corn soybean and wheat basis distributions see january 2004

httpwwwampcmontanaedupublicationsampcpublicationshtmlcommodity during the time period separating the futures contract transaction date and the delivery or contract expiry date see figure 2 as futures contract expires and the delivery month approaches the carrying charges go to zero and the cash and futures prices tend to converge at the da of actual delivery the basis represents the pure transportation cost separating the local market from the futures market delivery point in cases where local demand exceeds cal supply whether due to crop shortfall or nearby processing plant th basis may be less than the transport margin or even exceed the futures market price for example local corn demand may be bolstered by the existence of an ethanol plant or major livestock feeding operation geographic basis distributions demonstrate that local corn prices in the southern plains states with large cattle feeding operations and eastern seaboard states with widespread dairy and poultry feeding operations routinely exceed the price of the nearby cbot corn futures contract ie an inverted basis by as much as 10 to 20 cents per bushel due to strong local demand from livestock and poultry feeding operations whereas local corn prices in the primary corn growing regions of the northern and western corn belt average 30 to 40 cents below cbot corn futures prices15timepricefutures

price level the interest rate and the fees associated with insurance and other timerelated chargesfull carrying charges are rarely ever achieved in actual market behavior except in periods of substantia l oversupply or excess stocks however the generally repetitive patterns of the basis movements for storable agricultural commodities make the basis more predictable from year to year than the movement of either cash or futures prices16 as result the basis enables producers and users to estimate an expected cash price from the currently reported value of futures contract this predictability greatly reduces the risk of using the futures market to hedge or forward contract major factors influencing the basis factors affecting the local basis for grains oilseeds and cotton are similar to the factors affecting both cash and futures prices and include 1 the overall supply and demand for each commodity by variety or type 2 the supply and demand of other commodities th at compete for either the same land in production or the same dollar of consum er expenditure 3 geographical disparities in supply and dema nd 4 transportation and transportation problems 5 transportation pricing structur 6 available storage space 7 quality factors and 8 market expectations17 intercontract price spreads the price relationships that exist between differing futures contract months for the same commodity are called intercontract or intramarket price spreads under normal supply and demand c onditions more deferred fu tures contracts have premium over nearby contracts that reflects the carrying charges of holding the commodity until the deferred contract da tes for example suppose that the hypothetical cost of carrying 400 bushe l of wheat for one month is 3 cents calculated as 6 annual in terest charges for one mont h which equals 2 cents plus insurance and other fees of 1 cent per bushel per month18 then the premium based strictly on carrying costs between the september contract of the current year and next years march contract would be 18 cents per bushel calculated as six months at 3 cents per month per bushel equal to 18 cents however normal conditions rarely persist and the market is always altering its expectations of future events as new market information becomes available as result price differences between futures contracts rarely equate to simple carrying charges during periods of supply shortage cash prices tend to rise relative to futures contract prices and nearby fu tures contract prices tend to rise relative to more distant contract months as result both the basi s and the price spreads between nearby and deferred contracts will narrow if severe scarcity develops the carrying charges may disappear or actually become negative situation called an inverted market scarcity causes high prices in the cash and nearby futures contracts because the market gives priority to the pr esent and discounts the future

supplies are expected to be relatively abundant due to the new harvest19 this type of inversion is often referred to as the oldcropnewcrop inversion for wheat the oldcropnewcrop price spread is represented by the price difference between the may and july futures contracts september and december contracts for corn august and september contracts for soybeans and july and october contracts for

trade cbot if carrying charges were the sole determinant then the mayjune price spread would be about 5 to 6 cents per bushel instead th kcbot and cbot oldcropnewcrop prices spreads of 2 and 25 cents were less than the full carrying charges for the twomonth time period separating the may and july contracts suggesting relatively tight supply conditions however the market conditions for hrw and srw wheat appeared to be significantly less tight th an for hrs which had an inverted basis of 4 cents this example demonstrates how protein premiums plus differences in old cropnewcrop supplies can cause market prices to vary across both time and location local elevator price bids base d off of futures market contracts can be expected to follow similar pattern of price differentials usda market

offset to feedlot use and feed demand seed use seed demand is directly related to plantings and will therefore move up or down with changes in the pr ojections for crop area planted however seed use

outlook reports provide data on seed use for various but not all crops food and industrial use projections of food nd industrial use tend to be fairly stable and therefore more predictable than f eed

only very small portion of the final cost of most processed products whether it be food product such as loaf of bread box of breakfast cereal or jar of baby food or an indus trial product such as soap or paint as result changes in this demand category are rarely unexp ected and rarely produce unexpected market price movements basic data for industrial use comes from the census bureaus survey of

overview of commodity markets macroeconomic linkages to commodity markets longrun commodity demand is driven in large part by population and income dynamics countrys demo graphic makeup by age and ethnicity may play large role in determining food needs and pref erences however demographic changes generally occur slowly and in accordance with wellknow behavioral patterns similarly percapita income growth usua lly trends upward or downward gradually and predictably with the nati onal economy as result shortterm price movements are rarely driven by either of these phenomena however an important exception is the 1997 asian financial crisis which dram atically and quite suddenly curtailed commodity import demand in several major agricultural importing countries of east and southeast asia47 the 1997 asian crisis contributed significantly to the price declines in most international co mmodity markets of the late 1990s changes in currency exchange rates between trading nations can occur more suddenly and can have significant effects on international trade and prices for an exporting country devaluation of its curre ncy against other exporting countries has the same effect as lowering of its export price against those competitor nations thereby making its product more competitive in contrast for an importing country devaluation of its currency against the currency of exporting nations will make products from those exporters more expens ive thereby lowering its import demand currency appreciation will have the opposite effect currency exchange rate fluctuations and their economic impli cations are not unique to agricultural commodities but affect all goods nd services traded between nations48 special considerations fo r agricultural markets in general

when the physical goods are delivered 51 tomek and robinson agricultural product prices 4th ed cornell university press 2003cornell university pp 2528are the prices of most nonfarm goods and services49 three such noteworthy characteristics of agricultural crops include the seasonality of production the derived nature of their demand and generally priceinelastic demand and supply functions seasonality most agricultural crops grown in temperatezone countries like the united states where freezing winters limit crop production to 6 to 9month period the growing period is shorter at higher latitudes ve strong seasonal production patterns as result the biol ogical nature of crop production plays an important role in agricultu ral product price behavior in particular the production of springpla nted crops has lag in its response to market signals producers must make their planting decisions by early spring in order to purchase the seed and other inputs n eeded for production however producers do not receive price for their production until after the harvest when ownership of the physical commodity is transferred50 as result growers planting decisions are based partly on their expectations about fu ture yields prices of both outputs and the inputs needed to produce those outputs nd government progra m support rates for alternative production ac tivities also expectations c oncerning international market conditions and the possibility for unexpected changes in the trade outlook are often relevant for most major us field crops regions agronomic conditions such as weather and soil type s may influence the viability of producing particular crop or undertaking livestock activity however expectations of market conditions such as harvesttime output prices influence the final choices as result changes in the expected supply and demand of crops or other activities that compet for land or of other food sources that compete for demand can ripple through the va rious agricultural markets thus altering prices furthermore since the end resu lt of plantingtime production decision does not materialize until several months later at harvest time it is possible that market conditions will have changed substantially or that producers actual production may be very different from the planned pro duction due to unexpected variations in weather pests diseases or other circumstances derived nature of many agricultural product prices demand for agricultural products originates with consumers who use the various food and industrial products that are produced fro m raw or unprocessed farm commodities such as grains oilseeds and fiber at the consumer level such final demand is referred to as primary demand the term derived demand refers to demand for inputs that are used to produce the final products51 for example corn and other feedstuffs are important inputs in the liv estock industry wheat is used to make various bakery products and cotton is used in the production of textiles thus the demand for corn wheat and cotton is deri ved from the demand for their various endhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs23 products similarly the demand for so ybeans is derived from the demand for soybean meal and soybean oil the major products obtained from crushing soybeans diner at restaurant may be seeking particular flavor or texture in her steak which resonates back through the supply chai n to the feeding decisions made at the ranch or feedlot where cattle are fattened and readied for market as result the potential buyers of raw agricultural commodities are generally seeking particular enduse characteristic for example livestock feeder is generally trying to obtain the leastcost set of feed ingredients that yield particular balance of protein energy fiber and other nutrient components baker or miller might be looking for particular baking or milling qualities in their wheat purchases it is possible for the overall supply of generic commodity to be in abundant supply while specific vari ety of that commodity possessing the desired enduse traits may be in short supply as resu lt substantial price premiums and discounts may develop based on the commodities enduse characteristics this occurs frequently in the wheat market where the different wheat varie ties have very unique baking and milling characteristics but it is also not uncommon in other grain and oilseed markets eg rice based on grain length corn based on color and oil or starch content soybean based on protein or oil content barley based on malting quality etc priceinelastic demand and supply in general the demand and supply of farm products par ticularly basic grains and oilseed s are relatively priceinelastic ie quantities demande d and supplied change proportiona lly less than prices this implies that even small changes in supply can result in large price movements as result unexpected market news can produce potentially large swings in farm prices and incomes this price dynamic has long been characteristic of the agricultural sector and farm policy concern the supply elasticity of an agricultural commodity reflects the speed with which new supplies become available or supplies available in the marketplace decline in response to price rise fall in particul ar market since most grains are limited to single annual harvest new supply flows to market in response to postharvest price change must come from either domestic stocks or international sources as result shortterm supply response to pr ice rise can be very limited during periods of low stock holdings but in the longer run expanded acreage and more intensive cultivation practices can work to increase supplies on the other nd when prices fall producers might be inclined to withhold their commodity from the market the cost of storage the length of time before any expected price rebound the anticipated st rength of price rebound and producers current cashflow situation combine to determine if storage is viable alternative if return to higher prices is not expected in the near future storage may not be viable and continued ma rketings may add to dow nward price pressure similarly demand elasticity reflects consumers ability andor willingness to alter consumption when prices for the desi red commodity rises or falls consumers consider both ownprice and crossprice movements of complementary and substitutehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs24 52 for this and other farm to retail commodity price comparisons see the usda ers briefing room food marketing and price spreads farmtoretail price spreads at httpwwwersusdagovbriefingfoodpricespreadsspreadstable1ahtm products in making their expenditure deci sions willingness to substitute another commodity when prices rise depends on veral factors including the number and availability of substitutes the importance of the commodity as measured by its share of consumers budgetary expenditures and the strength of consumers tastes and preferences since the farm cost of basic grains generally amounts to very small share of the retail cost of consumer food products changes in grain prices generally have little impact on retail food prices and therefore little impact on consumer behavior and corresponding farmlevel mand for example grain is estimated to account for only 5 share of the reta il price of onepound loaf of bread52 20 rise in wheat prices would tr anslate into only about 1 ri in the price of loaf of bread few consumers would notice 2cent increase in the price of 2 loaf of bread figure 4 displays examples of both inel astic and elastic supply and demand curves the diagram on the lefthand side of figure 4 shows fairly price unresponsive ie inelastic demand and suppl curves typical of those associated with most seasonal agricultural markets sudden outward shift ie expansion in demand from d1 to d2 moves the market equilibrium outward along the supply curve s this change in market equilibrium results in only modest percentage change in the quantity supplied to the market qq compared with much larger percentage increase in prices pp similar large price change is obtained from sudden shortfall in supplies represented by left ward movement of the supply curve in figure 4 price changes due to supply shift are larger than quantity changes under inelastic demand curveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs25 53 for more information on wheat markets see usda ers wheat briefing room available at httpwwwersusdagovbriefingwheatcontrast greater than expect ed supply represented by rightward shift of the supply curve s would lead to large drop in the market price ignoring the effects of government programs the diagram on the righthand side of figure 4 displays more responsive ie more elastic demand and supply curves typical of those associated with many highervalued nonagricultural markets for comparative purposes assume the same sudden outward shift in demand from d1 to d2 moves the market equilibrium outward along the supply curve s here however the change in market equilibrium results in much larger percentage chan ge in the quantity supplied to the market qq compared with smaller percentage increase in prices pp increasing demand for grains and oilseeds by the industrial processing sector whether from food or biofuels processing industries or from expanding industrial hog and poultry operations further reinforces th general price inelasticity of demand for many agricultural commodities industrial us of grains is generally less sensitive to price change since as with retail food pr ices the price of the agricultural commodity usually represents only small share of overall production costs of the finished product furthermore indus trial users have ge nerally made trem endous investments in plant equipment and machinery and must continue to operate at some minimal level of capacity yearround as return on that investment in contrast feed demand for grain and protein meals particularly for cattle feeding in the southern and central plains states is far more sensitive to relative feed grain prices since similar feed energy values may be obtained from variety of grains cattle feeders in these regions have considerable leeway to vary the shares of different grains in their feed rations as relative prices change in general inelastic demand and s upply responsiveness characterizes most agricultural products however distinct differences in the level and pattern of responsiveness do exist across commodities some of these differences are briefly introduced below wheat background wheat is grown in almost every temperatezone country of north america europe asia and sout h america the largest wheat producing countries are china india the united st ates russia canada and australia us wheat production accounts for about 910 of world production but the united states is the worlds leading wheat expor ter with roughly 25

additional factors ch as transportation costs competitors supplies and foreign demand into play in determining the price of particular wheat type and quality wheat is the principal food grain grown in

and hrs wheat rely more than other wheat classes on sales into export markets the larger the share of exports to production the greater the vulnera bility to international market forces in the us domestic market flour millers are the major users of wheat accounting for over 70 of primary domes tic wheat processing in 2000 and 200154 in most cases wheat buyer at flour mill will source wheat by general location and primary quality attributes such as protein quantity and quality ie gluten share and baking performance price pre miums andor disc ounts reflecting quality differences often develop and can also in fluence buyer preferences other major wheat processors include breakfast food pet food and feed manufacturers wheat may be used directly in feed rations when alternate feedstuffs are lacking or when productionrelated quality damage makes the wheat unmarketable as food wheat milling byproducts such as bran shorts and middlings are also used by feed manufacturers in the pr oduction of animal feeds55 key market factors several factors that are somewhat unique to the wheat market suggest that the us wheat mark et structure has greater supply and demand elasticity than most other field crops in other words wheat supply and demand appear to respond faster than the supply nd demand of other grains when confronted with some external shocks such as cr op failure in competing exporter country or financial crisis in major purchasing country thus wheat prices are generally subject to less dramatic price sw ings than most other grains56 these characteristics include the confluen ce of food and feed markets seasonal differences between us winter and spri ng production seasonal differences betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs27 northern and southern hemisphere crops large number of foreign export competitors and us government food ai d programs which rely heavily on wheat first the feed potential of wheat can dampen wheat price variability either preventing prices from falling too low by introducing an additi onal source of demand or by shutting off that same demand source when prices rise too high relative to other feed grains for example if wheat prices fall too low wheat begins to compete with traditional feed grains eg barley sorghum oats and corn particularly in the southern and northern plai ns states where local feed grain production is frequently insufficient on the other hand as wheat prices rise above certain threshold in relation to feed grains livestock feeders are quick to reduce the share of wheat in their feed rations thus removing demand pressure underlying the wheat price rise second us wheat production is marked by two independent seasons winter and spring with planting periods nearly six m onths apart if it is apparent that winter wheat acreage is substantially below market expectations due to prevented plantings or that expected yields have suffered due to unusual winter weather during the octobermarch period some of the poten tial production losses can be offset by increased spring wheat plantings given the correct price signals relative to other crops spring wheat can crowd out other springplanted crops that compete for the same acreage eg barley sorghum sunflo wers soybeans or corn or fallow acreage rotated out of production to rebu ild soil moisture can be prematurely brought back into production in the sp ring provided prices are attractive third two of the uss major wheat export competitors australia and argentina are in the southern hemisphe re where their production runs on cycle that is offset by about six months from th us cycle as result argentina and australia have the opportunity to expand pl anted wheat acreage in response to supply and demand circumstances in the united states within the same marketing year dampening the potential yeartoyear variability of prices in the us and international market while this potentia l additional supply limits price rises it may deepen price declines because high storage costs nd limited storage capacity in those countries frequently push their surplus production into international markets even when prices are low fourth the potential for surplus producti on to enter agricultural markets from several competing wheat exporter nations principally canada argentina australia the eu and the black sea region incr eases the supply responsiveness of wheat beyond that of other major grains for ex ample us corn generally faces direct export competition from only two countries argentina and china fifth most government export programs have been directed at wheat and have dampened price variability in much the same manner as feed demand they introduce an additional source of demand that offsets price declines because export programs are funded to deliver fixed value of commodities the volume of us program grain exports rises during periods of excess supply and lower prices but falls when supplies are tighter and prices higher in summary the price sensitivity of wheat feeding and government export programs coupled with the opportunity for us spring wheat growers and southernhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs28 57 for

corn background like wheat corn is grown in almost every temperatezone country of north america europe asia nd south america however global corn production is less well distributed than wheat and only few countries tend to dominate production and trade in corn th ree countries the united states china and brazil account for twothirds of wo rld production the united states is the dominant corn exporter with twothirds share of world markets china and argentina account for another 20 share of world trade the ukraine brazil and the republic of south africa are incons istent exporters but have shown an increasing trend since 2000 this sma ll pool of potential exporters can make international corn prices vulnerable to weather disruption in one of the major exporter countries the us marketing year for corn runs from september 1 to august 3157 corn is the most widely produced feed grain in the united states accounting for more than 90 of total value and produc tion of feed grains other us feed grains include grain sorghum barley and oats around 80 million acres of land are planted every year to corn making it the single largest crop grown in united states majority of the us corn crop is grown in the traditional corn belt region encompassing swath of states running from ohio westward th rough indiana illinois iowa southern minnesota northern missour i and into the eastern dakotas and nebraska since 2000 about 58 on average of the us corn crop has been fed to livestock as primary energy source another 24 has been processed into multitude of food and industr ial products including starch sweeteners corn oil beverage and industrial alc ohol and fuel ethanol finally about 18 of us corn production has been exported in to international markets key market factors as feed grain corn must compete with broad range of feedstuffs including othe r coarse grains as well as feed wheat and in some cases lowpriced protein meals this makes feed grain markets particularly sensitive to relative prices among the various feed com ponents in the united states the other two major feed grains feed barley and grain sorghum have roughly 95 of the feed value of corn58 as result they are often priced against corn futures on the basis of their relative feed value because most us corn exports are destin ed to be used for livestock feed us corn exports are particularly vulnerable to the availability of alternate feed sources for example an early harvest freeze in late august in the canadian prairies has beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs29 59 for more information

wheat traditionally has been very competitive in east asian markets particularly south korea at the expense of us corn exports however the extent to which corn is crowded out of certain feed markets depends on the feeding operation involved some livestock species eg feeder cattle or dairy are better able to adjust to feed rations than others eg swine or poultry which are more corndependent factor of growing importance in us corn markets is the increasing use of corn for ethanol production this growth has been supported by several national and state programs59 an increase in the share of tota l demand attributed to industrial use could lead to greater price variability in the face of weatherdriven supply shortfalls in the 20052006 marketing year usda project s that 15 of us corn production or about 1575 million bushels will be used for ethanol production this compares with 4 share in 19901991 and 6 share in 200001 continued growth in corn based ethanol production wit hout concomitant growth in corn production will tend to support prices and possibly squeeze us corn out of pricesensitive feed and export markets60 rice background rice is the most important food staple for much of the worlds population particularly in as ia and parts of africa and the middle east rice is produced and consumed throughout the worl d in climates that range from temperate to tropical however asian rice producti on accounts for nearly 90 of global rice production with two countries china and india accounting for over half us rice production generally accounts for very small share less than 2 of world production however the united stat exports nearly half of its annual production as result the united stat is among the worlds leading rice exporting nations traditionally behind tha iland and vietnam india pakistan china and egypt are also important rice exporting nations in the united states the marketing year for rice runs from august 1 to july 3161 domestic production generally uses slightly more than half of the us crop every year us rice use falls into three major categories table rice us ed directly as food rice processed into other types of consumables such as snacks or

httpwwwersusdagovbriefingcottonkey market factors only small share estimated at about 6 of global rice production enters world markets as result the very limited amount of rice entering world markets 24 28 million metric tons annually relative to the large level of annual world consumption roughl 415 million metric tons makes the international rice market fa irly sensitive to an unexpect ed production shortfall in one of the major exporting or consuming countri particularly if the lost production must be made up by importing rice from the international marketplace in world markets there are two principal types of rice long grain indica and short grain japonica each with very specific cooking qualities and appearance consumers tend to have strict preferences for one or the other and rarely switch as result it is not uncommon for overall world rice supplies to be in surplus while supplies of one or the other type of rice may be in short supply relative to market demand the united states produces and exports both indica and japonica types of rice rice processing further differentiates rice products and markets rice quality is often associated with the degree of po lishing removing the hull and bran layers or whiteness of the grain and the percentage of whole versus broken grains both of these attributes are highly dependent on milling infrastructure market feature that the us rice industry has used to its advantage to compete in international markets parboiling rice process of steeping then precooking rough rice under pressure with its bran hull rice then removing the hull through abrasion results in product that is preferred by certain ma rkets eg saudi arabia the republic of south africa and nigeria cotton background cotton is the single most important textile fiber in the world accounting for over 40 of to tal world fiber production62 while some 80 countries from around the globe produce cotton the unite d states china and india together provide over half the worlds cotton bout onethird of nnual world production is traded in international markets the ited states while ranking second to china in production is the leading exporter acc ounting for over onethird of global trade in raw cotton the us marketing year for cotton runs from august 1 to july 31 the us textile industry has been in decline for the past decade as result domestic use of cotton has represented declining share of annual production and the us cotton sector has increasingly turned to international markets to sell its output since 20022003 slightly more than 60 of the us

randy schnepfresult local and international market conditions for these substitutes play role in us and international cotton price formation the phaseout of the multifiber arrangement mfa and other forces have been reshaping world textile and co tton markets in recent years63 the mfa and its predecessor agreements through their set of trade rules and import quotas directly influenced world textile and clothing trade patterns and indirectly influenced world cotton markets for nearly 50 years these agreements protected us and european union eu textile and clothing producers from imports but raised prices and reduced consumption in both us and eu markets the elimination of the mfa concl uded on december 31 2004 is helping reduce clothing prices in the united states and the eu and causing shift in industrial demand for cotton to china india and pakistan at the same time world cotton consumption has accelerated ong with economic growth since 1999 especially in developing asia where an emerging consumer society is driving increases in household consumption of clot hing and other cotton products in the long run income growth and technical chan ge are expected to have greater effect on world cotton consumption than the elimination of the mfa government programs such as step2 payments for domestic users and exports have also played an important role in facilitating both domestic consumption and exports of us cotton64 however following widely publicized ruling in 2004 upheld on appeal in 2005 against certain f eatures of the us cotton program in dispute settlement case brought by brazil at the world trade organization wto us government cotton programs are likely to be altered with important potential market consequences65 the administration has already announced changes to the us export credit guarantee program designed to accommodate the wto ruling and the us congress has proposed eliminating th step2 user payments in legislation that has passed both chambers hr 4241 s 1932 conference action is pending the effects of altering us export credit guarantees and the elimination of step2 user payments if enacted ar likely to reduce us cotton exports and by softening demand put downward pressure on domestic market prices in addition to the wto case intense inte rnational pressure has been brought to bear upon cotton subsidies in general and us cotton subsidies in particular at the ongoing doha round of wto trade negotiations it remains to be seen if these pressures will elicit further changes to the us cotton program the market

aid programs available at httpwwwfasusdagovfoodaidaspthe oilseed complex background the demand for oilseeds is derived primarily from the demand for edible oils and protein meals the international oilseed market consists of large variety of oilbearing crops produced thr oughout the world including temperatezone crops such as canola rapeseed and sunf lowerseed tropicalzone crops such as palm kernel and coconut copra and multizone crops such as soybeans cottonseed and peanuts most of these crops when crus hed for their oil also yield highprotein meals that are widely used in livestock and poultry rations as result most of them are relatively close substitutes and their prices are strongly correlated processed soybeans are the largest source of protein feed and vegetable oil in the world unlike many other commodity markets only few countries tend to dominate soybean production and trade ma king the market sensitive to any supply disruption in one of the major producing nations major soybean producers include the united states brazil china and arge ntina which combined have accounted for nearly 90 of global pr oduction since 2000 three countries united states brazil and argentina dominate world soybean trade accounting for about 92 of soybean exports since 2000 while two countries the eu and china have accounted for nearly twothirds of world imports the us marketing year begins on ptember 1 for soybeans and on october 1 for soybean meal and soybean oil66 soybeans equal about 90 of us total oilseed production while other oilseeds such as cottonseed sunflowerseed rapeseed canola and peanuts account for the remai nder the united states is the worlds leading soybean producer and exporter soybean and soybean product exports accounted for 43 of us soybean production in 2003 in the united states soybean oil accounts for about twothirds of all the vegetable oils and animal fats consumed similarly soybean meal is the dominant protein meal consumed in the united states us vegetable oil exports are heavily influenced by concessional food aid to developing nations thr ough such programs as pl 48067 soybean meal is the worlds most impor tant protein feed accounting for nearly 65 of world supplies livestock feeds account for 98 of soybean meal consumption similarly soybean oil is th worlds largest source of vegetable oil an important market development of the past decade has been the phenomenal growth of soybean output and exports by brazil and argentina together they currently account for about half of the world soybean export market up from less than 15 before 1980 they have each surp assed the united states in soybean meal and soybean oil exports vast untapped re serves of farmland in brazils interior region could permit conti nued significant expansion in soybean area production and exportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs33 the tropicallyproduced palm oil accounts for an important and growing share of global vegetable oil production us da projects 30 share in 2005 and vegetable oil trade projected 58 shar in 2005 malaysia and indonesia are the worlds leading palm oil producers nd exporters indonesia still possesses substantial untapped territory for further ex pansion of palm oil plantations the rapid growth in southeast asian palmoil output means it will likely surpass soybean oils top ranking within few years key market factors because of their primary processed products protein meal and vegetable oil oilseeds are affected by market conditions in both the feed grain and edible oil sectors of us nd international markets foreign import demand for whole oilseeds depends on th deficit between countries domestic oilseed output and its consumption dive rgent requirements for protein meal and vegetable oil as well as limits on domestic processing capacity determine the ratio of oilseeds to oilseed products that country will import some oilseeds have higher oil content than others and some oilseeds yield higher protein content meal with less fiber making them more easily digestible for example unit of soybean when crushe d will yield on the average about 1819 oil and 7480 meal with about 44 prot ein content soybean meal is the most valuable component obtained from proce ssing the soybean ranging from 5075 of its value depending on relative prices of soybean oil and meal as result an importer must weight the relative prices fo r vegetable oils and protein meals against the oil and meal yields for each type of oilseed as well as the protein and fiber content of the resultant meal another c onsideration is fiber content highfiber meals are better suited for ruminants eg feeder cattle and dairy than for non ruminants eg swine and poultry for soybean crushers the processing decision involves choosing when to commit to buying soybeans eg from farmers to processing them and to selling soybean meal and oil eg to food and feed manufacturers the main decision variable in making binding commitments on future dates to sellers and buyers is the gross soybean processing margin this margin equals the perbushel revenue of soybeans processed into oil and meal minus the perbushel soybean price if the gross soybeanprocessing margin is high enough processor will commit soybean processing resources for that date if it is too low the processor keeps the processing resources available for future date and higher margin compared with trade in other agricultural commodities trade in whole oilseeds particularly soybeans is relatively unrestr icted by tariffs and other border measures but oilseed meals and particularly vegetable oils typically have higher tariffs successful completion of the ongoing d oha round of multilatera l trade negotiations could reduce import tariffs and quantitative restrictions to global oilseed product markets offering increased growth in demand an important demandside market development has been the rapid growth of chinas and indias economie s which has spurred their domestic food consumption china is now the worlds leading soybean importer and both china and india are among the worlds largest vegetable oil importers the eu is selfsufficient in vegetable oil production but its protein ficit still makes it the worlds largesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33204crs34 importer of soybean meal and secondlarg est
