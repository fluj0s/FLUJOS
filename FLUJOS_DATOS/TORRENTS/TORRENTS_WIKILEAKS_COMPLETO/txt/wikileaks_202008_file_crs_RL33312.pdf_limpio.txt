president the authority to block proposed or pending foreign acquisitions of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united statesthat threaten to impair the national security this provision came under intense scrutiny with the proposed ac quisitions in 2006 of major operations in six major us ports by dubai ports worl d and of unocal by the china national offshore oil corporation cnooc the debate that followe d reignited long standing differences among members of congress and between the congress and the administration over the role foreign acquisitions play in us national security the public debate underscored the differences between us po licy which is to actively promote internationally the national treatment of foreign firms and the concerns of some over the way this policy applies to companies that are owned by foreign governments that have unlimite d access to the nations industr ial base much of this debate focuses on the activities of relatively obscure committee the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius and the exonflorio provision which gives the president broad powers to bl ock certain types of foreign investment in the first session of the

greater oversight by congress and increased reporting by the committee on its decisions in addition pl 11049 ostensibly broadens the definition of national security and requires greater scrutiny by the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius of certain types of foreign direct investments the law demonstrates the concern that some members have with the way in which the exonflorio provision is being administered they also are concerned with the perceived lack of transparency in the reviews that are mandated under the exonflorio provision that some members belie ve

have pl 11049 address six perceived problems with the current statutes that members had identified 1 the principal members of the interagency committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius at times seemed not to be well informed concerning the outcomes of reviews and investigations regarding proposed or pending investment transactions 2 cfius had interpreted in correctly the requirements under current statutes for investigations of transactions that involv firms that are owned or controlled by foreign government 3 reporting requirements under current statutes had not provided congress with enough informa tion about the operations and actions of cfius for members to fulfill their oversight responsibilities 4 cfius had exercised too much discretion in choosing which trans actions it investigated 5 the definition of national security used by cfius was longer adequate in postseptember 11th world and 6 deadlines placed on cfius to complete reviews and investigations of investment transactions di d not provide adequate time in some instances for the committee to complete its reviews and investigations the exonflorio provision in 1988 amid concerns over foreign acquis ition of certain types of us firms particularly by japanese firms congre ss passed and president reagan signed the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 19885 the exonflorio provision which was included as section 5021 of that act fundamentally transformed cfius this statute grants the president the aut hority to block proposed or pending foreign mergers acquisitions or takeovers of p ersons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that threaten to impair the national security congress directed however that before this authority can be invoked the president must conclude that other us laws are inadequa or inappropriate to protect the national security and that he must have credible evidence th at the foreign investment will impair the national security this same sta ndard was maintained in pl 11049 part of congresss motiva tion in adopting the exonfl orio provision apparently arose from concerns that foreign takeovers of us firms could not be stopped unless the president declared national emergenc or regulators i nvoked federal antitrust environmental or secur ities laws through the ex onflorio provision congress attempted to strengthen the presidents hand in conducting foreign investment policy while limiting its own role as means of emphasizing that as much as possible the commercial nature of i nvestment transactions should be free from political considerations congress so attempted to balance p ublic concerns about the economic impact of certain types of foreign investment with the nations long standing international commitment to maintaining an environment that is open and receptive to foreign investment furthermore congress did not intend to have the exonflor io provision alter the generally open foreign inve stment climate of the count ry or to have it inhibit foreign direct investments in industries that could not be c onsidered to be of national security interest at the time some analysts believed the provision could

transactions but operates under the authority of the president and reflects his attitudes and policies as result the discretion cfius uses to review and to investigate foreign investment cases re flects policy guidance from the president foreign investors are also constrained by legislation that bars foreign direct investment in such industr ies as maritime aircraft ba nking resources and power6 generally these sectors were closed to fore ign investors prior to passage of the exon florio provision in order to prevent public services and public interest activities from falling under foreign control primar ily for national defense purposes during consideration of the exonflorio proposal debate focused on three issues that generated clash of views what constitutes foreign control of us firm b how should national security be fined and c whic h types of economic activities should be targeted for cfius review of these issues the most controversial and the most farreaching wa s the lack of definition of national security as originally drafted the pr ovision would have considered investments which affected the national security and essential commerce of the united states the term essential commerce was the focus of intense debate between the congress and the administration the treasury department headed by secretary james baker objected to the exonflorio provision and the administra tion vetoed the first version of the omnibus trade legislation in part due to its objections to the language in the measure regarding national security and essential commerce the reagan administration argued that the language would broaden the finition of national security beyond the traditional concept of militarydefense to one which included strong economic component administration witnesses argued against this aspect of the proposal and eventually succeeded in prodding congress to remove the term essential commerce from the measure and in narrowing substantially the factors the president must consider in his determination according to one participant congress placed the exonflorio provision in the statutes under title vii of the defense production act to indicate that the provisi on should be interpreted as dealing with the broad industrial base issu addressed by that statut not the more narrow national security controls dealt with in export control measures7 through executive order 12661 president reagan implemented provisions of the omnibus trade act in the executive order president reagan delegated his authority to administer the exonflorio provision to cfius8 particularly to conduct reviews to undertake investigations nd to make recommenda tions although the statute itself does not specifically mention cfius as result of president reagans action cfius was

mergers acquis itions and takeovers by foreign persons 31 cfr part 800 10 31 cfr 800 discussion of final rulemandate and significant authority to advise the president on foreign investment transactions and to recommend that some transactions be blocked treasury department regulations after extensive public comment the treasury department issued its final regulations in november 1991 imple menting the exonflorio provision9 although these procedures were ame nded through pl 11049 they continue to serve as the basis for the exonflorio review and inve stigation these regulations created an essentially voluntary system of notification by the partie s to an acquisition and they allowed for notices of acquisitions by agencies that are members of cfius despite the voluntary nature of the notification firms largely comply with the provision because the regulations stipul ate that foreign acquisitions that are governed by the exonflorio review process that do not notify the committee remain subject indefinitely to divestment or other appropriate actions by the president the regulations make it clear that the president alone determines whether transaction threatens national security also the regulations state that the exonflorio provision will not be interpreted narrowly in way that might preclude the ability of cfius to review any transaction for its impact on national security treasury department however as the lead agency i ndicated in the regulations that it would judge transactions to have significant importance for national security if they involve products services and technologie s that are important to us national defense security requirements10 the regulations also indicate that notifications provided to the committee are considered to be confidential and the information is not released by the committee to the press or commented on publicly transactions not subject to review another aspect of the regulations that has come under increased scrutiny due to the sharp runup in investments through sove reign wealth funds swfs are the types of transactions that cfius generally will not subject to national security review according to treasury department regulations investment transactions that are not considered transactions under the exonfl orio provision and therefore not subject to cfius review are 1 an acquisition of voting securities pursu ant to stock split or pro rata stock dividend which does not involve change in control 2 an acquisition in which the parent of the entity making the acquisition is the same as the parent of the entity being acquired 3 an acquisition of convertible voting securities that does not involve controlhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33312crs6 11 31 cfr 800302 12 there are other statutes that

the acquisition of the shares to the securities and exchange commission for statistical purposes t he united states defines foreign direct investment as the ownership or control directly or indirectly

wh ich the foreign investor has intention of determining or directing the basic business decisions of the issuer in addition investments that are solely for investment purposes are defined as those 1 in which the transaction does not involve owning more than 10 of the voting securities of the firm or 2 thos investments that are undertaken directly by bank trust company insurance company investment company pension fund employee benefit plan mutual f und finance company or brokerage company in the ordinary course of business for its own account11 foreign investors representing swfs inve sted heavily in the mid to late 2007s in us financial institutions ranging from nasdaq to morgan stanley merrill lynch and citigroup as number of these financial institutions experienced drop in the value of assets associated with the subprime mortgage crisis in some cases the foreign investment has accounted for less than 10 of the voting securities of the firm and were classified as investments only for the purpos of investment apparently to avoid cfius revi ew or investigation control key factor in the exonflorio process is applying the term control to evaluating the role of foreign investor in any proposed transaction while the statute does not provide definition of th is term definition is included in the treasury departments regulations accord ing to those regulations control is not defined as numerical benchmark12 but instead focuses on functional definition of the term or definition that is govern ed by the influence the level of ownership permits the foreign entity to affect certain decisions by the firm according to the treasury department s regulations the term control means the power direct or indirect whethe r or not exercised and whether or not exercise d or exercisable through th ownership of majority or dominant minority of the total outsta nding voting securities of an issuer or by proxy voting contractual arrangements or other means to determine direct or decide matters affecting an entity in particular but without limitation to determine direct take reach or cause decisions regarding 1 the sale lease mortgage pledge or other transfer of any

department officials have indicated however that during review or investigation each member of cfius is expected to apply that defin ition of national security that is consistent with the representative agencys specific legislative mandate13 the concept of national security was broade ned by pl 11049 to include those issues relating to homeland security including its application to critical infrastructure and critical technologies the treasury department provides some guidance through its regulations to firms that are deciding wh ether they should notify cfius of proposed or pending merger acquisition or takeover the guid ance states that propos ed acquisitions that need to notify cfius are those that involve products or key t echnologies essential to the us defense industr ial base this notice is not intended for firms that produce goods or services with special re lation to national security especially toys and games food products hotel s and restaurants or gal services cfius has indicated that in order to assure an unimp eded inflow of foreign investment it would implement the statute only insofar as necessary to protect the national security and in manner fully consistent with the international obligations of the united states14 the byrd amendment in 1992 congress amended the exonflorio statute through section 837a of the national defense authorization act fo r fiscal year 1993 pl 102484 known as the byrd amendment after the am endments sponsor the provision requires cfius to investigate proposed mergers acquis itions or takeovers in cases where two

kirchgaessner stephanie us threat to reopen terms of lucent and alcatel deal continuedthis amendment came under intense scrutiny by the 109th congress as result of the dp world transaction many memb ers of congress and others believed that this amendment required cfius to undert ake full 45day investigation of the transaction because dp world was controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government the dp world acquisition however exposed sharp rift between what some members apparently believed the amendment directed cfius to do and how the members of cfius are interpretin g the amendment in particular some members of congress apparently interpreted the amendment to direct cfius to conduct mandatory 45day inve stigation if the foreign firm involved in transaction is owned or controlled by foreign gove rnment representa tives of cfius have argued that they interpret the amendment to mean that 45day investigation is discretionary and not mandato ry in the case of the dp world acquisition cfius representatives argued that they had concluded as result of an extensive review of the proposed acquisition prior to the case be ing formally filed w ith cfius and during the 30day review that the dp world case did not warrant full 45day investigation they conceded that the case met the first criterion under the byrd amendment because dp world was controlled by foreign government but that it did not meet the second part of the requirement becau cfius had concl uded during the 30day review that the transaction could not affect the national security16 the intense public and congressional r eaction that arose from the proposed dubai ports world acquisition spurred the bush administration in late 2006 to make an important administrative change in the way cfius reviews foreign investment transactions cfius and president bu sh approved the acquisition of lucent technologies inc by the frenchbas ed alcatel sa which was completed on december 1 2006 before the transacti on was approved by cfius however alcatellucent was required to agree to national security arrangement known as special security arrangement or ssa that restricts alcatel s access to sensitive work done by lucents research arm bell labs and the communications infrastructure in the united states the most controversial feature of this arrangement is that it allows cfius to reopen review of the deal and to overturn its approval at any time if cfius believes the companies materially fail to comply with the terms of the arrangement this marks significant change in the cfius pr ocess prior to this transaction cfius reviews and investigations d been portrayed and had been considered to be final as result firms were willing to subject themselves voluntarily to cfius review because they believed that once an investment transaction was scrutinized and approved by the members of cfius the firm s could be assured that the investment transaction would be exempt from any future reviews or actions this administrative change however means that cfius termination may l onger be final decision and it adds new leve l of uncertainty to foreign investors seeking to acquire us

july 26 2007 it is designated as pl 11049 on january 23 2008 president bush issued executive order 13456 implementing the law the executive order makes number of substantive changes to the law this report incorporates the changes made by this statute and by the executive order pl 11049 establishes cfius by statut ory authority and has the secretary of the treasury serve as the chairman of cfiu s the measure follows the same pattern that was set by executive order by llotting the committee 30 days to conduct review 45 days to conduct an investigati on and 15 days for the president to make his determination the presid ent retains his authority as the only officer with the authority to suspend or prohibit merger s acquisitions and takeovers and the measure places additional requirements on firms that resubmitted filing after previously withdrawing filing before full review could be completed over time the three step exonflorio process apparently has evolved to include an informal stage of unspecified length of time that consists of an unofficial cfius determination prior to the formal filing with cfius this type of informal review has developed because it likely serves the interests of both cfius and the firms that are involved in an investment transac tion according to treasury department officials this informal contact enables cfius staff to identify potential issues before the review process formally begins18 this informal process is likely to continue under the provisions of pl 11049 firms that are party to an investment transaction apparently have benefitted from this informal review in number of ways for one it allo wed firms additional time to work out any national security concerns privately with individual cfius members secondly and perhaps more im portantly it

cfius investigation as result of uncertainty in the market about prospects for the transaction the cfius review was instig ated by the fbi which had expressed concerns during the initial review stage that the majority interest of the japanese government in ntt could give it access to information regarding wiretaps that were being conducted on ema il and other webbased traffi c crossing verios computer system after completing its investiga tion however cfius did not recommend that president clinton block the transaction the potentially negative publicity that can be associated with cfius investigation of transac tion apparently has had ma jor impact on the transactions cfius has investigated since 1990 near ly half of the transactions cfius investigated were terminated by the fi rms involved because the firms decided to withdraw from the transactions rather than face negative determination by cfius in 2006 for instance the prospects of cfius investigation apparently was the major reason the israeli firm check point software technologies decided to call off its proposed 225 million acquisition of sour cefire us firm specializing in security appliances for protecting corpor ations internal computer networks in addition the decision by the china national offshore oil company cnooc to drop its proposed acquisition of unocal oil company in 2005 was pa rtly due to concerns by cnooc about an impending cfius investigation of the transaction for cfius members the informal process has been beneficial because it has given them as much time as they have fe lt was necessary to review transaction without facing the time constraints that ar ise under the formal cfius review process this informal review likely has also given the cfius members added time to negotiate with the firms involved in tran saction to restructure the transaction in ways that have addressed any potential secu rity concerns or to develop other types of conditions that members feel are appropriate in order to remove security concerns on january 23 2008 president bush issued executive order 13456 which implemented pl 11049 and made various changes to the law presently the committee consists of nine

as any merger acquisition or takeover which results in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states as previously indicated the treasury departments regula tions exclude certain types of transactions from being classified as covered trans actions and therefore not subject to cfius review such transaction are specified as those that are undertak solely for the

would have debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters24 this broad definition is enhanced to so degree by other

telecommunications energy fina ncial services water transportation sectors25 and the cyber and physical infrastructure services critical to maintaining the national defense continuity of government economic prosperity and quality of life in the united states26 the following year congress adopted the language in the patriot act on critical infrastructure into the homeland security act of 200227 by adopting the terms critical infrastructure and homeland security following the events of september 11 2001 congress demonstrated that the attacks had fundamentally alte red the way many in congress

therefore should be protected from fore ign investment that transfers control to foreigners or shifts technological leader ship aborad this viewpoint however has not been shared by some policymakers w

or controlled by foreign governments as result of the terrorist attacks the dubai ports world case in particular demonstrated that there was difference between the postseptember 11 expectations held by many in congress about the role of foreign investment in the economy and of economic infrastructure issues as component of national security for some members of congress cfius s eems to be out of touch with the posthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33312crs14 september 11 2001 view of national security because it remains founded in the late 1980s orientation of the exonflorio provision which views national security primarily in terms of national defense and downplays or even excludes broader notion of economic national security procedures according to the amended exonflorio provision the president or any member of cfius can initiate review of an investment transaction in addition to review that is initiated by the parties to tran saction providing formal notification as amended cfius has 30 days to review transaction to decide after it receives the initial formal notification by the partie s to merger acquisition or takeover whether to investigate case as result of its determination that the investment threatens to impair the national security of the united states national security also includes those issues relating to homela nd security including its application to critical infrastructure and critical technol ogies in addition cfius is required to conduct an investigation of transac tion if the committee determines that the transaction would result in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states during such review the members of cfius are also required to consider the twelve factor s that congress has authored as basis for assessing the impact of the investment if during this 30 day period all of the members of cfius conclude that the investment does not threaten to impair the national security the review is terminated if however at least one member of the committee determines that the investment does threaten to impair the national security cfius can proceed to 45day investigation during the 30day review stage the di rector of national intelligence although not member of cfius is required to ca rry out thorough analysis of any threat to the national security of the united stat of any merger acquisition or takeover this analysis is required to be completed within 20 days of the receipt of notification by cfius but the statute dir ects that the dni must be given adequate time presumably if this national security review cannot be completed with the 20 day requirement this analysis would in clude request for information from the department of the treasurys director of the office of foreign assets control and the director of the financial crimes enfo rcement network in addition the director of national intelligence is required to seek and to incorporate the views of all affected or appropriate intelligence agencies cfius is also required to review covered investment transactions in which the foreign entity is owned or controlled by foreign government but the law provides an exception to this requirement review is exempted if the secretary of the treasury and certain other specified officials determine that the transaction in question will not impair the national security it is somewhat unclear however how this requirement is meshing with the established process the measure does not amend or alter the current statute in the area that has been the source of differences between cfius and congress in particular the current statute states that the president and through him cfius can use the exonflorio process only if he finds that there is credible evidence that foreign investment will impair national security as result if cfius determines as was the case in the dubai ports transaction that it does not ve credible evidence that an investment will impair thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33312crs15 national security then it argues that it is not required to undertake full 45day investigation even if the foreign entity is owned or controlled by foreign government as result of cfius review the president acting through cfius is also required to conduct national security investigation and to take any necessary actions as part of the 45day investigation if the review indicates that at least one of three conditions exists these three conditions are 1 as result of review of the transaction cfius determines that the tran sactions threaten to impair the national security of the united states and that the threat had not been mitigated during or prior to review of the transaction or 2 the foreign person is controlled by foreign government 3 the transactions woul d result in the control of any critical infrastructure by foreign person the trans actions could impair the national security and that such impairment had not been mitigated at the conclusion of the investigation or the 45da review period whichever comes first the committee can decide to offer recommendation or it can recommend that the president suspend or prohibit the investment the presid ent is under obligation to follow the recommendation of the committee to suspend or prohibit an investment during review or an investigation cf ius and designated lead agency have the authority to negotiate impose or force any agreement or condition with the parties to transaction in order to mitigate any threat to the national security of the united states such agreements are to be based on riskbased analysis of the threat posed by the transaction also if notification of transaction is withdrawn before any review or investigation by cfius can be completed the amended law grants the committee the authority to take number of actions in particular the committee could develop 1 in terim protections to addr ess specific concerns about the transaction pending resubmission of notice by the parties 2 specific time frames for resubmitting the notice and 3 process for tracking any actions taken by any parties to the transaction factors for consideration the exonflorio provision includes list of twelve factors the president must consider in deciding to block foreign ac quisition these factor s are also considered by the individual members of cfius as part of their own review process to determine if particular transaction threatens to imp air the national security this list includes the following elements 1 domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements 2 the capability and capacity of domestic industries to meet national defense requirements including the availability of human resources products technology materials and other supplies and services 3 the control of domestic industries nd commercial activity by foreign citizens as it affects the capability and capacity of the us to meet the requirements of national securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33312crs16 30 the last requirement under factor 4 nd factors 612 were added by pl 11049 4 the potential effects of the transactions on the sales of military goods equipment or technology to country that supports terrorism or proliferates missile technology or chemical and biological weapons and transactions identified by the secretary of defense as posing regional military threat to the interests of the united states 5 the potential effects of the transaction on us technological leadership in areas affecting us national security 6 whether the transaction has security related impact on critical infrastructure in the united states 7 the potential effects on united states critical infrastructure including major energy assets 8 the potential effects on united states critical technologies9 whether the transaction is foreign governmentcontrolled transaction10 in those cases involving governmentcontrolled transaction review of the adherence

committee determine to be appropriate 30 factors 612 were added through pl11049 and pot entially broaden significantly the scope of cfius reviews and investigations previously cfius had been directed by treasury department re gulations to focus its activities primarily around investments that had an impact on us national defense security the additional factors however incorporat economic considerations into the exon florio process in way that was specifically rejected when the measure initially was adopted and refocuses cfius s reviews and investigations to consider the broader rubric of economic security in particul ar cfius is now required to consider the impact of an investment on critical infrastructure as factor for considering recommending that the president bloc k or postpone transaction critical infrastructure is defined in broad terms within the measure as any systems and assets whether physical or cyberbased so vital to the united states that the degradation or destruction of such systems or assets would have debilitating impact on national security including national ec onomic security and national public health or safety as originally drafted the

administrati on and various industry groups argued at the time that such business practices were deemed to be beneficial arrangements for us companies in addition they argued that any potential threat to national security could be addressed by th export administration act31 and the arms control export act32 confidentiality requirements the exonflorio provision also codified confidentiality requirements that are similar to those that appeared in executive order 11858 by stating that any information or documentary material filed under the provision may not be made public except as may be relevant to any administrative or judicial action or proceeding33 the provision does state however that this confidentiality provision shall not be construed to pr event disclosure to either house of congress or to any duly authorized committee or subcommittee of the congress the provision provides for the release of proprietary info rmation which can be associated with particular party to committees only with assurances that the information will remain confidential members of congress and their staff members will be accountable under current provisions of law governing the release of certain types of information the exonflorio provision requires the pres ident to provide written report to the secretary of the senate and the clerk of the house detailing his decision and his actions relevant to any transaction that was subject to 45day investigation34 mitigation and tracking following the implementation of the exonflorio provision in the 1980s cfius had developed seve ral informal practices that likely were not envisioned when the statute was drafted in particular members of cfius on occasion had negotiated conditions with firm s to mitigate or to remove business arrangement that raised national security concerns among the members of cfius such agreements often were informal arrangements that had an uncertain basis in statute and had not been tested in court these arrangements of ten were negotiated dur ing the formal 30day review period or even during an informal process prior to the formal filing of notice of an investment transaction presently cfius must designate lead agency to negotiate modify monitor and enforce agreements in order to mitigate any threat to national security such agreements are required to be based on riskbased analysis of the threat posed by the transaction cfius is also require d to develop method for evaluating the compliance of firms that have entered in to mitigation agreement or condition that was imposed as requirement for approva l of the investment transaction such measures however are required to be developed in such way that they allowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33312crs18 cfius to determine that compliance is ta king place without also 1 unnecessarily diverting cfius resources from assessing any new cove red transaction for which written notice had been filed and 2 placing unnecessary burdens

protections to addre ss specific concerns about th transaction pending re submission of notice by the parties 2 specific time frames for resubmitting the notice and 3 process for tracking any acti ons

the fo reign investment and national security act of 2007 members were concer ned about six issues 1 the seemingly lack of participation by principal member s of cfius 2 cfiu ss interpretation of requirements that it investigate transac tions involving firms that are owned or controlled by foreign government 3 re porting requirements that have not provided congress with enough information fo r members to fulfill their oversight responsibilities 4 the discretion cfius exer cises in choosing which transactions it investigates 5 cfiuss definition of na tional security and 6 cfiuss deadlines for completing reviews and investigations all of these issues were addressed to varying degrees in the law but it likely will take some time and experience with the new provisions for members to determine if the changes to the exonflorio process satisfy their concerns since congress passed pl 11049 cerns among the public and members of congress have risen sharply about firms that are controlled by foreign governments investing in economic activities that some judge to be detrimental to the nations homeland security and critical infrastructure although pl 11049 broadened the concept of na tional security to include homeland security and critical infrastructure it remains unclear how these concepts are being incorporated into the exonflorio process and if those who adminis ter the process have altered their views to reflect the broadened concep t of national security as it is specified in the statute at times members of congress and officials within the administration have been at odds over the way cfius has reviewed and approved of certain investments these differences reflect disparity in political and philo sophical viewpoints over the role of foreign investment in the economy and ove r the nature of the risks the investments pose to the national economic security the occasional sparring over foreign investment between congress and the administration reflect the fact that neither congress nor the administration has been able thus far to define clearly the national security implications of fore ign direct investment the dp world transaction revealed that the septem ber 11 2001 terrorist attacks may have fundamentally ltered the viewpoint of so members of congress regarding the role of foreign investment in the economy and over the impact of such investment on the national security framework if this assessment is correct then the change in attitude will require reassessment of the role of foreign investment in the economy and of the implications of corpor ate ownership of ac tivities that fall under the rubric of critical infrastructure in addition the dp world transaction focused attention on longunresolved i ssues concerning the role of foreign investment in the nations overall security framework and the methods that are being used to assess the impact of foreign investment on the nati ons defense industria l base and homeland security most economists agree that there is little economic evidence to conclude that foreign ownership whether by private tity or by an entity that is owned or controlled by foreign government has measurable impact on the us economy as whole others may argue on nonec onomic grounds that such firms pose risk to national security or to homeland security httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33312crs22 similar issues concerning corporate owne rship were raised during the late 1980s and early 1990s when foreign investment in the us economy increased rapidly there are little new data however to alter the c onclusion reached at that time that there is definitive way to assess the ec onomic impact of foreign ownership or of foreign investment on the economy though some observers have expressed concerns about foreign investors who are owned or controlled by foreign governments acquiring us firms there is little confirmed evidence that such distinction in corporate ownership has any measurable effect on the economy as whole for most economists the distinction between domestic and foreignowned firms whether the foreign firms are priv ately owned or controlled by foreign government is sufficiently small that they would argue that it does not warrant placing restrictions on the inflow of foreig n investment nevert heless foreign direct investment does entail various economic costs and benefits on the benefit side such investments bring added capital into the economy and potentially could add to productivity growth and innovation such investment also represents one repercussion of the us trade deficit th deficit transfers dollardenominated assets to foreign investors who then decide how to hold those assets by choosing among various investment vehicles including direct investment foreign investment also removes stream of monetary benefits from the economy in the form of repatriated capital and profits that reduces the tota l amount of capital in the economy such costs and benefits likely occur whether the foreign owner is private entity or foreign government
