the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 9 for the two partners reviewed reasonable ssurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accord ance with the subproject agreements 10 the audit certificates covering unhcr sub projects were available for coopi and unqualified audit opinions were expressed for cnr an adverse audit opinion was expressed on the 2002 accounts but they received an unqualified opinion on the 2003 accounts cooperazione internazionale 11 the controls over financial management wer assessed as deficient there was lack of segregation of duties as the same person was respon sible for all of the stages in the expenditure cycle from authorising and approving expenditure to recording payments in the books of account payment vouchers were not used and the doc umentation supporting expenditure was often inadequate proper procedures to track and ccount for operational cash advances were not established advances were not immediately recorded in the books of account and they were sometimes accumulatedcommingled with previous adva nces making their clearance and follow up difficult similarly salary advances were not p roperly accounted for and it was not evident that they were always recovered oios already raise d many of these issues after the 2001 audit but adequate action had not been taken as recommended by oios coopi agreed on the need to strengthen internal controls but disagreed on t he need to segregate duties as they were assigned to an expatriate staff member oios would highlight this as serious weakness in internal controls if unhcr continues to work with this partner then close and detailed project financial monitoring is required until the internal controls have been strengthened b commission nationale pour réfugiés 12 oios could not review the 2002 subproject s implemented by cnr with expenditure of some us 117000 as the cnr office had been looted and the relevant records and supporting documents had been lost an external audit carried out prior to the looting revealed serious shortcomings including the lack of adequate books of accounts weak internal controls 3 numerous discrepancies and lack of documentation to support the expenditure oios noted that the representation had taken appropriate steps to address the shortcomings and to recover unsupported payments totalling some us 18000 in addition new staff were hired in 2003 and new accounting software was installed oios as sessed that the internal controls in place were now satisfactory 13 oios noted that commitments of some us 5 000 were included in the final 2003 spmrs for unpaid salary taxes that had been outstan ding for several months oios highlighted that unsettled commitments should not have been cha rged as expenditure in the final spmr but also raised the concern that the delay of such paym ents could lead to penalties which could have otherwise been avoided the representation indicated that the outstanding 2 003 taxes have now been paid b other programme issues 14 oios assessed that project financial monit oring was generally adequate oios found however that the representation in bangui with reg ard to its responsibilities over the chad emergency had not dedicated the required number of staff with the appropriate skills necessary to cope with the size and nature of the emergency for example an associate protection officer was tasked the responsibility to set up the office and even though the officer had proven experience in administration and finance he was as signed these responsibilities consequently oios found that the internal controls were seriousl deficient the audit findings of the chad operation have already been reported by oios the representation explained that it was very difficult to monitor the chad operation from car g iven the lack of reliable flight connections the poor communication system and the bad security situation the representation also explained that an understanding was reached with th ert leader in ndjamena that close monitoring from bangui was not practical and that they would need to primarily rely on their own judgement to deal with the various operational issues they also pointed out that despite these difficulties technical assistance was provid ed in terms of staff sent on mission as often as needed it is oios view that if monitoring of the chad mergency operation from car was not practical or feasible the representation should ve promptly brought this to the attention of the bureau for africa c supply management procurement 15 local committee on contract was establis hed and the unhcr procurement procedures were generally adhered to except for few instances of noncompliance for example in april 2003 several vehicles were procu red locally at cost of us 120000 which was above the delegated procurement threshold of us 100000 without seeking the approval of the coc at headquarters also in july 2003 payment of some us 60000 was made to construction company for the renovation of the offi ce building but there was evidence that the contractor was selected competitively in vari ous other instances the documentation supporting the expenditure was found inadequate or lacking the representation stated they would observe the delegated threshold for procureme nt and comply with unhcr procurement procedures 4 b asset management 16 serious problems were identified in the ar ea of asset management assettrak was not operational and had never been implemented since th discontinuance of minder this was despite the fact that staff member had received f ormal assettrak training in neighbouring country records were maintained of the assets h eld by unhcr or partners the number and value appeared to be significant and included asset s such as trucks vehicles computers and high value telecommunication equipment physical inve ntory had been carried out and most of the assets had not been barcoded including those with implementing partners the representation indicated that physical inventory was being carried out and the assettrak system was being updated 17 in the absence of an asset database and in the absence of right of use agreements for assets held by implementing partners oios was conc erned that assets transferred in 2002 from former implementing partners to other partners migh t not have been fully accounted for further in march 2003 several vehicles computers and othe r valuable items were stolen or completely vandalised while gs45s were prepared for the sto len vehicles action had been taken for other lost equipment such as computers and printers the representation indicated that the relevant gs45s would be prepared shortly and submi tted to the hamb d security and safety 18 although unhcr was not fully moss complian t most of the security systems and procedures were in place staff members had comple ted the mandatory security training and were familiar with the contents of the security iss ues including the security plans and emergency procedures administration 19 in the areas of administration and finance ocm generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and trols were operating effectively during the period under review however certain internal cont rols needed to be strengthened 20 oios found that staff member obtained so lar payments totalling some us 3800 as well as dsa during his absence on mission from the special operations area which lasted about two months oios recommended that the overpa yment of solar be recovered the staff member has agreed to reimburse the overpayment of which us 2000 has already been repaid and the remaining balance of us 1200 woul d be refunded in august 2003 21 oios assessed that in 2003 budgetary cont rols were deficient and as result the representation spent some us 88000 over the autho rized budget and obligation level the representation explained that adequate budgetary co ntrols would be put in place to ensure that this does not reoccur in the future 22 significant account payables and receivabl aggregating to some us 41000 had been outstanding over an extended period with eviden ce that any action had been taken to clear them many of the receivables some us 22000 pe rtained to unsettled travel advances some of which related to staff still in car and for who m recovery should have been made one month after completion of the travel other staff members had left the country without submitting their 5 travel claims this needs to be followed up with th eir current duty stations the representation stated that action has now been taken to clear the outstanding accounts by the end of 2004 23 the representation did not fully comply wi th the provisions of the unhcr delegation of financial signing authority appropriate segreg ation of duties was not achieved and spending limits were not established for staff memb ers who exercised financial signing authority the representation indicated that the delegation of signing authority chart would be established shortly 24 the applicable rules and regulations for the private use of unhcr vehicles by staff members had not been adhered to certain staff had been using unhcr vehicles to commuting to and from their residence without reimbursing the costs associated with this logbooks were also not completed oios recommended that the repre sentation determine the amounts due by staff members and seek recoveries accordingly the
