internal revenue code irc most taxexempt organizations fall into one of five types the organizations described in irc 501c3 501c4 501 c5 501c6 and 527 this report was developed to answer frequently asked questions about the differences among these organizations how they are defined what they can and cannot do how they obtain exempt status and what kind of information they must disclose to the irs and the public as will be seen the same rules often apply to the four organizations described in irc 501c while different ones apply to 527 organizations for purposes of this report the term 501c organizations refers to the organizations described in irc 501c3 501c4 501c5 and 501c6 it should be noted that there are many other organizations described in irc 501c and that the rules described in this report do not necessarily apply to them g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g156g561 g11g20g5g561g535g561g347g342g343g507g140g508g507g345g508g561 the organizations described in irc 501c3 are commonly referred to as charitable organizations the section describes them as organized and operated exclusively for religious charitable scientific testing for public safety literary or educational purposes or to foster national or international amateur sports competition but only if part of its activities involve the provision of athletic facilities or equipment or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation and which does not participate in or intervene in including the publishing or distributing of statements any political ca mpaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office there are two types of 501c3 organizations public charities and private foundations in general public charities receive contributions from variety of sources while private foundations receive contributions from limited sources and are often controlled by their donors1 due to fear of abuse private foundations are subject to stricter regulation than public charities examples of 501c3 public charities include the red cross churches schools hospitals boy scouts girl scouts animal shelters and little league examples of private foundations include the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation the ford foundation the rockefeller brothers fund inc and the mars foundation an important limitation to note from the organizational definition is that 501c3 organizations may only engage in nonsubstantial amount of lobbying and are prohibited from engaging in political campaign activity none of the other exempt organizations discussed in this report are similarly limited this issue is discussed below in the disadvantages of taxexempt status section 1 irc 509 t httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30877g5g145g138g155g138g140g157g142g155g146g156g157g146g140 g156g561g152g143g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g146

organizations as civic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare or local associatio ns of employees the membership of which is limited to the employees of designated person or persons in particular municipality and the net earnings of which are devoted exclusivel to charitable educa tional or recreational purposes examples of 501c4 organizations include the national rifle association and the sierra club as can be seen from the organizational definitions in irc 501c3 and 501c4 these organizations have some overlapping characteristics both sections include organizations that operate for charitable purposes and are restricted in that earnings may be used to benefit private shareholders or individuals there are however two important differences between them first 501c3 organizations are eligible to receive taxdeductible contributions but 501c4 organizations are not see benefits of taxexempt status section below second 501c3 organizations are more limited in the amount and types of political activity they may do see disadvantages of taxexempt status section be low thus an organization that could qualify under either section will generally choose based on which is more important receiving tax deductible contributions or participating in political activity

and 501c6 are generally exempt from tax on their income however they are taxed on any income from unrelated business activities4 additionally 501c organizations particularly 501c3 organizations are subject to tax if they engage in certain activities taxable activities include making political expenditures participating in excess lobbying and political activities and engaging in excess personal benefit transactions ie transactions where insiders realize unwarranted benefits from their relationship with the organization 5 527 political organizations are exempt from income tax to the extent that they only have exempt function income and engage in exempt function activities exempt function income is income from such sources as contributions membership dues and political fundraising the funds must be segregated to be used for an exempt function 527 organizations are taxed if they have income derived from other sources eg investment income or if they spend money on non exempt function activities the exemptions under irc 501 and 527 do not extend to employment taxes thus if they have employees exempt organizations generally pa the usual employer share of taxes for social security

discussed in this report only 501c3 organizations are eligible to receive taxdeductible charitable contributions 8 the irs determines whether an organization is eligible to receive deductible contributions at the time it considers the organizations application for 501c3 status list of the 501c3 organizations eligible to receive deductible contributions is found in irs publication 78 cumulative list of organizations described in section 170c of the internal revenue code of 1986 this publication is available on the irs website at httpwwwirsgov charitable contributions to 501c3 organizations are not deductible if the organization provides goods or services in exchange for the contribution if the contribution exceeds the fair market value of the goods or services then the amount of the excess may be deductible when an organization receives more than 75 in exchange for goods or services the organization must tell the donor how much of the contribution if any is taxdeductible 9 generally there are particular requirements placed on contributors to 501c3 organizations however if contributor wants to take tax deduction for contribution of 250 or more then he or she needs to obtain contemporaneous written acknowledgment of the contribution from the organization 10 the acknowledgment should include description of the contribution good faith estimate of the value of any property contributed and statement about whether anything was given in return in addition the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 imposes new requirement that any cash donation be substantiated by bank record or written communication from the organization showing its name and the date and amount of the contribution contributors also are subject to limitations on the amount that may be deducted the deduction may not exceed percentage of the taxpayers income only individuals who itemize deductions may take the deduction and higherincome taxpayers are further restricted in the amount that may be deducted 11 when contribution is not deductible as charitable contribution the organization must notify the potential contributor of that fact at the time of solicitation12 there is an exception for organizations with annual gross receipts of less than 100000 if this exception does not apply then fundraising solicitations by organizations described in irc 501c4 501c5 501c6 and 527 must include notice that the donation is not deductible organizations that fail to meet this requirement face fine of 1000 for each day the failure occurs with an annual cap 7 irc 3306c8 and 10a 8

organizations with taxexempt status may qualif for certain nontax benefits from the federal government for example some federal grants are only available to taxexempt organizations generally those described in irc 501c3 additionally organizations that qualify for tax exempt status may qualify for favorable mailing ra tes the special rates are not an automatic benefit from receiving taxexempt

as it is consistent with the qualifications in their organizational definitions section 18 of the lobbying disclosure ac t of 1995 pl 10465 prohibits organizations described in irc 501c4 from receiving federal grants loans or other awards if they engage in lobbying activities even if they conduct the lobbying with their own funds as originally passed section 18 also applied to 501c4

exception of 527 organizations the organizations discussed in this report are restricted in some manner by the internal revenue code from participating in political campaign activity19 the purpose of 527 organizations of course is to participate in such activity the organizational definition in irc 501c3 prohibits those organizations from participating in political campaign activity an organization that violates the prohibition may lose its exempt status andor be subject to penalty taxes under irc 4945 and 4955 the internal revenue code allows 501c4 501c5 and 501c6 organizations to participate in political campaign activity so long as such activities are consistent with the organizations exempt purpose however under irc 527f any 501c organization that makes an expenditure for an exempt function is subject to tax on the lesser of its net investment income or the amount of the expenditure the tax rate is the highest corporate tax rate with an allowance for capital gains this provision provides an inducement for these organizations with substantial investment income to conduct their campaign activity through an affiliated 527 organization see the related organizations section below finally it should be noted that while the tax laws permit organizations described in irc 501c4 501c5 and 501c6 to engage in political campaign activity the election laws ban corporations and labor unions from making any contribution or expenditure in connection with federal elections 20 this ban applies whether corporation is forprofit or taxexempt exceptions may arise from the definitions used in election law but it is important to note that the election laws do not necessarily correspond to the tax laws this is another inducement for 501c organizations to set up 527 organization of course 527 organizations must also abide by applicable election laws g20g142g149g138g157g142g141g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 it is not unusual for
