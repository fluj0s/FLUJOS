social policy division march 13 2007 abstract growth in spending for health care is of particular concern to policymakers because medicare and medicaid already account for about 21 of federal spending as the population ages growing share of americans will receive health care under these programs putting increasing pressure on the federal budget unchecked this pressure is likely to aﬀect public spending for other priorities and also may aﬀect economic growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs226191 the 21 share is for 2006 see us congressional budg et office cbo the budget and economic outlook fiscal

social policy division summary health care spending has been growing as share of national income as share of federal spending and as share of many consumers income because people tend to use more health care as they age many obs ervers are concerned that an aging population will accelerate growth in health care spending and that such growth will lead to economic and fiscal crisis over the next several decades both nati onal and federal spe nding on health care are expected to grow rapidly for two basic r easons the first is changing demographics as the share of older people in the population grows health spending also will grow to reflect generally higher per capita health care costs for this population compared with younger people the second and more important reason is the rising cost of health care for all age groups in the past growing demand for h ealth care products and services has been significantly more important than population aging in driving health spending upward this trend is expected to continue with both older and younger people using more health care in the future than they do today growth in spending for health care is of particular concern to policymakers because medicare and medicaid already account fo r about 21 of federal spending1 as the population ages growing share of ameri cans will receive health care under these programs putting increasing pr essure on the federal budget2 unchecked this pressure is likely to affect public spending for ot her priorities and so may affect economic growth httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22619crs2 3 crs

also getting bigger it nearly doubled between 1950 and 2000 growing from about 152 million to 282 million people and is projected top 420 million in 2050 accounting for both population growth and aging the number of people age 65 and over grew from about 12 million in 1950 to 35 million in 2000 and is expected to approach 87 million in 2050 older people use more health care on average health

per capita spending fo r people in the older group grew faster from 1963 to 1987 and slower from 1987 to 2000 rela tively slow growth since 1987 in per capita spending for the elderly can be explained in part by changes in medicare policy these changes include the implementation of prospective payment for inpatient hospital care beginning in 1984 and for many other rvices following passage of the

this table are based on data from the national health accounts and several national household surveys the amounts ar not exactly comparable to spending estimates in table 1 because of differences in data sources and methods and because data in this table are adjusted for inflation aging is minor factor in health care spending growth population aging and higher per capita spe nding for older people contribute to growth in national spending for pers onal health care but aging is not the dominant factor population changes occur gradually while hea lth care spending has grown rapidly as shown in figure 2 national spending for personal hea lth care more than doubled over the 1987 to 1999 period not just for those over 65 but also for those under 65 and population subgroups across the

the oecd health affairs vol 26 3 janfeb 2007 pp 154161 8 for example in japan real growth in hea lth spending was 44 over the 19702002 period and about 1 of this growth could be attributed to population aging research and analysis on aging and health care spending over different historical and projected time periods and both in the united states and abroad consistently show that population aging is itself relatively minor factor in the growth of national spending for health care6 other factors including rising per capita income the availability of new health care products and services health in surance coverage and characteristics of the health care system play much bigger role over the 19702002 period real inflationadju sted growth in health care spending per capita averaged 43 per year in the ited states compared with 38 for subset of countries in the organization for ec onomic cooperation and development oecd7 in both the us and oecd countries about 2 percentage points of the growth could be explained by real growth in gr oss domestic product per capita see figure 3 put another way the fact that economic output grew by about 2 annually ove r the period allowed people to buy both more health care and more of everything else population aging was much smaller factor accounting for 03 percen tage points of growth in health spending the us and 05 percentage points in oecd c ountries the higher rate of growth from aging in oecd countries refl ects the fact that population aging has been more rapid in many oecd countries than in the us8 the remaining or excess growth in health care spending is simply growth from all factors except gdp and population aging hea lth insurance coverage and new health care technologies contribute to excess growth in bot h the us and other countries insurance coverage protects individuals and families from catastrophic health expenses but it also leads to higher spending because patients do not bear the full cost of the health care products and services they use excess cost growth from the use of new h ealth care technologie s is not necessarily bad if benefits exceed costs and if society values the additional health care more than it values what otherwise would have been produced with the resources at 2 percentage points annually over 19702002 period excess growth in the us was about double the rate for oecd countries one possible reason for faster growth in the us is the more rapid diffusion of new h ealth care technologies other reasons relate to characteristics of the health care financing and delivery system including the absence of global budgets for health care relatively hi gh prices feeforservice payment and weak controls on the supply and use of services together these characteristics reward providing more health care services as oppos ed to using resources more efficientlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22619crs6 9 in 2007 about 22 of medicaid spending is expect ed to pay for benefits for the

bout 21 of federal sp ending in 2006 to about 31 of spending in 201710 the expected increase will result primarily from excess growth in health care spending and enrollment growth in medicare as medicare enrollment grows the cost of beneficiaries health care w ill be transferre d from private sources to the federal government as share of the us economy federa l spending for medicare and medicaid is expected to grow from about 43 of gdp in 2006 to about 59 in 2017 all budget estimates are uncertain and l ongterm estimates are especi ally so nonetheless cbo projects that federal spending for medicare and medicaid could consume between 7 and 22 of gdp in 205011 to the extent that americans value health care highly they may be willing to devote ever more resources to these programs but doing so implies increasingly difficult tradeoffs between health care and other goods and services as well as between the beneficiaries who receive bene fits and the workers and taxpayers who help finance benefits in addition to the extent th at health care benefits are financed through debt their cost will be shifted to future generations and the lower national saving that results could reduce ec onomywide productivityfigure 3 components of r eal growth in health care spending per capita unit ed states and other oecd countries 19702002
