august 14 2008 abstract recent concerns regarding fresh produce contaminated with coli or salmonella have brought attention to the food and drug administration fdas regulatory authority some advocates have requested new fda food safety regulations including rules that would regulate activity on farms one question is whether the fda has the authority to regulate onfarm activities hr 1108 and s 625 which would authorize the fda to regulate tobacco products would limit the fdas authority to regulate activities on certain tobacco farms however it appears that the fda has the authority to regulate at least some onfarm activities related to other food products under the federal food drug and cosmetic act and the public health services act in 2004 the fda issued proposed rule governing safety procedures for shell eggs which would be its ﬁrst comprehensive onfarm regulation legislative proposals including hr 912 hr 3624 hr 5620 hr 5904 hr 6581 s 2077 and s 3385 also address the fdas role on

responsible for ensuring the safety of meat poultry and certain egg products the fda is th federal agency primarily responsible for ensu ring the safety of all other food2 in recent years incidents of contaminated spinach jala peño and serrano peppe rs and other produce have brought attention to the fdas role in maintaining safe food supply3 in general the fda has responded to recent contamina tion incidents with guidance documents and other informalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22939crs2 4 although it has official policy against notic eandcomment rulemaking the fda has shown preference for guidance documents over regula tions in recent years for example the fda commissioner has stated that voluntary guidan ce has certain advantages over regulations including the flexibility to update science and less cumbersome nature id 5 for more information about res ponses to the 2006 coli contamination see crs report rl33722 food safety federal and state response to the coli outbreak by donna v porter 6 see eg center for science in the public interest citizen petition 6 2006 the most important benefit of mandatory regulatory progra m is that it would assure that all growers and processors implement

certain growers and shippers associations to implement voluntary safety measures5 in response to recent produce contaminati on incidents some advocacy groups have argued that new regulations rather than guidance documents are necessary to prevent contamination6 some new regulations proposed by the advocacy groups include rules that affect onfarm operations for ex ample one advocacy group has requested regulations that would prohibit use of raw manure on produce and require growers to utilize potable water for cleaning7 these proposals raise an obvious threshold question does the fda have statutory author ity to regulate onfarm activity statutory language congress authorized the fda to promulga regulations rela ting to food safety through two federal statutes the federa l food drug and cosmetic act ffdca and the public health service act phsa8 examining relevant nguage from both statutes is important for determining the intended scope of the fdas regulatory authority the ffdca prohibits the adultera tion or misbranding of any food9 it likewise prohibits introduction of adu lterated or misbrande d food into the streams of commerce10 four categories of foods considered adultera ted under the statute are especially relevant to onfarm activities these categories ar 1 food bearing or containing added substances that may render the food injuri ous to health 2 food bearing or containing substances that are not added but that are of such quantity that they ordinarily render the food in jurious to health 3 food bearing or containing unsafe pesticide chemical residues and 4 food that has been prepared packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health11 the ffdcahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22939crs3 11 continued

general principles and recent trends by george costello 16 versions of bill that would amend the ffd ca to authorize the fda to regulate tobacco products were recently introduced in the house hr 1108 and senate s 625 both versions would expressly limit the fdas onfarm regulatory authority visavis tobacco specifically by prohibiting the fda from entering onto farm owned by producer of tobacco leaf without the written consent of such producer unless the producer either was also tobacco manufacturer or was controlled by tobacco manufacturer section 901c2 s 625 as reported section 901c2 hr 1108 as reported 17 under the ffdca food means 1 articles used for food or drink for man or other animals 2 chewing gum and 3 articles used for com ponents of any such article 21 usc 321f 18 see 42 usc 342aauthorizes the fda to promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement of these and other prohibitions contai ned within the statute12 the phsa authorizes the fda to make and enforce such regulations as are necessary to prevent the introduction transmi ssion or spread of communicable diseases from one state into any other state13 to enforce such regulations the statute authorizes the fda to provide for such inspecti on fumigation disinfec tion sanitation pest extermination destruction of an imals or articles f ound to be so infected or contaminated as to be sources of dangerous infecti on to human beings or other measures14 analysis the fda appears to have authority under the ffdca and the phsa to regulate at least some onfarm activities preliminary question when interpreting any statute is whether the statutes language provides explicit guidance neither the ffdca nor the phsa expressly authorizes the fda to regulate farm operations15 nor does either statute expressly limit the fdas onfarm regulatory authority16 however both statutes explicitly provide the fda with rulemaking authority over areas that could be interpreted as covering onfarm activities especially through the specific provisions enumerated above the specific ffdca provisions discu ssed above all apply generally to food17 without specifying the location of the food in addition these adu lteratedfood provisions describe characteristics that could first develop on farms for example foods bearing unsafe pesticides might have first been ex posed to pesticides in farm fields foods bearing added substances or harmful s ubstances of such quantity that they ordinarily render the food injurious to h ealth might have acquired such substances on farms and foods might be held in unsanita ry conditions on farms perhaps soon after they were harvested18 similarly the phsa explicitly authorizes the fda to promulgatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22939crs4 19 42 usc 264a emphasis added under th statute lists of specified communicable diseases are determined by executive orders 42 usc 264b 20 regardless of the interpretation of agency au thority note that congress likely has the power under the commerce clause to regulate activity on individual farms even if the regulations affect food that never enters the stream of interstate commerce the supreme court has upheld congresss power to regulate marijuana grown for athome consumption the court held that congress has broad authority to regulate even wholly intrastate activities as long as they substantially affect interstate commerce gonzalez v raich 545 us 1 1617 2005 analogizing to wickard v filburn 317 us 111 1942 which upheld federal regulation of wheat intended for consumption on farms where it was grown 21 62 cases

states v nova scotia food products corp 568 f2d 240 246 2nd cir 1977 invalidating the fdas timetemperaturesalinity regulation as applied to whitefish because the fda failed to follow proper rulemaking procedures but upholding the fdas authority to promulgate ch regulation when agency rulemaking serves the purposes of the statute courts shoul d refuse to adopt narrow construction of the enabling legislation which would undercut the agen cys authority to promulgate such rulesrules to prevent the introduction of communicable diseases19 provision that could be interpreted as including for example pr eventing harmful bacteria from developing on growing crops or during harvesting thus it appears that ffdca and phsa provisions could be interpreted as extending the fdas regulatory authority to the regulation of farm activities the remaining question is whether congress intended such an interpretation it would be possible to interpret the fda s regulatory authority narrowly under these provisions as limited to the promulgation of re gulations that affect food only after it has left farms as support for this narrow readin g one might assert that because the ffdca and the phsa aim to prevent the movement of adulterated food through streams of commerce and to prevent the spread of disease respectively it makes sense to construe the provisions narrowly as extending only to f ood that has actually left farms or in other words as extending only to food that is actua lly in the stream of commerce such that it is capable of spreading dis ease or causing other harm20 however courts have inte rpreted the ffdca and the phsa broadly rather than narrowly especially when broad interpretati ons of the statutes effectuate prevention of public harm the supreme cour t has stated that regard for congress purpose of keeping adulterated foods out of th channels of commerce should infuse construction of the ffdca21 the court has also held that as remedial legislation the ffdca should be given liberal construc tion consistent with the acts overriding purpose to protect the public health22 federal circuit courts have similarly interpreted the ffdca and the phsa broadly to effectuate protec tion of the public23 together with broad construc tions of the whole statutes courts have applied broad interpretations to the specific ffdca nd phsa provisions relevant to onfarm regulations for example interpreting the prepared packed or held under insanitaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22939crs5 24 nova scotia 568 f2d at 24546 25 id at 246 26 united states v anderson seafoods

provision federal circuit court rejected the assertion that insanitary conditions include only conditions in processing facilities24 instead the court held that the provision and therefore the fdas regu latory authority extends to conditions already present on the food at the time it r eaches processing facility25 likewise federal circuit court c onstrued the term added in the addedsubstance provision broadly to include all substances attributable to the acts of man26 courts have also recognized the fdas broad authority to implement ffdca provisions27 in addition the supreme court has generally treated agency decisions deferentially the court s held that if statutory language is ambiguous agency interpretations of statutes provisions shoul d be upheld as long as they are based on permissible constructi on of the statute28 the ffdca and phsa provisions discussed above appear to be ambiguous such that court would defer to th fdas interpretation in response to challenge to the fdas aut hority to regulate tob acco the court found that congress had directly spoken to the question at issue because it had specifically rejected amendments that would have explicitly granted the fda jurisdiction over tobacco and had later enacted tobaccospeci fic statutes granting authority over tobacco to other agencies such as the federal trade commission29 in contrast congress did not consider any amendment regarding fda jurisd iction over farm operati ons nor did it later enact any specific legislation addressing th question therefore court would likely defer to the fdas interpretation of its authority to regulate onfarm activities finally it is telling in assessing the fdas authority that independent agency reports the fda itself and other sources have assumed that the fda has the authority to regulate onfarm activities for example us government acc ountability office report assumed that the fda has authority over onfarm activ ities relating to the pr oduction of pizza and eggs30 in addition when it issued proposed regulation regarding shell eggs the fda affirmatively asserted its authority under bot h the ffdca and the phsa to regulate on farm activities31

httpwwwreginfogovpub licdoeagendaviewruleruleid284739the fda has jurisdiction where food is produced32 various law review articles state similar conclusions33 thus it appears likely that court would find the fda to have statutory authority to promulgate rules regulating at least some onfarm activities the number of regulations and the speed at which the fda could promulgate them pursuant to this authority may be subjected to practical impediments such as procedural requirements for noticeand comment rulemaking under th administrative procedure act and judicial review34 fdas regulatory activity the fda has promulgated numerous regu lations under the ffdca and the phsa that indirectly affect farm operations for example it mandates that milk sold into interstate commerce for direct human consumption must be pasturized35 in 2004 the fda issued proposed rule that would have directly regulated farm operations which some called the fdas first co mprehensive onfarm regulation36 specifically the proposed rule would mandate various onfarm procedures in an effort to prevent salmonella enteritidis37 the proposed rule would requi re growers to implement certain cleaning refrigeration and other onfarm prevention measures38 in 2005 the fda extended the comment period for the proposed rule39 the fda has indicated its intent to promulgate final version of the rule40 thus although fda appears to presume that it has the authority to regulate at least some onfarm activities the fda has not necessarily exercised this authority to its fullest potential
