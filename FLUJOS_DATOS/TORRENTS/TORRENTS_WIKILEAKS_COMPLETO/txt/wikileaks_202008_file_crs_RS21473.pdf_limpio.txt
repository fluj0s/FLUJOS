program of the late 1980s in the early 1990s north korea initiated the development of two ballistic missile programs known to the west as taepo dong 1 and taepo dong 22 the supposed design objectives for the taepo dong 1 system were to deliver 1000 to 1500 kg warhead to range of 1500 to 2500 km and for the taepo dong 2 to deliver the same warhead to 4000 to 8000 km range 3 initial prototypes for both systems were probably manufactured in 1995 or 1996 with possible initial production run for the taepo dong 1 initiated in early 1997 or 19984 analysts estimate that north korea may have produced from one to ten taepo dong 1 and one or two taepo dong 2 prototypes by the end of 19995 these missiles are not believed to be deployed6 north korea is believed to have had extensive foreign assistance from china russia pakistan and iran throughout the program7 very little was known about the actual program until the august 31 1998 launch of taepo dong 1 from the musudanri launch facility in north hamgyong province northeast coast of north korea8 the stated objective of this launch was to place north koreas first satellite kwangmyongsong 1 into orbit initial us intelligence reports postulated that the taepo dong 1 slv was only two stage rocket the first stage fell into international waters 300 km east of musudanri and the second stage flew over the japanese island of honshu and fell into the water 330 km away from the japanese port of hachinohe for total distance of approximately 1646 km 9 further analysis of radar tapes revealed that the taepo dong 1 had small third solid propellant stage presumably designed to place the satellite into orbit10 debris from this third stage was believed to have impacted as far as 4000 km from the launch point11 some analysts believe that if the missile had functioned properly the taepo dong 1 space launch vehicle slv could have achieved 3800 to 5900 km range 12 1 ballistic missiles are classified by range as follows short range ballistic

of the taepo dongs are us military facilities in guam 3500 km okinawa and japan the taepo dong 1 missile as opposed to the slv is believed to be two stage missile that uses dong missile derivative as its first stage and scud c derivative called the hwasong 6 as its second stage in this configuration it is estimated that it could deliver 700 1000 kg warhead to range of 2500 km14 which could put japan and okinawa within range for the taepo dong 1 to achieve greater range its payload would have to be decreased some analysts speculate that reducedpayload configuration could deliver 200 kg warhead into the us center and 100 kg warhead to washington dc albeit with poor accuracy15 until recently the taepo dong 2 had not yet been flight tested it has also been called the moksong 2 and the pekdosan 2 the taepo dong 2 is believed to be twostage missile about 35 meters long the first stage has been said to bear close resemblance to the chinese css2 and css3 first stage the second stage is believed to be based on the dong missile the two stage variant is assessed range potential of as much as 3750 km with 700 to 1000 kg payload and if third stage were added some believe that range could be extended to 4000 to 4300 km with full payload16 some analysts further believe that the taepo dong 2 could deliver 700 to 1000 kg payload as far as 6700 km17 pyongyang has yet to test the guidance system and the missile is believed to be fairly inaccurate18 how it might be deployed ie silo or transportable also remains undetermined although some have suggested it is road mobile system in order to achieve ranges capable of striking hawaii and targets on the us mainland some analysts believe that the taepo dong 2s payload would need to be reduced to 200 300 kgs19 some believe the taepo dong 2 may be exported to other countries in the future20 in june 2006 the taepo dong 2 was observed being assembled and fueled at the musudanri test site along the northeast coast of north korea at the time some observers believed test was imminent while others expressed caution because much technical uncertainty remained on july 4 2006 at 412 pm est north korea launched the taepo dong 2 the launch was

by three more21 about 40 seconds into the flight the taepo dong 2 apparently failed on its own during the first stage and fell into the sea of japan according to usnorthcom us northern command causes for the failure were studied but details have not been made public japanese sources reported some details of the missile launches suggesting greater accuracy in their impact areas than other analyses22 the report also suggested greater russian engineering support than indicated elsewhere some believe initial production of the taepo dong 2 may have started in 2005 and that perhaps 20 missiles were built in 200623 g16g152g155g157g145g561g13g152g155g142g138g514g156g561g15g146g149g146g157g138g155g162g561g21g153g142g151g141g146g151g144g344g346g561 some experts voice concern over north koreas level of military spending in relation to its missile program north korea reportedly spends as much as 40 percent of its gross domestic product gdp on the military 25 in 2004 us forces korea commander general leon j laporte reportedly stated that north koreas military investments are primarily in their nuclear biological chemical and missile programs in order to gain an asymmetrical advantage over us and south korean forces26 general laporte reportedly emphasized his concern over missile development and north koreas continued devel opment of its nuclear weapons program that could eventually lead to weaponizing their weaponsgrade materials on missiles27 north koreas apparent willingness to devote such large portion of its gdp to missiles and weapons of mass destruction could be cause for additional concern when viewed in the light of their alleged cooperation with other countries evidence suggests that north korea has had extensive dealings with iran pakistan russia syria yemen and libya on ballistic missiles and possibly even nuclear warheads28 one particular concern is that chinese warhead designs sold to libya by pakistani nuclear scientist dr aq khan might also be in the hands of north korea which could help accelerate its efforts to develop longranged nuclear ballistic missiles 29 some suggest that north koreas access to these countries missile and wmd technologies might enable north korea to advance its longrange nuclear ballistic missile program at more accelerated rate without having to conduct extensive testing particularly if they use proven missile designs from other countries 21 the shortrange test launches some combination of scuds and dong missiles occurred on july 4 all est at 1 232 pm 2 304 pm 3 359 pm 4 631 pm 5 712 pm and 6 415 am

that north korea is developing and deploying at least two new medium to intermediate range ballistic missile systems it is not publicly known if north korea is continuing development of reported new version of its taepo dong ballistic missile30 the so called taepo dong x which could achieve intercontinental ranges the two new medium to intermediate range missiles are believed to be based on the decommissioned soviet r2731 submarine launched ballistic missile32 the r27 which was allegedly acquired from russia in the 1990s and possibly enhanced with the help of russian missile specialists has been called an excellent choice on which to base new missile system33 its 40 yearold liquidfuelled technology is considered within the technological and industrial capabilities of north korea and versions of its engines are already used in north korean scuds and dongs perhaps the greatest advantage of this system is that the r27 is proven design meaning that north korea may be able to develop and deploy these missiles without having to conduct extensive ground and flight tests g14g138g151g141g556g4g138g156g142g141g561g24g142g155g156g146g152g151g561g345g346g561 the landbased version called musadan or dong b is medium to intermediate range ballistic missile with an estimated range of 25003200 km the north korean version of this missile is 12 m long24m longer than the r27and although smaller than the dong and taepo dong 1 has greater range than these two missiles this range puts most of east asia within range including us military bases at guam and okinawa although experts point out that the north korean dong 2 missile could also reach japan and okinawa initial prototypes of the landbased version were reportedly first identified in 2000 and preproduction models and new transportererectorlauncher tel were believed to have been completed by mid2003 the north koreans reportedly began constructing two new missile bases to accommodate the musadannon dong b one base is near yangdokgu n and the other is at sangnamni previously reported as dong and taepo dong base north korea has reportedly constructed administrative and maintenance facilities at these two sites as well as fortified underground tunnels for storing the missiles and tels by july 2004 experts reported that these new bases were from 70 to 80 percent completed

pursuing seabased ballistic missile capability which could have potential security implications for the united states in september 1993 the korean peoples navy kpn reportedly purchased 12 decommissioned russian foxtrot class and golfii class submarines for scrap metal from japanese company the golfiis which are capable of carrying three ssn5 slbms did not have their missiles or electronic firing systems when they were sold to the north koreans but they did allegedly retain significant missile launch subsystems including launch tubes and stabilization systems some analysts believe that this technology in conjunction with the r27s wellunderstood design gives north korea the capability to develop either submarine or shipmounted ballistic missile many experts postulate that north korea does not have the capability to develop new slbm on its own and that none of north koreas other ballistic missiles are easily convertible to slbms north korea apparently integrated the golfiis ssile stabilization and launch technology into new class of conventionally powered ballistic missile submarines possibly modified versions of golfiis or romeo class russian submarines 35 it is also possible according to some observers that north korea might attempt to incorporate this launch technology into merchant ship it is not known if north korea has sold or will sell this new system to other countries some analysts suggest that iran might be an ideal candidate fo r such system as it has allegedly researched seabased ballistic missile capability in the past

modified versions of the r27 they are likely more accurate in relative terms and have greater range than other dprk missiles some analysts believe that the sealaunched version could pose the greatest threat by threatening the continental united states these experts suggest that north korean sealaunched missile capability could complicate intelligence collection efforts as well as present challenges for south korean japanese and us ballistic missile defense systems others however are skeptical that north korea can reach the continental united states with the new seabased version anonymous us government officials have reportedly stated that north korea does not presently have submarine that is capable of transporting missile within striking distance of the continental united states 36 these officials also expressed doubt that north korea had intentions of developing missile to hide inside freighter to be used against targets in the united states37 35 ibid 36 thom shanker
