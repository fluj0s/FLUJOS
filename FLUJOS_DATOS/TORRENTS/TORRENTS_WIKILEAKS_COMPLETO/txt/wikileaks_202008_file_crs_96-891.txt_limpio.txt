insurance in 2007 decrease of approximately 13 million people when compared with 2006 although it was statistically unchanged in 2007 the percentage of people covered by employmentbased coverage has dropped in every other year since 2000 whether the uninsured rate rose in response depended on how much of the employmentbased decrease was offset by increases in public coverage in 2007 medicare and medicaid coverage rates increased and the uninsured rate declined from 158 in 2006 to 153 in 2007 mostly because of medicare only 19 of those age 65 and older were uninsured in 2007 in contrast 171 of
