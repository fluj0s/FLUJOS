6809c26 class viii tape 3 the laws of case supervision and this is the third lecture of the series of the class viii course now i give it an english accent because they will be played in england and they dont understand very much in england except english the rest of the lecture will be in american it is the twenty six of september ad 18 and the class viii course marches on i am very very happy tonight very cheerful very cheerful indeed two of the other class viii course suddenly became auditors suddenly and that is very very good news so apparently one becomes class viii auditor suddenly after great deal of hard struggle after reading very carefully star rating on the basic bulletins and the basic materials after going over this line after getting total total grip on tech so if somebody says the third law of listing you say brrrrp the fifth line of the auditors code brrrrzmp you dont even think you know its right there bong its not let see according to the laws of listing i i wonder if i put down this see i had blowdown what is blowdown i better look up in this bulletin over here and apparently after about three times through the lines and got the material cold and after terrific amount of study on properly done sessions now that is the thing which made the difference and just for the benefit of future students of the class viii course in england and in america the two points which make class viii auditor is total total grip on basic tech and good hard study of well done sessions and proper cs which led to the well done session ant proper grasp of how sessions arent well done and the study of the cs folders on that and the cs folders to which i refer are the cs folders which i did on flag on very long sprint of something on five weeks over 500 css now therefore class viii auditor has total grip on tech so that he does not fumble he does not have to think he doesnt have any unfamiliarity and none of the questions which i occasionally get you dont have any questions on the line theyve just got the tech pongo they apply the tech bango and they become class viii suddenly after theyve done all this its almost lousy sessions on tuesday fantastic on wednesday and then having become an expert class viii auditor one has the difficulty then of becoming an expert class viii case supervisor the marvelous invitations which the nonstandardly run pc offers to the case supervisor to squirrel are unlimited there is an infinity of ways to run case wrong there are less than four score ways to run it right and any time some auditor misses the missed withhold we just had one guy ran guy had you got an arc break you know asked you got an arc break it didnt read but the fellow says well yes i have about three or four arc breaks and these well im having an awful time of them natter natter natter natter natter natter natter natter natter paragraph paragraph paragraph natter natter natter well do you have another arc break read on the meter oh yes ive got lot of other arc breaks and so forth theyre really doing in and so forth aw for the awful way things are running theyre just terrible and the way youre auditing is awful and so on yes i got bunch of arc breaks and the ta goes up and up and up and up and the ta going up doesnt even alert this auditor one of the difficulties i had at saint hill was making bunch of auditors learn that missed withhold is missed withhold and an arc break is an arc break and never the twain shall meet but the guy can pretend to have an arc break when he has missed withhold and if you try to pull an arc break that doesnt exist and fail to pull the missed withhold youre in trouble so theres reverse slip to meter reading not only does the meter falsely read but you dont take up things that the meter doesnt read on unless when you get in suppress it then reads you can always put suppress on rudiment but of course now this is wide open invitation to pianola put nickel in the slop of the juke box type auditing do you have an arc break that doesnt read alright has anything been suppressed good do you have an arc break oh uh it doesnt read do you have present time problem doesnt read has anything been suppressed dajata degetee to do gee gee gee boom bull my disgust somebody who asked how do you ask for an arc break i say well now listen the answer to that question is star rate of every bulletin on the class viii course the zeros included why the guys asking questions like that because he hasnt got grasp on the tech do you follow now very often you get asked weird questions that have to do with the persons case hes asking you do mice jump through hoops well he hasnt differentiated between the basics of life and the peculiarities which have derived therefrom do you understand so you have to differentiate between what are the basics with which youre dealing and all of the god awful complex screaming infinity of balderdash and nonsense that can arise from miscombination of these alright so we get an unsolvable preclear you go oh obviously completely unsolvable we asked for an arc break and the ta went up so obviously hes an unsolvable preclear if you get pianola auditing you drop nickel in the electric piano the guy cant think basics so what he wants you to do is to put tape recorder in his head now if i gave you the proper answer to everything pc ever said it would take you from now till the end of the universe to memorize it all and i wouldnt be bothered writing it but anything pc said is indicative of one of another basics of which there may only be two or three hundred anything good bad or indifferent do you get the difference if youve got your basics when youve got your basics and youve got grip on these basics so that and i wonder if its true about the second law of listing psst what are you going to get out of that youve going to get an infinity of doubt and questions and all kinds of complications and pcs are going to become very complicated and theyre going to become very unsolvable you get the mystery of we asked for the arc break and we cleaned up the arc breaks but he didnt fn so there must be something wrong with standard tech because he didnt clean up actually the situations completely bonkers what is the symptom of missed withhold missed withhold is the pc nattering bong bang dont think see you dont have to say well lets see i wonder what bulletin covers that and blablabla you know and this he did i remember that in lecture and blaaa did did da do you have missed withhold yes people have been very mean to good whats the missed withhold well people have been awfully mean to whats the missed withhold well i really dont have any missed withhold read read read how do you pull such missed withhold well you gotta know you gotta know that youve got to pull missed withhold dont go any place else and do anything else for gods sakes pull the missed withhold well how do you pull missed withhold well theres ways of exaggerating missed withholds theres i can tell you half dozen ways of pulling the missed withholds what youve gotta know is that you must pull missed withhold now it is either missed withhold or its false read if its false read you clean it up with false reads you follow i mean you have to know how to play this piano now what would you think of piano player who say down to the piano and had to have somebody put his finger on each key and then say press youve got just about as much change of getting rachmaninoffs prelude hell never play it boys hell his musical sound pinks pink pink pink that was yankee doodle pretty good huh an auditing session is piano you play it boy and you play it now and you dont have any time to say i wonder where c is you hear plink in the pc and you go plunk just like that bang bang do you have an arc break read on the meter yeah i have lots of arc breaks theyre awfully mean to in the engine room theyve been shooting down lately and isnt it terrible the way they write up good whats the missed withhold oh hm well if you come down to that i the other day poured eight tons of diesel oil into the bunker fuel tank and havent told anybody good who nearly found out well actually the whole ship the people have been sort of looking at since good thank you very much thank you very much do you have missed withhold thats clean good do you have an arc break thats good thats fine now present time problem alright any overts well it reads oh i dont know i alright has anybody ever told you while they were auditing you that you had committed overts you hadnt committed oh yes as matter of fact i was doing this sec check and somebody said he turned on rock slam and then he found out the meter was disconnected and so forth and it was very upsetting but id keep getting this read on overts and so on good alright that was false read at that particular time good do you have an overt well thats clean your needle is floating thank you well now proceed to rehab and you think ive been short handing it but thats about how long it takes with these difficult cases there are difficult cases with standard tech there arent any well this pc was given reviews for two and half years in spokane and the ta three years ago went up to six and half and its been there ever since and at various places they mislisted the list and the number of errors found in the auditing summary are 119 auditing flubs well is the case hopeless case supervision do l4a to fn brrrrmp bong thump bang ta down bzzt bong thats it and the reason why they dont resolve is because the auditors sitting there gee i wonder what chart what hcob that was in lets see it was on tape i think it was on tape and something or other that the high ta shows an incidence of i think it was i think it shows medical background let see what does high ta show umm has place at class viii if you have to think in order to know basic fundamental data youre not viii and youre not going to get sessions they wont fly for you boy they wont fly the way you fly pc and the way you fly needles is you know it now now somebodyll write bunch of balderdash today i never insult students questions thats perfectly alright ask all the questions you please but i dont guarantee not to bring them up all the questions i get are simply divergences from standard tech the guy hasnt read the bulletins you know he hasnt read it he doesnt understand it if he did he wouldnt be asking questions like this its all there there arent any questions left to ask he asked whether or not you list service facsimile to the first blowdown or the second blowdown or to what you do oh brothers please any listing is covered by the laws of listings the laws of listing have variables there are variables in the laws of listing you always list that way there isnt any other way to list than the laws of listing there are other ways to list period full stop it just happens accidentally that in 5a you were hitting on the three primary points of thetans case and it just so happens that the first blowdown is invariably the item it happens on those three questions because they are questions which are dead on it so happens that those three questions are dead on they will inevitably be what you cant trust when youre case supervising is that the auditor caught the item that it did blow down on and when power goes wrong when 5a goes wrong it blew down on item one and he marked it as blowing down on item two so when power apparently goes wrong and the guy comes back and so on you get the list checked and now it follows the full laws of listing you may have to add to the list you may have to suppress it you may have to look for this and that and the other thing it just so happens that an expert who doesnt get blowing downs on the wrong item inevitably and invariably finds that the items the first item that blew down on the list because of the three key things about the list and that is why its called power plus those three listing questions 1b 1c and id are just dead center on case and he doesnt get several blowdowns hell only get that one i saw power 5a list on student the other day that about fried my hair he got blowdown and then went for whole column what was he doing why why why did he have to list he had blowdown he wrote it down himself with his own little pencil so would somebody please tell please tell my why anybody under the sun moon and stars would continue list beyond the first blowdown when it says in power plus in so many words that you it is the first blowdown period well who the hell thought there was whole bunch whole bunch of nonsense variables on this particular line the number of variables are zero in standard tech so the invariability of standard tech is an invariable variable and whenever you think you have variable on your hands you have done something or something has been done which departed from standard tech which now makes variable possible now let show you now the great invitation the great invitation pc who is different is complete invitation to the auditor and the case supervisor to do something screwy and the only mistakes the only only only mistakes you are going to make is accepting the invitation offered by the different case and then youre going to make mistakes there arent any different cases you go back down the line and you look there over former reviews this very resistant pc oh very difficult and there you see the blowdown on missed withhold only it was never pulled and there you see it in another session missed withhold rs but nobody ever pulled it and eventually this keeps up just that long and you suddenly get different pc doesnt matter much what you run on him its always something he doesnt respond he isnt he isnt responding to standard tech oh oh and clever case supervisor goes back and finds out where standard tech was violated and picks the case up at that point the formula of case supervision is to go back to find where the case was running well and come forward of that looking for violation of standard tech and if they are too many to refuse to get in fire fight correcting the corrections repairing the repairs you can do this so you can actually make up list of ive seen list of two solid type written pages single spaced of items wrong from the last time the case was running well and the case supervisor on this particular instance was advocating correcting every single one of those errors it would have been job that would have taken from now till halifax ive forgotten exactly what the instructions were i think it was something like do l4a to fn and do the next grade and they did l4a to an fn and the person made the next grade and is flying now it doesnt mean then that because case has been goofed up its quite tribute to scientology that it has gone forward to the degree of goof that it has been goofed the violations of standard tech its quite marvelous its just that you get about 200 times the result with standard tech yes go back over it so youve only got you got three sessions you got three review sessions something like that and each one has got mislisted list in it well correct it very easy to do three mislisted lists go back and find the right item on each list only takes about five minutes took something i mean per list took somebody else two or three hours or couple of intensives to make the list wrongly in the first place but go back correct them give him his right items give him his right items come up the line hes probably only stuck in one of these lists but youll catch that one but just little handful of lists well go ahead and correct them 5a if somebody falls on his head after 5a its usually its usually that something was very out and you had false auditors report in that he didnt give the pc the items that really blew down another item blew down or something of this sort or the pcs comm was violently cut you know something on the order of this trick somebody is so screamingly anxious about the fn that he doesnt let the pc finish his cognition like say oh seattle yeah he was going to say seattle yeah yeah yeah thats the place yeah yeah yeah christ what dumpy you know or what wonderful town something you know and the auditor saw that needle fly and he didnt realize there was comm lag between the needle which is just below the level of the pcs reality and the pcs cognition so the needle flew and he says thats it put down the cans good thank you thank thats woah you know wooh wooh were supposed to do all this very fast now then you dont see this as the case supervisor very often you can detect it to some degree but you dont see it really its not there in your view so the pc falls on his head after the session well something happened to his comm so you just correct that session very simple now you can correct the session by asking for this or asking for that but theres only one thing that can be wrong two things i mean that can be wrong it is either cut comm or wrong item so your standard case supervisor on something action like this it comes to you as somebody who has just been run on 5a now has headache and hes going around the review as for headache or he gets himself an ethics record or something of that character and so he goes around case supervisor hes just had 5a now along with your accuracy along with your accuracy in the field of basics must go confidence in the gains of tech and you cant go around saying well its not working out and it didnt work anyway and yeah yeb yee doo explain explain reasonable reasonable reasonable and probably 5a didnt work on this pc and 5a wouldve worked on the pc unless something happened so the pc by auditors report apparently ran ok but the pc few days couple of weeks later gets himself condition of liability from oprey and doprey or some other charge its the business of the case supervisor at that moment to pick up this pc something is wrong with power well the proper action is ruds or green form to fn if it didnt fn on the ruds you go ahead and run the green form to an fn and rehab power so the guy will check it check it and then when you get to the check of 5a you null the list you dont just say was that your item thats corny you null list this time because the probability is that the thing that blew down was not the thing he said so you null list meticulously and if the list now seems to be too short or something of that sort well you add to it and you repair it just the way you would repair an ordinary normal list because there is something wrong with the auditing report so the guy goes down and he repairs the list and so forth and its very unwise to get the auditor who ran the power to correct the power because you will get some kind of an action like this you know well i gave him the right item in the first place is mary jane your item yeah it was wasnt it yeah oh good thank you i thought it was there was just that little bit of criticism do you see thats why people when they fall on their heads go to qual not back to the hgc so the list is nulled and you normally will find out that it was his item but comm was cut or its marked as bd on the wrong item or for some peculiar reason it didnt bd at all and the pc was thinking about the listing question or something and got latent bd and didnt get the thing even thought he said mama papa uncle george he wasnt thinking about that he was thinking about people ive known god you know wow you know wow you know people ive known and we had somebody the other day bless her who didnt like to put bad people on list and the list in actual fact apparently blew down on somebody she thought of but not the person she put down on the list she was editing the list as she listed tricky huh tricky in that case on this list has anything you know youre not get the question reading items dont read on the list on this list question budupupupow has anything been suppressed pow what does that pwoon and then you get something like well i dont like to put bad names on list you see your variabilitys of what the pcs response is you get this real straight the variability of what the pcs response is hasnt anything to do with the standardness of the tech my god they will give you eighteen billion variations for every single solid piece of standard tech never q and with this amount of variation do you follow they act to standard tech directly but they give you such variable answers ill give you an idea do you have present time problem that read yeah well i hm present time problem alright is that false read you know read there anybody insist you had problem you never had you know hm alright good have you had problem auditors didnt find well yes reads good i was just thinking here ive never been audited without problems ive never been audited without problem ill always have problem the business im in jiminygod fn thank you very much you dont ask the next rud question of course because it fned on ruds now you get down to doing what youre supposed to be doing well thats variable answer youre going to get look there can be an infinity of wrongnesses absolute infinity there can be an infinity of sillinesses there can be an infinity of mistakes getting somebody to study mistakes only hes always gonna run into new mistake just think of the hottentot repairing the radio or the egyptian repairing the radio now how many mistakes could he make its an infinity now lets take lets take bunch of green red and blue chips of various sizes and shapes and lets throw them down and just scramble them up and throw them down on black table and every time you do this youre going to get brand new pattern and some of them are going to be good and some are going to be bad and so you say look at the variation in which life is steeped the hell it is theres variation here youre taking bunch of chips and throwing them on black table and that bunch of random items thrown down randomly will give you random answer thats the law back of that whats the variability crunch there is variability do you follow so there sits the auditor and hes got to have his tech solid proper question at all because hes sitting there talking to pc whos got 18765000 variables per square minute but theyre all varying on his exact basic principles what youve got to understand is youre sitting there with stable datum which hes running the locks of see youre just watching these locks now if you dont know your tech you think these locks are the stable data theres nothing more horrible to happen to an auditor than to run squirrel process and get win its fatal because hell now go down the street and get the next pc only the next pc didnt resolve on it and i have actually seen some guy try for years to get another win on the same process now the horrible part of it is is the guy in actual fact probably didnt get win on the process he continues to try he got win on something else pc all of sudden cognited hes saying hes saying how many motherinlaws are there on the head of pin or something some wise process see and he says this how many motherinlaws are there on head of pin see and the pc says oh gee thats good question its truly i feel wonderful thank you fn now the auditor not knowing his basics he thinks christy thats quite process well that wasnt the process the pc went fn on it was somebody who was willing to talk to as degraded bum as that somebody was actually willing to sit down and ask him question as though he amounted to something and he cognited on this and went fn you get the idea the auditor goes around with this squirrel process thinking and so on there are five or six brands of processes immediately jumped up and leaped into view around elizabeth new jersey one or two of them became very very famous and so on they were in actual fact questions which i had asked particular pc to pursue his particular problem and were based on the standard datum that pc makes mental image picture which then pushes him pushes his anchor points in and all i was doing was asking questions what would get the guy to look and these questions seemed terribly variable and they seemed so wise that they became processes one of them became whole line of therapy well you think this over well the guy who was watching ask the questions of the pc certainly didnt understand what the hell i was doing if hed understood what i was doing why he was i was trying to get the guy to look at the picture he was stuck in any question i asked was simply to get the guy to do that do you follow so the standard action there was simply well lets get the guy to look at his pictures and and blow few locks that was all that was all but they appeared to be very wise and so forth you see they had variables guys could actually go out and say golly you ask the person this marvelous question this marvelous question and so forth like what time was it that would add to something but whoever applied the process thought that i was asking about clock or something you know what time of the day was it at the time that this thing happened and so forth and you know get big variable on the line and then that could get all variabled up in some other way in other words these things squirrel up because the individual does not understand the basic from which the question stems do you understand that he hasnt got the principle from which the whole thing is advancing hes not running from basic data so not running from basic data of course he makes fantastic number of mistakes and then sooner of later if he squirrels and doesnt do standard tech he will sooner or later start getting loses on pcs and then he sort of considers it an overt and then he is apt to borrow some of their ideas of supervariability and if he didnt know standard tech in the first place he will for sure depart from what little standard tech he had so an auditor auditing standard tech owes himself hundred percent wins and hell get them hell get them theres monkey business about it now the state of the pc is not what the auditor says its what the pcs state is what is wrong with the pc is what is wrong with the pc not what the auditor evaluates is wrong with the pc these are all little basic laws it isnt the auditors opinion that makes the pc sick so you read lot of amateur cses they really are howl you you at this stage of the game youve got this ahead of you but youll start laughing at yourself after while at the tremendous opinion that you start forming of this that and the other thing and how complex these opinions are and how much figure you invest into the whole thing and you read my cses along this line and they seem to dispose of the most complex things with the simplest actions you ever heard of so that therefore because the pc is so complex and the solution so simple therefore there must be something you missed you get the idea so there must be something more in this folder but what youre looking at is the fact that we have the basic data of life these are the rules and laws that life lives and thats all you apply em and of course any life responds to it if you could talk to spider hed go ot so this this is what this is whats required of class viii auditor he has grip on tech the like of which nobody ever heard of you ought to be able to rattle off the auditors code bbbrrrrrrr boom but not just rattle it off pc comes in to session feels little dopey you dont think twice you say have you had enough sleep see you dont have to think about this you know that pc comes in feels for the chair and sits down yawn and you think immediately of the auditors code you had enough sleep well good go get yourself some sleep and well audit you when youre good and rested thank you not let see let see this is the this is three quarters of the way through the session let see i wonder what could be wrong with this pc he doesnt seem to be able to stay awake in the session is this dopeoff boil off figure figure figure figure figure figure figure now the alertness to these things is terrific i noticed used to notice that i would catch when we were doing long intensives and that sort of thing i could catch an arc break by the actual clock an hour and forty five minutes before the hgc auditor that was the lag hour and forty five minutes before the auditor noticed the pc was arc broken because the pc would get more and more and more and more arc broke throughout that hour but i could pick up the original arc break see and id say alright theres one and actually have clocked it and at that time i had squawkbox systems where i could listen to every session dont you see so i had lot of opportunity to do this the auditor would miss on his comm cycle and the pc would say or do something at that moment that was the beginning of an arc break that somewhere up the line in the next hour or two was going to explode in the auditors face and what always amazed was is the auditor would sit there and wait for it to explode in his face certainly the pc must have looked strained certainly the pcs voice must have gotten tighter certainly the needle must have been not responding properly the ta vanished out of the session the skin tone of the pc went bad the auditor wasnt getting anyplace with the process do you get it it took him long time to add up all these figures see well if youre redhot you recognize them in the first split half second see now the way you do it it isnt that you have to be quick its that you have to know what youre doing violation of comm cycle is liable to end up in an arc break now rather than go to all the labor of having to recognize it just dont violate the comm cycle thats the best answer to that just deliver flawless session and flawless session on communication is communication with the pc not communication with your instructor in trs do birds fly thank you the trs are just there to let you get up to point of where your grip on the trs are such that you simply apply the trs brrrrooooom boom boom boom boom you can talk that way you dont have to think about it it isnt wooden its very natural and when youve got the trs down pat why at that particular time bang bang bang they just run off pat thats all you can always tell brand new student hes trying to do his tr0 and his tr1 at the same time and it all shows up in his tone of voice and he hasnt got any more auditor presence than rabbit you just drill it up to point of where this comes natural thats all poomp pc originates handle the origination bong nothing to it so when it comes to adding and summating and looking up whats the difference between class viii auditor and lower class auditor class viii auditor knows his basics so well that he is never led into trap by pc he never comm lags as to what is going wrong he knows he doesnt have to correct his comm cycle errors they dont occur he doesnt have to patch up cases cause they werent misrun in the first place he doesnt have to repair the case supervision which he did on tuesday because it was correct and he has enough ethics presence when he is case supervising that an auditor who would do something else comes in with rather pale complexion if not bright green the auditor would be the first one to tell you he had goofed ethics presence is sufficient so he wouldnt try to hide goof boy so class viii does it right in the first place and can repair what other people have done wrong he himself in his auditing invariably does it right in the first place in his case supervisoring he does it right in the first place the cases he has to repair are the cases that have been done wrong by somebody else get the difference now i dont want to intimidate you or give you bad idea of what youve got to do but the only thing were demanding is 100 perfection 100 grip on the data 100 drill so that it just bong lead pipe cinch 100 result and that depends on 100 grasp of the data and 100 application of it and you get 100 results just like that bong you cant have 50 grasp on the data and get 100 results the percentages would be quite incorrect right now class viii is very fast it is fast fast fast fast i received note here from joe ship captain and it said during last nights lecture i got the first inclination of what standard tech is its the difference between cold war and blitzkrieg its not just better way of winning the cold war its calculated assault with calculated victory you dont go around when youre first studying and when youre first doing class viii type of auditing you may have some question about what the outcome of the session will be you might have some question but after youve been at it very short time theres question itd be matter of the wildest surprise if something weird happened in the session that made it go adrift or it didnt come out right at the end maybe one session in 75 or something like this might go adrift something outside your zone of control suddenly moves in on it in some fashion you might find yourself auditing some pc who has rather miserable auditing career and it may take you couple of sessions before you bring it up the line but your confidence is such that you know its going to come up the line through hell or high water its going to come right somehow to give you an idea my case supervision was running at about i suppose about 90 at first 90 little flubs of application and that sort of thing were pushing it astray and i myself in handling it was handling cases that had really been goofed boy theyd really been goofed and it moved up to about 95 and it moved up to about 99 its riding along quite handsomely now at 100 pocketa pocketa pocketa pocketa now the only place that it is coming adrift is that there are some student auditors on my lines and that doesnt make not handle the case what it makes is i have to case supervise it again not to change it but to tell them what to do to correct it so they can finish my cs see thats the reason they goof and then i make them correct it so they can finish my original cs and that may happen time on the case once or twice or something and then the cs is done it all comes out alright and bongo your neck is always out when you have an inexperienced auditor auditing for you in the first place he gives you false reports and he gives you false reports unknowingly and unwittingly he doesnt have clue whats going on so he doesnt tell you whats going on the case supervisor who believes an auditors summary is fool hes just fool thats all they have some use you continue to ask for them because it picks up the auditor observation and it can give you the auditors attitude toward the pc and what the auditor thought happened so they have value but you dont take it up as case supervisor theres action on your part for case supervisor got nothing to do with your case supervision beyond giving you the auditors attitude toward the pc and what the auditor thought happened in the session you find out what happened in the session by reading the auditors report and if theres any variation in that auditors report from what should have happened you know very well that the pc didnt come out alright in the end whether the summary report said that he did or didnt it had nothing to do with it and if theres goof on that line that you as case supervisor can catch as you go through the session as you read through the auditors report saying the pc came out alright has nothing to do with it the truth of the matter is youll find the pc is back in review goof in the session pc winds up in review or in ethics case supervisor you watch your ethics and review file compared to your cases which makes it very rat tat tat indeed theres nothing much to it in other words the auditor who ran standard tech produced the standard result or the case winds up in review or winds up in ethics thats the case supervisors point of view reversely the case that winds up in review again and the case that winds up in ethics was not standardly audited matter what the auditors report said something is wrong in that auditors report the auditor did not report something now youve got to do something to find out the data whether or not its to send it to the examiner or so on you you youre gonna find out more data case supervision consists of the complete folder turned in to you with the examiners note in it you dont ever talk to the auditor you dont ever talk to the pc you never talk to the auditor you never talk to the pc you never case supervise without the whole folder in front of you laws boy those are laws theyre in concrete never talk to the auditor never talk to the pc never case supervise without the whole folder in front of you those are the basic laws of case supervision and the only mistakes ive ever made on it but boy im talking from history ive case supervised more damn cases than you can shake stick at and the only mistakes i have ever made is when i talked to the auditor or talked to the pc or case supervised without the folder in front of and those are the only times ive ever made mistake quite marvelous and so if you dont disobey those rules you will be bear cat as case supervisor providing you are class viii and know your data so the guy ran in to hell of mess in the session he was trying to do the case supervision and he ran in to hell of mess in the session his proper action is to close the session how ever gracefully he can not have the pc sitting there waiting close the session thats it and so on with continuation of the session mentioned he just gradually says is there anything you would care to say before were closing down this session and he ends the session he makes out his report he takes his folder in hands it on normal lines it winds up in the hands of the case supervisor who in moment of dispassion reads the auditors report now the auditor was also expected when he handed in his folder to have included summary report and then it is administered and the whole folder is inspected to see what is going on here and then the action is taken that needs to be taken written down that needs to be taken with the case it is put in writing in separate sheet not scribbled across the corner of some green form its on separate sheet of paper of which the case supervisor keeps carbon copy and he writes down whats supposed to happen now if he doesnt know and he cant figure it out he sends the folder back with request that the pc appear before the examiner and when he gets the folder back then he has at least the comments and condition of the pc that the pc says not just the auditors side of it now he can do something about this and then what he does about this is so standard that it couldnt be knocked over with an abomb he accepts invitations to squirrel the auditors going to give him some because you will be supervising auditors who are level 0 or something hell have vast ideas of what he ought to do about this boy now you write something down and he doesnt think he can do this or something like that he doesnt change this as he goes in to session oh he just says that is it he doesnt go near the pc he has the pc informed that the session is suspended for the moment and he sends the folder back and says my reputation is at stake i either cant do or i dont understand or i dont agree with this cs cause after all im the guy thats going to be hanged if the pc comes out wrong im going to be hanged maybe youre going to be hanged but im for sure going to be hanged so therefore i cant do it doesnt compare to the case now that would be big invitation for the auditor to have talk with the case supervisor to violates one of the first principles cause the auditors now gotta say why if he cant do these processes then he had business auditing the case so you simply get another auditor if he says this isnt the right cs then hes gotta have some reason why it isnt the right cs and maybe he will disclose some new data that he before has not bothered to put down such as the reason he cant run the cchs is because the person is complete paralytic and is there lying on stretcher and that is case supervision how she is done and the end product of all of this is standard tech standard results and pocketa pocketa pocketa now the way to waste time is to try to save time by speeding up the admin lines any time you superspeed the case supervision auditor hgc admin lines any time you put crush on these lines it will add to the time spent lets get it all done and crush through in the next hour because the pc has to catch place for hoboken and lets get it in and big invitation to go in and see the case supervisor to find out exactly what hes supposed to do about the whole thing i can assure you boy you are now going to waste about session time money misery failures pfft you save the time in an auditing session in an auditing session you save your time it is so damned fast it happens so quick the auditing is so swift when it is done right that you could poke around for weeks with admin time now the only time you would run in on fast administration would be an assist at an injury somebody just got through dropping the body and youre going to tell him to get back in his head and take over control of the body thats responsibility of any auditor rendering proper assist putting tourniquet on the guy something like that see an assist level action well thats not in the realm and remedy of of auditing unless it itself is done wrong because an assist can fail ill have to tell you about assists because i find out theres very little information on them but your admin time you dont save time by saving the admin time you waste time by saving the admin time one rapidly done session which is expert and right on the button is worth hundred hours of old time auditing any day of the week furthermore the case that is set up that its all correct and you fire him right now boy he is in session about twenty minutes zoooooml and if you didnt set him up properly he will be in session and then be in review and be back on your lines and then hell be back over there and then hell go to the examiner and then he goes to ethics and then theyve got the hearing and then theres auditors and so on and some condition has to be assigned to him and then he goes back and then he has to correct the correction now so therefore the correction has to be and that is long arduous proceeding and they have to do various things and you get it so the essence of this is its the responsibility of the case supervisor to set the case up and to set the auditor up so it goes brroooooom now if its only going to take half an hour an hour and half or something like that to handle this case what the hell are you trying to do to save twenty minutes on the administrative lines matter of fact if theres any crush on these administrative lines the pcs in an awful rush in order to get fixed up in order to get swafff aff aff aff i myself would say well you tell the pc ive sent note to the examiner who is also the case supervisors relay to the pc is always the examiner not the auditor you dont say to the auditor tell the pc auditors not relay terminal for the case supervisor in that way you write note to the examiner and you say dear examiner we know the pc has to make his plane at 400 tell him to postpone his flight until next week signed case supervisor got it and if anybody is in such hell of rush that hes he has more importance in living than in being correctly audited i can tell you he aint going to live long he who spendeth his time convincing people how important it is will spend lot of his time in review just by the nature of things yes this fellow really has to be handled because hes entering college in fall and fall happens to be yesterday and he was due at the college and so forth and hes got to get it handled so that he can do his entrance examinations and so forth anybody saw anything like this on an examiner line the examiner should write all that down you understand anytime i saw an examiners report like that and hes got to be audited yesterday who dee dee dee do do do do eh well lets see what organization was this man last audited in lets see lets get that answered what organization there isnt very much folder here alright good the answer comes back hudson bay post 62 had his power and 5a so you say good well you tell him you tell him to make deposit with the registrar and make an appointment because weve got to get his folder here and that comes in by dog team and the other day just to give you an example somebody got in hell of hurry while i was gone on trip here these little things happen somebody got in an awful hurry somebody got in great hurry and they had to repair this guys power had to repair his 5a and the folders were at saint hill and saint hill is considerable distance away and so they relisted 5a they didnt have the original list so it was relisted not on my say so god forbid and i picked this up in this short term when i was absent and i said well and i think you may run across the case supervision of it well we dont know it says this is pretty adventurous to relist 5a or try to correct it in the absence of the folder and the list pretty adventurous some such thing and i didnt bother to file it because my certainty on standard tech knew the guy was going to fall on his head within the next week sure enough here comes in one from the examiner pc says he has bad headache naturally somebody doublelisted 5a christ how dumb can you get but you see they did this because it would take maybe couple of weeks to get his folder down here you see effort to save time on the admin line then winds up in an adventurous emergency action well auditing doesnt run like ambulance chasing true enough you can let case go and go and go and itll eventually fall apart now im at the same time not advocating that you just dont audit anybody for couple of weeks while you go fishing but any time you find yourself speeding it all up and having to do it in two seconds and therefore having to do it not thoroughly or having to actually call for the auditor to ask him the thing because youve really got to get this thing case supervised because the fellow is big joe from someplace and hes got the be audited tomorrow and you dont have the data bah youre setting it up to fall on its head the essence is you point him in the right direction and you fire him and he goes so fast when he is correctly aimed and fired and he goes so slow and it is so horrible when he isnt that any time you save by extraordinary actions on the administrative line is going to be lost by having the folder back and having it back and doing it some more and having it back again and doing it some more so the essence of the essence of standard tech is you know your data cold you know exactly what youre doing you make sure that the d of t has got that d of t trains those auditors so they just go boom boom boom you see youre going to have to do pianola training at this moment you say thin thun you know and youve got that d of p so arranged that that d of p he is just going to go over that case supervision with the auditor now its this an its this and its this now you go in and you get in the rudiments and mmmwma and thats what is says and then you so on and so on and this is very rough pc and he very often gives auditors bad time so you want to go in friendly everything get him set down tell him what you want to do and then give him this and tell him that and so forth now we got it all set and its something like setting up rocket dont you see and then the auditor goes in hes got it all set up he strikes the match on the seat of the pants and lights the fuse got it and the guy goes whhhhooooommmn see pc exits laughing now ill give you the other approach case supervisor he doesnt know uh this pc has long history of having been on the police force therefore he had great many overts uh lets see i think what we had better do is run joberg in order to handle this situation and uh then if we get joberg done um so on well just to make real sure we will run grade ii before we run arc straightwire and thatll thatll fix it up because then well also catch his overts yeah thats the way well do this case yes yes thats good alright and he sends it in pc comes into session the auditor hes got the case supervision but the d of p hasnt gone over it with him or anything like that and the auditor goes into session and goes what the hell is this joberg joberg lets see ok ok joberg i havent got form here where the hells the forms here joberg i think i dont know where the wheres the wheres the joberg what the hell is joberg oh i remember what it was i remember what it was uh yeah well i can i can do that i can do that right off the cuff see so he gets the pc in session he says alright tell about your sex life and pc comes into session already with his tone arm at 45 see tell about your sex life alright very good yeah youve had lot of sexual overts have you alright now lets check these things out and so forth you every stole anything robbed anybody and so on of course youve robbed somebody we know that now lets see alright session comes back ta 5 oh well i must have goofed that one this pc must have some im pretty sure this pc must have robbed bank yeah thats what well do well put it down here see if the pc has robbed bank and then run the cchs except specialize in cchs because he says somebody was glad hander in the last session and he sends it back and the auditor says well i i cch1 to hell i dont remember what that thing is oh alright um ta at 5 and he says well how does auditing seem to you now good how does it seem to you now good thank you how does it seem to you now good how does it seem to you now alright good how does it seem to you now oh lets see what question was i on yes pcs ta at 65 ran cch1 without any results kidding ive actually case supervised almost under those conditions where it didnt matter much what the d of p said the auditor did something else anyhow but to be agreeable why he put it on the report form that he did it or hed tell the d of p and then usually the case supervision was tearing into the office and making couple of sharp comments and then going off and not doing what the guy said anyhow now you wonder what the hell goes on well in that much confusion scientology still increased its stats still went up the line people still did recover from things and miraculous things occurred marvelous absolutely marvelous attestation but those sessions could go on for week after week year after year and grind out one way or the other and get someplace and somehow which is alright even without bad supervision even with the auditor actually knowing what the processes were running the processes too long doing this and that and the other thing running pcs not set up session without ruds and that sort of thing people still got hell of lot of result now when we find out exactly what are the additives off the line and you pull those off the line and you get this new line of think case supervisor says brrrmmmnp and zzzzpdpp and zippp d of t takes it up with the auditor makes sure that he knows how to do it pc comes in to session the pc has had rest the pc has been fed the pc is ok all is alrightf and we got it and the auditor strikes match on the seat of his pants and lights the fuse and booms there was two years of old auditing just went by in those twelve minutes got it and man pcll hold onto those gains just as hard as they are accurately delivered so you got your hands full of handful of miracle it happens so fast people will very often say it looks too simple yawn say thats what lindberg said or something like that you know its too simple yes it is terribly simple and when you have done your dianetics course your academy course class vi and become class vii and then had your class viii course couple of years from now and so forth you will be able to do it that simply too funny part of it is you can take an academy auditor and you can teach him to say i see cat sit down at the meter and say i see cat and dont say anything else to the pc and then when youve said i see cat then when the pc answers that question you watch this and youre watching for that needle to go woof if the needle didnt do that you close the session you make your auditors report and you send it back to and if you say another god damn word boy hm hm hm right now i want to stay in arc with you lets have this all on beautiful even plane of arc so i dont have to bust your teeth in to shut you up in session now i trust you completely thats why we have this squawk box your auditing room is bugged your sessions are patrolled we have utter trust complete trust say anything you please in session as long as you say exactly what i tell you to say and not another damn thing and you will be able to do it actually with level 0s what you would do actually is clear one rudiment at time one rudiment per session it isnt worth while to do anything else now class viii you turn him loose with whole session see well put the rudiments in this morning and then if the needle is still flying this afternoon you can go to the body of the session but youll have to send the case supervisor folder first this pc could very often be in the org for two weeks having received three sessions or having received five sessions each one of which was only five minutes long and the funny part of it is he would fly like bird do you see now the length of the case supervision then is proportional to the class of the auditor who is doing the auditing so i can say to sea org class viii now do the usual rundown for ot section 4 lrh and he goes and does it hell of complex damn thing its fly the needle on ruds or go to green form and fly the needle on it when you got that done get earlier rehabs practices whatever you got to do get that cleaned up make sure that rehabs rehab arc straightwire secondaries engrams now zero one two three four rehab or run if they dont rehab you do something with them to set them up skip power you never rehab power in clear rehab r6ew rehab ot1 rehab clearing course and ot1 ot2 prepsheck 3 do valence shifter and run confront and that is section 4 ot complete done by class viii and the total lapsed time that it takes to do that is variable i havent been reading the section times i dont know hour or two at the absolute outside but if all of sudden he cant do one of these items or one of these actions doesnt work or so forth even so he would be expected to pack the session up at that moment pack it up close it off and send it back for additional cs he has hit bug he doesnt try to sit there and solve this bug hes running standard tech and theres something in the road of it now the guy tried to rehab arc straightwire and it wasnt about to rehab and he checked over to see if it had been run and it apparently has been run if its been run it wont rehab and the ta rose on it he could assume maybe it was too many times rehabbed or something or something but he for sure had better send it back to the case supervisor something went adrift and the case supervisorll look it over look over his session and find probably the bug that he didnt see or we may be dealing with spook and before this time we have had somebody who was an ot2 who hadnt ever been audited on arc straightwire that hadnt ever been audited on engrams secondaries engrams ot1 2 3 4 never had his service fac run hed been run on some version or another of power and somehow or another had fumble bumbled and false attested his way at r6ew and fumble bumbled and attested his way falsely at this and had told people that he was in actual fact class vi auditor when hed never seen the inside of an academy how would you like that sitting in front of you as hell of withhold it isnt likely anything would either run or rehab but itd certainly measure as withhold but something like that so we could do an assessment on the thing and wed see all of sudden the pc has never been clean on withholds there was read there of some kind or another but it wasnt picked up something must be suppressed so the case supervisor would recheck and itd all fall out in the wash where the case doesnt run standard where the case doesnt run standard theres lie because the totality of ot is the totality of truth and the number of lies which person has on the line is direct index of his case state so youll get the lower level cases they lie like hell all the time anyhow so something has got out of line and we have to find what it is anyway regardless of that im just giving you some of the limitations some of the actions and the exact precision with which you do case supervision and youre going to think that you figure figure figure lot on case supervision you dont figure figure figure lot on case supervision you just know your standard tech better than any auditor you have auditing for you even though theyre class viiis and you always know your tech perfectly and you never get invited into the culdesac of running some unusual squirrel action because the auditors report seems to indicate that the case is different than all other cases there are different cases now when you can do it as case supervisor youre not even looking at the pc youre that remote and the invitations are terrific because the auditing is being done and recorded and reported to you out of your sight so there in all other places youve got to hold the grip on standard tech but to do it at all youve got to know your tech cold cold as ice this is standard tech this is viii viii in its auditing is one thing in its case supervision is another when youre good auditor you can case supervise when you cant audit you cant case supervise thats for sure ok i trust few of these succinct remarks will be of some value to you in future days thank you very much
