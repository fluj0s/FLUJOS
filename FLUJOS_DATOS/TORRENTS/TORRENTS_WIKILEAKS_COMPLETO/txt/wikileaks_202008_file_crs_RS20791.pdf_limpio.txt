division summary the united states is member of seven multilateral development institutions this report discusses the process for us involvement in each the us treasury department manages us

developing countries in all parts of the world four regional banks lend to developing countries in their particular areas these include the asian development bank adb african development bank afdf

brief ib96008 multilateral development banks issues for the 107th congress discusses several prominent issues as well as current congressional action visa vis the mdbs this report discusses how the united states manages its participation in these international agencies companion paper crs report rs20793 multilateral development banks basic background provides information about their organizational structure and operations another crs report rs20792 shows how much the united states has contributed annually to each multilateral agency httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20791crs2 us participation in the mdbs with the advice and consent of the senate the president names individuals to represent the united states on the executive boards of each mdb though formally the us executive directors useds occupy high positions in the mdbs paid by the banks they also function as the eyes ears and voices of the united states within those organizations under the mdbs articles of agreement mdb executive directors have fixed terms of service generally three to five years nevertheless as practical matter the useds serve at the pleasure of the president of the united states the president has the ultimate authority under us law to direct us policy and instruct the us representatives at the mdbs but delegates this responsibility to the secretary of the treasury the assistant secretary of the treasury for international affairs manages us participation with the help of professional staff of 20 individuals the secretary serves as the us governor member of the governing board at each mdb until recently us participation in ifad was managed by the us agency for international development usaid in 1999 usaid transferred it to treasury other agencies are also involved in the formation of us policy towards mdbs the working group on multilateral assistance wgma is the main forum for coordinating agency views it reviews each loan proposal during the 2 weeks before action is scheduled by an mdb executive board to see whether the loan complies with us policy and law based on these interagency discussions instructions are drafted by the treasury and sent to the us executive directors specifying the points they should raise and the way they should vote on each mdb loan or policy proposal participants include representatives from the treasury state agriculture and commerce departments usaid federal reserve board fed and exportimport bank eximbank the united states has substantial influence within the mdbs in most cases it is the largest single contributor and it has the largest vote however country has veto and majority vote of an mdbs executive board is needed before it can approve loan or adopt new policy or operating procedure in most of mdbs the united states and the other major industrial countries have near majority of the vote in the world bank grou p and in the ebrd this rises to clear majority in other regional mdbs the borrower countries have small voting majority the g7 and other industrial countries still have major influence however as the regional banks need the financial support of the industrial countries to underwrite their operations the mdbs cannot assess their member countries or require contributions without their consent the united states and other major countries can be outvoted on particular issues if their views are substantially different from those of most other advanced industrial countries consequently from time to time the mdbs have approved loans to countries which are in foreign policy disfavor with the united states likewise in cases where the united states is required by law see table 1 to oppose particular loans other major countries may decide not to follow the us example they may have different views as to how difficult situations should be handled nevertheless in most instances the mdbs make their decisions about loans or policies without formal reference to country voting shares everyone knows which countries have the largest votes generally decisions on the mdb executive boards are made on consensual basis this helps diminish any overt clash of interest between the donor and borrower countries it also helps promotehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20791crs3 1 for discussion see crs report 98180 multilateral development banks environm ental assessment and information policies impact of the

received due consideration in the formulation of mdb policy congress and the mdbs congressional procedure congress has major role in the formation of us policy towards the mdbs though less direct influence than it has over us government programs for instance it cannot earmark funds or direct the mdbs to approve or disapprove loans for certain countries or purposes however unless it authorizes us involvement and appropriates funds the united states cannot make new contributions congress can also pass legislation controlling what us policy in the mdbs shall be congress has enacted large body of law governing us policy towards the mdbs some laws control the us voice and vote these may direct the secretary of the treasury to instruct the useds to advocate certain policies or seek particular action by the mdbs for instance congress has adopted numerous laws requiring the administration to seek specified improvements in the banks treatment of environmental issues other provisions may require the secretary to instruct useds to oppose or vote against mdb loans for certain kinds of activities or for certain types of countries for example the useds must vote against loans to countries which fail to cooperate in suppressing illegal drug trafficking or commit gross violations of human rights the 1989 pelosi amendment international financial institutions act 1307 persuaded the ifis to adopt new procedures making their documents and operations more transparent to the public1 an illustrative list of these voice and vote requirements is shown in table 12 not all the directives enacted in the past several decades are shown congress has also used the power of the purse on occasion to promote change within the mdbs generally these laws specify that some or all of the money appropriated will be available for contribution to an mdb only if the secretary of the treasury certifies that it has taken or ceased taking certain specified actions or it has adopted particular policy norms for example in the mid1990s some us contributions to the idb were withheld pending action by the idb to require all borrowers to stop discriminating against procurement bids from potential suppliers in the united states and other countries in 2000 congress said that some of the us payment to ida must be withheld until the secretary tells the world bank that future ida aid to heavily indebted poor countries hipc getting debt relief should be grant aid an illustrative list of these power of the purse directives is shown in table 2 again it does not include all suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20791crs4 3 for discussion of the budget and appropriations process see the following two reports by larry nowels crs report rl30515 international affairs budget trends fy1980 fy2000 septem ber 29 2000 and crs report rl30511 appropriations for fy2001 foreign operations export financing and related programs october 26 2000measures that congress has enacted many of these oneyear provisions have been renewed annually the table generally shows the first year of enactment the senate foreign relations committee and the house committee on financial services have jurisdiction over mdb authorizat ion legislation while the house and senate foreign operations appropriation s subcommittees handle mdb appropriations the house international relations committee has authorizing jurisdiction for ifad mdb funding plans are in effect multiyear international agreements generally the united states plays major role in their negotiations major changes in mdb policy or procedure are often embodied in these plans most analysts believe that relations with allies and other major donor countries might be seriously strained if the united states fails to ratify the agreements through passage of the appropriate legislation once they have been negotiated the mdb program has been quite controversial many leading members of congress have thought that prospective mdb legisla tion might be defeated if it was brought out of committee by regular order thus during the past 20 years much of the debate about us policy in the mdbs has occurred behind the scenes all but one of the mdb authorizing measures enacted during this period were passed as riders to the annual foreign operations appropriation bills the house and senate have frequently made major cuts in mdb funding often funds have been restored following negotiations between the house and senate conferees or strong requests by the president us contributions to the mdbs is funded through the international affairs function 150 portion of the federal budget this also includes the operating expenses and program costs for the foreign affairs agencies us foreign economic and military aid participation in internationa l organizations and export promotion programs in fiscal 2000 total international affairs expenditures of the us government comprised about 4 of all federal discretionary spending budget authority to fund us participation in mdbs amounted to about 55 of the function 150 total3 in the bretton woods agreements act 1945 which authorized us participation in the imf and world bank congress required the administration to submit an annual report on the operations and policies of the international financial institutions ifis it was to be prepared by an interagency body called the national advisory council on international monetary and financial policies over time congress expanded greatly the number of issues to be discussed in the nac report successive administration have had difficulty preparing these reports while also managing us policy in the ifis the last for fy1992 was submitted in 1996 in 1998 congress simplified the reporting requirement dropping many of the detailed reports that were previously mandated the administration said at the time that this would enable it to present more timely and useful reports to congress but subsequent
