sidebyside summary prior to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks insurance covering terrorism losses was normally included in general insurance polic ies without additional cost to the policyholders following the attacks both primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage because insurance is required for variety of economic transactions it was f eared that lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have wider economic impact congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 tria pl 107297 116 stat 2322 tria created temporary program expiring at the end of 2005 to calm the insurance markets through government backstop for rrorism losses and to give the industry time to gather the data and create the stru ctures and capacity necessary for private insurance to cover terrorism risk fr om 2002 to 2005 terrorism insurance became widely available and largely affordable and the insurance industry greatly expanded its financial capacity there was howev er little apparent ccess on longer term private solution and fears pe rsisted about wider economic consequences if insurance were not available cong ress responded to the expirati on of tria with the passage of the terrorism risk insurance extension act triea pl 109144 119 stat 2660 triea extended the tria program til the end of 2007 while increasing the private sector exposur to terrorism risk the two years under the extended tria pr ogram were very similar to the three years under the first act the market fo r terrorism insurance improved but doubts remained as to capacity of the private sect or to finance larges cale terrorism risk in the united states as well as whether terrori sm risk can be considered an insurable event at all in response the house passed hr 2761 in the 110th congress which would have extended the tria program 15 years and made substantial other changes the senate also passed hr 2761 after amending it with language from s 2285 which would have extended tria seven years while making more limited changes to the underlying law the h ouse then passed hr 4299 which contained the language of the senate passed hr 2761 plus some of the provisions from the previous version of hr 2761 the differe nces between the house and senate bills included the inclusion of group life insuran ce restrictions on life insurers use of travel in underwriting lowering the deduc tible and trigger after large terrorist attack and the reduction of the program trigger to 50 million the senate however did not act on hr 4299 and the house ultima tely agreed to the amended version of hr 2761 that was previously passed by th senate the president signed this bill into law on december 26 2007

statute specifies the name as the terrorism insurance program while the department of treasury entitles it the terrori sm risk insurance program trip and this name has become more generally acceptedterrorism risk insurance legislation in 2007 issue summary and sidebyside introduction prior to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks insurance covering terrorism losses was normally included in general insurance policies without specific premium being paid for this coverage the attacks and the more than 30 billion in insured losses that resulted from them caused rethinking of the possibilities of future terrorist attacks in response to the new appreciation of the threat and the perceived inability to calculate the probability of loss and gather the loss data critical for pricing insurance both primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage many argued that terrorism risk is essentially uninsurable by the private market due to the uncertainty and potentially massi ve losses involved because insurance is require d for variety of economic transactions many feared that lack of insurance against terrori sm loss would have wider economic impact particularly on largescale developments in urban areas that would be tempting targets for terrorism congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 tria1 which was signed by the president in november 2002 tria created the terrorism risk insurance program2 which was enacted as temporary program ex piring at the end of 2005 to calm the insurance markets through government b ackstop for terrorism losses and give the private industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insuran ce to cover terrorism risk terrorism insurance became widely av ailable under tria and the insurance industry greatly expanded its financial capacity in the three years from 2002 to 2005 less progress however was made on creating terrorism models that are sufficiently robust for insurers to return to offering widespread terrorism coverage without government backstop and practically progress was made on private pooling mechanism to cover terrorism risk again fearing economic disruption from the absence of terrorism insurance congre ss passed and the president signed

for two years while increasing the private sector exposure under the program the two years experience under triea pr oved to be similar to the three under tria during this time terrorism risk insurance was available pricing was moderate and takeup ra tes slowly increased some additional progre ss was made on larger scale private solution and some private groups outlined proposals for such solution4 there was however little concre movement towards adopting such proposals the industry focus seemed to be on promoting the possibility of another extension of the tria program some see this experience as proof of the argument that the private market will never be able to offer insurance to cove r terrorism risk and continue to see the possibility of wider economic consequences if terrorism insurance again is unavailable others notably the us tr easury department respond that tria itself is retarding the growth of this private market by offering essentially free reinsurance against terrorism risk thus it should be allowed to expire or at least be reduced from its current form legislative action in the first session of the 110th congress three different bills addressing the impending expiration of the tria progra m saw committee or floor action two in the house and one in the senate as was the case in the tria extension debate in 2005 the house bills were more significant revisions and expansions of the tria program whereas the senate bill had narrower focus extending the program while making more limited changes also as in 2005 th administration gene rally supported the senates approach terrorism risk insurance revision and extension act of 2007 trirea hr 2761 representative michael capuano along with 23 cosponsors introduced hr 2761 on june 18 2007 referred to the fina ncial services committee the bill was the subject of hearing in that committees subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government spons ored enterprises on june 21 2007 hr 2761 as introduced would have exte nded and revised the current structure of the terrorism risk insurance program adding significant new elements to thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34219crs3 5 the full committee markup began on july 26 but hr 2761 was the last of number of bills to be marked upstructure within the existing tria structure the bill would have extended the program 10 years to the end of 2017 wh ile reducing the program trigger to 50 million and generally leaving the individual insurer deductibles and aggregate retention unchanged at 20 of direct earned premium and 275 billion respectively it also would have expanded the scope of tria by including domestic terrorism as covered event adding group life insurance as covered line and mandating that insurers make available cove rage for nuclear biological chemical and radiological ncbr terrorist events under the bill as introduced group life insurance would have had separate pool with its own deductibles and recoupment amounts based on the amount of insurance at risk rath er than direct earned premiums ncbr coverage would have had lower 75 deductible compared to nonncbr terrorist events 20 in addition hr 2761 as introduced included socalled reset provisions that would have lowered the program trigger and deductible thresholds for areas that have suffered pa st terrorist attacks or that suffer terrorist attacks in the future if the damage from the attacks ex ceeds 1 billion finally the bill would have expanded the mandatory availability provisions to include restrictions on life insurers ability to consider lawful intern ational travel as factor in underwriting decisions hr 2761 was marked up by the h ouse financial rvices committees subcommittee on insurance capital markets and government sponsored enterprises on july 24 2007 and by the full committee on august 1 20075 substantial amendments were adopted at both mar kups the subcommittee markup began with complete substitute amendment by chai rman kanjorski being adopted by voice vote this substitute changed the nbcr provisions delaying the make available provisions until 2009 and lowering the deduc tible to 35 with 05 increase per year it also included requirement fo r biennial reporting on the tria program by the treasury and changed the compositi on of the independent commission created by the bill to make recommendations on the program several amendments to reduce the 10year extension of the program were rejected as was one to require full recoupment of federal funds expended beyond the 275 billion aggregate retention amount in current law amendments dopted by the subcommittee included one by representative gary ackerman to include the secretary of homeland security in the certification of terrorist attack under tria and one by representative richard baker to apply the lower trigger amount in the retrospective reset provisions to the entire country rather than just to the affected area the full committee markup began with an amendment by chairman barney frank making number of technical change s and three primary substantive changes first chairman franks amendment chan ged the reset provisions removing the retrospective reset altogether and applying the prospective reset provisions to the entire country thus if there were future terrorist attack resulting in more than 1 billion in damages the trigger would be reduced to 5 million and the insurer deductible would be reduced to 5 for t hose insurers suffering terrorism losses second it included temporary preemptions from state rate and form

september 6 2007 cbo found that the bill as reported would increase direct spending by 37 billion from 2008 to 2012 and 104 billion from 2008 to 2017 this spending would be offset by dditional revenues of about 100 million from 2008 to 2012 and 20 billion from 2008 to 2017 since the cost estimate found that an increase in the budget deficit or decr ease in surplus would result from the bill it appeared to fail to meet the requirements of the payasyougo paygo rule adopted by the house at the beginning of the 110th congress6 in response to the paygo issues the special rule hres 660 under which trirea was considered on the house floor included selfexecuting amendment that inserted language into the underlying bill requiring passage by congress of joint resolution before any funds coul

congressional action introduced uncertainty to the tria program that did not exist before it was unclear exactly how the insurance market might have reacted to this uncertainty should this language

discussed possible amendments in the markup session amendments were voted on in committee the unamended bill was ordered reported to the full senate on vote of 201 chairman christopher dodd introduced the bill numbered s 2285 on november 1 2007 and the committee report s rept 110215 was issued the same day tripra as introduced was relatively straightforward reauthorization of the existing tria program the two primary changes to current law were to extend the program for seven years until 2014 and add coverage for domestic terro rist attacks to the program in addition s 2285 would have modified slightly the annual liability cap and required the secretary of the treasury to promulgate regula tions on determining payments should losses exceed 100 billion rath er than leaving this determination to future congress the bill called fo r reports from the government accountability office gao on the possibility of insuran ce coverage for ncbr events within one year and on the affordability and availability of terrorism insurance in specific markets within 180 days finally th presidents working group on financial markets was tasked to continue its analysis of the longer term availability and affordability of terrorism risk insurance and to report on this subject in 2010 and 2013 cbo issued cost estimate for s 2285 on october 29 2007 it found that the bill would increase direct spending by 31 billion from 2008 to 2012 and by 66 billion from 2008 to 2017 this spending would be offset by increased government receipts of 100 million from 2008 to 2012 and 15 billion from 2008 to 2017 this score caused similar paygo issues as those faced in the house8 in response to these paygo issues lang uage was added to tripra before it was considered on the senate floor this new language increased the total amount of the recoupment surcharge to 133 of the previous mandatory recoupment amount it also increased the rate of repayment requiring that repayment be

affected the offsetting gove rnment receipts would be increased in total cbo found the amended version w ould reduce budget deficits or increase surpluses by less than 50 million over the 5 and 10year
