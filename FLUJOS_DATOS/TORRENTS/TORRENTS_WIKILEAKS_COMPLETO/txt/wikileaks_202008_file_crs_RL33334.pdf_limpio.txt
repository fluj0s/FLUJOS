current issues summary animal agriculture is bein g transformed by rapid dvances in biotechnology term that encompasses variety of t echnologies including genetic engineering ge genetic modification transgenics recombinant dna techniques and cloning among others producers are interested in the application of biotechnology to improve productivity consiste ncy and quality to intr oduce new food fiber and medical products and to protect the nvironment potential human health applications of transgenic animals include producing biopharmaceuticals and generating organs tissues and cells fo r xenotransplantation criticisms of such applications involve issues ranging from f ood safety and social resistance to potential negative impacts on animal welfare and on ecosystems questions also have arisen about the adequacy of the current regulatory structure to assess and manage any risks created by these technologies on september 18 2008 the us food and drug administration fda released draft guidance on how it intends to regula ge animals and products fda intends to do so under its existing statutory author ity and regulations generally gederived foods for example will be regulated lik nonge foods if their composition does not differ from their conventi onal counter parts they will not have to be labeled nonetheless developers of ge animal s which will have to be accompanied by labeling and of gederived products will have to gain fda premarket approval although animal biotechnology involves many techniques other than cloning this latter technology has attracted the mo st attention in 2007 and 2008 final risk assessment and industry guidance on the safe ty of meat and milk from cloned cattle pigs and goats and their offspring were released january 15 2008 by fda the documents generally echoe d the fdas december 28 2006 draft risk assessment which found that such products are as safe to eat as those of conventionally bred animals the fda also concluded that cloning poses the same risks to animal health as those found in animals created throug h other assisted reproductive technologies although the frequency of such problems is higher in cloning scientists stress that cloning is an assisted reproduction t echnique that does not involve any transfer or alteration of genes through ge the ag ency said it was longer asking industry to refrain voluntarily from marketing the products of cloned animals and their offspring although the us department of agriculture usda has since asked that it be continued for products from clones but not from the offspring of clones the senatepassed version of the 2007 2008 farm bill would have delayed the fda final risk assessment and continued the marketing moratorium until completion of newly mandated studies on the safety and on the market impacts of introducing such products this language was not retained in the enact ed version of the bill pl 110234 hr 4855 is pending house bill with this study

given the breadth of the term anima l biotechnology one might reasonably define it to include thousands of year s of humans selectively breeding animals observing desirable animal traits and attempting to breed those traits into successive lines of animals one of the first modern forms of assisted reproductive technology art was artificial insemination ai ai has been long established as technological advance in traditional selec tive breeding and an important adjunct to the development of modern industrial an imal production especially in dairy and poultry ai was adopted by producers

synchronization which improves the efficiency of ai by more accurately controlling when female was in heat is so an important animal biotechnology with the development in the 1970s and patenting in the 1980s of recombinant dna techniques and the subsequent analysis of genes their resulting proteins and the role played by the proteins in animal biochemical pr ocesses functional genomics modern biotechnology is increasin gly equipped with set of sophisticated tools holding the promise of transforming the selective breeding of animals the range of new techniques nd technologies could transf orm animal biotechnology in ways that plant biotechnology was transformed in the 1980s and 1990s modern animal biotechnology is devel oping against the background of public experience with plant biotechnology and controversy over the technologies may be continuing feature of animal biotechnolog development not least because of the closer connection between humans and some animals and the belief that techniques developed for animals are only step away from application to humans some of the better known animal biotechnologie s follow number of them are types of assisted reproductive

biotechnology developing rapi dly and with significant public controversy most people think of cloning as the creation of an organism that is genetically identical to another one however scien tists use the term more broa dly to refer to production not only of such organisms but also of gene tically identical cells and to replication of dna and other molecules it also refe rs to form of reproduction found naturally in many singlecelled organi sms as well as plants and animals those differences in meaning and usage have caused some c onfusion in public bate about cloning where the main area of controversy relate s to artificial cloning involving higher organisms including humans7 gene knockout this is technique where re searchers inactivate or knock out gene by replacing it or disrupting it with an artificial piece of dna in order to determine what that particular gene does eg cause or protect against some disease alter metabolism and so fort h knockout mouse is laboratory

including the information to be required of developers under the draft guidance fda will examine both the direct toxicity including allergenicity potential of food from ge an imal as well as any indirect toxicity generally food and feed w ill be considered safe if the composition of edible materials from the ge animal can be shown to be as safe as from nonge animal the labeling requirements for gederived foods would be the same as for other foods fda has oversight over the labeli ng of seafood dairy products and whole shell eggs and usda over the labeling of most meat pou ltry and egg

from an adult called somatic cell nuclear transfer or scnt rather than undifferentiated cells from an embryo embryonic nt cloning in animal agriculture is generally not applied in isolation from other biotechnologies such as genetic engineering scientists note that cloning does not require fertilization and is not by itself form of genetic engineering ie altering removing or inserting genes into an

6 of the embryos transferred to recipient cows resulted in healthy longterm surv iving clones according to 2005 report18 the european food safety authority efsa recently reported that overall success rates vary by species ranging from 05 to 519 success rates are said to be improving however as more efficient cloning technologies which can overcome the ra nge of cloning abnormalities that have resulted from scnt are introduced they could provide new opportunities in human medicine agriculture and animal welfare this is the focus of much of the current international animal bi otechnology research the efsa draft scientific opinion estimated the number of live clones worldwide in 2007 to be less than 4000 cattle and 1500 pigs of which about 750 cattle and 10 pig clones were in the

existing animal is introduced to an oöcyte cell that is the immediate precursor of mature egg that has had its nucleus and thus its genome removed and then following some manipulations is induced to start replicating if all goes well the dividing cell is implanted into female animal dam continues to deve lop normally and is deliver ed just as any newborn animal cloning risk assessment p 20 whats the difference between cloned and ge animal clones covered by fdas january 2008 ri sk assessment and guidance are just clones that is they are copies of individual conventi onallybred animals and do not contain any rdna constructs what can be confusing is that an animal clone can be genetically engin eered ie have an rdna construct introduced into it and ge animal can be reproduced by cloning the

examined two important questions the safety of food from cloned animals and their progeny and the effects of the process on the health of these animals fda officials stressed th at the risk assessment did not address any other issues such as the social and ethical aspects of cloning or consumer acceptance of cloned animal products the risk asse ssment also focused only on cloning from nontransgenic cells this ri sk assessment is now final25 the final risk assessmen t concluded as had the december 26 2006 draft that the meat and milk of clones of adult cattle pigs and goats and the meat and milk from the offspring of these clones were as safe for human consumption as the food from conventionally bred animals th fda added that not enough data were available to reach the same conclusions about sheep clones r other species and recommended that they not yet be used fo r human food the risk assessment arrived at these conclusions after analyzing physiol ogical anatomical health and behavioral data on the animals and evaluating available information on the chemical composition of their milk and meat fda said its final assessment was peer reviewed by an independent panel of expe rts who agreed with the findings the final assessment also took into account many thousands of public comments and additional data that became available since the draft was prepared the agency said the agency said it would not require an special measures including labeling relating to the use of food products or an imal feed derived fro m cloned cattle goats and pigs because they are different from food derived fro m conventionally bred animals should producer express desire for voluntary labeling eg this product is clonefree it will be considered on casebycase basis to ensure compliance with statutory requirements that labe ling be truthful and not misleading26 the industry guidance states that products from the offspring of cloned animals of any species are suitable for f ood or feed consumption upon release of the 2006 proposed assessm ent fda officials said they were continuing to ask livestock breeders and producers to keep food products from cloned animals and their offspring out of comme rce this moratorium was announced in july 2001 and remained in effect until th final guidance was released in january 2008 although the fda moratorium is longer in effect usda has since been encouraging technology providers to main tain the voluntary moratorium but for products from cloned animals only food products from cloned animals offspring would not be similarly constrained

the clones themselves but rather from their sexually reproduced offspring cloned animals like other elite breeding animals such as prized bull are too valuable to use for f ood production except possibly when they reach the end of their productive lives the fda observed that it can cost 20000 or more to produce one such animal one ongoing question has been whether in fact milk and meat from the offspring of clones are entering the food supply several pr ess accounts have quoted farmers and others who say th ey have sold such offspring to be slaughtered for food and that the total number nationwide may be in the hundreds or even thousands on the other hand those numbers would amount to small fr action of the total number of us livestock slaughtered eg 34 million cattle and 109 million hogs in 200728 fdas january 2008 risk assessment did c onclude that some animals involved in cloning notably cattle and sheep surrogate dams and some clones are at greater health risk than conventional animals while the types of animal health problems observed in cloned animals are different than those found with other assisted reproductive technologies thes problems appear more frequently in cloning than in the other technologies such problems incl ude late gestational complications in the surrogate mothers and increased risk of mortality and morbidity in calf and lamb clones that are apparently caused mainly by large offspring syndrome swine and goat clones and their mothers do not ppear to experience any additional cloning related problems fda reported fda found that livestock clones as gr oup tend to have more health problems and death rates at or right after birth ho wever the risk asse ssment added that most animals surviving the neonatal period appear to grow and deve lop normally and that increased risk of adverse health effect s have been reported in clones approaching reproductive maturity the agency said that the technology was too new to draw any conclusions on the relative l ongevity of livestock clones european views cloning currently is not in commercial use in europe nor is there any specific authorization pro cedure in the european union for products from cloned animals29 the european food safety authority efsa on july 24 2008 released its scientific opinion on the food safety animal health and welfare and environmental impacts of

unchanged in clones there is indication that differe nces exist in terms of food safety between food products from healthy ca ttle and pig clones and their progeny compared with those from healthy conventionallybred animals as with fda the efsa conclusion is based on an examination of compositional and nut ritional data the probability for the presence of novel constituents the health status of the animal and available data on toxicity llergenicity and microbiology efsa agreed that scnt can be ccessful reproductive technique although death and disease rates of clones are signif icantly higher than those of conventionally reproduced animals efsa noted that surro gate dams have high er rates of failed pregnancies and other problems sign ificant proportion of cl ones mainly within the juvenile period for bovines and perina tal period for pigs has been found to be adversely affected often seve rely and with fatal outcome most clones that survive the perinatal period are norma l and healthy however adverse health effects were not observed in the offspring of clones lthough studies have not been conducted for their entire lifespans30 efsa also found indication of ne w or additional nvironmental risks compared with conven tionally bred animals the efsa report findings are being used by the european commission ec the european parliament and member states as they discuss their policies regarding animal cloning there is disagreement over the issue among officials in the various european bodies this was illustrated wh the european parliament in early september 2008 approved resolution asking the ec to propose comprehensive ban on cloning animals for food out of animal health and welfare and ethical concerns31 other views critics including number of consumer advocacy and animal rights groups oppose the use of cloned an imals and their offspring for food in october 2006 coalition formally petitione d the fda to impose moratorium on producing foods fro m cloned animals and to establish rules for mandatory pre market review and approval of cloned foods by regulatin g clones as new drugs under the food and drug act these consumer nd animal welfare groups contend that fda has ignored or minimized number of f ood safety and anima l welfare problems these include the treatment of surrogate mothers with high doses of hormones and their clone

yet be ready for widespread animal cloning 2006 poll commissioned by the pew initiative on food and biotechnology for example found that americans generally were not well informed about animal cloning but 64 of those questioned are uncomfortable with it fortythree percent of american s believed that foods from clones are unsafe the survey found cloning opponents cite these types of findings to argue that products from cloned animals s hould be labeled so that consumers could avoid them if they wanted to some critics have urged the president to halt all fda actions on cloning until national panel that includes ethicists and religious leaders can consider the ethical and other social issues that they believe the technology has raised the nrc animal biotechnology report had stated that embryonic splitting and nuclear transfer using embryonic not adu lt cells were performed with some dairy cows to successfully produce genetically valuable offspring that were milked commercially and whose milk and meat di d enter the food supply few concerns were raised by nrc authors about using th types of cloned animals for food since they are generally believed to pose low level of food safety concern however evaluating clonedanimal food composition would be prudent to minimize any food safety concerns the products of offspr ing of cloned animals were regarded as posing food safety concern because th ey are the result of natural matings33 other issues notably consumer acceptance social values and animal welfare could eventually overshadow any lingering questions about human health other policy concerns the following are among the policy concerns that have arisen along with the development of new biotec hnologies in animal agriculture some may be more applicable to gerelated t echnologies than to cloning per although others like social acceptance and animal welfare concerns may apply to both environmental issues environmental concerns arising from emerging

impacts of genetically alte red animals escape survival and gene flow into wild populations were identified as major concerns of most concern to the nrc committee was the escape into the environment of super salmon that have been genetically modified for rapid grow th and the likelihood that they could then breed with wild populations in the environment34 other genetically altered animals such as fish insects and shellfish could also potentially escape into natural environments and become fe ral disrupt ecosystems or introduce novel genes in natural population the fda draft guidance on ge

animals genetically engineered for nonfood products like pharmaceuticals or replacement organs might be of concern if such animals entered or affected the food supply consumer and social acceptance criteria for selecting desirable traits to be produced through transgenic animals will likely be based on the demand for specific commercial characteristics even if scientific evidence is convincing that ge and cloned animal products are safe nd beneficial for human consumption or economically valuable to producers other concerns may limit marketplace and consumer acceptance polls in recent years

survey believe that regulators should take into account ethical and moral considerations see also the 2006 pew findings on cloning under cloning policy developments section on other views consumers may be less willing to accept th practice of genetically modifying animals than plants some have argued obs erving that people relate differently to animals which many recognize as sentient beings some observe rs have expressed the concern that cloning farm animals might lead more quickly to human and pet cloning which those observers oppose othe rs believe that modifying animals for example to save human lives through xe notransplantation or the production of some important drug might be more acceptable th an doing so simply to produce more or cheaper food further science alone cannot resolve ethi cal views that appear to vary widely some people irrespective of the applic ation of technology consider genetic engineering of animals fundamentally une thical others however hold that the ethical significance of an imal biotechnologies must derive from the risk and benefits to people the animals andor the environment yet another view focuses on the right of humans to know what they are eating or how their food or pharmaceuticals are being produced and therefore labeling becomes an issue to be addressed42 food industry leaders appear sensitiv to consumer unease with animal biotechnology in general and cloning in pa rticular many companies are not yet ready to process and sell meat and milk fro m transgenic and cloned animals because they believe consumers may view the products as less sa fe than more conventionally produced food products the food industry so does not want to be portrayed as overstepping any widely held ethical or moral concerns about the new technologies43 such observations led some skeptics of animal biotechnology to propose that the fda not only consider the science and safety issues but also these broader concerns in the area of human reproductiv health for example the fda and other federal agencies have invoke d particular moral argume nts either to reinforce scientific arguments or to counterbalance scie ntific evidence others believe that the fda should base its decisions only on scien tific evidence and perhaps some other body should be established to consider th ethical and cultural questions as

cult in the absence of an ethical framework44 labeling some believe that segrega ting and labeling the products of biotechnology in agriculture including m eat and milk would enable the consumer to choose whether or not to buy such pr oducts either segr egating and labeling biotechnology products or failing to do so could contribute to public suspicion that these products are flawed or different in some negative way which may lead to contradictory policy decisions45 opponents of labeling argue that biotechnology products essentially are the same as more conventional products and are subjected to the same rigorous safety standards and therefore s hould be treated differently in the marketplace study by usdas economic research service reported that consumers willingness to pay for food ite m declines when the food label indicates that it was produced with the aid of biotechnology46 in december 2007 two leading us liv estock cloning companies announced they were creating voluntary system for tracking cloned animals the program which they asserted is designed to fac ilitate marketing claims is to involve national registry providing for the individual identification of each cloned animal affidavits that owners will sign committing to proper marketing and disposal of such animals and monetary deposits to be returned when such commitments are fulfilled consumer organizations immedi ately criticized th initiative noting that it would not track the offspring of cloned animals and was not mandatory47 however fierce debate continues regarding even the voluntary labeling of products to denote that they are not derived from biotechnology notably the use of socalled rbstfree labels on dairy products although fda cleared rbst as safe for commercial use in 1994 and it has been widely adopted by us dairy farmers the substance continues to be viewed skeptically by some consumer advocates they have convinced number of dairy processors nd retailers to label their products as free of added bst manuf actured through the use of recombinant dna technology fda guidance permits such labeling so long as it is not misleading is presented in the proper context and is adequately

animals are not eligible to be labeled as organic under its national organic program nop while cautioning that the organics program is marketing not food safety program usda also noted cloning as production method is incompatible with the organic foods production act and is prohibited under the nop regulations50 however the status of products from clone offspring is less clear the department noted that usdas agricultural marketing service where the nop is located was preparing rulemaking to address the organic status of such offspring51 animal welfare some aspects of gene tran sfer and of cloning have the potential to create infectious disease haza rds andor impaired reproduction looming large in the ethical debate are questions about whether genetic modifications cloning and other technologies stress animals unnecessarily subject them to higher rates of disease and injury and hasten death52 the nrc animal agriculture report noted for example that ruminants produced by in vitro culture or nuclear cell transfer methods tend to have higher birth weights and longer gestati on periods than those produced by artificial insemin ation creating potential calving problems nuclear transfer techniques to propagate gene tic modifications may increas risks to the reproductive health and welfare of both the surrogate female animals and their transgenic offspring the report cited other evidence of problems such as anatomical physiological or behavioral abnorma lities in many transgenic animals53 s m scientists have countered that animal welfare problems have been exaggerated

see convincing arguments to justify the production of food from clones and their offspring if such products were to be allowed into the market certain requirements regarding food safety an imal welfare and traceability should be met the group added54 genetic diversity could the introduction of few genetically altered or cloned superspecies bring too much genetic uniformity to herds as genetic diversity declines herds could be more susceptible to diseases leading to large production losses andor much heavier use of antibiotics and ot her animal drugs to treat them some have argued related concern is that relative handful of elite producers or breeders might hold the proprietary rights to these species to the disadvantage of many farmer s and ranchers some anima l biotechnology researchers have pointed to the potential importance of preserving unaltered germlines in domestic animals because they could prove to be an invaluable gene bank in the event that novel infectious diseases or i nheritable genetic def ects were inadvertently introduced into modified subpopulations as consequence of genetic modification trade issues if the united states becomes the first country to approve food products from cloned animals how might th decision affect us exports any exports of the products of animal biotec hnology would presumably encounter wide spectrum of foreign regulatory regimes some more restrictive than the us system for example the current european union restricti on on new biotechnology products is likely to encompass various restrictions on animal biotechnology

to ensure that trading partners are aware of whether or not they r eceive cloned or noncloned products58 congressional activity members of congress in the past have proposed various bills aimed at more closely regulating the products of agricultu ral biotechnology re quiring such products to be labeled and providing means to recover any damages caused by the technology none of these past bills ppears to have focuse d on transgenic animals or cloned animals specifically although b ills have been offered to prohibit human cloning as with human cloning ethical issues concerning animal clones and other animal biotechnologies also may continue to be visible public issues congress could be asked to play larger role in weighi ng the benefits and costs of these evolving technologies and to refine existing government oversight the release of the fda draft risk asse ssment in december 2006 just before the start of the 110th congress made it focal point for some members with an interest in the numerous consumer and production issues surrounding animal biotechnology in general and cloning in pa rticular during the first session this interest culminated in nonbinding language in explanator notes to accompany the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 strongly encouraging fda to continue the voluntary moratorium on marketing produc ts from cloned animals until the agency can evaluate the need for additional studies the report language takes note of the thousands of public comments received on the risk assessment many of which asked fda to first obtain additional info rmation and scientific peer review on potential health economic and trade impacts more specifically the explanatory notes state the house and senate appropriations committees strongly

usda officials said they are proceeding with the study of domestic agricultural and international trade economic implementations of commercialization the senatepassed version of the 2007 2008 farm b

health effects and costs attributable to milk from cloned animals with report to congress due within one year of enactment the study was to address whether there were sufficient number of studies to support the fda draft assessment and whether there were other pertinent ones that were not taken into account it would have included an evalua tion of potential public health effects and associated health care costs and an ev aluation of any consumer behavior and negative health and nutrition impacts resulting from decrease in dairy consumption if milk from cloned animals and their offspring is
