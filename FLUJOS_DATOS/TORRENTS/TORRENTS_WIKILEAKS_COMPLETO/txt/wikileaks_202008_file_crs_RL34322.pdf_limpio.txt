in the persian gulf region has long been national security priority for the united states1 primary us objectives have included securing the free flow of the regions oil and natural gas to international markets and supporting allied regional governments in their efforts to balance external threats and ma intain internal security in pursuit of these objectives successive us administrations have demonstrated security commitments to the six countries of the gulf cooperation council gccsaudi arabia kuwait bahrain qatar the united arab emirates and oman significant arms sales 2 prolonged military training programs3 material prepositioning and basing arrangements4 joint exercises5 and direct military interventions6 have characterized us policy toward the gulf region the arab gulf countries founded the gulf cooperation council in 1981 as mechanism for resolving internal political and economic issues and coordinating multilateral security cooperation both of these goals supported the gcc members states fundamental desire to minimize the potential need for external intervention in gulf affairs throughout the 1990s us military posture in the gulf region and us attempts to promote gcc security coordination were designed to contain potential conventional military threats from iraq and iran in the late 1990s the clinton administration initiated program to promote cooperation to meet threats from weapons of mass destruction see below the emergence of sophisticated transnational terrorist and proliferation networks the removal of saddam husseins government in iraq and the relative strengthening of iran have now created more complex strategic environment the bush administration established the gulf security dialogue in may 2006 as mechanism for reinvigorating established usgcc defense cooperation mitigating emerging terrorism and proliferation threats and responding to changes in the regional strategic balance 1 direct statements of policy have underscored this priority such as president carters january 1980 state of the union address declaration that the united states would use any means necessary including military force to prevent any outside power from attempting to control the persian gulf 2 from the year of the gccs founding 1981 through september 30 2006 the united states delivered over 72 billion in weapons training equipment and related services to the six gcc countries through the governmenttogovernment foreign military sales program over 57 billion of these sales were made to saudi arabia note the aggregate figure includes deliveries made to the united arab emirates under commercial sales agreement for 80 f16 block 60 aircraft source defense security cooperation agency data september 30 2006 3 the us military training mission in saudi arabia and saudi arabian national guard modernization program have continued since the 1950s and 1970s respectively the programs are administered under bilateral memoranda 28 ust 2409 and 24 ust 1106 4 since 1990 the united states has signed or renewed prepositioning andor basing access agreements with each of the gcc countries except saudi arabia key us facilities in the region include the 5th fleet headquarters in manama bahrain us centcom command facilities in qatar and basing and port facilities in kuwait and the united arab emirates 5 us centcoms annual eagle resolve exercises bring u s and gcc military and security personnel together for joint training in simulated crisis scen arios the 2007 exercise was held in qatar and focused on missile defense and attack consequence management training 6 key examples include the reflagging of kuwaiti oil tankers in the 1980s the expulsion of iraqi forces from kuwait in the 1991 gulf war and the removal of saddam husseins regime in 2003 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34322g22g145g142g561g9g158g149g143g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g6g146g138g149g152 g144g158g142g561g138g151

coordination mechanism between the united states and the six countries of the gulf cooperation council the core objectives of the dialogue are the promotion of intragcc and gccus cooperation to meet common perceived threats the dialogue provides framework for us engagement with participating gcc countries in the following six areas 1 the improvement of gcc defense capabilities and interoperability 2 regional security issues such as the israelipalestinian conflict and lebanon 3 counterproliferation 4 counterterrorism and internal security 5 critical infrastructure protection and 6 iraq the dialogue serves as forum for us officials and their counterparts in participating gcc countries to discuss bilateral and multilateral initiatives to address issues in these areas on the us side gsd engagement is led jointly by assi stant secretaries in the department of states bureau of politicalmilitary affairs and in the office of the secretary of defense to date formal gsd discussions have been held with each country semiannually at the working level interagency representatives from the national security council us central command centcom the department of state the office of the secretary of defense and the joint staff carry out ongoing bilateral consultations with gcc officials in support of initiatives coordinated under the gsd administration officials have stressed that the dialogue is not intended to replace or detract from longstanding bilateral arrangemen ts between the united states and individual gcc countries but rather to ensure the compleme ntarity of ongoing effo rts and to promote new multilateral cooperation in the case of some gcc member states traditional bilateral coordination mechanisms such as established military to military coordination programs have not yet been replaced by interagency integrated gsd engagement

benefits of sustained us military presence in the persian gulf region with the material and political costs that such presence creates as result successive administrati ons have promoted intragcc and gccus cooperation as potential means of reducing regional dependence on us and allied forces over time the united states has supported gcc initiatives such as the creation of the small gcc multilateral force known as peninsula shield and the establishment of the gcc belt of cooperation air space monitoring network during the clinton administration the united states promoted bilateral and multilateral cooperation with the gcc countries to meet chemical and biological threats under the auspices of multipillar cooperative defense initiative 7 as such the establishment of the gulf security dialogue and the announcement of related arms sale proposals do not mark significant changes in the overall direction of us foreign policy in the region but rather the renewal and consolidation of policy trend that has continued over several decades 7 the initiative had five pillars active defense passive defe nse shared early warning consequence management and medical

mid1990s have prompted an evolution in the focus of us engageme nt with the gcc countries these changes are reflected in the priorities defined by the gulf security dialogue the elevation of counterterrorism and counterproliferation efforts ongside conventional military c ooperation signals that increased emphasis is now being placed on these issues it also suggests that us policy makers may be concerned that existing initiatives are not sufficient to address transnational threats effectively the inclusion of political consultations on iraq and regional security issues like israelipalestinian affairs in usgcc dialogue demonstrates that the united states has acknowledged the importance of these issues to the security calculations of the gcc countries terrorist threats to and attempted attacks on critical energy infrastructure in the gulf region have prompted the opening of discussions on securing key sites in spite of historic sensitivities regarding sovereignty and foreign participation in the regional energy industry to date efforts to promote intragcc and gccus security cooperation have faced significant challenges some of which remain relevant in the current strategic environment the gcc countries have unique perspectives on the various security threats they face and on the preferability of various policy responses although complex transnational threats may compel the gcc countries to pursue more cooperative policies some gcc leaders appear to remain reluctant to fully embrace integrated responses arab concern about iranian intentions and military capabilities is evident but the gcc countries continue to reach out to iranian leaders to avoid the appearance of siding as consolidated bloc with the united states against their gulf neighbor the gcc countries have endorsed the international compact for iraq and have made pledges to iraq regarding debt forgiveness and diplomatic representation however some regional governments led by sunni arabs may continue to limit their engagement with the iraqi government based on perceptions that some shiite iraqi leaders are motivated by sectarian interests intragovernmental politics limit the willingness of some gcc members to engage in joint military and interagency consultations both within their own government and with the united states through the gulf security dialogue the stability and security of the persian gulf region and its energy resources will likely remain us national security priorities for the foreseeable future key short and mediumterm concerns include evolving terrorism and proliferation threats iranian investment in ballistic missile and nuclear technology and growing interest in gulf security from china russia and india looking forward congress may seek to influence us foreign policy toward the gcc countries through the appropriation of funds for programs coordinated under the gulf security dialogue and the evaluation of related arms sale proposals traditional congressional concerns about preserving israels socalled qualitative military advantage are likely to persist members also may judge appropriations requests and arms sale proposals in relation to their ability to secure new us objectives in changing security environment

countries however as in past debates some members simultaneously express concern about the potential fate of us weaponry and threats to us forces in the region should currently allied gulf governments suffer abrupt hostile regime changes others also argue that sales of sophisticated weaponry to the gcc countries may erode israels qualitative edge over its arab neighbors in the event of potential
