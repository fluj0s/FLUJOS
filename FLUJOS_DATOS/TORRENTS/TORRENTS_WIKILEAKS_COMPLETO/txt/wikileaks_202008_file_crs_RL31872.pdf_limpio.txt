uavs have been referred to in many ways rpvs remotely piloted vehicle dr ones robot planes and pilotle ss aircraft are few of the terms that have been used most of ten called uavs they are defined by the department of defense dod as powered aerial vehicles that do not carry human operator use aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely can be expendable or recoverable and can carry lethal or nonlethal payload ballistic or semiballistic vehicles cr uise missiles and artillery projectiles are not considered uavs by the dod definition1 drones differ from rpvs in that they are designed to fly autonomously uavs are either described as single air vehicle with associated surveillance sens ors or uav system uas which usually consists of three to six air vehicles ground control station and support equipment the military use of uavs in recent conflic ts such as iraq 2003 afghanistan 2001 and kosovo 1999 has opened the ey of many to the advantages and disadvantages provided by unmanned airc raft uavs regularly make national headlines as they are used to perform task s historically performed by manned aircraft uavs are thought to offer two main advant ages over manned aircraft they eliminate the risk to pilots life and their aerona utical capabilities such as endurance are not bound by human limitations uavs may also be cheaper to procure and operate than manned aircraft uavs protect the lives of pilots by performing the 3d missions those dull dirty or dangerous missions that do not require pilot in the cockpit however the lower procurement cost of uavs must be weighed against their greater proclivity to crash while the minimized risk should be weighed against the dangers inherent in having an unmanned vehicle flying in airspace shared with manned assets there are number of reasons why the employment of uavs has recently grown navigation and communication tec hnology is now available that wasnt available just few short years ago some say that the services socalled silk scarf syndrome of preferring manned aviati on over unmanned has diminished as uavs entered the mainstream although only recently procured in significant numbers by the united states uavs have had centuryold histor in aviation first included in janes all the worlds aircraft in 1920 uavs were tested during world war i but not used in combat

exam ple in 1996 the house armed services committee hasc supported legislation directing dod to weaponize both the predator and hunter but dod opposed the initiative6 the scope of congresss support and confidence in uav technology can be gleaned from prediction in the report accompanying the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 which stated that within ten years onethird of us military operational deep strike aircraft will be unmanned7 congressional considerations in recent years the pace of uav devel opment has accelerated and the scope of uav missions and applications has expanded how should these efforts be managed so that they are costefficient effective and interoperable in its eagerness to deploy uavs does dod risk duplication of effo rt between various programs are dod uav acquisition plans responsive to congressional direction investment priorities could change as the introduction of uavs into the us inventory shifts the balance between manned and unmanned capabilities congress as part of its defense oversight re sponsibilities may assess dods current uav efforts to verify that they match up w ith new investment go als and strategies conventional wisdom states that uavs are cheap or cost effective is this true today how do uav costs compare to manned aircraft costs uavs have traditionally been used fo r reconnaissance and surveillance but today they are being employed in roles and applications that their designers never envisioned the unanticipated flexibility and capability of uavs has led some analysts to suggest that more if not most of the missions currently undertaken by manned aircraft could be turned over to unmanned aerial platform s and that manned and unmanned aircraft could operate togeth er congress may have to contemplate the replacement of significant portion of the manned aircraft fleet with unmanned aircraft that have yet to be designed the defining characteristic of uavs is that they are unmanned if uavs are introduced into the force in large numbers might personnel issues arise recruitment and retention is perennial congressional i ssue that may be receiving increased attention due to the operational stresses associated with the global war on terrorism what impact might wide sp read deployment of uavs have on military personnelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31872crs4 8 for more comprehensive treatment of these uav programs see the current dod uav programs section below 9 note that to avoid accounting issues thes inventories do not include small uavs micro uavs or lighterthanair platforms industrial base issues also need to be considered if defense companies devote more of their time and expenses to develop unmanned aircraft will the skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft design erode those who argue that uavs will replace manned aircraft in the future are not as concerned with the industrial base issue as those who feel manned aircraft will still be needed to combat future threats as us companies compete for business in growing international uav marketplace concerns about the proliferati on of these systems may grow are steps required and if so what might they be to control the spread of uavs as part of its defense and foreign policy oversight congress may examine whether balance must be struck between supporting legitimate us exports and curbing the spread of uav technologies to dangerous groups or countries pace of uav acquisition nd scope of missions or applications undeniably uavs are being developed procured and fielded in growing numbers the diversity of designs and appli cations is also accelerating considering this growth many in congress may wish to evaluate the management of uavs are uavs being developed fast enough are they being developed too fast has dod developed an appropriate pl an and structure for incorporating uavs into future military capabilities uav programs range from the combat test ed pioneer hunter predator and global hawk to the not yet tested the air force and navys unmanned combat air vehicles sizes and ranges of uavs also vary greatly the wasp micro uav at 8 inches long has combat radius of 5 na utical miles while the

dods uav research and development r d funding has also grown for variety of reasons uavs are considered growth industry many uavs are relatively inexpensive to produce and new technology in miniaturization has helped accelerate the development of many uav types rd funding in fy2006 for uavs is more than double the total procurement funding for uavs this suggests that accelerated

it appears from statements and internal recommendations the pace of uav production will either continue or accelerate in the coming years when asked to study dods uav programs the defense science

it saw as leisurely rate of uav ac quisition and encouraged it to speed up this pace or speed up the incorporation of cer tain capabilities for example the national defense authorization act for

increased procurement and pplication of uavs for nonmilitary roles for example house homeland security committee chairman representative peter king was reported to have said that uavs are underutiliz ed by the department of homeland security and should play larger role in border security16 on the other hand congress has also ex pressed concern that dods growing enthusiasm may well lead to situation in which there is clear path toward the future of uavs17 some critics have expressed concern that an overly ambitious pace could affect the quality of the end pr oduct and the efficiency of the acquisition process fast pace could make congressi onal oversight much more difficult which could allow uav programs to exceed cost or to stray from the design objective as representative curt weldon cautioned aggressively fielding new types of ve hicles and even building more of the same type of vehicle may be premature we must feel confident that we have adequately addressed some of the fundamentals to ensure that unmanned air systems are designed and fielded consistent with the common communications architecture and that common standards are established for operations some services are buying million dollar uavs using operations and maintenance funding that has never been specifically authorized for uavs and for which appropriations have never been made other services are leasing uav rvices for combat operations using operations and maintenance accounts and some services have effectively reduced congressional oversight by establishing uav projects within multibillion dollar multiproject aggregated program requests 18 the global hawks ambitious pace may be an example of the dilemma representative wel don describe d 2004 government accountability office gao report cites crowde d production schedule and aggr essive funding strategy as one reason for the immaturity of veral critical technologies for the global hawk program19 the report indicates that deceleration

to notify congress when cost growth on major acquisition program reaches 15 if the cost growth hits 25 nunnmccurdy requires dod to justify continuing the progra m based on three main criteria its importance to us national security the lack of viable alternative and evidence that the problems that continuedhawks problems are exceptional they coul d argue that the rapid rate of production of the hunter in the past and the predator currently are evidence that fast pace can be extremely efficient and produce high quality aircraft while supporting uav programs in gene ral and even challenging dod to pursue uavs more aggressively many in c ongress appear to want assurances that taxpayer dollars are being well spent for example section 142 of the fy2006 defense authorization act hr 1815 h rept 10989 p123 would preclude procurement of new unmanned aerial vehicl systems by the military services without the written approval of the under secretar of defense for acquisition technology and logistics uav management issues in addition to establishing acquisition pace and scope of applicati on one crucial congressional task may be to determine whether dods administrative processes and lines of authority within the acquisition process are effective for uav development and acquisition the management of dod s development and acquisition programs has received heightened attention in the 108th and 109th congresses the air forces attempt to lease 100 kc767 ta nker aircraft and many aspects of the armys future combat system fcs have focused c ongressional scrutiny on the mechanics of dods acquisition process20 because uavs are acquired by all four of the military services and the us special opera tions command and because uavs appear to be acquired at an accelerated rate and for growing list of applications it appears that great potential exists for duplication of effort this leads many to call for centralization of uav acquisition authority to ensure unity of effort and reduce chances for wasteful duplicati on of effort on the other hand if uav efforts are too centralized some fear that compe tition and innovation ma be repressed another management issue pertains to cost uavs are developed and procured through the same acquisition system as ma nned aircraft and they appear to suffer from similar cost growth once viewed as cheap alternative to manned aircraft or even poor mans airforce some uavs ar beginning to rival manned aircraft in cost according to dods most recent estimate the global wk program will cost 65 billion to purchase 51 aircraft pr ogram unit acquisition cost of 128 million per uav the program has seen 194 million in development cost overruns triggering nunnmccurdy breach due to an average unit cost growth of 18 percent per airframe and

defense authorization act for fisc year 1993 hrept 102966 p635much of uav cost growth appears to be attributable to factors that have plagued manned aircraft programs such as mission creep and inconsistent management practices globa l hawk costs for example have been driven up by adding multiple sensors which themselves increase cost but also require larger wings and more powerful engines to carry the increased weight which also increases cost originally global hawk was intende d to carry one primary kind of sensor at time fleet of these uavs would provide mix of sensors to make global hawk more analogous to the u2 aircra ft dod changed the requirement so that global hawk is to carry two or more primary sensors which has increased the uavs price22 originally considered relatively m odest uav the joint unmanned combat air system jucas has evolved into large long range aircraft with heavy payload which has increased cost furt her dod has cut over 1 billion from the jucas budget and has m oved management of the program from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa to the air force cutting the jucas budget topline may reduce the total number or aircraft to be procured but can also increase the cost per aircraft chan ging management responsibility can also contribute to cost growth via lack of coherent direction and changes in requirements and priority the frequent change and realignment of dods organizations with role in uav development illustrates the difficultie s of establishing comprehensive uav management system over the years ma nagement of uav prog rams has gone full circle from the military services to navyrun joint program office jpo to the defense airborne reconnaissa nce office daro and then back to the services under the auspices of

onestop shop that takes look at all the possibilities for common operating systems and the best ways to use uavs35 if the intent of these bodies are simply to serve as onestop checkpoints in th uav development process instead of the centralized monitoring and oversight authority envisioned by the gao then questions may arise over where the final management authority resides within these bodies or with each of the services the task of finding adequate answers to these problems may fall on the shoulders of congress in the coming years outside of the current management stru cture does our defense establishment have an adequate plan or framework for how uavs will fit into the future of us warfighting the joint uav task force released in 2001 and 2002 the uav roadmap and follow up in

in march of 2005 prior to the release of the updated uas roadmap the gao called upon the department of defense to estab lish binding and authoritative strategic plan citing the 2002 roadmap failure to ou tline the interservice strategic goals for uavs and its lack of clearly defined investme nt priorities36 the 2005 uas roadmap reiterates its pr edecessors mandate and scope it states that its purpose is part of an oversight service in which the intent is to give strong guidance in such crossprogram areas as standards velopment and other interoperability solutions37 furthermore the road map neither authorizes specific uas nor prioritizes the requirements it does however identify future windows when technology should become available to enable new capabilities linked to warfighters needs to be inco rporated into current or planned uas38 like its predecessor the roadmap only provide s guidance and refrains from establishing authoritative blueprint for the future of uav development

overarching investment plan several relevant questions seem apparent how is uav cost qua ntified what is the most effective balance in spending between uavs nd manned aircraft how should dod congress and the uav manufact urers balance cost with capability finally what areas of investment are the most important to maximize uav capabilities quantifying and characterizing cost has proven to be complicated task for the members of the uav community yet would n eed to be assessed in an exploration of uav cost efficiency39 as with most aircraft uav costs can be depicted by different measurements two of the most frequently cited cost descriptions are flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost pauc according to the air forces system command afsc cost estimating handbook an air vehicles flyaway cost includes prime mission equipment sensor payload propulsion mechanics and body design systems engineering program management and allowances for engineering changes and warranties40 in contrast the pauc as described by the government accountab ility office is the total of all acquisitionrelated appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured end items which takes into account acquisition cost from previous years that tend to be more than the current year acquisition cost41 the difference between global hawks pauc and flyaway co st demonstrates the wide discrepancy between thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31872crs15 42 flyaway cost osd aircraft procuremen t air force ba 04 other aircraft fy2005 february 2004 high altitude endurance

in orde r to maximize their performance yet none of these are requisite for flight feasibly an f16 needs pilot in the cockpit and littleelse uavs with the exception of the few autonomous flight models require constant intervention and control from ground crew the probability that an f16 could sustain flight without communication from its ground crew is relatively high whereas the lack of communication between the ground operators and the uav yields significantly low probability of sustained flight cost descriptions global hawks flyaway cost for fy2005 was 641 million while its pauc is 1287 million42 when compared to other aircraft the cost of an individual remotely piloted vehicle can be misleading uavs operate as part of system which generally consist of ground control station ground cr ew including remote pilots and sensor operators communication links and often other air vehicles unlike manned aircraft such as an f16 these supporting elements are requisite for the vehicles flight43 consequently analysts comparing uav co sts to manned aircraft may need to consider the cost of the supporting elemen ts and operational infra structure that make up the complete unmanned aviation system monitoring or evaluating uav costs can also be complicated by budgeting conventions while uavs can be found in the aircraft procurement air force account in that services budget request documentation the army includes its uav funding requests in other procurement army this account contains broad range of dissimilar items to be proc ured also because most uavs conduct intelligence surveillance nd reconnaissance missions so portion of their costs are covered in the intelligence budget rather than the dod budget which complicates building complete picture of cost once an adequate and uniform cost comparison mechanism or definition has been established the next step for congress may be to identify an appropriate balance in spending between uavs and manned airc raft as result of the apparent ascension of uavs to permanent position in the uss military aircraft inventory one logical question should be how much should be spent on uavs in relation to manned aircraft if the upward tre nd in uav funding continues through 2010 as shown in figure 3 dod is projected to have spent upwards of 18 billion on procurement rdte operations and maintenance for uavs

cost savings are often neglig ible if one consider s that money saved by not having pilot in the cockpit must be applied to the ground cockpit of the uav aircrew operating the uav from the ground cont rol station another cost question concerns personnel do uav pilots cost less to train and keep proficient than pilots of manned aircraft45 so although the air vehicle might be cheaper than manned aircraft the uav system as whole is not always less expensive46 additionally uavs have hi gher attrition rate and wer reliability rate than manned aircraft which means that the operation and maintenance costs can be higher on the other hand uav ground control stations are capable of simultaneously flying multiple uavs somewh at restoring the advantage in cost to the unmanned system47 congress has noted that while the acquisition per unit cost may be relatively small in the aggregate the acquisition cost rivals the investment in other larger weapon systems48 two studies have addressed the headt head manned vs unmanned cost issue the first cbo study showed that repl acing army manned ttack helicopters with ucavs would produce significant saving s in steadystate procurement costs relative to current plans49 dod also studied the comparative costs of manned vs unmanned aircraft in their uav roadmap 2000 it found that development costs were essentially the same while there was cost savings in procurement costs when an f16 was compared to an unmanned combat aerial vehicle ucav50 assuming that funding balance is struck between manned and unmanned vehicles how then will dod juggle cost with capability the osd has cited this question as one of its most pressing cha llenges significant concern with some uavs is their rising price tag in march 9 2005 hearing for example

threshold does an expendable uav cost too much to lose sensors have consistently increased the cost of th air vehicle according to former air force secretary james roche52 the inexpensive design of small uav air vehicles like the desert hawk and dragon eye are dwarfed by the cost of the lightweight electro opticalinfrared cameras that make up their payloads on the other end of the size spectrum the rq4 b second generation gl obal hawks sensor payload represents approximately 54 percent of the vehicles flyaway cost which does not include the cost of the increased wingspan that shoulders the extra 1000 pounds of sensor suites53 these costs are increasing due to the basic law of supply and demand growing demand matched with lack of co mmercial sensor equi valents means that uav sensor producers face little competition which would help keep costs down growing sensor costs have prompt ed some to recommend equipping uavs with selfprotection devices suggestin g those uavs are longer considered expendable consequently there are two schools of thought for uav employment that could help balance cost with capability one is to field many smaller less expensive and less capable uavs contro lled through highly interconnected communications network54 one example of this inve stment approach is the developmental armys future combat system which networks several relatively inexpensive uavs like the raven the sha dow and the fire scout with 18 other weapons platforms none of these uavs can individually shoulder all of the air duties required by the system yet the robus t communications network is expected to distribute the mission duties to allow each platform to provide its specialized task55 second approach advocates fielding fewer more expensive and more capable uavs that are less networked with other systems such as the autonomous global hawk the global hawk serves as high altitude allinone surveillance platform capable of staying aloft for days at time yet does not operate in concert with any of its fellow uav peers since 2003 progra ms at both ends of this spectrum have experienced delays and reduction in fundi ng the armys future combat system has experienced delays due to signifi cant management and technology issues similarly the highly capable global hawk and the jucas program have risen in cost and been consumed by apparent ma nagement

pace of the dvancement of interoperability recently acting chief of acquisitions for the department of defense michael wynne declared that the lack of interoperability could be one of the pitfalls that causes dod to fall out of love with uavs unless the matter was resolved soon57 the future plans for uav usage within the framework of rger battlefield operations and more interconnected and potentially jointse rvice combat systems require uavs to seamlessly communicate between each other and numerous different ground components and to also be compatible with as equally numerous ground control systems the lack of interconnectivity at these levels have often complicated missions to the point of reducing their ffectiveness as dyke weatherington head of dods uav planning taskforce noted in 2004 there have been cases where services uav if it could ve gotten data to another service another component it may have provided better situational awareness on specific threat in specific area that might have resulted in different measures being taken58 advancing the interoperab ility of uavs has been critical part of the osds investment plans the department of defense has pushed forward with the establishment of intercommunication be tween similar uavs as vehicle to help facilitate interoperability among four categories59 first dod hopes to integrate an adequate interface for

competition for existing bandwidth may render the expansion of uav applications infeasible and leave ma ny platforms grounde d ultimately the requirement for bandwidth grows with every war the us

attractive and innovative technological priorities in the industry is to enable one ground operator to pilot several uavs at once at the 2003 paris airshow vice president of boeings inte grated defense advanced systems mike heinz said we have to reduce operator wo rkload thats been real thorn in our side typically we have d multiple operators per vehi cle but where we want to go is multiple vehicles per operator73 currently most uavs require at least two ground operators one to pilot the vehicle nd another control the sensors the end goal for uav manufactures and users is to reduce the to 21 operatorvehicle ratio and eventually to elevate the autonomy and interoperability of uav to the point where two or more vehicles can be controlle d by one operator if this technological feat is established the advantage of uavs as forcemultiplier on the battle field could provide dramatic change in combat capability many believe that the pro cess of achieving this goal would most likely require significant time and investments as the 2005 uas roadmap notes getting groups of ua to team or swarm in or der to accomplish an objective will require significant investment in control technolog ies with specific re ference to distributed control technologies 74 considering the two operator system currently in place for most uavs the logical approach to reaching this technological advancement is to first invest in the autonomous flight cap abilities of the uavs so as to reduce the workload for uavs the global hawk nd the scan eagle possess significant automate flight capabilities but their degree of actual flight aut onomy can be debated due to the uavs need for contin uous operator intervention in poor weather conditions the osd quantifies the degr ee of uav

investing in the rapid development and acquisition of heavy fuel engines for predator shadow hunter and fire scout primarily because of the lack of commercial demand for these engines enrique j enriguez president of the locust usa inc testified that the military has clearly established their need for heavy fuel burning engines for uavs but industry has been slow to respond to this need in the small size range that we are working in the military requirements are in place requiring heavy fuel burning engines however th requirements are being placed on the aircraft developer78 the incorporation of heavy fuel engi nes onto uavs could help the vehicle to climb faster operate at mo re lofty altitudes and to re duce the amount of time spent servicing the engine on the ground proponent of heavy fuel engines argue that the integration of heavy fuel engines would not only increase performance capabilities and reduce servicing time but would make the uavs flight system more reliable and significantly reduce operations and maintena nce costs furthermore heavy fuel is cheaper and more abundant than the gasolin used in standard internal combustion engines however some drawbacks may exist when applying hfe to uavs the targeted unmanned platforms for this engine are the mediumsized and less complex uavs such as shadow pioneer and pr edator although the operations and maintenance costs may lessened by the heavy fuel engine the initial acquisition cost is much greater than traditional engines and could burden these relatively cheap uavs with increased production costs furthermore developers are experiencing difficulties in designing an engine lig ht enough and small enough to accommodate the flight requirements of this lighter uav another alternative being c onsidered is modified fuel cell under development by pacific northwest national laboratory supporters of fuel cells note that these devices could double the efficiency of mid sized uavs and could reduce the acoustic and thermal signatures of the uavs effectiv ely making them more difficult to detect and target 79 air combat command is sponsoring the project with the idea in mind to use the

combat missions which are critical to th distinction of between these two vehicles are also not factored into this comparison the variety of uavs reflects the specific need of the ssion or userservices and not unnecessary duplication furthermore th ey argue that landingtakeoff capabilities durability storage requirements and overall cost all play additional roles in determining the necessity of the vehicle in recent years the uavs role in comb at missions has significantly increased the first public acknowledgment that uavs were being used for combat operations was in 2002 when predator uav outfitted with hellfire missile attacked and killed several alqaeda operatives in yemen85 now the uav combat landscape has changed the majority of the predator uavs have been equipped with hellfire missiles predator b comes off the assembly line with large array of munitions the maverick ignater fire scout and hunter uavs are undergoing armament evaluations and the jucas program ndeavors to create the first uav primarily designed for offensive applications using uavs to deliver airtoground m unitions appears inherently useful uavs can loiter over the battlefield to attack emerging targets at risk to flight crew yet uavs are not without limitati ons while cost and effectiveness comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft must be made cautiously doing so can help determine when using uavs fo r combat operations is more attractive than using manned aircraft the 2006 actual current year cost fo r the mq9 predator b is 117 million about onethird th 355 milli on estimate for the f16 falcon simple payload comparison shows that the f16 can carry approximately four times the payload of the predator b 10750 lbs vs 2500 lbs86 this means that the cost per one pound of munitions delivered is 4680 for the predator and 3302 for the f1687 further the f16 is versatile combat aircraft that can be used to perform many missions that the predator b cannot this may suggest that using manned aircraft for airtoground combat may generally prove more cost effective than using uavs and that he uavs unique combat capabilities may be most valued in niche circumstances such as when manned aircraft w ould be in extreme danger other missions for which uavs appear usef ul or are being considered in the nearterm include electronic attack also called standoff jamming or

governmentindustry partnership created to facilitate the incor poration of uavs into the national airspace system uav advocates bemoaned this development arguing that disbanding access 5 would severely hamper the forecasted development of uavs and their numerous global applications97 further in the future large uavs coul d take on the aerial refueling task now performed by kc10 and kc135 tanker ai rcraft although dod has not expressed plans for exploring the aerial refueling role it appears to some to be mission well suited for unmanned aircraft the flight pr ofiles flown by kc10 and

options could include manned aircraft blimps and space satellites99 each platform offers both advant ages and disadvantages manned aircraft provide flexible platform but risk pilots life some of the

uas roadmap include s section on lighterthanair blimps and tethered aerostat platforms which osd indicates to be important for variety of roles including psychological opera tions spot incoming enemy missiles and border monitoring furthermore these pl atforms could provide services equivalent to many border surveillance uavs but th eir decreased dependency on fuel could minimize operations costs one drawback to these lighterthanair platforms is their lack of maneuverability nd speed relative to uavs like the global hawk none theless the goal of many major uav ma nufacturers is to velop an operational system by 2010 that could carry out vari ety of missions for homeland security100 space satellites offer many benefits they are t hought to be relatively invulnerable to attack and field many dvanced capabilities however tasking the satellites can be cumbersome especially w ith competing national priorities the limited number of systems can only serve so many customers at one time additionally some sa tellites lack the loitering capab ility of uavs only passing over the same spot on earth about once every thr ee days due to the high costs of space launches uavs like global hawk are bein g considered for communication relays as substitutes for loworbiting satellite constellations101 recruitment and retention one commonly voiced concern with the pace of uav production is that these remotely piloted planes will replace manned aircraft in large numbers102 critics of mass uav production warn that reliance on unmanned vehicles degrades pilot skills and takes away the tactical

only service to require rated pilots to fly their uavs 105 for more information on recruitment issues see crs report rl32965 recruiting and retention an overview of fy2004 and fy 2005 results for active and reserve component enlisted personnel by lawrence kappit has not always been easy for the aviation culture to adapt to flying aircraft from the ground deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz during hearing on transformation stated that not long ago an air force f15 pilot had to be persuaded to forego rated pilots job to fly predator now air force leadership is working hard to encourage this pilot and others to thin k of piloting uavs as major mission and to become trail blazers in defi ning new concepts of operations103 the air force has realized the retention implications of requiring rated pilots to fly their uavs104 and has offered enticements such as plum assignments after flying the uav and allowing pilots to keep up their manned flying hours during their uav tour of duty historically many believe d that as more uavs were fielded recruitment and retention would suffer because those inclined to join the military would prefer to fly manned aircraft instead of unmanned airc raft this may be the case in some instances the future impact of dods uav programs on recruitment however is more complicated than this argument suggests the recruitment and retention situation varies among the services and for different types of personnel while the army appears to be having some difficulty with recent recruitment the air force and navy are actively trying to reduce their number of uniformed personnel thus reduced enlistments due to increased uav use if that turns out to be the case might not have the anticipated impact105 central question related to the poten tial impact of increased uav employment on personnel is what qualifi cations are required to ope rate uavs currently the air force require predator and global hawk operators to be pilotrated officers other services do not require uav operators to be pilotrated officers this means that in the other services there is competition between manned and unmanned aircraft for potentially scarce pilots many enlist in military service with desire or intention to fly manned aircraft some wish to fly but lack phy sical qualifications such as good eyesight the increased fielding of uavs may encour age some to enlist because it offers them an opportunity to fly that they may not ve had otherwise further those inclined to fly manned aircraft may not be as disi nclined to fly uavs as was believed in the past flying armed uavs may be more ppealing to these personnel than is flying nonarmed uavs also flying uavs may be an attractive compromise for certainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31872crs35 106 see for example crs report rl31236 the berry amendment requiring defense procurement to come from domestic sources by valerie bailey grassopersonnel while it may not c onfer all the excitement of flying manned aircraft it also avoids many of the hardships g arduous deployment s and potential harm the air force believes that flying uavs fro m control stations in the united states will be attractive to some reservists and guardsmen who may already be disinclined to experience an active duty lifestyle consistent with flying manned aircraft also not all uavs compete with manned aircraft for pilots those uavs that are pre programmed and operate aut onomously like global hawk do not require pilot like the predator and other remotely piloted vehicles the air force maintains that their uavs are more technologically and operationally sophisticated than other uavs and trained pilot is required to employ these uavs most effectively as uav au tonomy or command nd control matures or if personnel issues for the air force become more troublesome it or congress may decide to review the policy of requi ring pilotrated officers to operate uavs increased employment of uavs could potentially boost enlistment in other specialties if they are perceived as being effective in their missions if for example those inclined to enlist in infantry positi ons perceive uavs to offer improved force protection and cas capabilities over todays manned aircraft these potential recruits may have fewer qualms about the potential hazards of combat industrial base considerations congress is perennially confronted with spate of defense industrial base issues is us industry becoming too dependent on foreign suppliers do foreign competitors get

competition in the defense industrial base s hould congress takes steps to protect us defense industries in order to safe guard technologies or pro cesses critical to national defense106 it appears that dods pursuit of uavs presents seve ral interrelated issues relevant to the defense industrial base some are concerned that if uavs are increasingly designed and built funding for manned aircraft programs is likely to wane and the technical expertise required to design and perhaps build manned comb at aircraft could erode many point out that the ability to produce world class combat aircraft is distinct us comparative advantage and should be guarded closely others disagree that the pursuit of uavs could harm the industrial base they argue th at the joint strike fighter is likely to be the last manned tactical fighter and that the industrial base is naturally evolving toward the skills and processes require d to make increasingly advanced uavs those who fear manned indus trial base atrophy argue that the future of uavs is overrated and that there will be demand for tactical manned aircraft in the post jsf timeframe in their eyes crucial skills and technologies could thus be lost by concentrating only on unmanned aircraft design possibly causing us dominancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31872crs36 107 for more information on the arguments for and against future demand of tactical

poi nt out that uavs have been around for almost century yet only recently became operationally effective and are not likely to replace manned aircraft in the near future107 some disagree and believe that critical manned aircraft design skills are not jeopardized by increased pursuit of uavs because there is considerable commona lity between manned and unmanned combat airc raft except for the obvious lack of cockpit unmanned combat aircraft ma require stealthy airframes advanced avionics and high performance engines just like manned combat aircraft also major defense contractors have alr eady begun to shift to unmanne d aircraft design in order to stay competitive this is because uavs are beginning to play prominent role in warfare as seen in operation endurin g freedom in 2001 and operation iraqi freedom in 2003 the same skills and t echnologies required for building manned aircraft will likely lend themselves to unmanned aviation design as well companies that have lost out in recent aviation contracts such as boeing and the joint strike fighter jsf in 2001 are looking towards unmanned bombers and fighters as prospects for growth108 northrop grumman corp as another example has created new business unit to aggr essively pursue uav business109 if boeing were to design manned aircraft in the future the critical skills needed would still be present according to this argument others would argue that maintaining healthy us defense industrial base depends in part on how well us firms compete for the global uav market one survey finds that in 2005 there are 195 different uav programs world wide110 some estimate that global uav expenditures double from 21 billion in 2005 to 5 billion in 2014111 the global market for combat ai rcraft alone at approximately 125 billion in 2005 dwarfs the uav market but th rate of growth is projected to be much slower peaking at approxima tely 16 billion in 2013 and dropping to approximately 14 billion in 2014112 thus some would argue that much new business is likely to be generated in the uav market and if us companies dont capture this market share european russian israeli chinese or south african companies will from this perspective capturing this new business and nurturing industrial expertise in uav challenge ar eas eg autonomous flight control of multiple vehicles command and control communications bandwidth

explore the policy dimensions of uav and cruise missile proliferation113 uavs and cruise missiles essentially uav with weapon payload are concerns for policy makers for two reasons first because their proliferation appears difficult to control the majority of uav components are indistinguishable from components found in civil manned aviation114 therefore many believe that it is relatively easy to divert gitimate civilian or military ex ports of aviation technology into covert uav or cr uise missile program115 uavs could be accessible to many countries or even nonstate actors hizbo llah

feet the increased wingspan in combination with the more powerful pratt whitney f100220u turbojet engine will allow x47b an endurance of nine hours and range of 1600 nautical miles the speed and ltitude of the pegasus is expected to match that of the x45c the x47b retains smooth and sleek design optimized for stealth but features folding wingtips that cut down on size making it more suitable

intended the x 45s primary mission to be the suppression of enemy air defenses ad and secondary mission of electronic attack warfare168 the navy planned to use its ucav for armed intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance169 the payloads of each vehicle are expected to be tailored to the respective mission both boeing and northrop grummans systems will possess internal weapons ba ys and
