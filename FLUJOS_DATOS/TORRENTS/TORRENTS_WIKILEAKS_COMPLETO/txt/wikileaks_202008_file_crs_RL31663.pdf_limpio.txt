the uniformed services former spouses protection act usfspa in 1982 under the usfspa state courts can treat disposable military retired pay as divisible prope rty in divorce cases in addition certain former spouses would remain eligible to receive certain military benefits or privileges the usfspa has since been modified on number of occasions since its inception the usfspa has remained contentious opponents of the law feel that it is unfair and should be modified or repealed propone nts argue that the law protects the former spouse within nationally accepted standards and that protection should be improved in some details these proposed modifications include 1 expanding the eligibility for commissary and exchange benefits for former spouses 2 providing survivor benefits for certain former spouses 3 terminating direct payments to former spouse upon remarriage 4 limiting judicial jurisdiction during the reopening of settled divorce and 5 further redefinition of disposable retired pay as with the original provisions of the usfspa these and other proposed changes have been the source of great debate on october 12 2004 federal judge dismissed case challenging the usfspa

g18g158g155g153g152g156g142g561 the purpose of this report is to provide general discussion of legislative provisions and proposals relating to the military benefits for former spouses it is not designed to answer detailed questions about specific issues arising in individual cases thus it does not deal with case law nor does it apply legal or judicial interpretations of enacted statutes to specific situations what benefits can divorced spouses of members or retirees of the uniformed services receive under law what role do the services play in facilitating delivery of those benefits what practical problems arise in the implementation of and service involvement in claims on those benefits how does the current system for divorcerelated division of military retired pay work these frequently asked questions reflect confusion and controversy over social policy and economic equity issues the administrative and legal implementation has proven complex because large numbers of men and women and their often complicated individual situations are affected

the uniformed services former spouses protection act hereafter referred to as usfspa1 has five important provisions 1 it enables state courts to treat disposable military retired pay as divisible property in divorce cases 2 it allows direct payments by the uniformed services army navy marine corps air force and coast guard of up to 50 of members or former members disposable retired pay to the former spouse if the settlement involved is in compliance with the usfsp disposable retired pay is retired pay less withholdings disability pay the member is entitled to on the date the member retires or on the date the members name was placed on the temporary disability retirement list and survivor benefit plan deductions as discussed below2 3 it allows for the enforcement of alimony and child support in conjunction with previously enacted provisions of law providing for such enforcement regarding military personnel in 42 usc 659 1 title x pl 97252 approved september 8 1982 96 stat 720 sections 643645 the provisions of this law have been subsequently amended this report is summary of law and discussion of the issues based on the original statutes as amended through october 31 2002 2

designate former spouse as beneficiary under the military survivor benefit plan this provision was later modified by congress to allow state courts under certain conditions to order member or retiree to provide military survivor benefit plan benefits to former spouse3 5 it defines which former spouses are eligible to secure access to militarysponsored medical care benefits including care at uniformed service facilities for example as well as commissary and exchange privileges 4 the usfspa currently allows state courts to consider disposable military retired pay excluding disability retired pay as divisible property in divorce settlement and establishes procedures whereby former spouse can receive direct payment of part of that retired pay directly from the defense finance and accounting service5 there has been some confusion about the distinction between usfspa provisions that authorize courts to divide retired pay and provisions that allow for the direct payment of divided retired pay under the usfsp state courts are free to order the division of disposable retired pay in any manner congruent with state law the usfsp does not direct state courts to divide retired pay or to award former spouse certain percentage of disposable retired pay whether such division is made and if made what percentage is awarded to the former spouse is left to the discretion of the court in each individual settlement the secretary of the particular military department army navyincluding the marine corps and air force and the secretary of transportation for the coast guard can make direct payments of portion of that pay to former spouse in order to be eligible for direct payment former spouse must have been married to the service member or retiree at least 10 years during which the service member or retiree must have served at least 10 years of creditable military service in addition the awarded division of military retired pay must be incorporated in court ordered ratified or approved divorcerelated settlement these provisions of the usfspa pertain only to property settlements and do not affect provisions for alimony or child support the usfspa does not relieve the service member or retiree from the obligation to pay courtordered alimony andor child support payments which are distinct from divorce property settlement whether or not the retired pay is divided language was included in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 that would 1 waive the 10year rule for direct payments of retired pay 2 allow for cost of living adjustments in cases where awards of retired pay are stated in dollar amounts and 3 allow member to waive the notification process when an application for payment of retired pay is made these provisions were dropped by the conference committee 6 the service secretary concerned is required to be gin payments to the former spouse within 90 days after the receipt of valid court order if the member has not yet retired from the armed 3 for more information on the military survivor benefit plan see crs report rl31664 the military survivor benefit plan description of its provisions by david

begin payments not later than 90 days after the member becomes entitled ie retires the usfspa does not authorize any court to order member to apply for retirement or retire at particular time in order to effectuate any payment 7 under the usfspa the amount of court ordered retired pay that the services can pay to former spouse under the direct payment provisions is limited to 50 of disposable retired pay or to 65 if other provisions for garnishment such as alimony or child support under 42 usc 659 exist when the service member has more than one former spouse payment orders are handled by the secretary on firstcome firstserve basis the combined amount of retired pay paid out to one or more exspouses through the direct payment mechanism can not exceed 65 of disposable retired pay but this does not relieve the member or retiree of an obligation to pay any additional sums which are awarded to former spouse when conflicting orders exist eg retired pay subject to more than one court order the usfspa instructs the secretary concerned to send the amount specified in the lower of the two conflicting orders to the former spouses retain the difference between the two up to 50 and send the balance to the retiree upon resolution of the conflicting order the secretary is to allocate the retained amount in accordance with the usfspa finally the usfspa does not allow court to consider military retired pay in divorcerelated property settlement unless the court has jurisdiction over the service member or retiree by reason of hisher 1 residence other than military assignment in the territorial jurisdiction 2 domicile in the territorial jurisdiction of the court or 3 consent to the jurisdiction of the court

cost of survivor benefit the usfspa provides that members or retirees may voluntarily elect to name former spouse as beneficiary for divorces occurring before november 14 1986 this election may be part of or incident to divorcerelated property settlement if divorce occurred on or after november 14 1986 however court may order member or retiree to provide sbp protection as part of or incident to divorce according to changes in law implemented by the fy1987 dod authorization act court order may require person to elect or to enter into an agreement to elect to provide an annuity to former spouse or to both former spouse and child 9 this language does not require courts to make such an order but gives them the freedom to do so likewise the surviving spouses of active duty personnel who die are provided an annuity this annuity for an active duty nonretirementeligible member is determined by assuming the individual would have been eligible to retire under sec 1201 retirement or separation for physical disability regulars and members on active duty for more than 30 days retirement title 10 usc 10 with 100 disability the surviving spouses annuity is based on the amount of disability retired pay the service member would have received under sec 1201 the spouses share is 55 of the members disability retired pay if the surviving spouse is under age 62 and 35 if age 62 or over depending on when the in dividual entered the service the amount used may be either the terminal monthly basic pay for those who entered service on or before september 7 1980 or the average basic pay for the 36 month period also known as high three years during which the member earned the highest rate of basic pay for those who entered the service after september 7 1980 the amount of monthly disability pay is computed either by multiplying the determined amount of basic pay by the percentage disability or by computing 25 of basic pay times the members years of service up to 75 whichever is higher since the legislation assumes the level of disability is 100 the amount of basic pay or high three used would be multiplied by 75 as noted depending on the age of the surviving spouse the annuity is either 55 or 35 of the computed amount g15g146g156g140g142g149g149g138g151g142g152g158g156g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561 the usfspa and subsequent amendments also authorized military medical benefits and exchange and commissary privileges for certain former spouses of military members or retirees eligibility for these benefits depends on both the years of marriage and service by the member or former member and in certain instances the date of the final decree of divorce dissolution or annulment each set of requirements for eligibility are treated separately here when originally enacted in 1982 the usfspa provided that if member had been married for at least 20 years to one spouse during which time the member performed at least 20 years of creditable military service the unremarried form er spouse was eligible for military commissary and exchange privileges as well as military medical benefits if he or she did not have medical coverage under an employersponsored health program this restriction known popularly as the 202020 restriction was considered unfair by some because it excluded many former spouses who met most but not all of the time requirements in some cases for example the marriage could have lasted 20 years the service member had served 20 years but the two did not overlap by the required 20 years 9 10 usc 1550f4 10 under these provisions the members disability may not be the result of intentional neglect or misconduct

benefit eligibility provisions for former spouses who do not meet the 202020 restriction the benefits of those who do meet the 202020 restriction were not affected by these provisions11 first it provided full eligibility for medical care for former spouses whose final decree of divorce annulment etc was dated before april 1 1985 and who meet the eligibility requirements except for the fact that their minimum of 20 years of marriage and 20 years of creditable service overlapped by only 15 years or more and by less than 20 years ie they meet 202015 restriction second it provided

eligible for transitional care in the military medical care system for two years followed by the right to convert to private health insurance plan with the identical restriction on remarriage and other medical coverage 12 legislation enacted in 1988 limited the period of transitional medical care to one year13 third the 1984 legislation provided that former spouses who were otherwise eligible but who did not meet the minimum 202015 restriction would be eligible for coverage under specifically formulated private health care plan with responsibility for premium payments for this plan to be

authorized or constrained by federal legislation or federal legal precedent in dividing military retired pay in divorcerelated property settlements inconsistencies among the states and perceptions of unfairness and arbitrariness were common grounds for criticism of the system the supreme court ruled 63 on june 26 1981 in the case of mccarty v mccarty 15 that the former spouse of military member or retiree could not be awarded any share of that membersretirees retirement pay as part of divorce property settlement in community property state16 because thencurrent federal law did not authorize the treatment of military retired pay as divisible property in such settlement although there are only eight community property states arizona california idaho louisiana nevada new mexico texas and washington comparable reasoning would seemingly have applied in other states as well in reaching this ruling however the court did not necessarily endorse its social impact indeed justice blackmun writing for the majority virtually invited congress to consider change in the law to allow such division to be made 11 pl 98525 sec 645a september 27 1984 12 see 10 usc 1086a 13 see pl 100456 sec 651

often serious one see hearing on hr 2187 hr 3677 and hr 6270 before the military compensation subcommittee of the house committee on armed services 96 th cong 2d sess 1980 that plight may be mitigated to some extent by the exspouses right to claim social security benefits cf hisquierdo 439 us at 590 and to garnish retired pay for the purposes of support nonetheless congress may well decide as it

reemphasized that in area has the court accorded congress greater deference than in the conduct and control of military affairs 17 congress responded with the uniformed services former spouses protection act which was enacted in september 1982 the legislative history of the usfspa indicates that it was the intent of congress that the direct payment provision of the usfspa would not be applied to cases finalized before june 25 1981 the date of the mccarty decision and became effective after that date it was noted in the conference report on the act that although the conference report contains prohibition against courts reopening decisions before june 26 1981 the conferees agreed that changes to court orders finalized before the mccarty decision should not be recognized if those changes were effected after the mccarty decision and before the effective date of the new title x to implement the holding in that decision for example modification setting aside premccarty division of military retired pay 18 thus if divorce were settled two weeks before the mccarty decision and the member retired after mccarty divisibility of retired pay and other provisions would arguably not apply unless the original decree allowed for division of retired pay however the applicability of the usfspa in general to reopened cases remained ambiguous congress has direct control or jurisdiction over state courts which handle almost all domestic relations law separation divorce adoption etc however congress does have and has asserted control over the use of federal compensation and benefits as well as administrative mechanisms in the disbursal of federal compensation and benefits related to domestic relations law congress has indicated its intention that federal law govern the treatment of these benefits in divorcerelated settlements the us comptroller general has ruled that certain former spouses who have their premccarty divorces reopened on or after june 26 1981 may

to allow for division of retired pay pl 10151021 places explicit limits on the ability of state courts to consider retired pay as property in the reopening of premccarty divorce which did not provide for such division in its report on this legislation the house armed service committee stated the committee is concerned because some state courts have been less faithful in their adherence to the spirit of the law the reopening of divorce cases finalized before the supreme courts decision in mccarty v mccarty that did not divide retired pay continues to be significant problem years after final divorce decrees have been issued some state courts particularly those in california have reopened cases through partition actions or otherwise to award share of retired pay although congress has twice stated in report language that this result was not intended the practice continues unabated such action is inconsistent with the notion that final decree of divorce represents final disposition of the marital estate section 555 would provide that court may not treat retired or retainer pay as property in any proceeding to divide or partition such pay of member as the property of the member and his spouse if final decree of divorce dissolution annulment or legal separation including court ordered ratified or approved property settlement incident to such decree was issued before the mccarty decision and did not treat retired pay as property of the member and the members spouse or former spouse this provision would apply to judgments issued before on or after the date of enactment november 5 1990 of this act but only with respect to any requirement to make payments pursuant to such judgments after the date of enactment thus individuals divorced before the mccarty decision who have their cases reopened would not be relieved of the obligation to make payments until after the effective date of this act 22 this change was codified at 10 usc sec 1408c123

hereafter referred to as military retired pay is often compared to and contrasted with public or private civilian pension programs those aspects of military retired pay that are comparable to civilian pensions lead advocates of dividing retired pay in divorce cases to reason that military retired pay should be treated similarly ie as divisible property on the other hand certain unique aspects of military retired pay and military service in general have led opponents to argue that military retired pay is qualitatively different from pensions they maintain that to treat military retired pay as

military nondisability retired and retainer pay is to establish nondisability retirement system and authorize the payment of retired pay for service in the armed forces of the united states in order to insure that 1 the choice of career service in the armed forces is competitive with reasonably available alternatives 2 promotion opportunities are kept open for young and able members 3 some measure of economic security is made available to members after retirement from career military service and 4 pool of experienced personne l subject to recall to active duty during time of war or national emergency exists 24 the first and third purposes are directly comparable to reasons given for providing civilian pensions the second purpose is different in terms of the age at which military members retire most military members become eligible to retire between the ages of 39 and 45 while civilian pensions usually require that the beneficiary be much older before benefits become available all of these provisions are designed to allow the military to keep the force young and vigorous by permitting the involuntarily retirement of its members at relatively young age this is similar to retirement systems that apply to many nonmilitary police and firefighters the fourth purpose provides the principal argument for differentiating military retirement benefits from civilian pensions in retirement military retirees continue to be members of the uniformed services and to an extent their pay serves as compensation for reduced current services military retirees are generally subject to involuntary recall to active duty as well as to employment and travel restrictions for example approximatel 2000 retirees were called to active duty for the persian gulf war they are also subject to the uniform code of military justice violating any of these restrictions may be sufficient cause to terminate retired pay under pension plans retirement benefits are vi ewed as deferred compensation in other words pension annuities are based on benefits earned during the period of employment rather than during retirement in this sense it is at least in part the retirees own benefits earned during the period of employment that makes these benefits possible the money paid into or obligated to pension plan is property that serves as deferred benefit the retiree and hisher family therefore have vested interest in the pension since these pensions may also be earned during the period of marriage pensions are viewed as property that is subject to division in divorce settlements military retired pay is not based on deferred compensation military members do not contribute to their retirement instead as noted above although some features are analogous to civilian pensions others are not according to the supreme court in the mccarty decision the retired officer of the army remains member of the army see united states v tyler 105 us 244 1881 and continues to be subject to the uniformed

engages in certain activities finally the retired officer remains subject to recall to active duty by the secretary of the army at any time pl 96513 sec 106 94 stat 2868 1980 these factors have led several courts including this one to conclude that military retired pay is reduced compensation for reduced current services thus the military retirement system does not embody even limited community

personal entitlement payable to the retired member himself as long as he lives s rep 1480 90th cong 2d sess 6 196825 thus the supreme court and other courts affirmed that under thencurrent law military retired pay was not property and therefore was not pension in enacting the usfspa congress approved language that allows court to treat military retired pay as propertyie analogous to civilian pensionsin limited circumstances title 10 usc sec 1408 c states 1 subject to the limitation of this section court may treat disposable retired or retainer pay payable to member for pay periods beginning after june 25 1981 either as property solely of the member or as property of the member and his spouse in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction of such court 2 notwithstanding any other provision of law this section does not create any right title or interest which can be sold assigned transferred or otherwise disposed of including by inheritance by spouse or former spouse by passing this language into law congress allowed military retired pay to be treated as property in most divorce cases however military retired pay may not be treated as property for any other purpose26 in 1992 case that reached the supreme court27 however retired pay in part based on language under the usfspa was considered to be similar to pensions for reason of state tax laws while the court noted the different status of military retirees it held there are significant differences between military retirees and state and local government retirees in terms of calculating retirement benefits the statement in united states v tyler 105 us 244 245 that such pay is effectively indistinguishable from current compensation at reduced rate was made in the context of the particular holding of that case and cannot be taken as establishing that current compensation for reduced services and although mccarty v mccarty 453 us 210 222 referred to tyler it did not expressly approve tylers description of military retirement pay but specifically reserved the question whether federal law prohibits state from characterizing such pay as deferred compensation and urged states to tread with caution in this area an examination of other federal 25 see mccarty v mccarty slip opinion 805 june 26 1981 pp 11 12 and 14 us department of defense office of the secretary of defense military co mpensation background papers june 1987 417425 26 although this language made clear congressional intent with regard to retired pay in the situation of divorce settlements it arguably complicated the interpretation of the status of military retired pay in other situations ie state taxation of federal pensions see barker et v kansas 503 us 594 1992 in which the united states supreme court determined with the support of members and memb er organizations that retired pay constitutes deferred compensation and thus cannot be taxed any differently by the states than other categories of retired pay including retired pay received by former government employees thus the supreme court held that members retired pay s hould be treated the same for income tax purposes as federal and state retired pay the usfspa makes it clear that states may treat disposable retired pay as property subject to division in connection with divorce the retiree however remains member of the uniformed

that examined the implementation of the usfspa29 with respect to implementation procedures gao found that the department of defense has taken various measures to help ensure fair and consistent implementation of the direct payment provisions of the act and that the services generally have done good job of implementing them but as could be expected with complex new legislation such as this they have encountered some problems 30 despite some early difficulties each of the uniformed services has taken administrative steps to refine and streamline the processing of requests for courtordered payments to former spouses largely in response to the gao report31 however gao also noted that many of these early problems were related to inconsistent language used in courtordered

necessarily the same amount as taxes owedtax liability final tax liability and the payment of these taxes is determined when tax forms are filed with the irs the amount determined to be payable at the time of filing may be substantially different from the sum of withholdings from each check because disposable retired pay may be determined and divided on the basis of the amount paid in each military retirement check less withholdings and not on actual tax liability for those prefebruary 4 1991 settlements the amount received by the former spouse may vary from the amount receivable if retired pay were divided based on actual tax liability for example consider case in which service divides the disposable part of retired pay of 24000 equally between the service member and the former spouse as directed in hypothetical court order on the assumption that each will benefit equally see table 1 for simplicity assume that each is single under age 65 does not itemize deductions and has other source of income in this situation the government will withhold from the retiree approximately 3400 in federal income taxescalculated on the basis of 24000 of income the remaining disposable pay of 20600 will be divided between the exspouse and the retiree with each receiving 10300 the military retiree is liable for tax of about 1319 on 13700 gross retired pay less the former spouses share and so receives refund of about 2081 34001319 the former spouse however must still pay taxes of about 809 on the amount of retired pay received thus the military retiree receives 12381 in after tax income while the former spouses receives 9491 the retiree therefore gets 566 of total after tax income the former spouse receives 434 35 in addition the payments to the former spouse depend on the tax status of the retired service member former spouse whose circumstances are identical to those in the hypothetical case above but whose retired service member exspouse has remarried and now has three dependents receives 659 more after taxes than does the exspouse in the first example see tables 1 and 2 this occurs because the former members additional dependents allow him or her to reduce tax withholding which in turn increases disposable retired pay and thus the former spouses share as this example suggests the exmember could if he or she chooses reduce the benefits to the former spouse by increasing tax withholding on the retired pay to the highest permissible levels and realizing unshared reimbursement in the tax refund in an effort to curb abuse of this practice the comptroller general issued ruling that retir ees with outside incomes would still be able to increase withholding on their retired pay but only up to percentage justified by their projected effective tax rate that rate would be based on the ratio of the retirees anticipated total income tax to anticipated total gross income from all sources 36 the fy1987 dod authorization act pl 99661 november 11 1986 modified the definition of disposable retired life insurance deductions were eliminated in other words retired pay that was used to pay life insurance premiums was thereafter considered disposable pay and therefore subject to division this may have the effect of reducing the amount available to the retiree while increasing pay to the former spouse for example assume that hypothetical retiree

definition of disposable retired pay may have benefitted the retiree when insurance premiums were excluded post divorce retiree could legally reduce the amount former spouse received in this hypothetical situation retiree could take out an insurance policy naming second spouse dependents or himherself as beneficiary by naming himselfherself as beneficiary the retiree could use the insurance policy as savings account retired pay could then be directed to insurance premiums and thereby reduce the amount of retired pay available to former spouse the fy1991 national defense authorization act further modified the definition of disposable retired pay specifically amounts owed to the federal government for previous overpayments of retired pay and for recoupments required by law resulting from entitlement to retired pay 37 are excluded from this definition in addition amounts withheld from federal state or local taxes may not be excluded in other words pretax withholding

of disposable retired pay in 1891 congress enacted language prohibiting what it regarded as dual compensation for either past or current service and disability pension 38 as modified in 1941 the law prevents the concurrent receipt of both military nondisability retired pay and veterans disability compensation for those eligible for both military retired pay is offset or reduced dollar for dollar by v disability benefits which are tax free as noted the definition of disposable retired pay excludes disability benefits certain individuals may be eligible to retire either under the provisions of longevity retired pay or disability retired pay therefore an eligible retiree could choose to retire under the disability provisions and thereby reduce or eliminate the amount or retired pay available

pay were divided and the retiree had other source of income the retiree could be forced onto public assistance the fy1987 national defense authorization act stated that the disability exclusion would be eliminated to the extent that it excludes retired pay that is only nominally related to disability person eligible for military retired pay for length of service who had disability rated as 10 at the time of retirement is eligible for disability retirement39 this means that the retiree may have had the amount of hisher retired pay computed based on hisher years of service but paid as disability retired pay this modification would exclude from disposable retired pay only so much of the retired pay received under chapter 61 as would actually relate to the extent of the disability40 in other words the above retiree who had disability rated at 10 has only portion of retired pay defined as disposable retired pay41 as concurrent receipt has evolved it now falls into two distinct categories combatrelated special compensation crsc and concurrent re tirement disability program crdp crsc is paid to those with combatrelated disabilities with v rating of at least 10 percent service members must apply for this compensation and it is not taxable crdp is initially paid to those with any serviceconnected disability that is rated at least 50 percent or greater by the v full implementation of these program has been phased in over 10 year period and those who are 100 percent were integrated on january 1 2005 crdp is taxable income to the retired servicemember as currently structured congress has not defined the special pay provisions for those with qualifying disabilities as disposable property subject to division in divorce related settlements however the phasein of allowing concurrent receipt over 10 years creates some concerns during this period eligible retirees will see their retired pay increase for retiree who is divorced and whose spouse has been awarded percentage of the retired pay the former spouse could arguably see an increase in the dollar amount received conversely for those former spouses who were awarded specific dollar amount of retired pay changes in the total amount received by the retiree will arguably not affect the amount the former spouse receives perceptions of unfair treatment resulting from such change will possibly encourage further legal consideration of already settled divorces as well as calls for remedial legislative action

officers or when they entered federal civilian service was to be reduced or capped at certain limits there were two categories of dual compensation the first applied only to retired regular officers

the first 931017 or 870093 for those who entered the service after august 1 1986 of their annual retired pay plus 50 of the remainder the dollar figure is adjusted each year by the same formula used to calculate costofliving adjustmentscolasfor military retired pay second dual compensation restriction applied to all retired military members who were first employed by the federal civil service after january 11 1979 such retirees who were employed by the federal civil service had their combined civil service pay and military retired pay capped so that it was not equal to or greater than level v of the executive schedule 108200 as of january 1 1994 if the combined pay exceeded this level v military retired pay was reduced former spouse who was awarded percentage share of retirees military retired pay would necessarily receive reduced amount when total retired pay was reduced because of dual compensation restrictions such reduction may have thwarted courts intentions and therefore required the former spouse to seek court ordered adjustment of the property settlement 43 in 1999 congress repealed the above dual compensation restrictions allowing affected retirees to receive their full military retired pay44 the situation is noteworthy in that in some cases repeal had an effect on benefits available to certain former spouses hypothetically divorce property settlement that provided fixed amount of retire d pay to the former spouse would not be affected by this repeal however had the spouse been awarded portion of retired pay stated as percentage the amount available would have incr eased following the repeal therefore in this latter scenario both the retiree and former spouse would have experienced an increase in their benefits

receiving social security benefits earned during other periods of employ ment covered by social security however various provisions of law 1 permit the transfer of creditable military service to civil service for the purpose of computing civil service retired pay 2 require the reduction of civil service retired pay at age 62 when the retiree becomes eligible for certain social security retirement payments andor 3 permit retroactive payments into the civil service retirement fund or the federal employees retirement system in order to eliminate recomputation that can take place at age 62 for those with military service credited to civil service see below for more details military member who after retirement becomes entitled to civil service annuity can elect one of three options pertaining to military retired pay social security and civil service annuity in each situation the total income received both by the military retiree and by hisher divorced spouse from all federal retirement systems civilian and military could be affected by decisions made by the retiree receipt of both military and civil service retirement pay as well as social security benefits based on the years of military service this will provide the retiree with three separate retirement benefitsmilitary retired pay civil service annuity and social security coverage of military service under social security entitles spouse and former spouse if the marriage lasted at least 10 years of deceased military retirees to receive social security spouse survivor benefits based on the deceased retirees military service b waiver of military retired pay and crediting of all military service to civil service retirement with the amount of civil service pension to be based on total federal service including military service as well as receipt of social security benefits based on hisher military service under this option the military retiree would receive two separate benefitscivil service retirement and social security however when the retiree reaches age 62 the years of military service can longer be counted toward the civil service annuity because they are counted toward social security therefore the civil service pension is reduced at age 62 when social security becomes payable this reduction in civil service benefits is known as catch 62 46 c selection of the above option b and deposit of lump sum into the civil service retirement fund or fers to avoid reduction in civil service retired pay which would otherwise occur when the retiree reached age 62 under this option

had he or she been civilian federal employee during the time he or she actually performed military service the deposit must be made before the civilian employee actually retires from federal civil service 48 catch 62 affects military retirees only if they elect to waive receipt of military retired pay in order to credit their military service toward federal civil service retirement military retirees who continue receiving separate military and civil service retirement annuities are not affected by catch 62 because none of their military service is credited toward civil service retirement 2 the usfspa and the waiver of military retired pay if military retiree is divorced later retires from the federal civil service and elects to waive his or her military retired pay and credit his or her military service toward single civil service pension problems arise in the implementing courtordered division of military retired pay under the usfspa prior to 1996 the waiver of military retired pay reduced the amount of such pay to zero therefore direct payments under the usfspa could be made to the divorced spouse whether or not it was the intent of the retiree to do so he or she thereby deprived the former spouse of retired pay awarded by court the federal civil service pension could then be divided but neither the retiree nor the exspouse would receive any military retired pay after the retiree began to collect his or her civil service benefits it wasis possible for the former spouse to ask the court to reconsider the property settlement in order to provide for the division of the civil service pension given the new circumstances however that was an uncertain process in 1996 congress approved language that would allow former spouse to continue to receive payments based on division on military retired pay in instances wherein the retiree waived military retired pay in order to credit military service toward single civil service pension this change was prospective beginning january 1 1997 49 3 person affected by catch 62 and the usfspa the impact of the usfspa on military retirees in the catch 62 situation and on their former spouses is extremely complex the decision to make lumpsum payment into the civil service retirement fund or the federal employees retire ment system so as to avoid reduction in civil service retired pay at age 62 and the liability for making the payment belong to the federal civilian employee alone regardless of his or her marital status retirees receive larger annuity by making this deposit thus the retiree and possibly the former spouse can benefit when the deposit is made if such military retirees exspouses property settlement entitles himher to share of the retirees civil service pension the exspouse can receive this share without incurring part of the cost of making the deposit required to avoid the catch 62 reduction in civil service retirement at age 62 as noted above prior to 1997 the former spouse whose property settlement entitles himher only to share of military retirement would be deprived of all such retired pay 48 this section can only allude to some of the extraordinary complicated situations that arise due to the interaction of military service civil service retirement and social security for more information see crs report 91463 benefits to individuals based on previous employment

early pre20year retirement these options may have import to former spouses and military members since 1 court may consider or may have considered future retired pay as divisible property although the member may not have actually retired to receive those benefits because of the drawdown 2 the potential amount available under these programs may be substantially less than would have been available

armed forces including the career force both the vsi and ssb were available to military members with as little as six years of active duty the option of voluntary separation before the 20year mark in return for receiving either vsi or ssb benefits was offered by each military service army navy marine corps and air force to selected groups of individuals based on years of service occupational skill or pay grade as necessary to reduce active duty military manpower strengths during the 1990s election of early separation and receipt of vsi or ssb was voluntary on the individual members part although failure to elect vsi or ssb might leave the individual vulnerable to later involuntary separation for which the individual could receive much less liberal separation pay individual military members were notified that they were eligible to receive vsi or ssb the choice as to which benefit they receive was entirely up to them vsi summary each service member electing to voluntarily separate under vsi received an annual payment equal to 25 of final monthly basic pay multiplied by 12 and then multiplied by the members total years of service the member would receive the payments for period twice the number of years of service the member had upon retirement thus major or lieutenant commander pay grade 04 with 14 years of service would receive an annual vsi payment of 25 of the monthly basic pay of an 04 with 12 years of service multiplied by 12 and then multiplied again by 14 and would be entitled to receive the vsi payments for 28 years 2 x 14 years of service vsi recipients were be transferred to the indi vidual ready reserve irr of the armed forces and thus were subject under several different statutes to involuntary orders to active duty by either the president or the congress for as long as they receive their vsi payments they could join the selected reserve reservists who are paid and regularly train although they would have to forfeit most or all of their reserve pay either at the time of receipt of vsi or later upon receipt of reserve retired pay if they became eligible for the latter if they later rejoin the active duty military they would have to repay their vsi bonus through regular deductions from their active duty pay or from military retired pay received after retiring from an active duty career ssb summary the special separation benefit ssb consisted of single lumpsum separation payment calculated at 15 of final monthly basic pay multiplied by 12 and then multiplied by the members total years of service as noted above the formula was the same as that used for involuntarily separated personnel those forced out except the involuntary separation pay formula was based on 10 rather than 15 of basic pay the ssb payment was thus 50 higher than the payment for an involuntary separation ssb recipients were to serve in the irr for period of three years after separation from active duty in addition ssb recipients could join paidstatus reserve units and receive full reserve pay for their reserve service unlike vsi recipients most service members eligible for voluntary separation benefit opted for the lumpsum ssb rather than the longerterm vsi this appeared to result from concerns over various restrictions on reserve participation and nonmonetary separation benefits placed on vsi recipients as well as the natural human desire for cash up front

temporary and discretionary basis to allow active duty military members to retire and immediately begin receiving reduced amount of retired pay with minimum of 15 rather than the preexisting 20 minimum years of service years of service dod could use such factors as grade precise years of service and occupational skill in determining whether military member was allowed to retire with less than 15 years of service such early retirement had been used in the 1930s to assist in removing surplus of officers with 1520 years of service retirees were eligible for the full range of medical commissary and exchange and other benefits that current 20year retirees receive early retirees were to have their retired pay computed in accordance with twostep formula 1 the existing formula for computation was applied 25 of basic pay for each year of service multiplied by the number of years of service 2 the resulting amount was reduced by 112 of one percent for each month of service or one percent for each year of service less than 20 years for example applying the current formula to 16 year retiree who had four years of service less than the usual 20 years of service minimum would otherwise result in the retiree receiving 40 of final basic pay upon retirement however because the retiree was retiring early his or her retired pay would be reduced by one percent for each of the four years below the 20 years of service mark the retiree would thus be entitled to 96 100 4 of the retired pay to which he or she would otherwise be entitled or 384 of final basic pay 40 x 096 second aspect of the early retirement statute provided additional deferred retired pay for early military retirees who took certain critical public sector jobs after leaving the military persons who retired with less than 20 years of service could receive up to five years of additional service credit for jobs in fields such as law enforcement education or public health at age 62 their retired pay would be recalculated to reflect their additional service credit for instance the 16 year retiree who received 384 of basic pay upon retirement and who took an approved public sector job for at least four years after leaving military service would have his or her retired pay recalculated at age 62 to reflect 20 16 4 year s of serviceor 50 of basic pay without the additional one percent per year
