compensation uc1 program which may provide income support through the payment of uc benefits the underlying framework of the uc system is contained in the social security act title iii of the act authorizes grants to states for the administration of state uc laws title ix authorizes the various components of the federal unemployment trust fund utf and title xii authorizes advances or loans to insolvent state uc programs uc is financed by federal taxes under the federal unemployment tax act futa and by state payroll taxes under the state unemployment tax acts suta the federal government funds federal and state uc program administration the federal share 50 of extended benefit eb payments and federal loans to insolvent state uc programs states fund regular state uc benefits and the state share 50 of eb payments in fy2008 the states received an estimated 273 billion from the federal government for the administration of their regular uc programs and for the administration of the federal emergency unemployment compensation euc08 program in fy2008 states spent an estimated 381 billion on regular uc benefits and 41 million on eb payments

reduced probability of fulltime employment and an increased probability of part time employment those workers who find new fulltime employment on average experience significantly decreased earnings relative to what they earned before they lost employment the uc program pays benefits to workers in co vered employment who become involuntarily unemployed for economic reasons and meet stateestablished eligibility rules the uc program generally does not provide uc benefits to the selfemployed to those who are unable to work or to those who do not have recent earnings history states usually disqualify claimants who lost their jobs because of inability to work or unavailability for work who voluntarily quit without good cause who were discharged for jobrelated misconduct or who refused suitable work without good cause 2 this temporary unemployment insurance benefit is designed to be sufficient to meet an unemployed workers basic obligations until the worker finds new position generally benefits are based on wages for covered work over 12month period the entitlement formula varies by state typically requiring substantial work history and replacing approximately

benefits are capped at percentage of the average wage for workers in the state which generally lowers the average replacement rate for all worker to less than 50 47 in 2007 weekly maximums in january 2008 ranged from 210 mississippi to 600 massachusetts and in states that provide dependents allowances up to 900 massachusetts in the third quarter of cy2008 the average weekly benefit was 292 benefits are available for up to 26 weeks 30 weeks in massachusetts the average regular uc benefit duration in third quarter of cy2008 was 153 weeks in fy2008 the ratio of unemployed workers who receive benefits to all those who are unemployed ranges from low of 019 south dakota to high of 068 idaho in fy2008 40 of all us unemployed workers received uc benefits generally the recipiency rate of uc benefits rises during economic recessions as workers with strong labor market experience are laidoff and falls during economic expansions as new entrants to the labor market begin to comprise greater proportion of the unemployed 3

the difficulty in monitoring job search intensity creates the risk the unemployed will abuse system designed to alleviate the worst of job loss although there are clear disincentives to quickly find work in the uc system this disincentive is balanced by relatively low replacement rate of wages by uc benefits and recognition that proper allocation of human resources and human capital requires adequate job search time 4 the jobsearch behavior of the unemployed can be influenced by changing the timing generosity and duration of uc benefits higher benefit levels and easier program requirements for benefits will cause recipients to be less willing to accept jobs and may alleviate some of the social stigma from being unemployed5 thus the availability of benefits may create disincentive to search for and accept reemployment increasing unemployment and unemployment duration6 g23g5g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g561g7g161g145g138g158g156g157g146g152g151g561 the limited duration of uc benefits generally 26 weeks will result in some unemployed individuals exhausting their uc benefits before finding work or voluntarily leaving the labor force for other activities such as retirement disability family care or education empirical research suggests that workers who exhaust benefits search at similar or higher levels of intensity as those workers who do find employment before benefit exhaustion7 most state uc programs 3 the percent of uc beneficiaries as compared to all unemployed workers is commonly referred to as the recipiency rate the exhaustion rate measures the proportion of all uc benefit recipients who exhaust their uc eligibility and do not find job within that period 4 for detailed survey of this disincentive effect see burtless gary unemployment

potential benefit exhaustees through profiling system workers who are identified as likely to become unemployed longterm are offered intensive employment services8 figure 1 displays both the percent of uc beneficiaries as compared to all unemployed workers the recipiency rate and as the number of uc benefit exhaustees since 1979 please note that figure 1 uses different numerical scales for the recipiency rate and for the exhaustion rate because the correspondence between the two scales was determined by page size rather than by particular reason readers should not place any significance in the two lines crossing each other the scale for the recipiency rate is located on the lefthand yaxis the scale for the uc benefit exhaustees is located on the righthand yaxis the proportion of uc recipients who exhaust their benefits varies according to economic conditions state benefit duration formulas and the composition of the labor force some evidence suggests that an aging workforce may have increased the proportion of unemployed workers who were longterm unemployed at the same time this aging workforce may also have contributed to the decrease in the overall unemployment rate 9

nbernot the federal governmentdeclares when recession began10 recession is significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than few months normal ly visible in measures of real gross domestic product gdp real income employment industrial production and wholesaleretail sales11 recession begins just after the economy reaches peak of activity and ends as the economy reaches its trough between trough and peak the economy is in an expansion 10 for detailed explanation on the determination of recessions see crs report rs22793 what is recession who decides when it starts and when do they decide by brian w cashell 11 the nber explicitly states that it considers real gdp to be the single measure that comes closest to capturing what it means by aggregate economic activity therefore it pl aces considerable weight on real gdp and other output measures thus the nber takes into account employment but not unemployment or unemployment rates when determining recessionary periods the nbers approach is summarized at httpwwwnberorgcyclesrecessionshtml httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34340g7g161g157g142g151g141g146g151

that began in november 2001 and thus marking the beginning of the current recession the most recent expansion lasted 73 months the previous expansion of the 1990s lasted 120 months

and to stabilize the economy during recessions12 these objectives are reflected in the current uc programs funding and benefit structure when the economy grows uc program revenue rises through increased tax revenues while uc program spending falls as fewer workers are unemployed and receive benefits the effect of collecting more taxes while decreasing spending on benefits dampens demand in the economy this also creates surplus of funds or cushion of available funds for the uc program to draw upon during recession in recession uc tax revenue falls and uc program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive uc benefits the increased amount of uc payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of lost earnings by injecting additional funds into the economy in response to economic recessions the federal government sometimes has augmented the regular uc benefit with both permanent the eb program and temporary extensions including the euc08 program of the duration of unemployment benefits

states use one two or three different methods for determining an equivalent to 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment these methods are described in both law section 202a5 of the euca and regulation 20 cfr 6154b in practi ce states that require any of these three requirements for receipt of regular uc benefits and do not allow for exceptions to those requirements do not need to establish that the worker met the 20 weeks fulltime insured employment15 the three methods are listed below 13 the iur is substantially different than the tur because it excludes several important groups selfemployed workers unpaid family workers workers in certain notforprofit organizations and several other primarily seasonal categories of workers in addition to those unemployed workers whose last jobs were in the excluded employment the insured unemployed rate excludes the following those who have exhausted their uc benefits new entrants or reentrants to the labor force disqualified workers whose une mployment is considered to have resulted from their own actions rather than from economic conditions and eligible unemployed persons who do not file for benefits 14 the tur is essentially weekly version of the unemployment rate published by the bureau of labor statistics that is the ratio of the total number of unemployed persons divided by the total number of employed and unemployed persons

congress has created federal temporary programs of extended unemployment compensation congress acted eight timesin 1958 1961 1971 1974 1982 1991 2002 and 2008to establish these temporary programs of extended uc benefits these programs extended the time an individual might claim uc benefits ranging from an additional 6 to 33 weeks and had expiration dates some extensions took into account state economic conditions many temporary programs considered th states total tur or the states iur or both historically these programs started operation after the trough of recession had passed this is due to several reasons one cause is that nber often announces that recession has begun three or more months after what is later determined to be the official start another cause to this lag in response time is that often the severity of the recession and its impact on unemployment levels does not become apparent for several quarters after the recession begins the 1958 and the 1961 programs were proposed and enacted after the trough of those recessions but before the unemployment rate had peaked the 1971 program was enacted after the end of the recession in november 1970 both the 1974 and 1982 programs also became effective toward the end of those recessions the 1991 program was enacted eight months after the 19901991 recession trough but eight months before the unemployment rate peaked likewise the 2002 program was enacted after the recession had ended but before the unemployment rate peaked the current emergency unemployment compensation euc08 program of 2008 was enacted

recently congressional and popular debate has examined the relative efficacy of expansion of uc benefits and duration compared to other potential economic stimuli in his january 22 2008 congressional testimony the director of the c ongressional budget office cbo stated that increasing the value or duration of uc benefits may be one of the more effective economic stimulus plans18 this is because many of the unemployed are severely cash constrained and would be expected to rapidly spend any increase in benefits that they may receive19 mark zandi of moodys economycom has estimated multiplier effects for several different policy options including extending unemployment benefits with multiplier effect of 16420 the multiplier estimates the increase in total spending in the economy that would result from dollar spent on given policy option zandi does not explain how these multipliers were estimated other than to say that they were calculated using his firms macroeconomic model therefore it is difficult to offer thorough analysis of the estimates others point out that increasing either the value or length of uc benefits may however discourage recipients from searching for work and from accepting less desirable jobs 21 17 the summary does not include pl 10811 which created the special teuca program that temporary program was in response to the unemployment of airline workers resulting from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks subsequent security measures and the iraq war signed into law on april 16 2003 the program provided up to 39 weeks of extended benefits to individuals whose regular uc was based on qualifying employment with certified air carrier at facility in an airport or with producer or pplier of products or services for an air carrier the program had two tiers of benefits known as teuca and teucax and were authorized through the week ending before december 29 2003 18 see cbo testimony of peter orszag on options for responding to shortterm

these measures may include statistics that are absolute measures such as employment and unemployment levels as well as relative measures such as the insured unemployment rate and the total unemployment rate vigorous debate on how to determine when the federal government should intervene by extending unemployment benefits has been active for decades generally this debate has examined the efficacy of using the iur or tur as triggers for extending unemployment benefits the debate also has examined whether the intervention should be at national or state level recently serious consideration of other measures of the labor market has become increasingly common in particular the increase in the number of unemployed from the previous year has emerged in several proposals as new trigger for nationwide extension in unemployment benefits

labor market through both insured and total unemployment rates and included both federal and state level triggers for extended uc benefits the ebs federal trigger 23 was eliminated by the omnibus reconciliation act of 1980 pl 96499 that act also required that the iur measure not include those who had exhausted benefits or who were receiving eb this effectively made the iur statistic less generous measure of unemployment since the adoption of the permanent eb program in 1970 there has been considerable debate concerning the relative merits of the iur versus the tur as an eb trigger the iur is defined as the 13week moving average of continuing regular uc claims divided by the average number of individuals in uccovered employment this mean s that the iur itself is an output of the uc program because the calculation of the iur is based upon the number of individuals currently receiving uc benefits each states iur depends on various noneconomic factors including state eligibility 22

perennial question concerns the appropriate level at which to measure changes in unemployment generally this debate has centered on the eb program and whether the eb trigger should be based on national regional state or substate data recently the debate on the eb trigger has been expanded to ask what measure should be used if new temporary extension of uc benefits were to be enacted in particular should congress act as it has in the most recent recessions and create nationwide extension of uc benefits with nod to higher unemployment states through an additional highunemployment tr igger or would it be more appropriate and better use of scarce resources to target only those states with current economic difficulties the argument in favor of national trigger is that the definition of recession is national in scope and the federal governments interest in reversing an economic decline is national as well however recessions have often been primarily regional in impact thus national trigger can result in the payment of extended benefits to individuals in states that do not face unusually weak labor markets there have also been proposals to create triggers on either regional or substate level the logic behind the substate or regional triggers is that they might improve the targeting of benefits because state boundaries are often of little relevance to the workings of labor markets there can be considerable labor market differences between urban and rural areas within state or among urban areas within state furthermore some labor markets are located in more than one state statewide trigger can deny benefits to areas facing severe labor market problems because other regions of the state are not facing the same conditions there are variety of arguments against regional and substate triggers it would be diffic ult to define appropriate regional or substate boundaries and it is unclear whether these newly defined regions would be any less arbitrary than current state boundaries in addition there are significant obstacles to be overcome in the financing and administration of an eb program on the basis of regional or substate areas because the state has always been the operational unit for uc there is also concern regarding the accuracy and availability of regional or substate data and the costs of data improvements that would be needed 24 24 the advisory council on unemployment compensation advised against the use of substate or regional data in determining the availability of extended benefits advisory council on

most recently congressional debate has moved away from using the iur or tur as trigger for national program serious consideration of other measures of the labor market has become increasingly common in particular the increase in the number of unemployed from the previous year has emerged in several proposals for new triggers in nationwide extension in unemployment benefits hr 4934 the emergency unemployment compensation act of 2008 was introduced on january 15 2008 this bill would have extended uc benefits for up to 26 weeks whenever the number of unemployed persons 16 years of age or older as compared to the same month of the previous year exceeded one million individuals table a5 located in the appendix provides information on the timing of the recessions changes in unemployment of at least 1 million compared to same month in the previous year and federal enactment of the temporary extensions of benefits during this period the temporary extensions of unemployment benefits take effect between 4 and 14 months after the onset of the recession the first changes in unemployment compared to the same month in the previous year of at least 1 million occur between 3 and 5 months after the onset of the recession therefore if the use of the 1 million trigger had been applied in the past the extension of uc benefits would have been triggered between 8 to 12 months earlier than actually occurred figure 2 provides graphical presentation of the information that was summarized in table a4 figure 2 also includes data on the unemployment rate please note that figure 2 uses different numerical scales for changes in unemployment levels and for the unemployment rate because the correspond ence between the two scales was determined by page size rather than by particular reason readers should not place any significance in the two lines crossing each other the scale for the changes in unemployment levels compared to same month in the previous year is located on the lefthand yaxis the scale for the unemployment rate is located on the righthand yaxis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34340 g561 g5g20g21g556g343g344g561figur 2 recessions changes in unemplo yment compar ed

of unemployed several other measures of unemployment are often used in assessing the severity of employment conditions these measures include the number of unemployed workers who exhaust uc benefits and the number of workers who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks the number of longterm unemployed figure 3 shows the change in the number of exhaustion of uc benefits figure 4 shows the change in the number of workers who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks generally both the changes in the numbers of exhaustees and the changes in the number of longterm unemployed peak after
