congress the millennium challenge account congressional consideration of new foreign aid initiative summary in speech on march 14 2002 at the interamerican development bank president bush outlined proposal for the united states to increase foreign economic assistance beginning in fy2004 so that by fy2006 american aid would be 5 billion higher than three years earlier the new funds which would supplement the roughly 163 billion economic aid budget for fy2003 would be placed in separate fund millennium challenge account mca and be available on competitive basis to few countries that have demonstrated commitment to sound development policies and where us support is believed to have the best opportunities for achieving the intended results these bestperformers would be selected based on their records in three areas ruling justly investing in people and pursuing sound economic policies development of new foreign aid initiative by the bush administration was influenced by number of factors including the widely perceived poor track record of past aid programs recent evidence that the existence of certain policies by aid recipients may be more important for success than the amount of resources invested the war on terrorism and the march 2002 unsponsored international conference on financing for development in monterrey mexico the mca initiative is limited to countries with per capita incomes below 2935 although in the first two years fy2004 and fy2005 only countries below the 1415 level would compete for mca resources participants will be selected based on transparent evaluation of countrys performance on 16 economic and political indicators divided into three clusters corresponding to the three policy areas of governance economic policy and investment in people eligible countries must score above the median on half of the indicators in each area one indicator control of corruption is passfail measure country must score above the median on this single measure or be excluded from further consideration the administration proposed to create new entity the millennium challenge corporation mcc to manage the initiative the mcc would be supervised by board of directors chaired by the secretary of state several other key issues including the number of participating countries and monitoring mechanisms have yet to be determined congress plays key role in the policy initiative by considering authorization and funding legislation and confirming the head of the proposed mcc number of issues have been addressed in the congressional debate including country eligibility criteria performance indicators used to select participants creation of the new mcc and budget considerations congress approved legislation division d of pl 108199 authorizing the new program and appropriating 994 million for the first year the measure creates corporation as proposed but alters the composition and size of the board of directors it further limits the extent to which lowermiddle income countries in fy2006 and beyond can participate in the mca so that more resources will be available for the poorest nations the legislation creates roughly 90day period after the corporation is established for consultation and public comment before selecting mca participants for fy2004 it is expected that the board will name the initial mca eligible countries in may 2004

consolidated appropriations act 2004 pl 108199 within which congress authorized the creation of the millennium challenge account and appropriated 994 million for fy2004 the mca legislation included in division d of the omnibus spending bill resolved several key issues on which the house and senate differed the measure creates new millennium challenge corporation mcc headed by ceo who reports to the board of mcc directions instead of the secretary of state senate or the president house the board includes the secretary of state chairman the secretary of the treasury the us trade representative the usaid administrator the mcc ceo and four others from lists submitted by congressional leaders and nominated by the president lowmiddle income countries may participate in mca programs beginning in fy2006 as proposed but may not receive more than 25 of mca appropriations the legislation creates roughly 90day period during which the corporation will name the list of countries that will compete for mca selection in the first year candidate countries publish the methodology that will be used for identifying best performing countries seek public comment on the initiative and consult with congress following this review period countries will be selected eligible countries and invited to submit program proposals for funding this could take place as early as may 2004 introduction in speech on march 14 2002 at the interamerican development bank president bush outlined proposal for the united states to increase foreign economic assistance beginning in fy2004 so that by fy2006 american aid would be 5 billion higher than three years earlier he further pledged to maintain economic aid amounts at least at this level into the future the funds would be placed in new millennium challenge account mca and be available on competitive basis to few countries that have demonstrated commitment to sound development policies and where us support will have the best opportunities for achieving the intended results these bestperformers will be selected based on their records in three areas ruling justly promoting good governance fighting corruption respecting human rights and adhering to the rule of law crs2 investing in people providing adequate health care education and other opportunities that sustain an educated and healthy population pursuing sound economic policies that stimulate enterprise and entrepreneurship promoting open markets sustainable budgets and opportunities for economic growth if fully implemented the initiative would represent one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in half century outpaced only by the marshall plan following world war ii and the latin americafocused alliance for progress in the early 1960s administration officials characterize the mca as representing the most comprehensive policy change ever in how the united states designs implements and monitors development assistance to low and lowermiddle income nations in particular executive officials emphasize the resultsbased aspect of the initiative in which countries will be selected based on past and current performance and programs will be evaluated on and required to show measurable achievements that impact favorably on economic growth and poverty reduction conditioning assistance on policy performance and accountability by recipient nations is not new element of us aid programs since the late 1980s at least portions of american development assistance have been allocated by the us agency for international development usaid to some degree on performance based system what is significantly different about the mca is that the entire 5 billion money pool which is nearly twice the size of the fy2003 usaid core development aid budget will be tied to performance and results moreover program proposals will be based on national development strategies developed by the countries themselves with us role limited to providing technical assistance in project design further in another major departure from past policy the mca is intended to focus exclusively on development goals without being influenced by other us foreign policy and geostrategic objectives that often strongly influence us aid decision making nevertheless while new details regarding country eligibility selection criteria and organizational structure were announced in december 2003 many issues have not yet been decided and remain under review by the executive branch congress plays key role in the approval of the initiative by way of considering authorization and funding legislation and in confirming the head or ceo of the millennium challenge corporation that manages the mca under the presidents plan congress will also maintain continuing oversight of the program as it is implemented and additional funding is sought in subsequent years among numerous policy issues for congress raised by the mca proposal were country eligibility should the mca target both low and lower middle income countries as proposed by the administration or should it focus exclusively on the poorest nations where the needs are the greatest and where access to other financial resources is limited and if both how should funds be allocated between the two groups crs3 performance indicators and selection process will the indicators and the methodology proposed by the administration identify the best performers implications for other us development aid programs how will the mca affect global and country aid programs not part of the new initiative us organizational structures is the proposed millennium challenge corporation with staff of 100 the most appropriate structural model for managing the mca what are the implications for the us agency for international development the primary government bilateral aid agency program development and selection what types of activities should the mca fund and how will these programs be designed legislative and funding matters what should be the relationship between mca authorizing legislation and current foreign aid laws and legislative practice what are the budgetary implications on the mca background of the millennium challenge account initiative context the concept of the millennium challenge account is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to sound economic and good governance policies especially where these conditions exist prior to expanding resource transfers past failures of economic aid provided by the united states and other international donors some argue have been caused to large extent by lack of attention to performance and the requirement for measurable results1 executive branch officials say that the mca abandons the process of basing aid allocations on promises by recipient governments to initiate policy changes in the future and instead will make those decisions based on achievements already made and policies that are currently working2 this view has been joined by growing body of literature in the late 1990s concluding that there was little relationship between the amount of development aid 1 others will argue however that of equal or perhaps more importance has been the close ties of us foreign assistance with more strategic and geopolitical goals where development results have been of secondary importance for policymakers charged with aid allocations and policy formulations 2 see remarks by andrew natsios administrator usaid at the us embassy in london october 21 2002 httpwwwusaidgovpressspe_testspeeches2002sp021021html crs4 provided and success in raising economic levels and reducing poverty rather some researchers argued that foreign assistance produced the greatest impact where the recipient country had already adopted sound policies3 others have concluded that international development assistance has largely failed and will continue to do so unless the donor community fundamentally shifts its focus to support real policy change4 despite many development successes in such areas as agricultural production and child immunization by one calculation 97 countries receiving 144 billion constant dollars in us aid since 1980 had their median per capita gross domestic product gdp decline from 1076 to 994 by 20005 also influencing the debate over the launch of new foreign aid initiative are the terrorist attacks of september 11and an evaluation of their causes there remain differences of perspective regarding possible direct relationship between poverty and terrorism especially given the fact that many terrorist leaders come from relatively wealthy backgrounds but most agree that poverty can be contributing factor president bush in announcing the mca on march 14 2002 made numerous references to the war on terrorism noting that we also work for prosperity and opportunity because they help defeat terror he further emphasized that although poverty does not cause terrorism poverty prevents governments from controlling their borders policing their territory and enforcing their laws development provides the resources to build hope and prosperity and security6 accompanying this was renewed interest in global development aid funding levels as governments international institutions and nongovernmental organizations prepared for midmarch 2002 unsponsored international conference on financing for development in monterrey mexico conference proponents hoped the session would serve as catalyst for donors to increase aid commitments in order to achieve by 2015 the ambitious goal of reducing poverty by onehalf relative to 1990 at the 2000 millennium summit international leaders including the united states had pledged support for set of specific targets including those related to hunger education womens empowerment child health hivaids and other infectious diseases that became known collectively as the millennium development goals world bank analysis released february 2002 estimated that to achieve these goals by 2015 donors would need to increase spending by 40 to 60 billion 3 see for example craig burnside

by the president on global development at the interamerican development bank washington dc march 14 2002 crs5 per year or roughly double the amount provided in 20017 as the monterrey conference approached international development advocates began pressing participating governments to issue specific pledges that would help close this funding gap identified by the world bank outlines of the mca following the presidents speech in march an interagency team including representatives from the national security council office of management and budget state department usaid and the department of treasury met frequently to work out proposals to design and implement the us initiative the nsc managed overall policy development while the state department took charge of outreach seeking input from the nongovernmental community and the treasury department assembled economic and governance indicators that would be used to determine eligible countries the team drafted recommendations on many but not all mca issues and after being approved by the secretaries of state and treasury the proposals were forwarded to the president after making further modifications on november 25 president bush endorsed several key principles of the initiative thereafter the process of writing legislation deciding on budget levels for fy2004 and consulting with congress began on february 3 2003 the president proposed 13 billion for the mca in fy2004 followed two days later by submission of draft bill authorizing the initiative the requested legislation was introduced as hr 1966 and s 571 but ultimately enacted as part of the consolidated appropriations act 2004 division d of pl 108199 while several important issues have been decided both through enactment of authorizing legislation and through interagency discussions others remain under review as the mca framework evolves these issues are highlighted below and discussed in more detail in the following section on the mca and congressional consideration mca features announced by the administration the administration issued proposals on number of key mca elements some of which were incorporated into the enacted authorizing legislation country eligibility in the first year fy2004 countries that can borrow from the world banks international development association ida with per capita income below 1415 are eligible the list will expand to 115 over the next two years to include all countries with per capita gni less than 2935 for complete list see appendix b selection criteria and performance indicators mca participants will be selected based on their performance measured by 16 7 world bank goals for development history prospects and costs by shantayanan devarajan margaret miller and eric swanson april 2002 text available at httpeconworldbankorgviewphptopic19type5id13269 crs6 economic and political indicators in most cases score above the group median on the indicator would represent passing grade the mca board of directors will be guided by the statistical outcomes but maintain some discretion over the final selection corruption measure is passfail to be eligible country must score above the median on the corruption indicator as compiled by the world bank institute program development and submission mca programs will be countrydriven in which participating country officials will design and submit project proposals based on national development objectives types of programs supported mca programs will be available not only for governmentsponsored projects but for activities proposed and implemented by local governments and communities civil society and other private entities national governments however would remain responsible for the program and be the party to sign compact between the us and the country moreover according to administration officials all types of assistance budget support for government initiatives infrastructure projects and more targeted activities focused on specific sectors are available for consideration organizational management of the mca the administration asked and congress approved the creation of new entity the millennium challenge corporation mcc that will be supervised by board of directors chaired by the secretary of state fy2004 funding the administration proposed 13 billion for the mcas first year and continues to support its pledge of 5 billion by fy2006 congress however reduced the fy2004 funding to 994 million mca issues undecided within the administration beyond some of these key decisions other matters remain under discussion number of countries participating because the mca will be performancedriven program it is difficult to predict how many nations will qualify and participate administration officials have suggested however that the number will be relatively small perhaps less than 20 by the third year it is also undecided whether all or only some of the countries that qualify based on the performance indicators will receive mca funding the final list may comprise selections from the pool of best performing countries or the selection could be based on the quality of program proposals submitted by qualifying nations other options are also under review crs7 impact on usaid program objectives in mca countries mca participants may or may not continue to receive regular development aid under existing usaid programs if they do it is unclear whether those activities will change focus in order to support mca projects the role of usaid missions in mca countries is also yet to be clearly stated monitoring and accountability executive officials say that mca programs will be closely monitored and scrutinized perhaps by some independent auditing system but they have not established plans or procedures graduation or exit strategies main objective in providing an increased resource pool to help jumpstart or accelerate countrys development process is to set it on the road toward graduation what criteria to use to end programs in successful countries or how to withdraw from nonperforming mca participant remain undecided the mca and congressional consideration as congress considered mca authorizing legislation and funding recommendations in 2003 and will later debate the confirmation of the mcc chief officer followed by continuing oversight of program implementation several key elements of the initiative have been and will continue to be closely examined these will include matters that have already been decided within the executive branch as well as issues that remain under discussion country eligibility and income levels one of the first questions addressed by the executive steering committee was where the income cutoff point should be drawn for purposes of defining potential mca participants the debate chiefly focused on whether only the poorest nations should be considered for mca programs as noted above the administration announced in late november 2002 that pool of 115 countries phased in over three years would compete for mca resources they are grouped into three clusters according to income level and world bank borrowing status with new cluster added to the competition each year corresponding to the anticipated rise in mca resources in fy2004 only the 75 idaeligible countries with per capita incomes below 1415 can compete while 12 more will be added the next year8 by fy2006 when 5 billion is planned for mca programs countries with per capita incomes between 1415 and 2935 28 in number will be added since countries above 1415 per capita income are likely to score higher on the eligibility indicators the 8 idaeligible borrowers total 81 while most fall below the 1415 gross national income gni per capita level seven small island countries with incomes above this level also can borrow from ida see appendix b for complete list of countries falling into each income grouping crs8 white house further has decided to have separate competitions for the low and low middle income groups to avoid income bias issue income eligibility there emerged at the outset relatively broad consensus within the us development community that the mca should focus on idaeligible lowincome countries9 for policy aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing poverty most agreed that it made sense to place emphasis where the greatest needs existed by expanding the number and income level of mca participants beyond idaeligible status some argued the amount of money available for the poorest nations would be reduced some also noted that the 28 member lowmiddle income group includes nations that maintain strong political and strategic ties with the us egypt jordan colombia turkey and russia that would increase the possibility or at least the perception that countries might be selected on criteria other than mca performance measures it may further tend to blur the distinction between mca goals and objectives of other aid programs jeopardizing the unique approach of the mca and the need for programmatic flexibility10 achieving economic results as an objective has frequently taken position secondary to strategic interests in us aid allocation considerations in the past in addition some point out that the poorest countries have far less access to capital from private sources making mca resources even more valuable to them according to one analysis aid as percent of gross national income gni for ida eligible countries with per capita incomes below 1415 totals 108 compared with 14 for the higher income group below 2935 gross private capital flows as percent of gdp for the poorer idaeligible countries below 1415 is 69 while those between 1415 and 2935 receive 103 tax revenues and domestic savings as percent of gdp among lowmiddle income countries are roughly double the level of those for idaeligible borrowers below 1415 thus providing more expansive potential source of financing11 others however argue that lowmiddle income countries deserve equal consideration in program intended to identify and partner with the best performers in some cases they assert commitments to sound policies have enabled nations to move into the higher income range if primary goal of the mca is to maximize the effectiveness of aid resources then nonida countries should be 9 three nongovernmental organizations for example argued that the mca should limit participation exclusively to idaeligible countries see interaction the millennium challenge account new vision for development may 2002 catholic relief services

falling in the 1415 2935 per capita income range while maintaining higher income levels also have large numbers of people living in poverty these countries with stronger institutions and better capacity may also be better positioned to apply mca resources more effectively one argument of those favoring exclusive participation of countries below the 1415 level that betteroff economies would score higher on the eligibility indicators raise the median standards for qualification and squeeze out the poorest nations seems to be addressed by the administration based on preliminary estimate of the median scores of each group the median would be higher and in some cases significantly higher for 14 of the 16 indicators for lowmiddle income countries compared with those below 1415 gni per capita13 in fy2006 when the 28 higherincome countries become eligible they will be evaluated separately from the other 87 competing against each other to score above the group median on the 16 indicators this would allow countries to qualify based on comparisons with their incomelevel peers whether the administration will divide mca resources into two pots of money for each income group has not been determined in any case unless the administration and congress agree to increase the mca beyond the proposed 5 billion target whatever number of lowmiddle income nations that qualify will reduce the amount of resources that would otherwise be available for those below the 1415 level congressional proposals to modify income eligibility reflecting the perspective that the mca should remain focused on the poorest countries the senate foreign relations committee recommended in s 1160 as added to s 950 to permit participation by lowmiddle income country in fy2006 and beyond only if mca funding exceeds 5 billion if not mca programs could only be supported in countries that fall below the historical per capita income cutoff of the international development association level that is currently 1415 even in years when the mca appropriation exceeds 5 billion the senate bill would limit funding to low middle income participants to 20 of the total amount the foreign relations committee further expressed its intention that mca programs in the lowmiddle income countries should focus on poor communities in those nations the house international relations committee in hr 1950 also limited to 20 the amount of mca resources that could be allocated in fy2006 to lowmiddle income participants but unlike the senate the house measure did not require an appropriation in excess of 5 billion for inclusion of the lowincome group in fy2006 the committee considered two amendments during markup related to the income issue the first offered by congressman payne and approved by the house panel would have required lowmiddle income countries that are selected for mca 12 paolo pasicolan and sara j fitzgerald the millennium challenge account linking aid with economic freedom the heritage foundation october17 2002 p 2 13 the two indicators for which this would not be the case are trade policy which would be the same for each group and threeyear budget deficits however because qualification under the latter indicator is set at specified threshold less than 20 percent group medians would have impact on whether country passed this hurdle source crs analysis based on data compiled by steve radelet center for global development crs10 grants to make contribution from their own resources to whatever mca programs are funded the second amendment proposed by congressman menendez originated out of concern that few 7 latin american nations would be eligible to compete for mca resources in the first two years despite large pockets of poverty in these countries the menendez amendment which was defeated 1024 would have made lowmiddle income nations group which includes nine from latin america eligible from the beginning similarly congressman kolbe proposed an amendment during house floor debate that would have allowed lowmiddle income countries to be eligible beginning in fy2005 rather than fy2006 the kolbe amendment failed 110313 while sympathetic to the concerns expressed by sponsors of the amendment those opposed to changing the income eligibility structure argued that resources diverted from latin america and many other nations would come at the expense of the worlds poorest nations where the needs are greatest as enacted in division d of pl 108199 the mca authorizing legislation follows the earlier house and senate plan of including only lowincome countries in the program during fy2004 and fy2005 beginning in fy2006 lowmiddle income nations with percapita income above 1415 may also participate but they can only receive 25 of the amount appropriated for the mca in that year performance indicators and selection process executive branch decisions on which performance indicators to use have been guided by whether the data and methodology are transparent publically available accurate and easy to understand another key factor is whether the data source provides full coverage for as many countries as possible and is relatively current officials further sought to identify indicators that would be few in number but sufficient to reflect broad policy results in each of the three policy categories and valid relationships between the indicators and economic growth and poverty reduction finding indicators that meet all of these requirements is difficult and according to some impossible gathering valid economic social and political statistics especially in developing nations has always been difficult often resulting in significant gaps in coverage and long lag times gaining consensus on whether given set of indicators accurately measures policy achievements unfettered of institutional bias by whatever organization or individuals collect and interpret the data is also major challenge as noted above the administration has settled on 16 indicators for measuring performance and determining country eligibility as shown in table 1 six fall within each of the ruling justly and encouraging economic freedom categories while four will determine results in the area of investing in people sources include international institutions such as the world bank imf and and non governmental and private organizations like freedom house heritage foundation and the institutional investor magazine national statistics will also be drawn upon where gaps occur but none of the data sets will be compiled by the us government for aggregating country scores the administration decided to use hurdles approach instead of adding up the results and ranking nations top to bottom to qualify country must score above the median on half of the indicators in each crs11 policy area in other words countrys ranking must be above the median of all 75 countries in the first year on three of the six indicators for ruling justly and economic freedom and two of the four for investing in people the one exception to the median standard is the inflation indicator countrys inflation must be below 20 percent in order to pass that hurdle officials believe that the hurdle methodology will demonstrate that country is committed in all three areas and more precisely identify policy weaknesses in year three and beyond when lowmiddle income countries are added to the competition there will be separate evaluations for countries below and above 1415 per capita incomes so that higher income countries will not drive up the median and exclude poorer nations from qualifying importantly one indicator control of corruption will be passfail test in which any country scoring at or below the median on this measure will be disqualified regardless of performance on any of the other 15 indicators executive officials argue that since there are strong links between financial accountability and economic success strong commitment to fight corruption must be demonstrated by all mca participants further after passing all the required hurdles countrys score will be evaluated by the mcc board of directors who will make the final recommendations to the president the board will be granted degree of discretion in selecting the final participants taking into account such things as missing or old data trends in performance and other information that might reflect on countrys commitment to economic growth and poverty reduction moreover officials have yet to decide whether to fund programs in all countries that qualify and pass the final review final selection for example could hinge on the quality of program proposals submitted by the best performing nations although other selection options are also under discussion presumably the president will also maintain flexibility as to whether to agree with the boards recommendations congressional action on performance indicators measures considered in the senate and house s 1160 as amended and incorporated into s 925 and hr 2441 as amended and incorporated into hr 1950 did not directly legislate the list of performance indicators to be used thereby allowing the executive branch to apply the measures that it has recommended both however provided for advance congressional consultation and public awareness s 925 required that the list of proposed indicators be published in the federal register and on the internet and that the administration consider public comment prior to issuing the final determination of the indicators in this way the committee believed that the indicators could be refined and improved hr 1950 required the corporations ceo to consult with congressional committees prior to establishing eligibility criteria and methodology and publish such criteria once finalized both bills further directed that country eligibility would be based on an evaluation of performance criteria that closely matched the 16 indicators listed in table 1 below in its report on s 1160 the senate foreign relations committee expressed its intent that the selection be based on development needs and performance and not on immediate political considerations crs12 the enacted legislation like earlier house and senate bills does not specify the specific performance indicators in describing the criteria by which countries should be assessed the mca act makes reference to the extent to which countries respect the rights of people with disabilities promote the sustainable management of natural resources and invest especially the health and education for women and girls while none of the 16 indicators chosen by the administration directly address these three additional concerns it is likely that mcc officials will review existing indicators or search for new performance measure in order to better evaluate progress on these three factors added by congress the legislation further requires the corporation to publish the eligibility criteria and methodology used for country evaluation on its website and in the federal register and receive public comment and congressional input prior to country selection

poverty reduction analysts will be examining the set of 16 indicators to determine how well they predict successful development outcomes an initial assessment by the center for global development suggests that many of the indicators show reasonable or strong relationship with economic growth infant mortality and literacy rates although few show weak associations especially in the economic freedom category according to the centers analysis each of the six governance indicators maintains good or strong correlation to development outcomes the measure of public primary education spending as percent of gdp however is weakly associated with the three development standards three of the six economic freedom indicators trade policy days to start business and three year budget deficits are also found in the study as being weakly correlated with development achievements14 issue hurdles and median vs aggregated ranking some argue that an aggregation of scores and toptobottom ranking rather than the use of hurdles is better way in which to determine eligibility with an abovethemedian score requirement while the administration holds that passing half the hurdles in each of the three policy areas ensures broad commitment to both economic growth and poverty reduction it also means that countries do not have to meet each of the 16 standards to qualify this approach departs from more traditional aid requirements in which recipients must comply with all conditions associated with program framework especially those of the world bank imf and in some cases us aid agreements once country passes hurdle there are limited incentives to keep improving in those areas for countries that miss qualifying by small margin however the incentive remains use of the median also in some cases complicates efforts for country to pass the hurdle due to outcomes beyond its control the median will change over time sometimes because new countries are added to the pool as will be the case in fy2005 in other instances possible firstyear qualifiers one country may improve on analysis particular indicator but still not pass the hurdle because other countries armenia honduras senegal

the millennium challenge account see especially table 2 appendix p 2 this study also provides useful critique of each of the 16 indicators concerning data availability reliability and other relevant issues text available at httpwwwcgdevorgnvchoosing_mca_countriespdf crs15 set specific individual thresholds that would be relevant to each indicator or to use absolute scores15 further issue in use of the median is that for three of the indicators political rights civil liberties and trade policy the range is relatively narrow for scoring country performance resulting in many falling at the median the freedom house assigns scores on 17 scale while the heritage foundation uses scale of 15 for the trade policy indicator for example 15 of the 75 idaeligible countries are assigned the median score of 4 since country must place above the median to pass hurdle this eliminates number of candidates with limited differentiation of performance issue surprising country outcomes and modifying the indicators many have been surprised by the possibility that countries such as vietnam and china might qualify despite scoring near the bottom on half of the indicators for ruling justly both countries pass the hurdles for corruption rule of law and government effectiveness but have some of the worst scores in the categories of political rights civil liberties and voice and accountability since they score above the median for three of the six indicators and pass the corruption measure they would qualify at least in the ruling justly category one analyst attributes this to the high degree of correlation among several indicators in single category that tends to magnify existing data deficiencies when half the indicators in single category are strongly related to one another and country scores well in those areas the other indicators essentially become irrelevant egypt is also cited as an example of country with poor record on regulation and trade but would have passed the economic freedom grouping with data available in early 2003 based on the strength of macroeconomic indicators16 one modification to the current proposal that would address this potential weakness would be to make sure that highly correlated indicators represent less than onehalf the total cluster in this way country would not pass one of the three categories based on strong showing in one respect but very poor standards for the other measures another alteration to the administrations plan would be to add an additional indicator in each category so that there would be an odd number of measurements in each category in sense the added element would become tie breaker in cases where the current indicators tended to cluster in two evenly divided highly correlated groupings one review of the mca proposal argues that the initiative does not include sufficient attention to democracy issues because it includes indicators in the ruling justly category that are better measures of economic not political freedoms this analysis recommends shift of the corruption rule of 15 see for example nancy birdsall ruth levine sarah lucas and sonal shah on eligibility criteria for the millennium challenge account center for global development september 12 2002 p 5 and radelet qualifying for the millennium challenge account p 25 as noted above the administrations proposal sets specific threshold for the inflation indicator 16 brainard compassionate conservatism confronts global poverty p 158 according to more recent data egypt would not qualify in fy2006 crs16 law and government effectiveness indicators to the economic policy category under this scenario countries like vietnam and china would fail the ruling justly test17 issue data accuracy and availability due to the difficulty in collecting accurate data especially those based on perceptions certain degree of error can be expected in each of the 16 measurements this cannot be overcome but is mitigated to some extent by the requirement of only having to pass half the hurdles in each policy area but it appears most problematic for the passfail test of corruption according to an assessment made by the authors of the corruption index there is large margin of error and high degree of uncertainty for 25 countries that score slightly above or slightly below the median either crosscountry data are not informative or sources disagree on countrys corruption standing of the total of 25 13 fall below the median and would therefore be eliminated from further consideration despite strong doubt as to whether the data measured performance accurately to overcome this potential weakness the authors recommend that mca managers employ indepth country diagnostics regarding governance performance for countries that fall near the medium the yellow light countries18 missing data also pose challenges strict interpretation of the data would result in failing grade on hurdle where figures were available only 87 of the 115 possible mcaeligible countries have been reported with regard to the indicator days to start business although the number has increase from 63 year ago for other indicators where data were incomplete or lagged especially in the cases of education and health spending as percent of gdp executive officials say they will rely on information collected at us embassies in each country issue mca board of directors discretionary authority allowing the board some latitude to depart from the purely statistical record will help address some of the data accuracy and availability problems but there appears to be divided opinion over how much discretion should be permitted arguing for broader flexibility some note that countries that just miss qualifying possibly because of the lack of data could still be reconsidered and approved19 in the case of closecalls the board could examine trends over time to assess if borderline country was improving or falling back in performance and make appropriate adjustments in order to maintain the integrity and transparency of the selection process final judgments that deviate from the methodological base will need to be clearly explained and closely examined20 this will be especially 17 thomas palley the millennium challenge accounts elevating the significance of democracy as qualifying criterion open

one observer acknowledges that some discretionary authority is needed but adds when continued crs17 important in cases where the country with close strategic and political ties to the united states is included despite not meeting all the hurdle tests the same will be true should the president decide to reject country that has recently opposed or refused to support an important us securityrelated policy others disagree however contending that any discretion on the part of the board would invite unwarranted political influence and undermine mca effectiveness21 another analyst argues that one way to avoid undue foreign policy intrusion would be to channel mca funds through multilateral entities such as the world bank22 congressional proposals to modify board of directors discretion as noted below the senate foreign relations committee initially reported an mca authorization bill that did not authorize the creation of millennium challenge corporation with board overseeing its operations instead s 1160 placed the mca within the state department under the authority of the secretary of state and gave the secretary the power to determine eligible countries through the evaluation of governments commitment to several factors in the three areas of ruling justly economic freedom and investing in people subsequently however the senate voted on july 9 2003 to modify the mcc structure and the role of the board of directors by adopting revised text that was largely based on proposal offered by senator lugar s 1240 the modified arrangement which was incorporated as division c of s 925 established corporation to be managed by ceo under the senate measure the ceo would report to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state s 925 as amended further established board of directors chaired by the secretary of state and grants the board the power to determine eligible countries by evaluating the commitment of country to democratic governance economic freedom and investments in people this did not however appear to limit the boards selections based solely on the results of the performance indicators in this way the senate measure seemed to permit similar degree of discretion that the administrations plan envisioned the housepassed measure hr 1950 was similar to the senate bill in that it required eligible countries to have demonstrated commitment to bolstering democracy investing in health and education and promoting sound economic policies but did not specifically identify how such commitment would be determined other than through the creation of eligibility criteria and methodology 20 continued the board issues waiver and deviates from the performance indicator outcome it should be required to publically issue policy justification and rationale for making the exception see palley the millennium challenge accounts elevating the significance of democracy as qualifying criterion p 14 21 brent d schaefer and paolo pasicolan how to improve the bush administrations millennium challenge account heritage foundation backgrounder 1629 february 28 2003 22 nicolas van walle comment on the mca proposals center for global development january 9 2003 available at httpwwwcgdevorgnvfeatures_mcahtml crs18 as enacted the mca authorizing legislation follows the general themes of earlier house and senate bills eligible countries are to be determined to the maximum extent possible by objective and quantifiable indicators measuring countrys commitment to the three core policy goals of ruling justly promoting economic freedom and investing in people the legislation directs that the selection is to be based on the consideration of three factors the extent to which the country meets or exceeds the eligibility criteria the opportunity to reduce poverty and promote economic growth in the country and how much money is available to carry out mca programs this appears to provide substantial flexibility and discretionary authority in the selection process where the house and senate bills diverged however regarded who made the determination of eligibility and therefore who would be in position to exercise discretion in deviating from strictly statistical evaluation s 925 as amended on july 9 gave the board of directors authority to determine whether country is eligible while hr 1950 placed the power with the corporations ceo the enacted legislation gives this authority to the board of directors implications for other us assistance programs the mca initiative will be an additional economic assistance tool of the united states and is not intended to replace or substitute for any existing channel of us foreign aid it can be expected therefore that overall american aid will continue to serve multiple national interests and foreign policy goals including security humanitarian multilateral and commercial objectives administration officials have made commitment that the mca will be in addition to existing aid activities and that regular us programs will continue even in mcaparticipating countries nevertheless because of the priority being placed on the mca policy orientation and the size of the financial investment there almost certainly will be ramifications of the new initiative for current programs foremost may be funding tradeoffs especially given rising budget deficits and the costs of fighting the war on terrorism spending issues are also discussed below in the section on legislation and budgets issue commitment to global initiatives during the past year some analysts have argued that portion of the mca should be dedicated to effective and resultsoriented global programs operated on multilateral basis one concern is that the large amount of resources directed to the mca may limit the us ability to maintain or expand upon commitments to such activities as the global fund to fight hivaids tuberculosis and malaria another worry is that soundly managed high impact programs in countries with weak governance and poor corruption standards will miss out on the mca opportunity to accelerate process that is already making contribution to longterm economic growth and poverty reduction proponents of this view advocate twotiered approach to the mca in which separate pools and perhaps multiple pools are maintained to serve several types of activities23 23 see for example gene sperling and tom hart better way to fight global poverty broaending the millennium challenge account foreign affairs marchapril 2003 p 9 crs19 the tradeoff for this approach would be that significantly fewer resources per country would be available most likely reducing the impact of mca assistance some also caution that multilateral programs regardless of their merits do not necessarily have the same resultsoriented performance requirements of the mca fact that would undermine the main objective of the mca increased resources are only one important feature of the new initiative and to many mca advocates the most significant feature by far is the goal of allocating the aid where it will have the greatest impact and be most readily accounted for issue policy coherence and usaid program goals in mca countries the administration says it will maintain regular development aid programs in country while it simultaneously launches far larger mcadesigned activity executive officials have not said however how this might affect the shape and goals of continuing programs managed by usaid missions some may argue that regular aid objectives should be reoriented to maintain policy consistency with the mca initiative and in some cases to help facilitate the core focus of the larger pool of resources others especially within usaid country missions may question whether successful projects should be abandoned with potential negative impact on the target population in perhaps the clearest statement to date usaid administrator natsios told the house foreign operations appropriations subcommittee that actions may vary from country to country he noted that usaid missions in mcaselected countries would likely undertake strategic review of their programs and may adjust projects to support the mca contract in other cases however missions might continue highpriority activities such as those combating hivaids or curbing trafficking in persons or terminate certain activities24 some of these same issues regarding policy coherence are being raised regarding the relationship between the mca and other us economic and trade tools aimed at promoting economic growth in developing nations one study for example concludes that there is very little overlap between countries likely to qualify for the mca and those currently eligible for debt reduction under the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative or for trade preferences under the african growth and opportunity act25 congressman jim kolbe chairman of the house foreign operations subcommittee the house panel with jurisdiction over funding the mca suggests that mca qualifiers should get special consideration for expedited trade preferences that would further accelerate economic growth possibilities26 still others who support the mca framework find fault with the administration for not devising simultaneously an overall foreign aid strategy into which the mca fills one of several elements of comprehensive policy27 24 statement by andrew natsios administrator usaid before the house foreign operations appropriations subcommittee may 21 2003 25 brainard compassionate conservatism confronts global poverty p 160 26 jim kolbe lessons and new directions for foreign assistance the washington quarterly spring 2003 p 197 27 steve radelet will the millennium challenge account be different the washington quarterly spring 2003 p 184 crs20 beyond us programs and policies other foreign aid donors and institutions are expressing concerns that the mca may be creating additional and perhaps competing performance goals to those that already exist how mca program goals align with the millennium development goals is of particular concern organizational structures one of the most contentious issues associated with the mca policy review process has been and is likely to continue to be where the mca program management will be placed this debate has raised issues discussed for many years concerning under what auspices us foreign aid policy should be designed coordinated and managed over the years suggestions have ranged from coordination within the national security council creation of umbrella organizations like the illfated international development cooperation agency and most recently the merger of such responsibilities into the state department after extensive debate during the mid1990s decision was reached to make usaid the principal us government bilateral aid agency totally independent but to have it operate under the guidance of the secretary of state after considering numerous options including the placement of the mca as separate unit with the state department the administration proposed to create new government entity the millennium challenge corporation to manage the initiative given the innovative and nontraditional approach inherent in the mca concept executive officials said it makes sense to establish new entity to oversee its implementation the corporation as proposed would have ceo confirmed by the senate and staff of more than 100 that would be drawn largely from other government agencies and serve for limitedterm appointments board of directors chaired by the secretary of state and include the treasury secretary and omb director would oversee the mcc although it appears there is precise existing model in the us government officials said that the mcc would most closely resemble the overseas private investment corporation an organization that promotes private american investment overseas and the commodity credit corporation an arm of the department of agriculture that manages export credit guarantee programs for the commercial sale of american agricultural goods an important difference between these and the mcc however is the proposal to have cabinetmember board oversee the latter and make final recommendations issue the need for new organization before agreeing on the mcc the interagency steering committee reportedly looked seriously at the option of creating separate unit within the state department to manage the mca one reason for rejecting this proposal may have been the relative lack of experience of state department staff in administering aid programs this was one of the central issues considered when the question of whether to fold usaid into the department was under debate this technical shortcoming however could have been overcome by adopting the mcc principle of detailing aid experts from other agencies to staff the office broader reason for not placing the mca within the state department however may have been concern that it would be located too close to the center of the us foreign policy apparatus that would limit the programs immunity from strategic and political influences at minimum many observers believed there would be perception problem whether true or not that the mca did not truly crs21 represent departure from the past aid entanglements with broad us foreign policy interests at the same time many groups encouraged the administration to establish the mca as an office within usaid but apart from the normal operations of the agency various external groups have argued that usaid with its 40 years of development experience maintained the knowledge staff and ontheground country presence to most effectively administer and monitor the mca to place responsibility elsewhere they contend would risk duplication of effort competing priorities and inconsistent policies28 another businessrelated organization also opposes the creation of new institution rather it recommends the establishment of small core office unspecified as to where it would be placed that would identify program priorities and distribute the mca funds to usaid and the trade and development agency tda29 others are skeptical however that usaid is best suited to implement the mca concept the agency is frequently criticized as encumbered with excessive regulations managed with poor financial systems and timeconsuming planning cycles and burdened by extensive congressional oversight one analysis after weighing both the merits and disadvantages of placing the mca within usaid concluded that if the administration wants the mca to operate differently than usaid it should create new agency to manage it30 congressional proposals to modify the organization structure proposals considered by the senate shifted positions on the organizational issue as bills moved through the legislative process in 2003 s 1160 as reported by the foreign relations committee in may 2003 did not authorize the creation of the mcc as proposed by the president instead the legislation designated the secretary of state as the coordinator of mca assistance and directed the secretary to designate coordinator within the state department for managing the program the coordinator who would be confirmed by the senate would have authority to develop the list of performance indicators select eligible countries and to coordinate mca programs with other donors the committee adopted this approach by approving an amendment offered by senators hagel and biden approved 118 the sponsors noted that in 1998 congress had consolidated two independent agencies usia and acda in the state department in order to give the secretary more director authority over all tools of us foreign policy to create separate entity to manage what could become the cornerstone of american foreign assistance they argued would run counter to these recent efforts to better integrate and coordinate foreign policy decisionmaking 28 see for example the arguments of interaction raised in its may 2002 policy paper the millennium challenge account new vision for development 29 business recommendations for administering the millennium challenge account business council for international understanding available at httpwwwbciuorgmcapdf 30 see carol lancaster where to put the millennium challenge account center for global development october 15 2002 crs22 supporters further questioned what value the omb director would provide by being on the board of directors given that the director is generally not assigned policy making responsibilities the administration strongly opposed the committees action to place the mca in the state department at the markup session on may 21 2003 chairman lugar read letter from secretary powell underscoring the value of new independent and creative entity for managing this new start to us foreign aid the secretary said that if this approach remains in the final bill he would recommend that the president veto the legislation senator lugar who opposed the bidenhagel amendment proposed an alternative structure in new legislation s 1240 as introduced on june 11 would create millennium challenge corporation headed by ceo who would report to the secretary of state senator lugar intended that such an arrangement would provide the corporation with the same degree of independence and status as usaid but establish chain of command that would permit the secretary of state to exercise broad authority over the mca s 1240 created board of directors made up of the secretary of state chairman the secretary of the treasury the usaid administrator the us trade representative and the mcc ceo the full senate adopted the general approach proposed by senator lugar when it voted on july 9 2003 to incorporate modified text of mca authorizing legislation into s 925 an omnibus foreign policy authorization bill the approved text further strengthened the explicit relationship between the corporation and the secretary of state by adding that the ceo shall report to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary the administration did not express objection to the revised legislation the house bill hr 1950 took somewhat different approach than the modified senate proposal that was closer to the administrations position although with some important differences hr 1950 would create new millennium challenge corporation sought by the president but altered the composition of the board of directors and as noted above the authority of the mccs chief executive officer the board would include the secretary of state as chairman and the secretary of the treasury as proposed but deleted the director of omb and added the usaid administrator the us trade representative and the ceo of the mcc the bill also included four additional members to be appointed by the president from list submitted by the majority and minority leaders of the house and senate the board would further include as nonvoting exofficio members the ceo of opic and the directors of the trade and development agency peace corps and omb the house measure further created an advisory council that would advise consult and make recommendations to the ceo and board of directors for improving the mca the council would include seven ceoappointed members from the non governmental sector including business labor private and voluntary organizations foundations public policy organizations and the academic community as enacted title vi of the foreign operations appropriations act 2004 as included in division d of pl 108199 the mca authorizing legislation combined approaches found in both house and senate bills the statute creates an independent millennium challenge corporation headed by ceo who is confirmed by the crs23 senate and reports to the board of directors the board consists of the secretary of state chairman the secretary of the treasury the usaid administrator the us trade representative and the ceo four additional individuals will be on the board that should be named by the president from lists of candidates supplied by the majority and minority leaders in the house and senate the enacted legislation however does not require advisory council as proposed by the house issue role of mcc staff in managing and monitoring the mca one of the first concerns of aid managers is the ability of 100staff organization to maintain proper oversight and accountability standards over what will become 5 billion program by comparison usaid maintains staff of nearly 2000 american directhires and several thousand more contractors and foreign nationals based overseas to implement roughly 8 billion program few would argue that similar workforce is needed indeed there would likely be minimal support for bureaucracy even half that size but with central mandate of performance results and accountability the mca requires strong monitoring capability the administration has mentioned the prospect of an outside independent auditing system but the issue appears to remain unresolved even though usaid will not manage the mca it is likely that its staff especially those located in mca participant countries will play supporting role in various capacities usaid administrator andrew natsios has told his staff that the agencys long record of best practices and experience will be required if the mcc is to be successful but how this will operate in the field is an open question there is concern among some usaid professionals that the time and attention of mission staff to support administrative contracting and procurement needs of mca programs will diminish their ability to manage regular aid programs and as mentioned above how the current mission portfolio relates to mca objectives is unclear issue future of usaid the creation of new agency to manage the mca is likely to be viewed by some as vote of confidence in usaid this may stimulate renewed debate over whether the usaid mandate should be modified perhaps limiting it to strictly humanitarian aid agency or folding it into the state department or the mcc itself at some future date usaid supporters are concerned that an mca managed outside the principal us development organization will establish twoclass aid system with usaid responsible for addressing the needs of the weaker performers while the main emphasis will transfer to the mcc the potential impact on staff recruitment and morale and eventually resources they believe could be serious an argument could be made as well however that this provides an opportunity for usaid not only to demonstrate its expertise as an aid organization and serve the mcc as valued consultant but also can serve as incentive to review its own operations and correct some of the persistent problems identified by critics31 31 one analyst also notes certain irony to locating the mca outside of usaid and leaving the agency with just three core missions humanitarian immediate postconflict and basic health and education programs in poor performing nations this would place usaid continued crs24 congressional proposals to modify usaids role during legislative consideration of mca authorizing bills congress attempted to clarify the relationship between the mcc and usaid in efforts to minimize overlap and inconsistency of aid policies and operations as mentioned above under both bills the usaid administrator would become voting member of the board of directors s 925 as amended further directed corporation staff posted overseas to coordinate the mca program with the usaid mission director in that country the legislation also directed usaid to ensure that agency programs would help prepare potential mca participant countries to become eligible for assistance similarly hr 1950 gave usaid the lead role in assisting countries to become eligible in the future that had demonstrated commitment to development but failed to qualify based on the performance indicators the socalled nearmiss countries up to 15 of the amount authorized annually for the mca could be made available for such usaid programs the senate measure also provided up to 10 of annual mca funds be available to countries that failed to qualify because of unreliable data or lack of performance on only one indicator although the corporation not usaid would provide the assistance hr 1950 also directed the mcc to consult with usaid officials regarding the contents of contract or compact between the us and an mca participant country and required that the mcc and usaid coordinate their programs to the maximum extent possible during house floor debate members adopted an amendment by congressman kolbe intended to further clarify usaids role in providing us economic assistance the language stated that the usaid administrator shall report to the president through and operate under the foreign policy authority and direction of the secretary of state32 the kolbe amendment also authorized usaid to extend assistance to countries ineligible for mca aid so that they may become eligible and permitted usaid to help in the evaluation execution and oversight of the mca projects the enacted legislation authorizing the mca title vi of the foreign operations appropriations act 2004 as included in division d of pl 108199 specifically addresses the issue of the mca and usaid relationship section 615 of the measure requires the ceo to consult with the usaid administrator and that usaid must ensure that its programs play primary role in preparing countries to become eligible for the mca as such the legislation makes available up to 10 of the mca appropriation 99 million in fy2004 for assisting countries that demonstrate significant commitment to the mca requirements but narrowly miss qualifying usaid may provide this support the statute further requires usaid to seek to ensure that agency programs play primary role in helping prepare 31 continued programs much closer to broad us foreign and strategic policy interests than the mca yet the state department by virtue of the secretary being the mcc board chairman would have greater influence over the mca than the independent usaid see brainard compassionate conservatism confronts global poverty p 165 32 this is similar to current law sec 1522 of pl 105277 which states that the usaid administrator shall report to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state crs25 country that has failed to qualify previously to better compete in the next selection process program development and selection with broad agreement that development programs work best when they are designed and therefore owned by the host country and not imposed from outside executive officials stress that mca programs will be countrydriven once nation is identified as eligible it will be invited to draft and submit program proposals for evaluation and selection through the mcc projects should directly support broad national development strategies already in place preferably constructed with extensive input from civil society since several of the possible mca countries have already designed such strategies as part of the heavily indebted poor country hipc debt reduction initiative the poverty reduction strategy papers these prsps might serve as the guiding framework for program goals where appropriate the administration has outlined numerous types of programs that might be supported by the mca budget support for various community sector or national initiatives infrastructure development commodity financing training and technical assistance and capitalization of enterprise funds or foundations selection would depend on countryspecific circumstances and would not be appropriate in all cases for example budget support programs would only be suitable where governments maintain transparent budgeting accounting and control systems and have strong governance and anticorruption records endowing enterprise funds or foundations might be appropriate where other alternatives are weak or where innovative ways of financing development proposals appear attractive an eligible country could submit multiple proposals annually some of which might take several years to implement the mcc would create contractual relationship with selected countries and require the establishment of project performance goals so that progress could be closely monitored should performance fall behind or fail the contract could be declared void and funding cutoff issue detailing the types and targets of programs one of the next steps for mca planners will be to refine more precisely the nature of programs the mca will support who the beneficiaries will be and what criteria will be used in making the selection number of groups especially in the us ngo community have stressed the need to include programs that will directly support non governmental and civil society activities that may operate independently of the government some advocate that the mcc solicit proposals directly from private nongovernmental groups33 the administration appears to be receptive to the principle that mca funded activities need not support only governmentrun or sponsored initiatives but also could include projects operated directly by the private sector or ngos the draft legislation submitted to congress in february 2003 allowed the mcc to issue grants 33 see for example palley the millennium challenge accounts elevating the significance of democracy as qualifying criterion p 13 crs26 to both private and public entities what may be more problematic is the receipt of proposals straight from these nongovernmental sources this might result in an awkward competitive relationship between government and nongovernment submissions competition that might be best settled by the country itself prior to transferring recommendations to the mcc usaid administrator natsios told the house appropriations foreign operations subcommittee on may 21 2003 that while the mca would likely include programs proposed by nongovernmental entities the contract would need to be signed by the host government and that the government would be responsible for managing and overseeing the project another issue related to the types of programs eligible for mca resources is the capacity of both the us and participant countries to manage the projects budget support infrastructure and commodity assistance most likely would be largescale activities where substantial amounts of resources could be invested thereby reducing the total number of projects to be managed and monitored communitybased or ngo projects on the other hand likely would be much smaller in size and funding requirements but far more numerous in totality while supporting the broadest array of development programs with mca funds provides the maximum opportunities us policy makers will have to decide whether they are prepared to assume responsibility for large number of projects in the mca portfolio and the associated management oversight and accountability demands key principal endorsed by numerous mca proponents is that programs must be countryowned designed by broad spectrum of government and civil society as noted above some have suggested that prsps that have been developed by many potential mca countries could be used as the guiding framework in devising program proposals34 recognizing however that many mca countries do not have sufficient capacity to design program proposals on their own many suggest that usaid and others assist but do not control the development of program submissions35 congressional action on program issues the enacted mca authorizing legislation permits resources to be provided to wide range of entities including central governments ngos regional and local governments and private groups assistance may take the form of grant cooperative agreement or contract with any of these eligible entities the legislation requires that the united states enters into compact with qualifying country that describes the program to be funded how it will be monitored and how the development goals will be achieved the compact cannot exceed five year commitment the measure specifically prohibits assistance for military purposes for any project that would likely result in the loss of american jobs for projects that would likely cause significant environmental health or safety hazard or for abortions or involuntary sterilizations the legislation further sets out the process by which the ceo can suspend or terminate compact in cases where the country has engaged in activities contrary to 34 see for example millennium challenge account proposed conceptual approach for eligibility us conference of catholic bishops august 13 2002 available at httpwwwusccborgsdwpinternationalmcahtm 35 brainard compassionate conservatism confronts global poverty p 161 crs27 us national security interests has taken actions inconsistent with the criteria for determining mca country eligibility or has failed to meet the requirements of the compact legislative and funding matters the administration submitted in early february 2003 draft mca authorizing legislation and separately proposed 13 billion for the first year funding level program flexibility as expected was one of the key themes integrated throughout the draft bill executive officials said that while the mca should have its own statutory base separate from existing laws including the foreign assistance act of 1961 current restrictions that prohibit us assistance to countries would remain these include lengthy list of potential infractions including those related to human rights drug production terrorism nuclear weapons transfers and testing military coups debt payment arrears and trafficking in women and children just to name few in keeping with the desire for flexibility the draft legislation would make available mca resources notwithstanding any provision of law but with notable exception countries that currently cannot qualify for us assistance under part 1 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 that part of the act authorizing programs for bilateral development aid narcotics control international disasters the former soviet union and central asia among others would remain ineligible for mca funds however if the president waived any prohibition under part 1 for particular country that nation would then be eligible for mca resources36 another area of flexibility highlighted in the draft bill concerned personnel and administrative authorities the ceo of the corporation would be granted authority to establish and modify in the future human resources management system without regard to existing laws governing civil service and foreign service activities although certain provisions including merit and fitness principles cannot be waived the draft submission further granted the ceo the authority to appoint and terminate personnel notwithstanding civil service and foreign service laws and regulations the bill would also allow the mcc to transfer mca resources to any us agency and would permit the corporation to draw on the services and facilities of other federal agencies in carrying out the program on the funding question the administration expressed commitment to 5 billion mca program by fy2006 although the pace at which resources approach that figure would be influenced by anticipated demand as well as larger budgetary considerations stemming from competing spending priorities growing deficit and other possible policy initiatives for fy2004 the president requested 13 billion figure less than onethird of the three year goal that some had expected the administration did not provide any projections for fy2005 36 for example the president may waive human rights restrictions for part 1 programs if he determines that the aid will benefit the needy people of the country section 116 likewise the president make exempt application of aid cutoffs based on national interest requirements for countries that do not cooperate on narcotics control matters crs28 the president further made commitment that mca resources would not be drawn from existing aid programs but would be in addition to those appropriations although of course final decisions on appropriations are made by congress the administration sought large 26 billion or 16 increase in foreign operations appropriations programs for fy2004 including the mca funds but some areas of the proposal especially for bilateral development assistance programs fell below current amounts for fy2003 issue flexibility and congressional directives and oversight an issue that has been heatedly argued between congress and all administrations for many years has been the practice of congressional legislative directives and earmarks in foreign aid authorization and spending laws executive officials argue that the excessive use of such directives both formal and informal seriously erodes their ability to manage foreign policy and operate coherent foreign aid program most in congress view the use of directives and earmarks however as legitimate tool for congressional participation in setting foreign aid policy and spending priorities some members point to congressional emphasis in recent years on initiatives such as child health basic education and international hivaids programs that both the clinton and bush administrations subsequently came to embrace and support with higher budget requests without congressional pressure through earmarks us commitment and leadership on these policies would not exist to the extent they do today many argue moreover some contend that these broad sector allocation directives represent prioritysetting decisions by lawmakers and reflect the appropriate and constructive power of congress to manage the federal purse it is the far more targeted earmarks they contend benefitting special interests or specific organizations and firms that are problematic from the executives perspective the dispute over congressional foreign aid directives is unlikely to be resolved during any mca debate however the distinctive nature of the mca initiative provided the administration with different set of arguments against earmarks because of the demandbased resultsdriven concept of the mca executive officials contended that the traditional pattern of congressional directives specifying funding amounts for selected countries or activities and placing restrictions on certain operations would undermine the basic principles of the mca concept legislative setasides for particular set of countries or for certain program activities would arguably undercut the transparent objective process of selecting the best performers in settling these differences one model to examine might be how congress authorizes and funds other demanddriven programs in the annual foreign operations appropriation bill since it is not known in advance who may request or require support under programs such as the exportimport bank the trade and development agency or international disaster assistance congress generally appropriates amounts that are expected to be needed to meet the resource demands placed on these activities with few or setasides for specific requirements authorizing laws for these programs include some restrictions but are generally not nearly as extensive as those for regular bilateral economic and military aid programs an important crs29 difference however between such programs and the mca is that their purpose is far more narrowly defined than that of the mca linking existing foreign aid eligibility requirements with the mca drew broad support within congress since many of those requirements reflect fundamental social and political values and were congressionally initiated but the prospect of applying to an mca participant these overarching aid prohibitions especially those that require an administration discretionary determination to trigger the aid cutoff raised new set of issues would for example the extent to which the us has major financial investment in successful mca project influence decision on whether to declare the government in violation of narcotics cooperation standards congressional action on flexibility and oversight issues for the most part the enacted mca authorizing act refrains from earmarking providing authorities consistent with mca principals set out by the administration and permitting the executive to implement the program with degree of flexibility the measure authorizes assistance notwithstanding any other provision of law however countries which are ineligible for american economic aid due to restrictions contained in the foreign assistance act of 1961 or any other provision of law cannot be selected for mca support this provision will likely eliminate consideration of number of countries although in most cases these countries would most likely be weak performers under the mca selection criteria moreover as noted above assistance may not result in the loss of american jobs displace us production pose major environmental health or safety hazard be used for military support or finance abortions or involuntary sterilizations the statute also adds several requirements aimed at strengthening congressional oversight of the mca the legislation requires the secretary of state to post information about the mca in the federal register and on the internet and to submit an annual report on mca operations issue funding and possible tradeoffs following submission of the fy2004 budget mca advocates closely examined two funding issues the size of the mca request and proposals for other us economic aid programs many believed that mca resources should and would grow in equal amounts of 167 billion per year to reach the 5 billion total in three years conflicting administration statements gave credibility to the view that this was the intention although officials have said more recently that this is not the case for one reason since the number of qualifiers the first year is still far from certain the funding requirements may be quite different from 167 billion in addition the budget environment was much different than it was in march 2002 when the president issued his policy statement budget deficits had risen creating greater pressure to hold spending down in nearly all areas such pressures are likely to continue throughout future budget debates making the task of accommodating new and large funding initiative more difficult one way to manage mca increases would be to rearrange overall foreign aid spending priorities and reduce amounts elsewhere but the president said the administration would not take that path while the fy2004 budget request largely maintained funding for other foreign aid programs at existing levels although with crs30 few important exceptions congressional appropriators faced limitations in their ability to fully provide for both the mca and other aid accounts the effects of war in iraq and unanticipated foreign policy contingencies arising later in 2003 created new resource demands when congress decided on different appropriation priorities than the president and allocated smaller amount to the foreign operations funding bill it set the stage for direct tradeoffs between the mca and competing security economic and humanitarian activities in addition the mca was not the only foreign operations program that was vying for increased spending for fy2004 the presidents budget included several other new initiatives including those for additional hivaids resources topping up the hipc debt reduction initiative contingency funds addressing famine and conflict needs while the overall request for foreign operations was well above fy2003 enacted levels up 16 these new initiatives accounted for most of the increase leaving continuing programs with more modest 36 rise some foreign aid proponents were especially concerned about reductions in the presidents fy2004 budget for development assistance and global health programs compared with the administrations request for fy2003 the fy2004 budget blueprint was the same combined 296 billion total for these core bilateral development aid activities but due to congressional additions the fy2003 levels had increased to 323 billion making the fy2004 request 8 less than enacted amounts for fy2003 some argued that these and similar reductions below fy2003 appropriations for refugees disaster and food aid broke the presidents pledge to make the mca an additional source of funding in order to reach conclusion however one would have to know whether funds proposed for the mca would be made available for accounts supporting similar activities if this new initiative was not submitted it is unclear that in the absence of the mca or any of the other new initiatives that an equivalent amount of resources would have been made available for other bilateral economic aid programs congressional proposals to modify mca funding levels throughout the 2003 debate over mca authorization and appropriation funding amounts congress struggled with the challenge of fully funding the presidents 13 billion mca request and addressing other foreign aid priorities senate bills s 1160 and s 1426 authorized and appropriated 1 billion for the mca in fy2004 the authorization further provided for 23 billion in fy2005 and 5 billion for fy2006 in the house hr 1950 authorized 13 billion while hr 2800 appropriated 800 million as enacted in title vi of the foreign operations appropriations act 2004 included in division d of

300 million less than requested37 this appropriation reduction may affect the number of countries and program proposals selected for fy2004 and the pace at which the initiative would move forward

relations committee had reported hr 2441 which was incorporated with modifications to hr 1950 and passed by the house on july 16 crs35 appendix b us aid compared to other major donors and the impact of the mca for many years the united states has been criticized by other nations and international development organizations for not contributing enough to fight global poverty and promote economic growth although the united states was the largest provider of official development assistance oda38 until the early 1990s and was second to japan in most years since until 2001 its contribution has been at or near the bottom of the list of international donors when measured as proportion of national wealth figure 1 oda performance 2002 in 1972 the united nations adopted resolution calling on developed countries to allocate 07 of gnp for foreign economic assistance this target which continues to be cited by many nations and international organizations was never endorsed by the united states and has been achieved by only few mainly nordic countries the united states defends its record as development aid provider arguing that contributions to global poverty reduction should not be measured simply in terms of 38 oda is category used by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to measure and compare the efforts of 22 member countries in supporting global economic development oda includes all concessional and grant economic and food assistance excluding export promotion programs and military support it also excludes assistance to certain countries that are more economically advanced such as israel russia ukraine poland and hungary consequently oda measures large part but not the total amount of us economic assistance in fy2003 for example the united states provided about 12 billion to nations that are not included in oda figures moreover oda is usually reported on net basis that is aid disbursements minus loan repayments because of these factors oda amounts for the united states are somewhat smaller than actual economic aid appropriations annually approved by congress crs36 aid transfers as percent of gnp39 us officials note that in dollar terms american oda has remained substantial and is programmed on more favorable terms than that of other donors the united states they emphasize was leading voice over the past several years in the heavily indebted poor country hipc debt initiative being the first government to advocate 100 cancellation of bilateral debt owed by the worlds poorest nations american charitable organizations and businesses provide significant proportion of annual aid transfers and private investment to the developing world given the large amount spent by the united states on defense and the security it provides to allies and friends around the world american contributions to global stability and stable environment in which economic development can take shape is much larger than oda expenditures suggest they contend in the coming years if congress continues to appropriate funds for the mca initiative that are in addition to other oda resources the dollar value of us oda will increase perhaps significantly especially if other new foreign aid programs like the global hivaids initiative proceed as planned the administration says that the mca would add 50 to us oda contributions and while that figure may not be reached by fy2006 it is likely to be in the 2540 range but on the other point of measurement oda as percent of gdp the impact will not be so dramatic largely because mca appropriations are likely to be very small relative to the size of the us economy and because of projected gdp growth estimates over the next several years according to current projections assistance would rise from the 2002 level of 012 of gdp to 015 39 in recent years the world bank the oecd and other institutions have substituted the term gross national income or gni for gnp in order to conform to revised 1993 system of national accounts guidelines the us government in most cases uses the calculation of gross domestic product or gdp gni includes gdp plus net receipts of primary income compensation of employees and property income from nonresident sources for the united states gni is slightly larger than gdp in 2000 for example gni was less than onetenth of one percent larger than gdp the calculations in table 2 and the ensuing discussion are made based on omb reported and projected us gdp figures crs37 appendix c potential mca participants country categories idaeligible per
