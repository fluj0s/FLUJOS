ciga rettes remained unchanged at 8 cents per pack from 1951 to 19821 since 1982 the rate has been increased by three federal tax acts the rate was increased to 16 cents per pack as part of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 pl 97248 in the general explanation of the reve nue provisions of the tax equity and fiscal re sponsibility act of 1982 the joint committee on taxation indicated that the reason for this increase was that inflation had caused the effective level of the tax to decline by more than 70 in constant dollars because the tax was imposed as sethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20343crs2 2 as originally enacted increased revenue coll ections were to be credited against the total payments to be made under the tobacco industry ttlement agreement however this provision was repealed under section 519 of the fy1998 ppropriations for labor health and human resources pl 10578 amount rather than as percen tage of sales price the doubling of the tax rate did not increase the perpack tax in real terms above the 1951 level also congress felt that the broadbased increase in reve nue required by the fiscal outlook through 1985 mandated an increase in the cigarette excise taxes next the rates were increased in two stages under the reve nue reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 one half of the increas 4 cents per pack took effect on january 1 1991 with the second half an additional 4 cents in effect as of january 1 1993 thus the revenue reconcilia tion act of 1990 raised the rates from 16 cents per pack to 24 cents per pack the rates were increased because of large continuing federal budget deficits and the need for dditional federa l revenues the most recent increase in federal excise tax rates on tobacco products occurred in the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 like the increases provided under the revenue reconcilia tion act of 1990 the tax rates on ll tobacco products increased in two stages the rates first increased on january 1 2000 the final increase in rates occurred on january 1 2002 in the case of ciga rettes the first stage increased rates by 10 cents pack to 34 cents in the second st age the rates increased an additional 5 cents pack to make the federal excise tax 39 cents per pack in addition the act established tax rate for rollyourown tobacco which is now in effect table 1 provides details on the rate

revenues the master settlement agreement between the states the district of columbia us territories and the tobacco i ndustry had not been signed as result of the master settlement agreement tobacco companies have raised prices number of times so as to raise revenues with which to make the annual payments totaling 2045 billion through 2025 in apparent response to the increase in price projected tobacco consumption has declined thus the joint committees revenue estimates for tobacco receipts would be lower if made under current conditions more recent projected federal tobacco tax estimates prepared by the tr easury department are shown in the final column of table 2 which appears on the final page of this report the projected revenues in the budget documents have also been revised downward tobacco excise taxes are paid into the general fund of the us treasury there continues to be direct relationship between federal tobacco excise tax collections and any particular federal program in those cases where other excise taxes are directly linked with spending programs as through trust funds there is usually relationship between the taxed products and program financed by the funding such as the gasoline and diesel fuel excise taxes and the highway trust f und in some cases excise taxes may be imposed in situations where those actually responsible for damages cannot be held directly accountable such as the 01 cent excise tax on gasoline used for cleaning up underground leaking storage tanks in those cases taxes are levied on current production of product associated with causing the damages that the government program is trying to rectifyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20343crs5 table 2 tobacco excise tax estimates and actual revenue receipts revenue amounts in billions
