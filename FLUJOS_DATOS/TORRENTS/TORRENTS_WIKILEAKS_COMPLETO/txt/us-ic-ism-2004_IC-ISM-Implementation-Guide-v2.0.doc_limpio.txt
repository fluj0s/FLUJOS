intelligence community metadata standards for information assurance information security marking implementation guide pic intelligence community metadata working group release 20 30 april 2004 preface this implementation guide is part of the documentation set for the intelligence community ic metadata standard for information security marking ism the other part of the set is data element dictionary appendix b reference 3 this guide serves to instruct managers and developers on the processes and methods required to adhere to this standard in the collaborative and collateral shared spaces defined by the ic system for information sharing icsis and on implementing and extending this standard to meet organizationspecific needs ic ism is an implementation of the world wide web consortiums specification of the extensible markup language xml reference 5 it consists of set of xml attributes that may be used to associate securityrelated metadata with xml elements in documents webservice transactions or data streams it is distributed as both an xml entity set and w3c xml schema wxs so that the xml attributes defined in the standard can be incorporated into any xml document type definition dtd or schema made available along with the ic ism entity set and wxs are controlled vocabularies of terms that are used as the sources for the values of the ic ism attributes the first section of this implementation guide is an introduction that addresses applicability and the target audience the second section is description of the xml components that constitute the ic ism entity set and wxs the third section explains how to include the ic ism entities or attribute groups in xml dtds or schemas accordingly and how to extend the entity set and wxs to support local requirements in section 4 are illustrations of graphical user interfaces as the preferred method of specifying values for the ic ism attributes section 5 explains how to use the attributes to create portion marks security banners and classificationdeclassification blocks section 6 explains the controlled vocabularies from which the values for the ic ism attributes are drawn section 7 describes each ic ism attribute in detail including permissible values usage examples and notes ic ism is product of the ic metadata working group mwg an activity of the ic chief information officer cio with oversight by the ic cio executive council the development work that resulted in ic ism was performed by panel under the ic mwg comments and suggestions pertaining to this implementation guide should be sent by

declassification 19 introduction 1 what this publication is all about this implementation guide explains how to use the intelligence community information security marking ic ism standard to apply classification and controls tokens to extensible markup language xml documents and data streams the ic ism standard consists of vocabulary of agreedupon xml attributes that were developed by panel of the ic metadata working group ic mwg to support the controlled access program coordination office capco guidelines for security markings reference 2 this guide will help organizations tag xml data in such way that capcocompliant security markings can be generated using standardized transformations and formatting this guide should be used in conjunction with the ic ism data element dictionary ded version 20 reference 3 the ded contains definitions of all of the ic ism attributes 2 applicability this guide applies to intelligence documents or serialized data streams created in xml format for interchange within the community via the ic system for information sharing icsis community organizational and collateral shared spaces the intent is to provide common set of classification and controls xml attributes for use throughout the community that may be associated with any xml data elements and used for categorization and selection as well as formatting of portion marks security banners and classificationdeclassification blocks ic ism is not intended to address business rules associated with using security metadata and is therefore not replacement for capco requirements or the understanding of those requirements users of ic ism may develop specific but separate programming interfaces to implement their required business rules for populating and using the ic ism attributes the ic mwg developed ic ism as part of the ic cio executive council commitment to interorganization interoperability ic ism is based on number of data modeling activities that have occurred in the ic over the last few years 3 the target audience this implementation guide is intended for use by developers and it support personnelnot analysts and other users the guide provides implementation details that should be transparent to authors editors and reviewers users of this guide are expected to have at least basic knowledge of xml the guide has been written with the assumption that readers understand xml syntax angle brackets names name tokens unique identifiers elements attributes et xml namespaces andto very limited degreexml document type definitions dtds and w3c xml schemas wxs the references for these w3c specifications can be found in appendix b 4 where to submit questions and comments points of contact for this implementation guide the ic msp models and the ic mwg are listed in appendix ic ism components ic ism defines 18 xml global attributes and set of controlled vocabularies from which the values of certain attributes may be selected 1 the attributes the global attributes defined by ic ism are to be used to associate capcodefined classification and control marking abbreviation components with xml elements in documents or data streams the names of the 18 attributes are 1 classification 2 ownerproducer 3 scicontrols 4 saridentifier 5 fgisourceopen 6 fgisourceprotected 7 disseminationcontrols 8 releasableto 9 nonicmarkings 10 classifiedby 11 classificationreason 12 derivedfrom 13 declassdate 14 declassexception 15 declassevent 16 typeofexemptedsource 17 dateofexemptedsource 18 declassmanualreview the attribute names follow the naming guidelines promulgated by the federal xml developers guide lower camel case is used except when an acronym is part of the name acronyms are all upper case the formal iso 11179style definitions of the attributes may be found in the ic ism ded 2 how the attributes are packaged the ic ism attributes are provided as an xml entity set for dtds which is available from the ic xml registry as an xml schema document with the name ic_ism_entities the entity set may be downloaded from the ic mwg web sites as well the file name for the entity set is icismv2ent the ic ism attributes are also provided as w3c xml schema wxs which is available from the ic xml registry as an xml schema document with the name ic_ism_wxs the wxs may be downloaded from the ic mwg web sites as well the file name is icismv2xsd the dtd entity set consists of two xml parameter entity declarations that declare entities named securityattributes securityattributesoption the entity text of these entities contains the definitions of the 18 ic ism attributes references to these entities may be inserted into an xml attribute definition list in order to include the names declared values and default values of the ic ism attributes into the attribute definition list of any xml element the wxs version consists of declarations for two attribute groups and the 18 ic ism global attributes the attribute groups which are equivalent to the dtd parameter entities are named securityattributesgroup securityattributesoptiongroup references to these attribute groups may be inserted into complex type definition in order to include the names declared values and default values of the ic ism attributes into the attribute list of any xml element as illustrated by the following figure reference to entity securityattributes will create an attribute definition list in dtd in which classification and ownerproducer are required and the other attributes are implied ie optional entity

securityattributesoptiongroup are meant to be used with any xml element for which classification metadata may not always be required examples might be list items within parent lists or paragraphs for which the classification and controls are set at the level of the parent element however even though the classification and ownerproducer attributes are declared to be optional if one is used they both must be used whenever security attributes are specified for an element with respect to validation of the attributes as they appear in instance documents the dtd and the wxs are functionally equivalentwith one important exception the wxs has an associated xml namespace for more on this see 33 below 3 the controlled vocabularies capco is the authority for the development and use of the classification marking system for the intelligence community this system employs uniform list of security classification and control markings authorized for all dissemination of classified and unclassified information including hardcopy and electronic documents by components of the ic the ic mwg has developed set of controlled vocabularies consisting of valid xml name tokens which are associated with the various general categories of security classification and control markings the name tokens used in the controlled vocabularies that populate the ic ism attribute values are based on the authorized portion marking abbreviations specified in the capco authorized classification and control markings register reference 1 in most cases name token used in controlled vocabulary is identical to the actual capco authorized portion marking abbreviation in those few cases in which capco abbreviation does not meet the syntax requirements of an xml name token this standard uses substitute for the abbreviation controlled vocabulary may be contained either within an enumerated list internal to the declaration of an attribute or within an external document an internal enumerated list is used for attribute classification in dtd syntax this list is called name token group in the wxs syntax it is set of enumerations of type name token the list is built into the declaration of the attribute as its declared value the list provides choices to be used for the attribute value in the dtd syntax the name token group is u c s ts r nu nr nc ns nss nsa cts ctsb ctsbalk ctsa nsat nca this list is identical to the us and nonus classification portion marking abbreviations in the capco register in the wxs syntax the set of enumerations looks like this

xsdenumeration valuensat xsdenumeration valuenca xsdrestriction attribute declassmanualreview also uses an internal name token group in the dtd syntax that group is true false in the wxs syntax declassmanualreview is declared to have the built in data type boolean which by definition means that the permissible values are true and false the ic ism dtd and wxs do not include enumerated lists for the other attributes the permissible values for those attributes are more subject to change and consequently users are expected to refer to authoritative sources for those lists in order to support implementation of ic ism however several controlled vocabularies have been created and registered in the ic xml registry as domain value sets usage of the domain value sets is described and illustrated in section 6 below as sample one of the domain value sets for intnonicmarkings20040430 is listed in appendix d in section 7 where applicable the domain value set for an attribute is identified 4 specifying attribute values for attributes classification and declassmanualreview the value must be one of the name tokens in their internal controlled vocabularies for example to associate classification with an xml element named figure that contains confidential information use start tag like this figure classificationc for attributes classifiedby classificationreason derivedfrom and declassevent the declared values are character data cdata in the attribute definition list in the dtd entity set as shown in figure 1 and figure 3 these same attributes are declared to be of builtin data type string in the wxs therefore the value for any of these attributes is simply literal text string which may contain alphanumeric characters spaces symbols and other legal xml characters however this is not to say that the format and content of value can not be further restricted through configuration of authoring software by implementing organizations in fact it will at times even be necessary to restrict an attribute value in this way in order to comply with capco guidelines for example security derivedfrommultiple sources although the declared value of derivedfrom is just text string that string must be restricted to one of several forms it may specify the title and date of classification guide the title and date of source document or the literal string multiple sources this can only be enforced through software configuration the definitions of attributes declassdate and dateofexemptedsource differ in the dtd version from the wxs version in the dtd version these attributes are declared to be of type nmtoken this means that the value may consist only of the alphanumeric characters and the special characters hyphen underscore _ period and colon it is intended that the value be an iso 8601 compliant date such as 20040430 since this date format conforms to the syntax of name token parser can perform at least rudimentary check that the value is of an appropriate type in the wxs version we take advantage of the builtin data type named date this data type constrains the attribute values to the form yyyymmdd for each of the other attributes the declared value is nmtokens short for name token list this means three things 1 an attribute value may be single name token or it may be spacedelimited list of name tokens where each name token is taken from the associated external controlled vocabulary 2 each name token must conform to the syntax of an xml name token that is it may consist only of the alphanumeric characters and the special characters hyphen underscore _ period and colon 3 the attribute values are case sensitive si and si are not equivalent the reason that these attributes are declared to be of type nmtokens is that multiple controls may apply to the corresponding information for the category of control marking associated with the attribute take these two examples classificationts scicontrolssi classificationts scicontrolssi tk b in example the scicontrols attribute contains single value si in example b however the scicontrols attribute contains two independent values si and tk the embedded space between the name tokens is only delimiter we know this because the declared value of scicontrols is nmtokens note also that since all of the values in these examples consist of just alphabetic characters they conform to the syntax of name token here is another example in which the releasableto attribute value is spacedelimited list of four name tokens classifications disseminationcontrolsrel releasabletousa aus can gbr it should be pointed out that the values in the ic ism controlled vocabularies have been chosen so as to be valid xml name tokens in the great majority of cases the authorized portion marking abbreviations in the capco register already are valid name tokens however in few cases modified versions of the authorized portion marking abbreviations are used in the controlled vocabularies because the abbreviations as they appear in the capco register do not qualify as valid xml name tokens for example for the dissemination control restricted datasigma 1 marking title the capco authorized portion marking abbreviation is rdsg 1 the space between sg and 1 would not be permissible in an xml name token therefore for ic ism rdsg1 is used in the corresponding controlled vocabulary it is up to xslt stylesheets to transform the name tokens appropriately to generate the correct security markings 5 attributes with dependent or conditional relationships numerous and perhaps sometimes obvious dependent or conditional relationships do exist between attributes between attributes with certain values between individual spacedelimited name tokens within an attribute value or between attributes and elements few examples are 1 attributes classification and ownerproducer must be used together both are required in order to specify whether document is us document nonus document or joint document see 714 below 2 when and only when typeofexemptedsource is used dateofexemptedsource must also be used 3 when and only when disseminationcontrols contains the rel or eyes values releasableto must also be used see 710 and 715 below 4 individual values within certain multivalued attributes should be listed in specific order for example the usa value iso 31661 country code trigraph should always be listed first in the value of the releasableto attribute see 715 below 5 manyin fact halfof the ic ism attributes are meaningful primarily at the product level to provide the values for the classificationdeclassification block and the declassification parameter of the banners these should be used as attributes of portionlevel element only when the intent is that the portion will be reused these relationships are rooted in the business rules resulting from compliance to capco classification and control marking guidelines other relevant governances like executive order 12958 and isoo directive 1 and ic mwg guidelines an xml parser program will not and cannot enforce these business rules nor should xslt stylesheets be expected to account for incorrect or inappropriate application of attributes or attribute values within xml documents business rules like these must be enforced through software configuration as part of the process of applying security marking metadata to xml documents within the digital production authoring environment or other applications that create xml data streams one approach by which implementing organizations can enforce business rules is briefly introduced in section 4 6 attributes with specific rules the value of the fgisourceprotected attribute should be applicable iso 31661 country code trigraphs listed in alphabetical order followed by applicable registered international organization tetragraphs listed in alphabetical order identifying the country or countries andor international organizations that furnished information content as the name of the attribute suggests the identity of the sources of the information is to be protected and should not be disclosed therefore additional measures should be taken so that the values of this attribute should never be displayed or disseminated in the icsis shared spaces by contrast when the identity of the country or countries andor international organizations may be disclosed and may appear in portion marks and security banners the fgisourceopen attribute should be used guidelines for interoperability the ic ism dtd entity set and wxs are available from both the ic mwg web sites and the ic xml registry on the web sites the entity set is in file named icismv2ent and the wxs is in file named ic ismv2xsd in the ic xml registry the resource names are ic_ism_entities and ic_ism_wxs they are resources of type xml schema document in the int registry namespace 1 integrating the ic ism entity set the ic ism dtd entity set may be included by reference in any xml dtd this requires adding an entity declaration and an entity reference to the dtd first declare parameter entity for the ic ism entity set file in the following example parameter entity named icsecurityentities is declared the replacement text of the entity icismv2ent is uniform resource locator url for the entity set file entity icsecurityentities system icismv2ent next place parameterentity reference in the dtd at the point at which the ic ism entity set should be included the following example shows parameterentity reference when an xml parser encounters this reference it will retrieve the file icismv2ent and read it as if it were part of the parent dtd at the location of the reference icsecurityentities because the ic ism dtd entity set is itself set of parameter entity declarations it should be included near the beginning of dtd before any references to the ic ism entities are used once the ic ism entity set has been included the ic ism parameter entities may be referenced in the attribute definition list of any element the next example shows the element declaration and attribute definition list declaration for hypothetical element named target element target pcdata attlist target benumber cdata required osuffix cdata implied categorycode cdata implied securityattributes the attribute definition list of target includesin addition to attributes named benumber osuffix and categorycodeall of the ic ism attributes 2 integrating the ic ism w3c xml schema the ic ism w3c xml schema may be included by reference in any xml schema this requires declaring the ic ism version 2 namespace and inserting an import statement into the schema first declare the namespace for the ic ism wxs file in the following example namespace prefix ism is declared for the ic ism xml namespace xsdschema xmlnsxsdhttpwwww3org2001xmlschema xmlnsxlinkhttpwwww3org1999xlink xmlnsismurnusgovicismv2 next insert an import statement into the schema at the point at which the ic ism wxs should be included the following example shows an import statement that tells an xml parser to import schema declarations applicable to the urnusgovicismv2 namespace from the url prescribed by the schemalocation attribute xsdimport namespaceurnusgovicismv2 schemalocationicismv2xsd once the ic ism wxs has been included the ic ism attributes may be referenced in the attribute list of any element the next example shows the declarations for the example target element in the wxs syntax xsdelement nametarget xsdcomplextype xsdsimplecontent xsdextension basexsdstring xsdattribute namebenumber typexsdstring userequired xsdattribute nameosuffix typexsdstring useoptional xsdattribute namecategorycode typexsdstring useoptional xsdattributegroup refismsecurityattributesgroup xsdextension xsdsimplecontent xsdcomplextype xsdelement 3 namespaces as shown above the wxs version of ic ism declares an xml namespace for the schema the name of that namespace is urnusgovicismv2 the purpose of declaring such namespace is to facilitate importation of the ic ism schema into another schema without having to be concerned about conflicts between distinct attribute types that have the same name for example the ic ism attribute classification can be used within another schema even when the other schema also declares an attribute named classification in instance documents the name of an attribute is considered to include the namespace name consequently the full name of classification becomes urnusgovicismv2classification in order to avoid unwieldy names prefixes are used in place of namespace names in the example of element target in the preceding section the prefix that was assigned to the ic ism namespace name was ism in document that is to be validated against wxs the element would be used like this target ismclassificationu ismownerproducerusa benumber1234dd5678 osuffixdd123 categorycode1234ammunition planttarget since dtd syntax predated the advent of xml namespaces dtd parsers do not interpret namespace names or prefixes consequently the current version of the ic ism dtd entity set does not make use of namespaces when dtds are being used to validate an xml document the target example would be written like this target classificationu ownerproducerusa benumber1234dd5678 osuffixdd123 categorycode1234ammunition planttarget in dtd usage it is the responsibility of the organization that develops the parent dtd to be sure that none of the attributes defined for an element conflict with the ic ism attributes that will be used with that element in this document most of the examples were originally created with dtd implementations in mind consequently the examples do not show namespace prefixes 4 xml registry xml registries are vital component in the implementation of shared data exchanges developers looking to express information using xml need support in establishing common lexicons and grammars registry should be the reference point for obtaining the latest dtds schemas controlled vocabularies templates and sample documents currently the ic xml registry httpdiidesncrdisamilxmlreguserindexcfm contains the latest ic ism components and documentation implementing organizations are encouraged to register any extensions to the ic ism dtd entity set and schema so that developers may avoid repeating efforts underway at other agencies reduce overall development efforts and ensure compatibility 5 customizing the ic ism dtd entity set or wxs for internal use ic ism has been specifically designed to allow for extensions changes to the standard may be necessary to support internal requirements of specific agency or community of interest any extensions or changes made to the standard should be maintained as separate organizational representation organizations may extend the ic ism entity set and schema for internal use only the goal of such extensibility of security metadata is to meet each organizations internal or bilateral requirements while maintaining common set of security metadata to allow sharing of information throughout the ic 1 extending or restricting the attributes the extensible nature of xml allows ic ism to be customized for additional attributes in this way agencyspecific attributes may be incorporated into document model this is best accomplished through the use of locally declared parameter entities in an agency specific dtd or locally declared attributes or attribute groups in an agencyspecific schema the agencyspecific dtd or schema sometimes called driver dtd or driver schema would define all agencyspecific extensions and call in all external modules including the ic ism entity set or ic ism wxs this method keeps the ic ism entity set and ic ism wxs free from internal modification later if the ic ism entity set and ic ism wxs are revised the new versions can replace the older versions without impacting local modifications in the following example part illustrates how an organization can declare local parameter entity that has as its replacement text the parameters for two attribute declarationsone named localmarkings and the other named fdo part b illustrates how the locallydefined entity can be referenced as part of an elements attribute definition list to associate the two local attributes along with the ic ism security attributes with an element named part c shows the element and attribute definition list declarations with

additional controlled vocabularies or additions and subtractions to the current controlled vocabularies are possible within an agencys controlled space changes to the controlled vocabularies do not affect the functionality of the ic ism entity set the values used in the controlled vocabularies are recognized by the xml parser as name tokens the xml parser does not validate the name tokens themselves therefore care must be taken to ensure that any changes to the existing controlled vocabularies are the actual name token values to be stored care must be exercised in order to maintain consistency in stored values conversion scripts can be written to correct many inconsistencies but tighter control and handling of the controlled vocabularies would make more practical sense and guarantee greater data reliability from the producer and for the consumer 6 creating stylesheets one of the guiding principals of xml is that information content within an xml document is independent of any presentation format to the greatest degree practical formatoriented markup should be kept out of xml documents therefore in order to be rendered in useful format xml documents require accompanying stylesheets using the extensible stylesheet language xsl reference 7 developers can convert xml content for display in web browser into portable document format pdf for hardcopy printing into other xml hierarchies into text files such as rich text format rtf etc each publishing organization will need to create stylesheets for web and print delivery that adhere to the styling guidelines specific to that organization the xsl for transformations xslt declarative transformation language is the recommended method for creating web pages from xml documents xsl for formatting objects xslfo should be used to create pdf output and input for layout and pagination software stylesheets for each output type may be created to allow for publishing to various formats to meet the specific requirements of individuals and organizations xslt stylesheets that process the ic ism attributes to create portion markings security banners and classificationdeclassification blocks are available from the ic mwg web sites for those who choose to develop their own stylesheets here are some guidelines use attributes classification and ownerproducer together to determine whether to output us classification parameter non us classification parameter or joint classification parameter expect the tokens in listvalued attributes to be in the order prescribed by the capco register in other words it should not be necessary to sort the list of values use the appropriate separators when displaying multiple values from listvalued attributes the lists for ownerproducer fgisourceopen and releasableto are all formatted differently and releasableto is formatted differently when it is used in conjunction with rel and in conjunction with eyes transform date values in declassdate and dateofexemptedsource from the yyyymmdd format to yyyymmdd for display transform the tokenized control values that differ from the capco abbreviations to the capco form for example transform the disseminationcontrols value rdsg1 to rdsg 1 for display if the value list for disseminationcontrols contains eyes or rel find the list of country codes and international organization codes in attribute releasableto output mr in the banners if any of the conditions listed in section 783 apply if more than one of the attributes declassdate declassevent declassexception and typeofexemptedsource are present stylesheet must determine what to put in the banners and classificationdeclassification block if declassevent or typeofexemptedsource is present or if declassexception is present and equals 25x1human put mr in the banners if declassdate and declassexception are present and declassexception is not equal to 25x1human put the first 25x token in the banners most of the transformations described by these guidelines are illustrated in section 7 data input techniques it is not the intent of the ic mwg that the security attributes be populated manually the ic security attributes were developed as set of containers for capcoauthorized classification and control markings use of the attributes by themselves does not guarantee that an appropriate combination of attributes and attribute values has been specified for any given portion or product in order to produce valid portion markings valid top and bottom security banner and valid classificationdeclassification block due to the potentially complex business rules associated with properly marking classified information the use of formsbased software interface will provide the best method of creating and storing the security markup business rules except for basic classification were not incorporated in ic ism for several reasons updates can be incorporated more easily into the model business rules regarding security metadata are constantly under revision the model can be customized to meet the requirements of each organization it will be an organizations responsibility to understand and incorporate the required business practices for security metadata 1 graphical user interfaces security marking gui should provide user with all of the valid capco security marking options for the context in which she works business rules to support relationships of the capco security markings can be incorporated into the gui however most likely the gui itselfthat is the formwill not provide the logic for validating the overall classification of product the use of roll up scripts and human review will ensure the information is properly marked for archiving and distribution figure 5 shows notional gui with tabbed pages for the classification and controls options it is likely that many workable formsbased and other approaches for assisting with the entry of correct classification markings can be devised this figure serves only to illustrate the idea it illustrates selection options for us classification and controls this particular user interface makes use of xml helper files that contain the requisite controlled vocabularies the data stored in the helper files is used to populate the dialogs list boxes and check boxes this method keeps the controlled vocabularies external to the gui code so that changes to the controlled vocabularies do not necessarily render the code obsolete the xml helper files are text files that can be updated easily by an administrator or authorized user in text editor or xml authoring tool an organization can easily customize these files to limit or extend the security markings used by that organization pic figure 5 security gui with us security marking options displayed figure 6 illustrates gui that assists an author with selection of options for the classificationdeclassification block and the declassification parameter of the banners pic figure 6 gui for selection of declassification here is an example of simple helper file that can be used in conjunction with gui once again this is just one potentially useful approach to maintaining the controlled vocabularies in separate files some implementers of digital authoring solutions use xml topic maps for the vocabularies in any case the helper files are read by the gui software to populate the various list and check boxes this example of helper file is an xml document that contains concatenation of the controlled vocabularies used by

input lacking software application that contains the capco logic and presents gui users may enter security markup into the xml directly using text editor or an xmlaware authoring application that includes dialogs for setting attribute values due to the interrelationships among classification and control markings users must be well versed in capco andor organizational guidelines and business rules when entering attributes directly usage examples of the attributes along with associated controlled vocabularies are provided in this ic ism implementation guide see the ic ism ded for data element definitions of the ic ism attributes the ded will give the user an understanding of each attributes allowed values and complete definition operations on the security attributes once the ic ism attributes are populated in an xml document or data stream the attributes can be used for several key requirements 1 formatting portion marks the top and bottom security banner and the classificationdeclassification block for display in authoring or editing applications in web pages or in print oriented outputs such as portable document format files 2 rolling up the attribute values assigned to child elements in order to determine the classification and controls of the parent element and 3 filtering documents that have been written for multiple security domains in order to produce domainspecific outputs for dissemination 1 creating portion marks the values of the ic ism attributes for any given portionlevel element will be used to format the corresponding portion mark for display purposes an xslt stylesheet may be used to create the portion mark string based on the values of the attributes consider the following example for an element named in an xml document classifications ownerproducerusa scicontrolssi disseminationcontrolsrel releasabletousa can gbr an xslt stylesheet can be used to create the following portion mark string and place it at the beginning of the paragraph text ssirel to usa can and gbr 2 security rollup security rollup can be described as the process of deriving or determining the appropriate set of classification and control marking attributes and their values for document data stream or block element based on all of the classification and control marking attributes and attribute values for subordinate elements found within the document data stream or block element the security rollup process is most often associated with determining the set of product level security attributes which are used to form the security banner highwater marking that is displayed at the top and bottom of document and to form documents classificationdeclassification block the security rollup functionality and methodology may be simple or very complex depending on the extent of security markings for which an organization needs to account with respect to the process of authoring document security rollup may be repeatedly performed while document is being authored within the authoring tool the author may call the rollup function manually at any time andor rollup will be performed automatically prior to closing any authoring session and saving the document from an authoring standpoint security rollup can ensure that the documents highwater marking will be at least at the level necessary based on the classification and control markings of the documents current content when rollup is performed an author can then verify that documents highwater marking is appropriate with respect to the current content and then either accept the results of the rollup or modify the results to designate higher classification level if necessary as part of postauthoring process security rollup can be included in filtering process for domain transformation discussed below any automated rollup processes should be followed by human review and verification to ensure proper markings before dissemination of the documents to the community space the name token values in the ic ism controlled vocabularies duplicate in almost all cases the abbreviations used in portion markings authorized by capco this facilitates the straightforward generation of capcocompliant portion markings with minimum of transformation effort using attribute values containing name tokens from the controlled vocabularies however the generation of capco compliant security banner markings from the productlevel security attributes will require more significant transformation 3 performing domain filtering the ic ism dtd entity set and wxs enable the process of domain filtering through automated methods domain filtering allows document or portions of document to be filtered and combined using xslt stylesheets to form products that can be disseminated to various networking domains based on the classification andor releasability requirements of the domain for example top secret portions of document can be automatically stripped out using an appropriate xslt stylesheet so that the resulting document can be disseminated to secret network single xslt stylesheet can be used to perform all domainfiltering activities however it may be more practical and feasible to modularize the filtering process across multiple stylesheets using the controlled vocabularies as noted above an xml name token nmtoken consists of string of one or more letters digits hyphens underscores periods and colons most of the ic ism attributes require name token or spacedelimited list of name tokens as values as also noted there are relatively small number of instances when capcoauthorized abbreviations do not qualify as name tokens and substitutes are used the name tokens that are the permissible values for the various ic ism attributes are specified in controlled vocabularies for attribute classification the controlled vocabulary is built into the attribute declaration as name token group in the dtd entity set and as list of enumerations in the wxs validating xml parser will use the name token list or enumeration list to ensure that the value of classification is one of the permissible values the controlled vocabulary for classification is internal to the dtd entity set and wxs because it was the expectation of the ic ism developers that the permissible values were very stable and would change only infrequently for the other attributes with controlled vocabularies the vocabularies are not built into the declarations they are external domain value sets they were kept out of the declarations in anticipation that they would change relatively frequently they are documented in this guide and they exist in digital form in the ic xml registry it should be understood that there is mechanism by which an xml parser can ensure that the name tokens it finds are actually taken from any of the external controlled vocabularies all the parser can do in this case is verify that an attribute value is in fact name token or spacedelimited list of name tokens it is the responsibility of implementing organizations to provide means for authors and editors to have access to the associated controlled vocabularies when selecting values for the ic ism attributes and to restrict the population of attribute values to name tokens contained in those controlled vocabularies in some cases the domain value space of an attribute consists of two domain value sets this is true for those attributes that specify iso 31661 country trigraphs andor capcodefined international organization tetragraphs 1 replacing extending and sharing replacing or extending the controlled vocabularies to meet the internal requirements of an organization is rather trivial remember an xml parser does not validate the actual name tokens used it only checks for unallowable characters in the name tokens in order to replace or extend the controlled vocabularies an organization should first determine which of the current name tokens are relevant for its use and then define any additional name tokens if necessary the organization should distribute the list of new name tokens to authors and reviewers within the organization see section 42 or integrate the new name tokens into xml helper files for security gui as suggested in section 41 obviously because of the probability of manual input errors checks must be utilized to ensure consistent marking and conformance to the new controlled vocabularies similar checks should be utilized if these controlled vocabularies are shared with other organizations caveat any agencyspecific name tokens must be removed prior to dissemination of the documents contents into the ic shared space 2 controlled vocabulary listings each of the following attributes has one or two associated external domain value sets the contents of the domain value sets are illustrated in section 7 declassexception section 77 disseminationcontrols section 710 fgisourceopen section 711 fgisourceprotected section 712 nonicmarkings section 713 ownerproducer section 714 releasableto section 715 scicontrols section 717 typeofexemptedsource section 718 the domain value sets are maintained as xml instances in the ic xml registry the vocabularies are registered as domain value documents as explained in section 22 the xml schema for the domain value document type is also available in the registry attribute value specifications the following subsectionsone for each of the 18 ic ism attributesshow the permissible values for the attributes and the corresponding formatted marking also shown are usage examples note that this section shows only unclassified permissible values consult the capco register reference 1 for the complete sets it is important to recognize that this is not an official reference for the capco markings the capco register and implementation manual reference 2 are the authoritative sources for most of the abbreviations and markings international standard iso 31661 is the authoritative source for country trigraph codes the authoritative sources for the business rules are the capco implementation manual isoo directive 1 reference 4 and executive orders 12958 and 12951 in the following tables the values
