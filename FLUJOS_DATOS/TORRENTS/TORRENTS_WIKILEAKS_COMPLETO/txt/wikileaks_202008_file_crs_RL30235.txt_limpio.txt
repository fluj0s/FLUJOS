act updated march 12 2008 william g whittaker specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division minimum wage in the territories and possessions of the united states application of the fair labor standards act summary the minimum wage under the fair labor standards act flsa is generally applicable to any state territory or possession of the united states such as puerto rico the virgin islands guam american samoa and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi implementation has been gradual though the ultimate objective has been consistently to raise wages to the highest level that is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment in 1937 and 1938 when congress crafted the flsa there appears to have been little concern about its impact upon the us territories and possessions in 1940 the act was amended to permit special industry committees sics to visit puerto rico and the virgin islands to assess their economies and to make recommendations for subminimum wage in certain industries in 1956 the same procedure was instituted for american samoa guam had always been under the act though it may not have been implemented the cnmi in setting forth the terms of its association with the united states had retained control over its own insular minimum wage by the 1980s and early 1990s puerto rico and the virgin islands had emerged from the sics procedures and come fully under the flsa two territories remained to be accounted for american samoa and in different context the cnmi it was generally assumed that the mainland minimum wage applied to american samoa though it had not been implemented during the early 1950s the department of the interior moved to attract new industry to the island group namely tuna canning the first company van camp sea foods asked congress to grant an exception from the flsa and in 1956 the puerto rican model was adopted the exception remained in place until 2007 when under the flsa amendments of that year the sic system was abolished and the federal minimum wage in steps would be applied the cnmi was acquired by the united states in the aftermath of world war ii when in the mid1970s it became commonwealth in association with the united states the cnmi retained control over its minimum wage and certain aspects of immigration and trade policy decade later in the 1980s congressional hearings uncovered what were alleged to have been sweatshop practices involving the garment and tourism industries with the 2007 flsa amendments the federal minimum wage will be applied in steps to the cnmi in the 110th congress several bills hr 2 hr 976 hr 1591 hr 2206 and hr 5154 dealt with the minimum wage for samoa andor for the cnmi this report will be updated as warranted contents introduction 1 the

possessions of the united states application of the fair labor standards act introduction when congress crafted the fair labor standards act flsa during 1937 and 19381 there appears to have been little concern about how its provisions might affect the territories and possessions of the united states gradually through various procedures and over different time periods the federal minimum wage has come to be applied in most of these jurisdictions in puerto rico and the virgin islands implementation was gradual utilizing special industry committees sics parallel sic was created for american samoa during the middle 1950s by the late 1980s or early 1990s the sics for puerto rico and the virgin islands had been phased out for samoa the sics seem to have had little effect in raising wage rates though the procedure remained in place intermittently until the summer of 2007 when it was abolished the flsa was immediately applicable to guam though it was only enforced about two decades later in 19591960 the case of the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands the cnmi is somewhat different the cnmi was acquired by the united states in the wake of world war ii with the creation of the united nations the island group was assigned to the united states as part of the trust territory of the pacific islands by the mid1970s the islands had entered into covenant of association with the united states under their current commonwealth status in doing so they retained responsibility for the insular minimum wage and exercised control over aspects of insular immigration policy as conditions developed goods produced in the cnmi were to be marketed as made in america combining the advantages of low wages lower than those required in most other us jurisdictions the availability of alien contract labor from china and elsewhere and the right to use made in america label for marketing purposes the relatively small cnmi developed substantial production industry this was especially notable in garments over time the alien labor force came to equal the natives of the cnmi and allegations of sweatshop conditions began to surface at the same time there were affirmations that entrepreneurs of the cnmi had done very well for themselves that is to say business success story2 1 the fair labor standards act of 1938 as amended is the basic federal statute dealing with minimum wages overtime pay child labor industrial homework and related issues 2 see for example clint bolick marianas show how free markets can flourish human continued crs2 thus among us territories and possessions the minimum wage had remained unresolved in american samoa and the cnmi various bills were introduced during recent congresses that would have increased the general minimum wage and at the same time extended the federal standard to the cnmi in addition some have suggested modified restructuring of the covenant of association with regard to minimum wage and immigration and with respect to marketing of cnmi products as made in america as result of the enactment of hr 2206 pl 11028 procedures have now been added to the flsa that will bring the insular minimum wage up to mainland standards this report is an introductory sketch of the role of the minimum wage in the territories and possessions of the united states omitted are nuances of policy that might rightly deserve more extended study the fair labor standards act of 1938 as adopted in 1938 the flsa pl 75718 defined state as any state of the united states or the district of columbia or any territory or possession of the united states3 distinctions were made between the states and the other jurisdictions where flsa wagehour policy was concerned the general concept of the flsa appears to have evolved from experience under the national industrial recovery act the nira 19331935 the nira was basically voluntary depending for much of its even limited success upon the goodwill of the several parties though the nira encountered problems dealing with the territories notably with puerto rico there was built into the act flexibility which initially the flsa did not seem to enjoy4 the nira was declared unconstitutional in 1935 but still it was very much on the minds of the members of congress in 1937 and 1938 and framed much of the context of the wagehour debates of that period in 1938 the flsa set minimum wage of 25 cents per hour for covered workers with step increases to 30 cents per hour one year after enactment and to 40 cents per hour seven years after enactment however the act also provided for system of special industry committees sics for each industry engaged in 2 continued events april 18 1997 p 20 and juliet eilperin roll call january 8 1998 p 13 see also w john moore

defined state as any state of the united states or the district of columbia as the legislation moved through congress the broader language was added see s 2475 black and hr 7200 connery of the 75th congress 4 concerning the national industrial recovery act see bernard bellush the failure of the nra new york norton company inc 1975 crs3 commerce or in the production of goods for commerce the administrator of the wage and hour division at the department of labor dol was thus permitted to examine the several covered industries and as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment to increase the federal minimum wage for particular industries through administrative processes5 such administratively set minima were not to exceed 40 cents per hour nor were they to fall below the level fixed by the statute for each statutory step increase the administrator could reject sic recommendations andor remand the matter to the committee or to another committee these administratively determined wage rates were to have effect only through sevenyear period thereafter the 40cent minimum would become applicable6 congress did not seem to anticipate immediate appointment of industry committees and indeed they came into being only gradually section 8 mandated that the administrator shall from time to time convene the industry committee for each such industry and the industry committee shall from time to time recommend the appropriate wage rates taking into account economic and competitive conditions it directed that such rates not give competitive advantage to any group in the industry but rather that they should take into account transportation living and production costs nor was the age of the worker to be part of the equation7 in general the industry committee was vehicle for upward movement of wage rates its discretion involved only the interim area between the statutory floor 25 cents an hour and an upper level of 40 cents per hour several factors came into play under the special industry committee procedures congress sought to provide for the establishment of the highest minimum wage rate consistent with the statute however it was equally determined that institution of the minimum rate should not substantially curtail employment and finally it provided that any committeeestablished subminimum rates would not give competitive advantage to any group in the industry each of these issues was discussed at some length during the initial debates on the flsa8 the provision for industry committees under section 5 and section 8 has provided through the years context for minimum wage treatment of some insular jurisdictions though that was not it appears initially its purpose 5 section 5 of pl 75718 june 25 1938 6 section 8 of pl 75718 7 ibid apprentices and similarly disposed persons were provided with special option but in the general workforce youth subminimum wage was not agreed to 8 here again the special committee was to elevate wages above the minimum and potentially to do so by grade of work but the minimum wage per was not stratified by age nor by gender crs4 puerto rico in the 1938 statute puerto rico was covered under the flsa in the same manner as the states of the union however between 1940 and 1996 it was afforded special treatment through system of specially industry committees sics now the minimum wage treatment of puerto rico is on par with the several states puerto rico with its capital at san juan was acquired by the united states as result of the spanishamerican war 1898 although its ultimate status would remain somewhat ambiguous the island developed institutions that closely paralleled those of the states just as several states had experimented with minimum wage laws early in the century so did the puerto rican legislature which adopted such requirement in 19199 insular wage rates however remained far below those for most mainland workers through the 1930s when with the enactment of the flsa in 1938 puerto rico was mandated to increase its wage floor interests on the island argued that it would be hard pressed to do so without serious economic dislocation the upward flexibility permitted through the special industry committee structure may have been useful for the mainland but for puerto rico some argued that even the 25 cent floor may have been too high10 during 19391940 various industry groups pressed for remedial legislation for puerto rico on the matter of wagesandhours law claiming that failure to secure relief means the total collapse of industries vital to our economic structure and unemployment for thousands of wage earners dependent thereon11 in 1940 congress enacted new legislation designed specifically for puerto rico and the virgin islands it allowed the flsa minimum wage requirements to be set aside and replaced with special industry wage floors these minima to be developed by industry committees operating in cooperation with the usdol were intended to reflect insular economic realities deviation from the national minimum wage under the flsa was allowable only for so long as and insofar as such employee is covered by wage order issued by the administrator of the wage and hour division within the usdol pursuant to the recommendations of special industry committee12 the intent of this special arrangement for puerto rico and the virgin islands was to bring the two jurisdictions up to the standards observed by the states as rapidly as might be economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment at the same time the committees were prohibited from recommending minimum 9 dietz james l economic history of puerto rico institutional change and capitalist development princeton princeton

wage rate that would give any native industry competitive advantage over its counterpart in the united states13 the process of increasing wage parity with the mainland continued through more than halfacentury during consideration of the 1989 flsa amendments congress revisited the case of puerto rico as it had through the years it was found that in most areas of production the insular employers were meeting national standards the 1989 enactments thus eliminated the special industry committee system for puerto rico and mandated through series of step increases in the insular wage structure under the flsa that all covered workers be paid not less than the applicable federal minimum wage after april 1 199614 the virgin islands under the flsa of 1938 the virgin islands were covered in the same manner as the several states however during the period 1940 to 1989 there was time when wage rates were fixed by special industry committees as had been the case with puerto rico since the mid1990s the minimum wage for the virgin islands has been set at the national level the virgin islands were acquired by the united states in 1917 through purchase from denmark there are about 68 islands in the american virgin chain with only about three actually populated collectively the islands have population of slightly less than 150000 people15 charlotte amalie is the capital the relationship between the islands and the mainland evolved slowly through the decades following their acquisition by the united states like puerto rico the virgin islands were covered under the original flsa enactment of 1938 but if hearings and floor debates are any indication their inclusion may have been more nearly pro forma rather than the result of direct legislative intent during consideration of the flsa in 1937 and 1938 very little attention appears to have been focused upon either the virgin islands or puerto rico however with enactment of the wagehour legislation industry became concerned about its impact and through 1939 and 1940 puerto rican interests appealed to congress for an amendment to the statute on behalf of the islands though the focus of congressional debate appears to have been upon puerto rico the 1940 flsa amendment applied to the virgin islands as well16 where the federal minimum wage could be met it was applied where significant unemployment might have resulted from imposition of mainland wage rates the minima were set by industry committees with the approval of the usdol wage and hour administrator 13 kantor op cit p 1099 14 see pl 101157 section 4 15 populations figures throughout this paper are estimates though they will probably vary little from actual census figures 16 section 3 public resolution 88 june 26 1940 crs6 as in puerto rico flsa coverage was gradually expanded for the virgin islands together with the rest of the nation in 1989 the government of the virgin islands indicated that for all the covered industries wage rates had been raised to meet the national standard therefore the flsa was again altered to eliminate any special treatment for the virgin islands17 guam the flsa has applied to guam since 1938 just as it has applied to the states of the union however it has only been enforced there since about 19591960 guam like puerto rico was acquired by the united states in 1898 as result of the spanishamerican war for 50 years it remained under the jurisdiction of the united states navy then in 1949 president truman transferred administration of the island to the department of the interior in 1950 congress established system of civil government for the island of perhaps slightly less than 200000 people its capital is agana in 1968 the island was allowed to elect its own governor in 1972 to elect nonvoting delegate to the us congress18 prior to world war ii socioeconomic and cultural conditions in guam were quite different from those of the united states or other industrialized countries19 through the years the insular labor force and wage structure appear to have remained multitiered with separate rates for alien workers imported from the philippines for native guamanians for americans recruited on guam and for american workers recruited from the states20 when the civil government was established 1950 colonial administration appears to have been somewhat chaotic one observer stated for example existing laws represented hodgepodge of rules regulations laws naval expressions of policy and letters and other documents having the force and effect of law21 as territory or possession of the united states guam was covered under the original flsa but it seems that the statute was not enforced there thus for these several reasons guamanian employers do not appear to have been involved in discussions during 1939 and 1940 which led congress to alter the act with respect to puerto rico and the virgin islands guam of that period was simply too far removed from washington to be really at issue 17 see pl 101157 section 4 18 for general accounts of guam see paul carano and pedro c sanchez complete history of guam rutland vermont charles tuttle company 1964 and

pacific guam became immediately of interest the island was occupied by the japanese from late 1941 until 1944 when the united states reclaimed the island much of its infrastructure appears to have been devastated much of the economy fell under government control and regulation there was significantly expanded postwar military population that was not native to the island plus major population of filipinos brought into the island by american contractors22 the case for enforcement of federal minimum wage standards in guam was strengthened with the 1948 decision of the us supreme court in vermilyabrown co inc et v connell et 335 us 377 1948 although at issue was the application of the flsa to employees of american contractors engaged in the construction of military facility for the united states in bermuda part of great britain there were clear implications for guam the court identified possession covered under the act as including puerto rico guam the guano islands samoa and the virgin islands23 in dissent in vermilyabrown further justice jackson suggested that the situation of us facility in bermuda was of character different from that of our possessions as enumerated by the courts majority24 in addition with adoption of an organic act for guam in 1950 commission established to review the application of federal laws to the island found that flsa applicability to guam was indisputable particularly in view of the recent decision in vermilyabrown but the commission noted the wage and hour division usdol has field office convenient for serving that area25 again in 1953 chief judge mclaughlin of the us district court for hawaii pointed out in part based on the vermilyabrown decision that the flsa was applicable to guam johnston island american samoa and so forth26 by the late 1950s as potential problems began to mount with regard to labor standards for aliens employed in the construction of overseas bases congress revisited the issue of offshore application of the flsa through the course of hearings in 1957 it was clear that the flsa applied to guam though there was some question about coverage for the filipino workers following from the hearings the 85th congress adopted amendments to the flsa under which guam american samoa and certain other jurisdictions were specifically written into the act27 in 22 see laura thompson guam and its

flsa has applied to american samoa since 1938 just as it has to the states however it appears not to have been enforced there until the late 1950s and then through special industry committee structure the special industry committee arrangement was repealed with the 2007 flsa amendments hr 2206 pl 11028 under pl 11028 changes in the insular rate were to proceed incrementally until it became coequal with the federal rate it would then increase in tandem under the provisions of the federal statute insular history and governance the samoan islands are divided into two segments western samoa formerly british and now independent and american samoa cluster of seven islands governed from the insular capital of pago pago there had been an american presence in samoa through the latter 19th century but with the spanishamerican war there developed series of treaties and leases between the insular officials and the united states in 1900 president william mckinley directed the navy to assume responsibility for eastern thereafter american samoa mckinleys directive remained in effect until 1951 when with the samoan naval station closed authority fell to the department of the interior29 during the middle 1950s an insular constitutional government developed and in 1960 constitution was approved like guam american samoa appears to have been covered by the flsa since enactment of the law in 1938 however the act does not appear to have been enforced there until the late 1950s tuna and the roots of development in 1953 development of tuna canning operation commenced in american samoa an industry that quickly became the islands primary private sector employer with the supreme court decision in 1948 in vermilyabrown discussed above samoan industry became increasingly aware of the likely enforcement of minimum wage and other flsa standards it was with vermilyabrown in mind that representatives of van camp sea food co inc appeared before the senate committee on labor and public welfare in may 1956 to seek amendment of the act 27 continued alien workers was also confirmed by legislation 28 conversation with usdol staff june 1980 29 van cleve ruth g the office of territorial affairs new york praeger publishers 1974 p 6065 crs9 the company urged the creation of special arrangement under which the american secretary of labor would promulgate wages for insular industries and in effect would institute subminimum wage commensurate with insular economic conditions30 in the absence of such an amendment the full weight of the federal minimum wage would have applied thus employer spokespersons readily accepted an industry committee structure an sic similar to those then in operation for puerto rico and the virgin islands which could provide rate less than the rate in effect nationally31 as in other offshore jurisdictions the industry committee structure for american samoa was intended to be an interim measure while the insular economy moved toward mainland standards thirty years later the special industry committee structure was still in place in 1986 sic 17 following routine hearings and investigation into the condition of the various segments of the insular economy concluded that the minimum wage for samoa could be raised to the mainland level without risk that it would substantially curtail employment in the industries of the island thus following period of adjustment until april 1988 the samoan minimum wage would have become the same as that for the mainland32 as result the special industry committee system would have been disbanded with samoa achieving the same status in wagehour matters as guam that is equality with the states before the recommendations of the committee were given effect dol explained several interested groups commenced litigation to have the rates set aside so that insular employers might continue to pay wage rates below the national minimum33 concern was voiced that the tuna industry would substantially shift its operations to foreign locations that judicial process was cut short when congress added language to the pending insular areas regulation act 99th congress specifically overturning the findings of special industry committee 17 retaining the lower wage rates already in effect and directing that new committee be appointed that would recommend minimum wage rates less threatening to the insular economic structure34 two legislative initiatives followed the 101st congress approved legislation proposed by senator james mcclure of idaho that reduced the

75 of the national minimum after the first year to 90 after the second year and to the full national minimum after the third year the murphy bill died at the close of the 102nd congress thus american samoa though covered under the minimum wage provisions of the flsa continued to remain under the special industry committee structure american samoa and the 110th congress in 2007 provision was

the northern mariana islands cnmi associated with the united states since the mid1970s had not been covered by the minimum wage provisions of the flsa rather it was governed by its own insular minimum lower than the flsa standard in the 2007 amendments to the flsa pl 11028 the federal minimum wage was extended in steps to include the cnmi 35 section 8b of the flsa had provided that the special industry committee would recommend payment of at least the national minimum unless there is substantial documentary evidence including pertinent unabridged profit and loss statements and balance sheets for representative period of years or in the case of employees of public agencies other appropriate information in the record which establishes that the industry or predominant portion thereof is unable to pay that wage in effect there was means test for an employer seeking exemption from the regular minimum wage on grounds of inability to pay and still to compete the mcclure bill s 2930 pl

established the northern mariana islands controlled sequentially by spain germany and japan passed to the united states by conquest at the close of world war ii in 1947 following establishment of the united nations the marianas were placed under us control as part of the trust territory of the pacific islands during the mid1970s movement for expanded selfdetermination commenced this led ultimately to the creation and ratification of the covenant of association between the mariana islands and the united states establishing the current commonwealth status like guam and american samoa the northern mariana islands are lightly populated probably depending upon the criteria less than 100000 people culturally different from the united states and geographically distant most of the population resides on saipan but with several other islands notably tinian and rota sharing in density as trust territory unlike guam or samoa the mariana islands were not initially thought of as part of the united states per rather they seem to have been regarded as in temporary association with the united states thus imposition of precise us standards upon the local population which in turn may have meant some substantial disruption of traditional relationships may not have been high priority western style jobs had barely begun to develop when the united states came into control of the islands37 in 1947 shortly after the close of world war ii the american government stated that the northern marianas were still undergoing transition to cash economy and lacked both trade unions and traditional wage standards38 again in 1976 the department of state reported that there is minimum wage law for the trust territory and that wage rate determination is very much up to each employer39 with the adoption of the covenant 19751976 responsibility for labor standards was divided between the cnmi and the united states the united states assumed responsibility for overtime pay child labor regulation control of industrial homework and related matters the cnmi saipan took responsibility for alien labor immigration and the minimum wage it was also agreed that goods produced in the cnmi would move in

adoption of the covenant ie 19451976 have been retired to the national archives that any system of labor standards was developed for the islands during the trust period is not immediately apparent crs12 the usdol does not appear to have moved swiftly to implement its responsibilities the regional office of usdols wage and hour division in san francisco had jurisdiction over the pacific areas but there appears to have been regular usdol presence in the cnmi prior to 19861987 at which point the department commenced an investigation of overtime pay compliance in insular industry an aspect of labor standards protections over which the usdol had continuing jurisdiction new industrial growth and its aftermath by the 1980s garment industry had developed in the cnmi based largely it appears upon three factors 1 an initial minimum wage then about 215 per hour substantially below that required by the flsa though it may not have extended to many workers 2 importation of alien nonimmigrant contract workers many from china who came to be employed in the insular garment factories and 3 the capacity to move cnmi production in commerce for tariff purposes as made in america quickly the insular population grew with noncitizen alien workers significant proportion of the total the system overall some suggested seems to have led to abuse of workers while raising the image of sweatshop conditions because of concerns about labor practices with other matters extensive hearings were conducted by subcommittee of the committee on interior and insular affairs in 1992 and again in 199540 the information developed through the several hearings was contentious representative ron lugo of the virgin islands chairman of the house subcommittee on insular and international affairs estimated that half of the 45000 people in the cnmi in 1992 were temporary alien workers he stated that the insular garment industry had grown from 5 million volume in 1985 to over 250 million in 1991 gradually the usdol had become involved in 19911992 lugo stated the usdol had levied series of fines against cnmi garment manufacturers 500000 to settle criminal charges related to the alleged forced kickbacks of wages 560000 in fines against employers for what an official called appalling living and working conditions and 9 million to settle the underpayment of wagescharge41 in 1998 the focus shifted to
