moloney figliola specialist telecommunications and internet policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31636wireless privacy and spam issues for congress summary wireless communications devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants pdas are ubiquitous some consumers already deluged with unwanted commercial messages or spam via computers that access the internet by traditional wireline connections are concer ned that such unsolicited advertising is expanding to wireless communications further eroding their privacy in particular federal requirements under the enha nced 911 e911 initiative to ensure that mobile telephone users can obtai n emergency services as easily as users of wireline telephones are driving wi reless telecommunications carriers to implement technologies that can locate ca ller with significant precision wireless telecommunications carriers then will have the ability to track users location any time wireless telephone for example is activated therefore some worry that information on an individuals daily habits such as eating working and shopping will become commodity for sale to advertising companies as consumers walk or drive past restaurants and other businesses they may receive calls advertising sales or otherwise soliciting their patronage while some may find this helpful others may find it nuisance particularly if they incur usage charges as with the parallel debates over internet privacy and spam the wireless privacy discussion focuses on whether industry can be relied upon to lfregulate or if legislation is needed three laws already address wireless privacy and spam concerns the 1991 telephone consumer protection act tcpa pl 102243 prohibits the use of autodialers or pr erecorded voice messages to call wireless devices if the recipient would be charged for the call unless the recipient has given prior consent the 1999 wireless communica tions and public sa fety act the 911 act pl 10681 expanded on privacy protections for customer proprietary network information cpni held by telecommunications carriers by adding location to the definition of cpni nd set forth circumstances under which that information could be used with or without the customers express prior consent the 2003 controlling the assault of nonsolicite d pornography and marketing act the canspam act pl 108187

and other services by linda k moorewireless privacy and spam issues for congress introduction wireless communications devices in cluding mobile lephones personal digital assistants pdas pagers and auto mobilebased services such as onstar are ubiquitous1 many of the services provided by these devices require data on the users location whether it is to connect phone call or dispatch emergency services when an airbag deploys consumers and privacy rights advocates are increasingly concerned about the privacy implications of these wireless locationbased services if company providing wireless service knows the users location with whom can that data be shared how long can the data be retained will the data be used to create individual profiles that will be sold to marketing companies or used for other purposes unknown to the user or contrary to his or her preference will consumers be deluged with messages on their communications devices advertising sales at nearby stores or restaurants not unlike the spam2 in their email inboxes the precision with which wireless rvice providers can determine subscribers exact location is improving with the implementation of enhanced 911 e911 capabilities for mobile telephones and other wireless devices wherein wireless carriers are required to provide public safety answering points psaps with the location of wireless callers who dial 911 within 50300 meters 150900 feet3 while this serves the laudable goal of ensuring mobile telephone users immediate access to emergency services many worry about what other uses will be made of such location information once the technical ability exists to provide users precise coordinates some privacy advocates worry that more and more devices will incorporate it making location info rmation widely available without proper privacy safeguardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31636crs2 4 for more on internet privacy see crs report rl31408 internet privacy overview and pending legislation by marcia s smith 5 the cdt website is httpwwwcdtorg 6 the epic website is httpwwwepicorgthe debate over wireless privacy in many ways parallels the debate over internet privacy 4 and internet spam indeed since wireless internet access devices are on the market the issues intersect one particular similarity is that the policy debate focuses on whether legislation is needed or if industry can be relied upon to selfregulate four laws each discussed later in this re port address some of the issues the telephone consumer protec tion act pl 102243 th wireless communications and public safety act pl 10681 the

109455 howev er other concerns remain concerns of consumers and privacy rights advocates spam some consumers and privacy rights gr oups including the center for democracy and technology cdt5 and the electronic privacy information center epic6 worry that the ability to identify wireless customers location could lead to furthererosion of individual privacy although the e911 requirements apply only to calls made from mobile telephones seeking emer gency assistance once that capability is available many worry that such information will be collected and sold for other purposes such as marketing some observe rs point out that wireless carriers may be motivated to sell such customer data to recoup the costs of deploying wireless e911 users of wireless devices such as pa gers personal digital assistants or automobilebased services such as onstar might be affected along with mobile telephone customers major concern is that if location information is available to commercial entities wireless customer walking or driving along the street may be deluged with unsolicited advertisements fro m nearby restaurants or stores alerting them to merchandise available in their establishments supporters of unsolicited advertising insist that consumers benefit from directed advertisements because they are more likely to offer products in which the consumer is interested they also argue that advertising is protected by the first amendment one aspect of this concern is that co mpanies could build pr ofiles of consumers using data collected over period of time in that context one question is whether limits should be set on the leng th of time location informa tion can be retained some argue that once 911 call has been complete d or after subscriber to

have or not have thei r numbers listed in wirel ess 411 cell phone directory such directory does not currently exist but ctia the wireless association7 began developing one in 2004 for six of th seven largest mobile service providers8 one estimate is that wireless directory could generate as much as 3 billion year for the wireless industry by 2009 in fees and additional minutes9 qsent is the aggregator for the directory service10 in early 2005 some of the companies backing the directory project announced changes in their plans sprint and alltel were the first to indicate that they would delay offering such service until the regulatory climate stabilized some cited new california law that re quires carriers to obtain parate authorization from subscribers before including them in the directory as an example of the evolving regulatory climate numbe r of other states are consid ering similar legislation by the end of april 2005 tmob ile reportedly was the only major carrier still planning to offer directory services pled ging to do so on an optin basis11 key difference between wireless and wi reline phones is that subscribers must pay for incoming as well as outgoing calls thus some argue that subscribers need to be assured that they will not receive unwanted calls not only because of nuisance factor but for cost reas ons consumers may list their cell phone numbers on the national do not call registry12 but concerns persist about unwanted calls from telemarketers or others in december 2004 an email was widely circulated on the internet warning consumers that they must list their cell phone numbers on the do not call list before the end of 2004 but th at is incorrect phone numbers may be added to the do not call list at any timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31636crs4 13 at senate commerce committee hearing on september 21 2004 kathleen pierz of the pierz group testified that nearly all mobile s ubscribers except cingular

carriers promise congress wireless 411 will protect privacy communications daily september 30 2004 p 2questions that are arising include whethe r subscribers should be able to decline to have their numbers published without pa ying fee as wireline customers must do if they want an unlisted number proponent s of the directory insist that customers will have to consent to having their num bers listed opponents counter that many subscribers do not realize that they alread have given consent through the contract they sign with their service provider13 other critics point out that wireless subscribers pay for every call and view th eir cell phones as distinctly private from the beginning one of the largest mobile rvice providers verizon wireless decided not to participate in the directory the companys president and ceo denny strigl argues against the notion of an optin directory where subscribers would have to give their express prior authorization to be ing listed saying that customers see opt in as disingenuous footinthedoor lead ing to optout clauses and fees for not publishing number nor does optin allo w customers any degree of control over how and to whom their information is revealed they either keep full privacy or face full exposure with nothing inbetween14 optin and optout are explained below consumer s union established website15 to encourage individuals to contact their members of congress in support of wireless dir ectory legislation in september 2004 hearings were held by the senate commerce science and transportation committee and by the house energy and commerce committees subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet at the 2004 senate hearing ctia testified that there is need for legislation because the directory does not yet exist so it is premature to pass legisla tion now the wireless industry has proven track record in protecting consumer privacy and subscribers would not be forced to participate in the directory nor charged fee for optingout mr strigl from verizon wireless repeated his strong opposition to the directory but agreed that legislation is not necessary some opponents of the legislation point to verizon wirelesss decision not to participate in the directory as indicative of marketbased solution to the problem since subscribers wishing not to be listed could switch to verizon wireless advocates of the legislation at the 2004 house hearing countered that for example the wireless industrys track reco rd is less than perfect according to communications daily 16 representative pitts who sponsored one of the 108th congress bills stated that when he first discussed wireless di rectory with industry representatives two years earlier they insisted that optin was impossible and they would need to charge for the service ye t now he noted the indus try is asserting thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31636crs5 the system would be optin and free representative markey commented that the fact that the carriers informed consumers that their numbers might become listed in wireless directory only in the fine prin t of their service contracts made some observers suspicious of their intentions senator boxer testified at the house hearing noting that cell phones are quite differe nt from home phones because people take them wherever they go so unwanted calls are even more intrusive she emphasized the need to allow parents to control whether their childrens numbers are listed and the need to act quickly before the directory comes into existence witnesses from epic and the aarp testified in favor of the legislation at the senate hearing legislation has been reintroduced in the 109th congress as discussed later in this report selling cell phone records concern is mounting about the public av ailability of cell phone records which may include detailed information on calls to and from particular number such as the number dialed the duration and the cation of the cell phone some of these records along with records from othe r telephone and voice communications may become available for sale over the intern et from data brokers who collect and sell the information attention is focused on how the data brokers obtain the information and whether telecommunications companies are adequately protecting the socalled customer proprietary network information cpni as required by law for more discussion of cpni see the wireless communications and public safety act the 911 act below from legislative standpoint fundament issue is whether existing laws the federal trade commission ftc act 15 usc 4151 which bans unfair and deceptive practices that might be employed by pretexters and the 1996 telecommunications act which requires telecommunications carriers to protect cpni are adequate or if new laws are needed to criminalize specifically the fraudulent acquisition and sale of cell phone or all tele phone records generally privacy rights groups want add itional legislati on one telecommunications association ctia supports new legislation to crimina lize obtaining phone records by fraudulent means another usteleco m wants improved enforcement of existing laws instead of new laws the fcc pports three potential legislative actions making the commercial availa bility of consumers phone records illegal overturning 1999 court ruling that limited the fccs ability to implement more stringent protections of consumer phone record in formation and strengthening the fccs enforcement tools the ftc has not endorsed new laws but recommends

webster reportedly defended his companys practices by saying that cell phone records have been obtained by private investigators for long time and the issue is only being raised now because of privacy groups which often have their own agenda24 mr webster reportedly said that s ubscribers could protect themselves by asking their phone company to remove call tails from their bills i have done this

unlisted numbers and calling records for sale25 the ap story reported that operators of such websites insist they are not doing anything illegal because there is specific prohibition against

that the ftc reached settlement with data broker choicepoint the previous week in which choicepoint will pay 10 million in civil pe nalties and 5 million in consum er redress that case did not involve cell phone records however but he explained that the ftc may bring law enforcement action ag ainst pretexter who obtains telephone records as an unfair and deceptive practice mr leibowitz did not make recommendations on actions congress might take other witnesses before the house committee included ctia president steve largent robert douglas from privacytoda ycom and marc rotenberg from epic mr

douglas argued that the legislation should not be limited to tele phone records and that the ftc should not be given primary authority for enforcement mr rotenberg summarized his organizations efforts at raising awareness of this issue through the filings with the fcc and ftc discussed above he explained that lephone carriers opposed the use of enhanced security requirements for the data they collect arguing that bringing lawsuits against pretexters would be sufficient he insist ed that enforcement alone would only drive the practice underground and that simple s ecurity enhancements such

national network to end domestic violence she testified about the potential impact of the availability of stolen cell phone records and other pers onal information on victims of domestic violence other concerns other wireless privacy concerns exist but are outside the scope of this report to discuss in depth briefly some are concerned about whether law enforcement authorities might require wireless carriers to provide location information29 cdts james dempsey notes that government access to data stored on third party network is not subject to fourth amendment prot ections that require probable cause before conducting searches30 cdts alan davidson was quoted in computerworld about other ominous implications the first time somebody steals location information on the whereabouts of kid and he goes missing there will be backlash and lawsuits he added or phone compan employee could have crush on woman with cell phone and use the purloined data to follow her around he said31 it should be noted that privacy concer ns often are tempered by consumers desires for new services and low prices the extent to which consumers would choose one wireless carrier over another purely because one promised better privacy safeguards is unclear fair information practices much of the wireless privacy controve rsy parallels the debate over internet privacy see crs report rl31408

wireless comm unications and pub lic safety act pl 10681 often called the 911 act in addition to making 911 the universal emergency assistance number in the united states the 911 act also amended section 222 of the communications act of 1934 47 usc 222 which establishes privacy protections for customer proprietary network information cpni held by telecommunications carriers inter alia the 911

permitted in others45 in addition to adding location to the definition of cpni the 911 act amended section 222d4 regarding authorized uses of cpni as amended the law determines those circumst ances under which wireless carriers need to obtain customers prior consent to use wireless cation information and when prior consent is not required customers prior consent is not required section 222 d to

information to anyone other than for use in an automatic crash notification system the phrase express prior authorization is not further defined in the law however nor the measures telecommunications

email message that is transmitted directly to wireless device that is utilized by subscriber of commercial mobile service as defined in the 1934 communications act in this report an mscm is referred to as wireless commercial email message the fcc announced notice of pr oposed rulemaking on march 11 2004 according to communications daily 46 during the comment pe riod several wireless carriers and the ctia urged that they be exempted from the requirement to obtain express prior authorization before sending commercial messages to their customers if the customers are not charged for them arguing that those are carriercustomer relationship issues and are protected by the first amendment ctia reportedly agreed with the fccs preliminary interpretation47 that the canspam act applies only to messages sent to an email addre ss consisting of two parts unique user name or mailbox and referen ce to an internet domain eg janedoewirelesscarriercom and therefore should not apply to sms short code or other text messages sent using other address formats the fcc adopted the new rules on august 4 2004 they were released on august 1248 most went into effect on oc tober 18 2004 although several that deal with information collection requirement s must obtain approval of the office of management and budget the fcc took the following actions prohibited sending wireless commercial email messages unless the individual addressee has given the sender express prior authorization optin which may be given orally or in writing including electronically requests for such au thorization may not be sent to wireless subscribers wireless device because of the potential costs to the subscriber for receiving accessing reviewing and discarding such mail authorization provide d to particular sender does not entitle that sender to send wireless commercial email messages on behalf of third parties including affiliated entities and marketing partners the request for aut horization must contain specifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31636crs16 information such as the fact that the recipient may be charged by their wireless service provider for receiving the message and subscribers may revoke their authorization at any time the rules do not apply to messages that are forwarded by subscriber to his or her own wireless device although they do apply to any person who receives consideration or inducem ent to forward the message to someone elses wi reless device or phonetophone sms messa ges if they are not autodialed internettophone sms messages are covered by the rules since they involve domain name address announced that it would create publicly available fcc wireless domain names list with the domain names used for mobile service messaging so that senders of commercial mail can determine which addresses are directed at mobile services and prohibited sending any commercial message to addresses that have been on the list for at least 30 days or at any time prior to 30 days if the sender otherw ise knows that the message is addressed to wireless device and required all wireless service pr oviders to supply the fcc with the names of all internet domains on which they offer mobile service messaging services determined that all autodialed calls including sms are already covered by the tcpa interpreted the definition of wireless commercial email message to include any commercial message sent to an email address provided by wireless service provider formally called commercial mobile radio service or cmrs specifically for delivery to the subscribers wireless device provided guidance on the definition of commercial but noted that the federal trade commission is ultimately responsible for determining the criteria for commercial and transactional or relationship messages as noted some wireless service provi ders sought an exemption from the requirement to obtain express prior authorization for them to communicate with their own subscribers as long as the subscriber s did not incur additional costs the fcc did not grant such as exemption in part because it concluded that the existing exemption in the canspam act for transactional or relationship messages is sufficient to cover many types of comm unication needed between provider and subscriber furthermore the commi ssion concluded that the canspam acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31636crs17 required it to protect consumers from unwan ted commercial messages not only those that involve additional costs the us safe web act the undertaking spam spyware and fraud enforcement with enforcers beyond borders act us safe web act pl 109455 is pr imarily concerned with traditional forms of spam via email however the law also covers wireless spam specifically the act permits the ftc and
