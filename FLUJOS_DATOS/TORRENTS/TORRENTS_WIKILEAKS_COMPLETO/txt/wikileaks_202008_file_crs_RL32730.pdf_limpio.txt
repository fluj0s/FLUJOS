issues for the 109th congress summary since the early 1960s us policy toward cuba under fidel cast ro has consisted largely of isolating the communist nation through comprehensive economic sanctions which have been significantly tightened by the bush administration another component of us policy has consisted of suppor t measures for the cuban people including private humanitarian donations and ussponsored radio and television broadcasting to c uba while there appears to be broad agreement on the overall objective of us policy toward cuba to help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island there are several schools of thought on how to achieve that objective some advocate maximum pressure on cuba until reforms are enacted others argue for lifting some us sanctions judged to be hurting the cuban people and still others call for swift normalization of uscuban relations fidel castros announcement in late july 2006 that he was temporarily ceding political power to his brother raúl in order to recover from surgery has prompted some members to call for reexamination of us policy in the 109th congress legislative initiatives included the approval of five human rights

will not be returning to power number of observers maintain that castro is suffering from cancer although cuban fficials deny that he has cancer1 although many observers be lieve that the eventual demise of cubas communist government ultimately is inevitable there is considerable disagreement over when or how this may occur some still predict that the regime will collapse when fidel castro permanently departs the political scene other observers stress that fidel is still not out of the picture and that the cuban government has plan for the permanent succession of his brother raúl they point to cubas strong security apparatus and the extraordinary system of controls that prevents dissidents from gaining popular support httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32730crs6 before fidels recent surgery observers discerned several potential scenarios for cubas future when fidel either dies in office or departs the political scene because of age or declining heath these fit into three broad categories the continuation of communist government military government or democratic transition or fully democratic government according to most observers the most likely scenario at least in the short term is successor communist government led by raúl castro this is true for variety of reasons but especially because of raúls designation by fidel as successor in the pa rty and his position as leader of the far the far has been in control of the gove rnments security apparatus since 1989 and has played an increasing role in cubas economy through the ownership of numerous business enterprises the scenario of militaryled government is viewed by some observers as possibility only if successo r communist government fails because of divisiveness or po litical instab ility for many observers the least likely scenario upon fidels death or departure is democratic or democratic transition government with strong totalitarian secur ity apparatus the castro government has successfully impeded the development of independent ci vil society with only small and tightly regulated private sector independent labor movement and unified political opposition for further information see crs report

to reach the united states the men were executed by firing squads after summary trials that were he ld behind closed doors four other ferry hijackers received life sentences while another received 30 years in prison analysts see variety of potentia l reasons for th 2003 cr ackdown on democracy activists the cuban government asserts that the cr ackdown was justified because the defendants were supported by the us government and that us diplomats in cuba most notably the head of the us interest s section in havana james cason often met with the dissident s some analysts believe that the crackdown was clear message by the cuban government that it w ill not tolerate the us governments active and open s upport for the opposition movement other analysts emphasize that the crackdown was an effort by castro to strengthen the regimes political control in light of faltering economy and d im economic prospects ahead according to this view an incr easingly assertive oppos ition movement could become national security threat to the castro regime in the tough economic times ahead along these lines some analysts see the crackdown as way for the regime to clear away any potential opposition in orde r to ensure that the eventual succession of raúl castro to power will be smooth some observers maintain that the cuban governments willingness to jeopardize the possibility of eased us trade and travel restrictions as an indication that it currently views the dissident movement as serious security threat others however believe that the cuban government judged that there would not be any movement to ease the embargo under the bush administr ation under any circumstances and felt that it had little to lose in cracking down on the opposition movement finally view often heard when castro takes harsh action that jeopardizes an improvement in relations with the united states is that castro actually is opposed to any further opening to the united states because it could threaten his regimes control according to this view the crackdown against the opposition blocks any potential easing of us policy release of several prisoners in 2004 in 2004 the cuban government released 14 of the 75 arrested in marc h 2003 and 4 other political prisoners for health reasons in the first half of the ear seven prisoners were released for health reasons including noted economist and mocracy

pressure on the cuban government until reforms are enacted while continuing current us efforts to support the cuban people others argue for an approach sometimes referred to as constructive engagement that would lift some us sanctions that they believe are hurting the cuban people and move toward engaging cuba in dialogue still others call for swift normalization of uscuban relations by lifting the us embargo in general those advocating loosenin g of the sanctionsbased policy toward cuba make several policy arguments they assert that if the united states moderated its policy toward cuba through increased travel trade and diplomatic dialogue that the seeds of reform would be planted in cuba which would stimulate and strengthen forces for peaceful change on the island they stress the importance to the united states of avoiding violent chan ge in cuba with the prospect of mass exodus to the united states and the potential of involving the united states in civil war scenario they argue that since castros demise does not appear imminent the united states should espouse more realistic approach in trying to induce change in cuba supporters of changing policy also point to broad international support for lifting the us embargo to the missed oppor tunities to us businesses because of the embargo and to the increased suffering of the cuban people because of the embargo proponents of change also ar gue that the united states should be consistent in its policies with the worlds few remaining communist governments including china and also maintain that moderating policy will help advance human rights on the other side opponents of changing us policy maintain that the current twotrack policy of isolating cuba but reaching out to the cuban people through measures of support is the best means fo r realizing political change in cuba they point out that the cuban liberty and demo cratic solidarity act of 1996 sets forth road map of the steps cuba that needs to take in order for the united states to normalize relations including lifting the embargo they argue that softening us policy at this time without concrete cuban reforms woul d boost the castro regime politically and economically nd facilitate the survival of the communist regime opponents of softening us policy argue that the united states should stay the course in its commitment to democracy and human rights in cuba that sustained sanctions can work and that the sanctions against cuba have only come to full impact with the loss of large subsidies fro m the former soviet bloc

that the cuban people have an ardent desire and ge nuine need to receive the programming produced by tv marti85 supporters argue that liminating tv marti would send message to the cuban people that the united states is not committed to the cause of freedom in cuba they believe that eliminating tv marti would be giving in to the dictatorial castro government which suppresses the free flow of
