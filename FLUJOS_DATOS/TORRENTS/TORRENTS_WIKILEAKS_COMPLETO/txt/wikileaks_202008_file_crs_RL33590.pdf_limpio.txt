was negotiated between the clinton administration and north korea specifying measures to limit and eventually eliminate north koreas nuclear programs in late 2002 the agreed framework broke down over us evidence that north korea was operating secret nuclear program north korea restarted nuclear installations that had been frozen under the agreed framework negotiations ensued in 2003 involving six governments the united states north korea china south korea japan and russia the six parties to the north korean nuclear negotiations concluded an agreement on february 13 2007 that specifies two phases of implementation the phases provided for freeze of north korean nuclear installations at the yongbyon site subsequent disablement of all north korean nuclear facilities and north korean declaration of all nuclear programs the six party agreement was negotiated following north korean nuclear test in october 2006 the nuclear test signaled progress by north korea in reprocessing plutonium since 2002 for six to eight atomic bombs the agreement also came about because of changes in bush administration policy tactically the administration ended its unwillingness to negotiate bilaterally with north korea and actively sought bilateral meetings the details of the agreement were negotiated at these meetings the bush administration negotiated three subsequent agreements with north korea they produced the initiation of disablement of north korean nuclear installations at yongbyon inside north korea including nuclear reactor and plut onium reprocessing plant bush administration lifting of trading with the enemy act sanctions against north korea and removal of north korea from the us list of state sponsors of terrorism and north korean declaration of nuclear programs limited to known nuclear installations at yongbyon and reportedly plutonium stockpile of 30 kilograms the third of these agreements negotiated in october 2008 established system of verification and inspections but limited to the declared facilities at yongbyon and not including the taking of samples by inspectors at six party meeting in december 2008 the bush administration failed to get north korea to agree to include sampling in written agreement these agreements did not cover important components of north koreas nuclear programs the apparent production of few atomic bombs highly enriched uranium program known to the united states since the late 1990s and alleged nuclear collaboration with iran and syria according to us officials collaboration with syria involved the construction of nuclear reactor which israel bombed in september 2007 collaboration with iran reportedly involves development of high enriched uranium development of nuclear warhead that could be mounted on jointly developed intermediate range ballistic missile north korean nodong iranian shahab missile and north korean assistance in constructing deep underground installations to house part of irans nuclear program this report will be updated periodically

north korean agreement for the issuance of statement by the governments of the six party negotiations on north korean nuclear programs north korea rejected us proposals th at the statement include provision that would allow six party inspectors to take samples of nuclear materials from north koreas declared nuclear facilities the failure to resolve this dispute over verification system especially the right of inspectors to take samples cast into doubt the completion of implementation of usnorth korean nuclear agreement that had been negotiated in stages since january 2007 1 on june 26 2008 the north korean government and the bush administration took measures to implement nuclear agreement that they had negotiated in 2007 into 2008 the details of the agreement were finalized details in april 2008 at meeting of the chief us and north korean negotiators in singapore 2 the agreement if fully implemented would complete the second phase of an accord reached by the six party conference on north korean nuclear issues in february 2007 and detailed more fully in six party statement of october 2007 the six parties are the united states china north korea south korea russia and japan the agreement created two obligations each for north korea and the bush administration to fulfill north korea is to allow process of disablement of its plutonium nuclear facilities at yongbyon site 60 miles from the capital of pyongyang the shutting down of yongbyon was key provision of the 1994 agreed framework nego tiated by the clinton administration and north korea yongbyon ceased to operate between 1994 and the end of 2002 in late 2002 the bush administration suspended us obligations und er the agreed framework because of us intelligence estimates that north korea was operating secret nuclear weapons program based on highly enriched uranium north korea responded by restarting the yongbyon facilities between early 2003 and the summer of 2007 the yongbyon reactor and the plutonium reprocessing plant produced enough weapons grade plutonium for the production of several atomic bombs north korea tested an atomic device in october 2006 the disablement process began in october 2007 the bush administration said in june 2008 that eight of eleven components of the disablement process have been completed and that close to 50 of nuclear fuel rods the source of plutonium in the yongbyon nuclear reactor have been removed 3 administration officials have stated that completed disablement of the yongbyon installations would be extensive enough so that it would take north korea about year to restart them4 but subsequent developments indicated that north korea could restart the plutonium reprocessing plant within three to four months north koreas second obligation was to provide the united states and other members of the six party talks with complete and correct declaration of nuclear programs the declaration 1 glenn kessler n korea doesnt agree to written nuclear

delivered to china on june 26 2008 contains declaration of the amount of plutonium that north korea claims to possess reports asserted that north korea declared 308 kilograms of plutonium5 us intelligence estimates reportedly conclude that north korea has accumulated 50 to 60 kilograms of plutonium6 however other components of north koreas nuclear programs reportedly are omitted from the declaration apparently based on concessions the bush administration made to north korea in the singapore agreement these include the numbe r of atomic bombs north korea possesses information about the facilities where north korea produces and tests atomic bombs and the locations where north korea stores plutonium and atomic bombs the declaration also reportedly contains information about north koreas reported highly enriched uranium program or north koreas reported nuclear collaboration activities with iran and syria according to bush administration officials the uranium enrichment and syria issues are addressed in confidential minute 7 they have said nothing about iran however in the confidential minute north korea reportedly does not admit to uranium enrichment or proliferation activities with syria it merely acknowledges us concerns that north korea has engaged in these activities in the past8 the united states two obligations under the agreement are to remove north korea from the us trading with the enemy act and from the us list of state sponsors of terrorism removal from the trading with the enemy act will allow us companies to import north korean goods and sell nonstrategic goods to north korea it opens up possibilities for us companies to invest in north korea however given north koreas communist economic system and its suspicions of foreign intrusions there appears to be little likelihood of any meaningful trade or investment relations developing between the united states and north korea 9 removal from the trading with the enemy act could give north korea in the future access to 317 million in north korean assets in the united states that have been frozen since the korean war 10 removal from the us list of state sponsors of terrorism will end the requirement that us presidents oppose north korean membership in international financial agencies like the world bank and the international monetary fund because of north koreas economic system and secretive economic activities its prospects for near term membership in or aid from the world bank and the imf appear to be remote however in likely nuclear negotiations in 2009 under the obama administration it is probable that north korea will demand that the incoming obama administration complete north koreas removal from the terrorism support with an affirmative act of initiating proposals for north korea to receive financial aid from the world bank and the international monetary fund north korea may have three additional motives for its pressure on the bush administration to remove it from the list of state sponsors of terrorism one is to reduce us support for japan on 5 north korea tells china 308 kg of plutonium extracted agence france presse october 24 2008 6 glenn

the clinton and bush administrations previously had cited resolving of the japanese kidnapping issue as linked to removal of north korea from the terrorism support list second motive apparently is to improve the prospects for normalization of diplomatic relations with the united states which north korea says it wants11 possible third motive may be to remove any us incentive to examine the issue of north koreas activities in the middle east and deny to the united states potential negotiating lever over north koreas activities in the middle east numerous reports indicate that north koreas activities include providing training and weapon s to hezbollah and cooperation with the iranian revolutionary guards in the development of both missiles and nuclear weapons see subsequent section on

chairman of the six party talks simultaneously president bush announced that he had removed north korea from the trading with the enemy act the president has full authority to renew annually trading with the enemy act sanctions on north korea or to lift those sanctions from north korea president bush also announced that he had sent to congress notification of his intent to remove north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism after 45 calendar days on august 11 2008 under us law the president is required to notify congress 45 days before removing country from the list the white house said that north korea would be removed on august 11 2008 unless congress acted legislatively to block removal12 however the white house also said on june 26 2008 that removal of north korea was conditioned on north korean acceptance of provisions for us verification of the nort h korean declaration of nuclear programs on june 27 2008 north korea blew up the cooling tower of its nuclear reactor at yongbyon as symbol of the continuing disablement process china as chairman of the six party talks called six party meeting on july 1012 2008 six part press communique announced that north korea had agreed to complete the disablement of yongbyon by the end of october 2008 also by that date the united states china south korea and russia are to complete the provision to north korea of one

july the administration presented north korea with draft protocol on verification of north koreas nuclear programs the draft protocol would have given us and other six party inspectors the right to

announcing that it would restart the plutonium reprocessing plant at yongbyon13 neither the february 2007 nor the october 2007 nuclear agreements which was put in the form of six party statement mentioned system of verifying the implementation of the agreements there is evidence that the singapore agreement of april 2008 detailed any system of verification however following the usnorth korean meeting at singapore the bush administration began to seek supplemental agreements with north korea regarding the establishment of verification mechanisms to examine north koreas declaration of its plutonium stockpile in early may 2008 the bush administration and north korea negotiated an accord for north korea to turn over to the united states over 18000 documents related to its plutonium program dating back to 1986 us experts currently are examining these documents the white house announcement of june 26 2008 of submission to congress of notification of intent to remove north korea from the terrorism support list stated that removal after 45 days would be carried out only after the six parties reach agreement on acceptable verification principles and an acceptable verification protocol the six parties have established an acceptable monitoring mechanism and verification activities have begun the six party meeting of july 1012 2008 reached agreement on verification principles including inspection of yongbyon facilities review of documents and interviews of north korean nuclear scientists and technicians verification would be carried out by experts of the six parties the international atomic energy agency would have only an advisory role however the bush administration also gave north korea draft protocol on verification which proposed an inspection system that would have access to any site in north korea including military facilities and to all materials at these sites 14 north korea rejected the us proposal the bush administration decided not to remove north korea from the terrorism support list on august 11 2008 north korea immediately announced suspension of the disablement of yongbyon and on august 26 2008 an intention to restart the plutonium reprocessing plant the bush administration reacted to north koreas announcement of restarting of the plutonium reprocessing by scaling back the scope of its verification proposals assistant secretary of state christopher hill went to pyongyang in early oc tober and negotiated verification deal which would concentrate inspections only on yongbyon 15 north korea agreed and announced resumption of disablement the bush administration followed on october 11 2008 by the announcement of secretary of state condoleezza rice that north korea was removed from the us list of state sponsors of terrorism the state departments description of the verification agreement included the following points inspectors would have access only to the sites at yon gbyon in north koreas june 16 2008 declaration access to nondeclared sites would be by mutual consent the inspection organization would be composed of the five non north korean members of the six party talks the united states china south korea

verification agreement were contained in usnorth korean document and in certain other understandings16 the bush administration and the state department give few details on two other aspects of hills talks in pyongyang and the verification agreement one was the issue of inspectors being able to take samples of nuclear materials at the yongbyon installations for laboratory analysis north korean foreign ministry statement of november 11 2008 and subsequent statements asserted that the written verification agreement said thing about sampling and that north korea only had to abide by the written agreement and nothing else the state department then acknowledged that hills discussion with north koreans about sampling was only verbal understanding 17 this issue was not resolved in the december 2008 six party meeting the second aspect of hills talks was his meeting with north korean lt general lee chanbok this was the first time that north korean military leader had participated in the nuclear talks general lee reportedly called for bilateral usnorth korean military talks and may have linked us acceptance of bilateral military talks to further progress on the nuclear issue18

about 5 electrical megawatts that began operating by 1987 it is capable of expending enough reactor fuel to produce about 6 kilograms of plutonium annuallyenough for the manufacture of single atomic bomb annually north korea in 1989 shut down the reactor or about 70 days us intelligence agencies believe that north korea removed fuel rods from the reactor at that time for reprocessing into plutonium suitable for nuclear weapons in may 1994 north korea shut down the reactor and removed about 8000 fuel rods which could be reprocessed into enough plutonium 2530 kilograms for 46 nuclear weapons north korea started operating the reactor again in february 2003 shut it down in april 2005 and said it had removed another 8000 fuel rods 16 ibid 17 n korea rejects contentions it is delaying

megawatts reactors under construction at yongbyon and taechon since 1984 according to us ambassador robert gallucci these plants if completed would be capable of producing enough spent fuel annually for 200 kilograms of plutonium sufficient to manufacture nearly 30 atomic bombs per year however when north korea reopened the plutonium program in early 2003 reports indicate that construction on the larger reactors was not resumed plutonium reprocessing plant about 600 feet long and several stories high the plant would separate weapons grade plutonium239 from spent nuclear fuel rods for insertion into the structure of atomic bombs or warheads us intelligence agencies reportedly detected north korean preparations to restart the plutonium reprocessing plant in february and march 2003 according to press reports the cia estimated in late 2003 that north korea had reprocessed some of the 8000 fuel rods in january 2004 north korean officials showed us nuclear expert dr sigfried hecker samples of what they claimed were plutonium oxalate powder and plutonium metal dr hecker later said in testimony before the senate foreign relations committee january 21 2004 that without testing he could not confirm whether the sample was metallic plutonium but all observations i was able to make are consistent with the sample being plutonium metal iaea monitors in july 2007 stated that the reprocessing plant was not in operation satellite photographs reportedly also show that the five megawatt reactor has attached power lines which it would have if used for electric power generation persons interviewed for this study believe that north korea developed the five megawatt reactor and the reprocessing plant with its own resources and technology it is believed that kim jongil the and

reactorrelated plutonium facilities in syria came in reports later in 2008 that iran also was involved in the syrian reactor with north korea and that plutonium reprocessing plant was in iran the online service of the german news publication der spiegel cited intelligence reports seen by der spiegel that north korean and iranian scientists were working together at the reactor site at the time of the israeli bombing some of the plutonium fuel rod production from the reactor was to have gone to iran which viewed the reactor as reserve site to produce weaponsgrade plutonium as supplement to irans own highly enriched uranium program31 similar description of north koreaniranian cooperation in the syrian reactor came in two reports from washington in the japanese newspaper sankei shimbun

the ground for the berlin agreement of september 1999 in which north korea agreed to defer further missile tests in return for the lifting of major us economic sanctions president clinton formalized

statement of august 18 2003 reportedly estimated that north korea had produced one or two simple fissiontype nuclear weapons and had validated the designs without conducting yield producing nuclear tests 51 the initial estimate of one or two nuclear weapons is derived primarily from north koreas approximately 70day shutdown of the five megawatt reactor in 1989 which would have given it the opportunity to remove nuclear fuel rods from which plutonium is reprocessed the us central intelligence agency cia and the defense intelligence agency dia reportedly estimated in late 1993 that north korea extracted enough fuel rods for about 12 kilograms of plutoniumsufficient for one or two atomic bombs the cia and dia apparently based their estimate on the 1989 shutdown of the five megawatt reactor 52 south korean and japanese intelligence estimates reportedly were higher 1624 kilograms japan and 722 kilograms south korea these estimates reportedly are based on the view that north korea could have acquired higher volume of plutonium from the 1989 reactor shutdown and the view of higher possibility that north korea removed fuel rods during the 1990 and 1991 reactor slowdowns russian defense ministry analyses of late 1993 reportedly came to similar estimate of about 20 kilograms of plutonium enough for two or three atomic bombs general leon laporte former us commander in korea stated in an interview in april 2006 that north korea possessed three to six nuclear weapons before the 1994 usnorth korean agreed framework 53 russian intelligence agencies also reportedly have

middlerange likelihood that north korea may have smuggled plutonium from russia in june 1994 the head of russias counterintelligence service successor to the kgb said at press conference that north koreas attempts to smuggle components of nuclear arms production from russia caused his agency special anxiety us executive branch officials have expressed concern in background briefings over the possibility that north korea has smuggled plutonium from russia one us official quoted in the washington times july 5 1994 asserted that there is the possibility that things having gotten over the russianorth korea bor der without anybody being aware of it the most specific claim came in the german news magazine stern in march 1993 which cited russian counterintelligence service reports that north korea had smuggled 56 kilograms of plutonium enough for 79 atomic bombs from russia if as it claims north korea reprocessed the 8000 nuclear fuel rods in 2003 that it had moved from storage at the beginning of that year north korea gained an additional 2530 kilograms of plutonium according to dr sigfried hecker in his testimony before the senate foreign relations committee on january 21 2004 dr hecker former dire ctor of the alamos laboratories had visited north koreas yongbyon nuclear complex in january 2004 us officials and nuclear experts have stated that this amount of plutonium would give north korea the potential to produce between four to eight atomic bombs 54 nuclear expert david albright estimated in february 2007 that north korea had stockpile of reprocessed plutonium of 2850 kilograms enough for between 5 and 12 nuclear weapons55 these estimates appear to be based on projections that country like north korea would need 68 kilograms of plutonium to produce one atomic bomb the iaea has had standard that nonnuclear state would need about eight kilograms of plutonium to produce an atomic bomb the question of whether north korea produced additional nuclear weapons with the plutonium that it apparently acquired after 2003 may depend on the degree of successfailure of north koreas nuclear test of october 2006 and whether north korea is able to develop nuclear warhead that could be fitted onto its missiles experts believe that any atomic bombs developed likely are similar to the plutonium bomb dropped by the united states on nagasaki in august 1945 however north korea has few delivery systems that could deliver such bomb to us or japanese target thus pyongyang probably would not produce additional nagasakitype bombs but would retain its weaponsgrade plutoni um until it could use it to produce nuclear warhead statements by us officials reflect an apparent uncertainty over whether north korea has achieved warheading capability 56 and they have not addressed publicly the reports of north koreaniranian collaboration in nuclear warhead development according to press reports in late 2002 the cia concluded that north korea accelerated its uranium enrichment program in the 1999 2000 and 2001 according to us news and world report september 1 2003 the cia estimated that north korea could produce uraniumbased atomic weapon by the
