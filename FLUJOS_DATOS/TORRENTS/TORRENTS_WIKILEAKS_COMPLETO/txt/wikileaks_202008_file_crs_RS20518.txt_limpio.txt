wide authority to provide emergency assistance for foreign disasters and the us government uses several channels to provide disaster assistance when the us ambassador to country declares disaster usually in response to request from the host government he can authorize the transfer of 25000 in grants usually available within 24 hours the usaid administrator is the presidents special coordinator for international disaster assistance the office of foreign disaster assistance ofda within usaid can respond immediately with relief materials and personnel including some already located in various countries around the world2 ofda has emergency response teams of experts darts which can be put together quickly to respond to each particular disaster they provide expertise in disaster response as well as an assessment of what assistance is needed from donors including the united states ofda has wide authority to borrow funds equipment and personnel from other parts of usaid and other federal agencies ofda also provides assistance as grants to governmental and nongovernmental agencies in the disaster area usaid administers title ii of the food for peace program which provides food aid to victims of disasters the department of defense also has humanitarian assistance program that is sometimes involved in disaster response in addition the president has the authority to draw down defense equipment and direct military personnel to respond to disasters3 the president may also use the denton program4 to provide space available transportation on military aircraft and ships to private donors who wish to transport humanitarian goods and equipment in response to disaster assistance for the long term recovery of nation after disaster can also be provided in variety of ways foreign aid programs may be reprogrammed or the president may ask congress for supplemental appropriation in the aftermath of the hurricane mitch disaster affecting six countries in central america the administration used both reprogramming and supplemental appropriation as well as debt forgiveness for information on that disaster see crs report 981030 f central america reconstruction after hurricane mitch and crs report rl30083 supplemental appropriations for fy1999 central america disaster aid middle east peace and other initiatives 2 authorized in sec 491493 of pl 87195 the foreign

relief items and provide other humanitarian assistance to the extent authorized annually by congress 4 title 10 section 402 authorizes the shipment of privately donated humanitarian goods on us military aircraft on space available basis crs5 international disaster response the united states provides disaster assistance as one of many donors in the system unicef development program world health organization and the world food program all respond to natural disasters information sharing and technical assistance is provided by the office of the coordinator of humanitarian activities under the secretary general many countries besides the united states provide bilateral disaster assistance echo the humanitarian response agency of the european union provides assistance in addition to the contributions made by european union members private voluntary agencies including the red cross affiliates provide assistance using government funds as well as their own us disaster assistance in fy2000 the united states has declared 43 disasters since fy2000 began on october 1 1999 the declaration of disaster means that the ambassador may request 25000 for immediate release to local relief organization and that the united states will respond to requests for further humanitarian assistance sixteen of the disasters declared were man made disasters caused by warfare or political activities resulting in flows of refugees thirteen of the disasters were floods including the southern africa floods the declaration is generally made when the host government declares disaster and asks for assistance aid is provided for varying lengths of time it is difficult to compare disasters and the us response to them first there are different humanitarian needs in an earthquake war flood or an environmental accident second while some governments have little capability to handle domestic disasters many have competent staff with long experience in disaster response who need only modest help third in providing aid the united states takes into account the humanitarian aid provided by other governments and international organizations as well some countries have special relations such as france with its former colonies or common borders which result in high levels of governmental or private response to disasters fourth disasters last for varying lengths of time earthquakes are over quickly but droughts may last much longer aid in an earthquake situation must be quick and specific to find and help people trapped by the quake drought develops over months and aid may be most needed toward the end of the disaster when the disaster occurs is also important drought or flood in time when fields are fallow is less damaging to country than the same problem at harvest or planting time the following table compares the thirteen floods for which the us has provided assistance so far in fy2000 including the current one in southern africa the number of killed displaced and affected are only estimates in disasters people flee to safe havens and are considered missing or dead until they show up in other cases people who are listed as missing may never be found and never added to the death toll the terms displaced and affected are often used interchangebly by governments and humanitarian workers making it difficult to tell whether people have fled their homes and are in danger or are safe but cant get to markets or jobs until the water level goes down or cant afford to buy goods at the inflated prices caused by the flood the column listing us spending gives the amounts collected and totaled by usaid ofda to date from all the agencies and programs involved it generally takes many months and sometimes years for the crs6 actual totals to be determined and reported finally the column which includes all international aid reported to unocha for particular disaster is incomplete first there is requirement that country or organization report aid provided in disaster so unocha can include only the information which it receives second unocha statistics do not include aid in kind blankets for example or services helicopters and crews for example if country doesnt provide unocha with monetary value finally countries place their own value on their assistance and may also include assistance which they plan to provide or hope to provide but have not yet provideds
