to sit up but yuri shoves him back in pinning him indys got leverage yuri wraps his hands around indys throat choking him through clenched teeth yuri sorry about your truck wham yuri punctuates his

pullhandle marked fire with what have i got to lose look on his face he decide to see what happens when he pulls it he reaches over yanks it and is stunned as the rear end of the cockpit ignites with blast of flame and an enormous roar the russians jerk back in shock yuri has startled beat of realization jumps on indy and theyre both instantly whisked from sight wider angle as the cockpit turns out to be rocket sled hurtling along set of rails indy and yuri hang on for dear life as the sled goes screaming down its track ext hangar night and explodes through set of wooden doors into the night once clear an even bigger booster of flame kicks in hurtling them ever faster up ahead section of the outer gate open automatically heralded by spinning lights they zip through ext desert night and go blazing down the rails across the desert on the rocket sled both men are screaming and holding on the sled goes faster and faster still everything vibrating like crazy yuri tries to pull indy out of the seat but indy lands solid punch to the russians nose that flips him over the back of the sled yuris now hanging on by his fingertips his body horizontal in the slipstream above the roaring rocket flame the contrail is enormous over thirty feet long s cm 18 indy manages to twist around in the seat getting properly positioned fighting the gforces every inch of the way he grabs the safety harness and raises it up to his chest trying to get it buckled he almost gets it but with mighty effort yuri thrusts his arm forward and loops it around indys neck now indys being choked again not to mention being pulled inexorably out of his seat the russians howling in his ear both their faces getting plastered back by sheer gforce indy sees the hypo on the floor near his foot he reaches for it with straining fingers manages to grab it in danger of being yanked out the sled indy ships the hypo up and stabs it repeatedly over his shoulder at yuri yuri keeps avoiding it whipping his head from side to side he gets indys wrist in an iron grip turning the hypo back on indy now straining to jam it into his neck indy throws several quick punches over his shoulder with his free hand popping yuri in the nose yuris grip on indy wrenches loose the hypo falls back into the cockpit as the russian drops back again hanging by his fingertips indy forces himself back down into his seat he tries again to buckle his safety harness his hands fighting to overcome the gforces he almost gets it but suddenly the sleds booster shuts down indy is hurled forward as the gees reverse banging his head off the control panel and cracking glass dial yuri goes sailing over indys head thrown clear and vanishing from view the sled comes to stop shutting down to complete silence groaning indy sits clutches his bleeding head trying not to pass out its an effort of will but he stays conscious and just when he looks up wham yuri suckerpunches him knocking him out as we fade to ext desert night indys slumped

president you first escalante oh these pictures are not of theyre of you for my wall he motions to countless framed photos of people on the wall escalante all the people whove gone after the city of the gods and never returned for posterity marion forced smile lovely tradition lovely indy and marion are herded before the lens looking stiff and uncomfortable together indys distracted scanning the photos on the wall 54 marion what he spots certain photo of distinguished older man and directs her attention to it muttering indy that one there thats professor oxley escalante in the unlikely event that you survive you will of course receive copies eight by tens and wallet sized big smile the photographer presses the shutter cable and flash the screen whites out int ballroom day timecut and the flash dies away as chorus line of female dancers come trooping out along runway launching into broadway style tap routine as the audience applauds angle drifts past the orchestra to find indy and marion seated at banquet table indy poring over his books and map indy okay im remembering this right in the early 16th century pair of jesuits attached to pizarros expeditioin found what they claimed was dioses the lost city of the gods in the valley of dreams they said it was place where wishes became real of course they were insane by the time they stumbled out of the jungle all they had to back up their story was the gold they were carryingand crystal skull that skulls on private display in the vatican museum marion theres more than one twelve that i know of indy right the mitchellhedges skull the one in the british museum some in private collections looks to her i and now your skull lucky thirteen howd you get your hands on it 55 indys tone is casual but its weighted question he knows russian spies are involved but wants to see if marion has any idea she just shrugs marion we went through that antiquities broker in marrakesh same guy who hired you osgood turner hovers in an alcove speaking urgently on phone turner yes im looking at him right now notify washington that jones has surfaced in peru resume indy and marion as the dancers finish their routine and troop off the runway to thunderous applause escalante rises from his seat escalante and now my friends the afternoons main entertainment fresh line of people are trooped out all men they turn to face the audience like row of beauty pageant contestants as marion reaches across indy to his map of peru unnoticed by them the line of men on stage are having nooses lowered around their necks as the orchestra plays jauntily on marion peters got the team assembled and waiting for us points on map there soon as we get our papers signed ive got plane waiting indy plane good legend has it the jesuits found the lost city by following the lines in the earth left by the gods as map professor oxley once told my father he thought the lines in the earth meant the nazca lines the orchestra tapers off as drumroll begins indy points on the map draws his finger along their proposed route indy thats along our route i say we fly over them if oxley was right they could point the way 56 marion i thought you didnt believe in f this lost city stuff indy i dont that doesnt mean im always right they glance up just as the drumroll ends and thunk the runway drops out from under the feet of the men as they are hung applause from the audience indy and marion just sit there with their jaws open aghast as escalante so much for our communist rebels eh come enjoy the orchestra strikes up again couples take to the dance floor escalante spots marion smiles and waves he approaches their table pulling pen from his pocket indy mutters to marion nice friends youve got new angle and now were watching from across the room as escalante bends to sign marions papers angle shifts to figure fg watching he turns toward us his name is angel peruvian rebel dressed as busboy he exits frame as escalante signs the document folds it offers it marionbut when she tries to take it he doesnt immediately let go first escalante remember sehora all antiquities found in peru belong to you are well advised to keep that in mind there is threat implicit in his smile he releases his grip letting her have the document as we cut to ext airfield day hand reaches up spins wooden propeller the engine roars to life the man turns revealing indiana jones as we know and love him leather jacket fedora bullwhip he circles the plane its big ungainly biplane with two open cockpits as graceful as buffalo renaldo is in the forward cockpit revving the engine 57 marions in the rear cockpit indy clambers up squeezes in behind her the space accommodates two but its snug marion watch those mitts indy dont flatter yourself he signals renaldo the biplane bounces down the dirt runway scattering sheep as it lurches into the air and we dissolve to ext aerial montage day series of shots takes us over the fabled nazca lines the huge mysterious geoglyphs carved into the earth of the desolate nazca plains each pictograph is several kilometers long and all are unique the killer whale the baby condor the hummingbird the astronaut the god humanoid in form the spider the star the lizard and so on indys leaning out with small leica snapping pictures ext biplane day and as they come toward camera pursuing biplane descends m into frame behind them indy is oblivious for moment focusing the leicathen he glances back seeing the enemy plane has dual cockpits push in to reveal yuri piloting it behind him in the rear cockpit is angel our peruvian rebel busboy manning swivel machine gun mounted between the cockpits indy is stunned and horrified to see yuri on his tail indy behind us renaldo glances back in panic as bullets shred the tail he throws the stick hard left banking away behind them yuris plane is smaller and more nimble hi zips and swerves staying on our heroes tail machine gun blazing marion why are they shooting at us she pulls out her expedition papers and waves them wildly at the pursuing plane elbowing indy in the face marion we have permission yflflffts 58 indy grabs the top of marions head and shoves her down out of sight trying to get her out of the line of fire he pulls his revolver turns and starts firing the enemy plane swerves to avoid his shots massive green mountains loom in on either side as the terrain goes from desert to jungle renaldo veers out over an endless vista of rain forest with the enemy plane hot on his heels marion keeps trying to rise but indy keeps shoving her back down he shakes the spent cartridges from his revolver accidentally sending one down the back of her neck marion ow dammit thats hot and he frantically reloads painfully slow process of inserting each bullet individually marion watches with growing amazement and irritation marion i know what im buying you for christmas off his look tommy gun he slaps the cylinder shut and twists around trying to draw bead on the pursuit plane finally giving marion chance to pop back up shes just in time to witness machine gun bullets chew holes up the length of the lower wing worse yet the outermost wooden struts connecting upper and lower wings get chopped in half severing them the upper wing is longer anchored the outer half is flexing up creaking threatening to give way entirely marion indy the wings gonna tear off indy cover keep those bastards off our tail indy slaps the gun into marions hand along with extra bullets he heaves himself from his seat balancing crazily on the edge of the cockpit leans forward grips the upper wing and swings himself onto the bottom wing grabbing the upright struts to keep from being swept off he looks back and sees the enemy plane moving in for the kill but marion levels the revolver over the back of the cockpit and lets em have it blam1blam1blam yuris plane takes few bullet hits yuri veers off 59 n marion lets out laugh of triumph cracks the cylinder and starts to reload as indy wingwalks between the struts wind tearing at his clothes he hears horrible loud crunch ahead he looks up and sees the upper wing now buckling severely up about to shear off indy unspools his bullwhip and cracks it forward twining the end of it around the fractured upper strut he heaves down on the wing and steps close desperately wrapping the upper and lower struts with the whip threading them together marion finishes reloading as yuris plane reappears with angel firing the machine gun marion ducks the gunfire but drops the pistol luckily it falls into the cockpit unluckily the cockpit is really tight and she has to go down after it yuris plane angels ammo runs dry he hurries to reload bringing up new box and struggling to pop the lid while indy finishes his repair turns backand sees marion gone he looks in horror at the pursuit plane totally exposed inside fuselagemarions cockpit while marion gropes for the revolver on the floor of the fuselage grimacing and contorting around the control stick and rudder pedals duplicate of renaldos in the forward cockpit her fingers straining for the gun yuris plane yuri shoot him why dont you shoot angel i must reload the ammo box is jammed thinking fast yuri guns the throttle and surges forward indy sees him coming helpless to do anything indy marion get up here now fc 60 inside fuselagemarions cockpit her fingers are moments away from snagging the gun marion there in sec the planes yuri maneuvers in using his propeller to buzzsaw the tail of our heroes plane to tatters renaldos reaction is to panic and throw the biplane into steep dive this has two results one indy loses his balance falls flat on the wing and slides clean off but manages to grab vertical wing strut the gun slides away from marions fingers skidding down the floor of the fuselage toward renaldos feet marion damn it renaldo renaldo glances back hearing marion pull up you hear pull up renaldo jerks back the control stick as hard as he can inside fuselagemarions cockpit and the duplicate stick ierks back as well whacking marion right between the eyes it knocks her out cold indy is hanging on the wing strut by his fingertips his body trailing in the slipstream he looks back as yuri maneuvers in again closer and closer propeller cutting the air like the worlds biggest meat slicer indy gulps it is the worlds biggest meat slicer and hes the meat renaldo starts zigging and zagging yuri zigs and zags along right behind them sticking close propeller whipping from side to side and missing indys legs by inches on every pass indys getting whipped around in the slipstream like human rag helpless he cant hold on much longer besides the strut hes clutching ins starting to crack under his fingers he glances back at the enemy plane getting an idea born of sheer desperation he knows his timing must be perfect or 61 hell die and he waits for the right moment when renaldo zigs and yuri zags and thats when indv lets go yuris plane and he sails past the propeller slamming painfully into the wing struts of the enemy plane he grabs on for dear life letting his momentum and the rushing wind spin him around toward the pilots cockpit where he lands an awesome punch to yuris face yuri is knocked senseless for moment head snapping back as the plane starts to drift indy looks to the astonished angel whos finally gotten the ammo box open and is just finishing reloading angel racks the feet bolt and swings the machine gun around to shoot but indys already scrambling over yuri to the rear cockpit wham indy lands another solid punch this one rocking angels head around the machine gun swings wildly and fires hero plane killing renaldo as the bullets shred our hero plane renaldo slumps head dropping down just as marions head pops up in the cockpit behind him l shes coming to looking around she glances over and sees indy on the other plane trading punches with angel she blinks in confusion how the hell did he get over there and then it dawns on her she looks forward heart in her throat shes alone with dead pilot can it get any worse well yes it can renaldo slumps forward on the control stick sending the plane into dive it drops from view as marion indyyyyyyy yuris plane yuri gathers his wits and glances back sees indy and angel swapping punches yuri furious decides theres one simple way to solve this problem he snaprolls the plane upside down flying inverted both combatants fall angel plummets away screaming but indy manages to grab the machine gun mount and hold on yuri looks back and sees indy dangling there shit indy whats so special about the skull yuri why do you want it so bad sm j0i 62 yuri give it to and maybe ill let you live indy for old times sake hell with you pissed yuri snaprolls the plane upright again causing indy to plop into the rear cockpit indy sits up yuri pulls pistol turns around to shoot him and this time its indy who grabs the stick and snaprolls the plane upsidedown yuri falls out screaming the last we see of him hes freefalling toward the jungle below indy snaprolls the plane rightsideup again with big deal look on his face apparently hes become an expert pilot since temple of doom indy looks around sees marions plane way the hell down there he rolls his plane into steep dive to catch up with her marions plane is pretty much shot to pieces by now flying via miracle sputtering and trailing smoke worse yet were still in steady dive toward the jungle below marions tugging on her stick trying to pull it back but the weight of renaldos body on his stick is preventing her indys plane zooms in from above matching her dive as he shouts at the top of his lungs indy pull up pull up marion i would if there werent dead guy on the stick indy well try harder he points frantically at the jungle below theres lot of green rushing up to meet us marion braces her feet on the instrument panel straining with all her might the stick begins to move renaldos body flops back as the stick rises and her plane levels out just above the trees heading straight for cliff indy hard left hard left 63 marion throws the stick hard left making an extreme 180 degree turn with indy on her tail both planes level out back in the direction they came sailing along some ten or twenty feet above the jungle canopy its scary and spectacular rollercoaster ride without the rails marion now what indy can you fly marion does one lesson count indy okay plan b grab the skull ill get my wing up to your cockpit you wingwalk over to and we fly away marion you call that plan indy you got better one marion why dont you come to indy uh lets seecould it be because your plane is shot to pieces and will fall apart at any moment okay how about i cant fly and wingwalk at the same time am i getting warmer off her look look either do it or die arguing he points she looks and sees ridge of sheer granite rising out of the jungle dead ahead she hastily reaches behind the seat to retrieve the skull indy starts easing the plane in but his attention suddenly snaps ahead as he sees yuri is dropping toward the trees by parachute with burp gun in his handsl yuri opens fire tracking the planes as they go ripping by him emptying the clip into indys engine then he drops into the trees gone beat indy leans to one side and peers ahead at the engine rwhich seems to be doing fine until the entire cowling abruptly bursts into flames indy looks over to marion indy never mind ill come to you 0 na jt 64 marion nods frantically the granite ridge is looming nursing the last few seconds of life from his flaming engine indy drops altitude his wheels now kissing the treetops and he veers under marion with mere moments to spare he reaches up and grabs hold of her landing gear as his plane drops out from under him leaving him dangling the abandoned plane impacts nosefirst into the trees below his feet cartwheeling through spectacular fiery disintegration indy pull up uuuup1 marion heaves back on the stick with all shes got fighting for every inch of altitude for moment it doesnt look like theyre going to make it but they do clearing the ridge by mere feet unfortunately the ridge proves to be jungle plateau where marions plane is suddenly chewing through the treetops like hedge trimmer with wings indy is holding on desperately to the landing gear getting swept relentlessly through the branches swarms of monkeys are shrieking and jumping out of the way thump indy looks down and finds shrieking monkey clinging in terror to his chest and screaming in his face indy screams back equally startled the monkey jumps for it vanishing back into the trees as the plateau suddenly drops away and the plane soars out over thousandfoot drop with indy still holding on marion wrestles the stick looking frantically over the sides marion indy indy trembling hand appears at the edge of the forward cockpit followed by second hand indys face rises up looking like hes been dragged down ten miles of bad road marion lights up with cocky grin exceedingly proud of herself marion hah not bad flying for one lesson huh jones indy the monkey pooped on my chest 65 she doesnt understand what that means and hes too tired to explain he hauls himself painfully over the side into renaldos cockpit tosses glance back over his shoulder indy ill take it from here and the engine dies the instant he takes the stick the huge wooden propeller stops indy oh perfect and they drop from frame like brick various angles indy wrestles the plane in dead glide dropping fast desperately looking for place to set down he deadsticks it toward clearing trying to line up for landing indy hang on the landing gear tears off as they clip tree and bellyskid in the wings are ripped off by passing tree trunks then the plane finally comes to stop all things considered its pretty damn good landing indy looks stunned that he pulled it off he tosses cocky smile over his shoulder at marion but she points he turns forward to see flames erupting from the engine mad scramble he leaps from his cockpit indy quick the skull she tosses him knapsack and jumps down they race away from the plan and boom the plane explodes sending fireball into the sky and knocking them both flat on their faces marion pries her nose off the ground looks back at the plane its an inferno marion i suppose we can walk from here indy facedown muffled that might work if the compass and map werent in the plane indy rolls painfully onto his back barely able to move he sees his whip lying within reach in tangle of wing wreckage he snags it with his fingers pulls it toward him groaning with each little movement fi 66 marion whats the matter jones mileage finally catching up with you indy it aint the mileage sweetheart its the years this gets faint trace of smile from her in spite of everything theres still tiny spark here but her smile vanishes as she gets furious marion who the hell were those guys why were they shooting at us indy you really telling you dont know anything about these russian spies marion russian spies are you insane damn it indy what have you got into indy why is it always hey its your skull theyre after you wanna explain that the conversation escalates into shouting match as marion oh please dont shift blame things were fine until you showed up indy yeah i didnt hear you complaining when i saved your life five times in ten minutes marion yeah well my life wouldnt need saving if it wasnt for you dont take credit for putting out the fire you started indy hey baroness or highness whatever the hell you are yelling at wont get us out of this jungle alive you wanna be constructive help figure out where we are so we can rsuddenly they hear twig snap they fall silent turning slowly behind them are revealed v 67 line of fierce native warriors theyre warpainted hovitos wearing bits of bone feathers loincloths camera pans them every single warrior stands poised with blowguns arrows or spears we endframe as doktor felix von grauen unexpectedly steps from amongst them into closeup thin unshaven sinister wearing wireframe specs he removes his hat revealing bristly gray crewcut von grauen guten tag off indys and marions astonished looks we cut to ext jungle day an empty parachute hangs from the branches of tree tilt down to reveal yuri on the ground below sorting items into knapsack he rises grabs his burp gun starts walking and hears loud cocking of weapons he stops turns dozen soldiers are aiming rifles right at him he drops his weapon carefully raises his hands as we cut to ext expedition base camp magic hourdusk daylight is fading two hovito dugout canoes pull smoothly through the water and bump gently to shore marion is helped from canoe by von grauen followed by indy marion peter and we reveal the camp filled with men pack mules trucks cookfires activity supplies are being sorted preparations made and coming through it all is baron peter belasko archeologist and author marions suave hungarian husband hes handsome sophisticated aristocratic brilliant hugely successful and in spite of all those things actually pretty likable with him are group of his men key among them viktor and porfi viktor also hungarian is belaskos righthand man porfi peruvian is boss of the local labor pool marion rushes into peters arms and gives him huge kiss which makes indy grimace but only we notice peter marion youre all right there was trouble 68 marion renaldos dead we might be too if not for indy smiles with great modesty as she lifts her arm in his direction but his smile drops as she points instead to marion doktor von grauen is it von grauen i saw their forced landing i was close at hand peter my deepest thanks herr doktor embracing marion thank god youre not hurt whos responsible for this viktor rebels most likely they would love to sabotage us and embarrass president escalantes government marion it was russian spies according to him peter turns and registers indy for the first time peter and this man is marion peter id like you to meet our expedition foreman indiana jones peter indianajones glance to marion my word ive heard lot about you indy nothing good im sure peter on the contrary my wife speaks very highly of you indy tosses surprised glance at marion marion hes being polite 69 peter nonsense i know you by reputation as well ive read your published work im surprised to have you join us to say the least shakes his hand but honored now please whats this about russian spies indy seems theyre trying to get their hands on thisthrough im hard pressed to say what they want with crystal skull of destiny indy opens the knapsack and watches carefully for reaction peter peers in exhilarated doesnt miss beat peter power of course perhaps beyond imagining to marion seems weve attracted the wrong kind of attention marion porfi we leave tomorrow at first light make sure the men are armed and have extra ammunition any question take em to your new foremandoctor jones porfi nods respectfully to indy porfi anything else sefior indy double the guard tonight sense taking chances porfi nods and hurries off hollering in spanish as viktor if the russians are after us that makes rebel attack even more likely the rebels are communists very friendly to the soviets indy then they better hope they dont run into presidente off their looks he likes to hang communists little hobby of his cut to 70 int escalantes office night pair of hands complete hangmans noose tilt up to presidente jolly as snake puffing on cigar escalante i love rope rope is sturdy and dependable you know what i love most about rope it is the love that binds he playfully tosses the noose like lasso whippan with the noose as it flies and snags an incan statue revealing yuri standing before escalante flanked by armed soldiers yuri this expedition of theirs stands to gain more than you could ever guess its not about stones and trinkets its about the balance of world power escalante you think i am unaware that i have resources of my own yuri is taken aback this comes as news escalante reels in his noose and tosses it again snagging soldierss rifle escalante you amuse communist spy captured on my soil wishing to strike bargain give one good reason i should not have you killed yuri you lack my knowledge the stakes are high and you have much to gain beat presidente give what i need men machines armaments and i promise my government will be very generous when the objective is achieved escalante you have that backwards when the objective is achieved perhaps it is my government which will be generous of yours we shall see he tosses the noose this time it lands perfectly around yuris neck escalante reels him in pulls him close escalante now tell about this skull cut to 71 the crystal skull is pulled from the knapsack kicking reflected firelight tilt up to peter as he raises it peter my friends ext expedition base camp night and turns revealing it to gathering of people peter i give you the skull of dioses gasps are heard were in large camp clearing surrounded by tents campfires torchlight porfis men patrolling with rifles pause in dread at the sight of the skull several of the guards cross themselves von grauens hovitos drop to their knees muttering in superstitious awe an eerie commotion briefly draws indys attention to truck parked in shadow among the other vehicles the back of the truck is large square covered with tieddown tarp cage perhaps from under the tarp comes animal moans of fear seemingly triggered by the appearance of the skull along with indy marion and von grauen the expedition team f members are rama japanese map expert lars swedish psychic and himmelman swiss anthropologist all regard the skull with reverence and awe voices hushed marion its beautiful and horrible lars approaches and holds his hands up to the skull not touching it but rather feeling its emanations lars it wishes to make contact the psychic vibrations are strong indy psychic vibrations is this science or seance peter perhaps both indiana i hold in my hand the most mysterious object in all antiquity one which defies all reason and logic ik himmelman steps up using his pincenez as magnifying glass himmelman do you know why doctor jones sg jry 72 indy if its like the other skulls its shaped from single piece of quartz crystal using methods unknown to us even today its cut against the grain which is impossible without shattering the quartz and theres trace of tool marks or sanding even under microscope peter so by any standards of modern science these skulls cannot exist and yet they do fashioned how by whom and for what purpose indy look i11 admit its strangebut that doesnt mean its haunted peter peter crouches before indy and raises the skull the other team members are gathering closer as peter can you honestly say you havent felt its hypnotic power can you truly say you wouldnt give everything to know what ancient secrets lie within indy would you peter indiana we are men of science we would gladly clasp hands and jump into hell if that were the pride of knowledge tell im wrong indy cant bring himself to deny it he glances uncomfortably at marion who gives him wry look marion i knew you two would hit it off by now the group is clustered around like kids telling ghost stories at campfire the skull weaving spell on them all peter and where science fails us are we not left with legend we follow the skull as it gets passed around everybody getting their turn to feel it faces exhilirated in the firelight as 73 indy the legend says there are thirteen skulls in all fashioned by the gods as they lay dying and that when all the skulls are brought together again the gods will be reborn and reward mankind with all the knowledge of the universe the skull is passed to von grauen you missed the most important part of the legend doctor jones they say the lost city is place where wishes are made real is this not why men have searched for centuries to conjure ones innermost desires what glorious thing that would be he passes it to marion as ts peter what would you wish for marion what are your innermost desires she and indy make accidental eye contact the talk of innermost desires flusters her but she covers quickly marion to find the lost city and name it after myself marionville she hands it off to lars whose eyes start rolling up as lars i canfeel its thoughts it wants to lead us to the lost city that awaits in the valley of dreams the mood is broken by indy whos also rolling his eyes indy look maybe you can read its mind maybe it does grant wishes ive seen some strange things in my time wouldnt surprise but i never found lost city without being practical mr hama youre the map expert hama nods pulling sheaf of maps indy rises to camp table lays out map of peru the others gather as hama shows indy circled area on the map srinfx s0hk 74 hama according to belaskosan we must concentrate our search here in this area which i have circled peter off indys look i was told this by the survivor of the oxley expedition i saw him last year in lima poor fellow his ordeal has left him quite insane indy so were basing our plan on what some guy in nuthouse told you marion makes as much sense as those pictures you took today that we almost died for viktor lays down stack of 8x10s indy spreads them with his hand displaying his aerial photos of the nazca lines indy hey im just telling you oxleys theory he was convinced these pictograms are some kind of road map use em in the right sequence and connect the dots they supposedly lead you straight to the lost city looks to peter the trick is figuring out which order the pieces fit thats the part i dont know hama mr lars can help us divine the proper order he is the most psychic lars carefully gathers up the photos and map clasping them to his chest camera pushes in as lars i shall sleep with these under my pillow my best psychic visions come to in my dreams off their looks fear not my friends tomorrow i shall have all your answers dissolve to int tent night hand reaches in eases the tent flap aside shadow crosses the moonlight as somebody enters but were at waist level and cant see the face the figure creeps across the tent 75 and brings burlap sack into view the figure reaches into it wearing thick black rubber glove as the hand comes out again we see squirming in the intruders fingers tiny black frog with blazing red stripes camera pans off to lars sleeping on his back mouth open snoring softly as we fade to ext camp dawn misty primordial beauty the sun peeking through sudden hollering commotion sends macaws and parrots to flight as ext lars tent dawn men burst from the tent carrying lars everybody yelling at once they lay him on the ground crowding around indy and peter going to their knees they wince as they get look at lars face the skin is weirdly mottled the eyes bulging hama the map and photos are gone stolen porfi the guards heard nothing marion if its murder wheres the blood peter rips open the dad mans shirt checking for peter stab wounds bruises indy wait wait everybody falls silent as indy peers at the corpse leaning closer everybody leans closer with him he slowly presses the lower jaw causing the mouth to open and tiny black frog with red blotches squirms out followed by more stream of frogs burst out leaping in all directions everybody screams and hollers stomping like mad indy dont touch em dont let em get on your skin as the commotion dies amazonian tree frog also known as the poison arrow frog those poison darts the natives use thats where the poison comes from its the most deadly venom on earth one touch and youre gone 76 marion so it was murder indy mutters to marion some psychic he couldnt see that one coming marion gives indy an appalled look as marion search the camp find out whos missing viktor need its that german von grauen he left hours before sunrise and took his hovitos with him peter im to blame for this i should never have trusted him now good man is dead because of looks to indy it seems we have competition and they will stop at nothing indy looks that way but we still have the negatives indy and peter both look to marion with concern seeing how rattled she is by the murder indy and peter simultaneously are you all right she looks from one to the other not sure who to respond to marion fine better than him brushes past them strike the camp various angles of slambang activity trucks being loaded pack mules lining up men mounting horses in the midst of it all indy pauses hearing weird howl from that mysterious tarp covered truck viktor slams the butt of his rifle against the tarp with metallic clang there is cage under there whatevers inside quiets down indy turns sees peter indy what the hells in that truck 77 peter animals live food for the road f0 must keep the troops fed v peter takes the reins of his horses and mounts up indy does the same canters to the head of the line turns indy move out the column moves out horses and rumbling trucks leaving dust in their wake camera booms down bringing rough wooden cross into frame fg lars final resting place cut to ext presidential palace morning another expedition is moving out three open troop trucks led by surplus nate armored personnel carrier soldiers are piling onto the trucks engines firing up and belching smoke osgood turner of the state department comes stumbling through the mud in his suit as the column moves out escalante rides in the turret of the apc happily puffing cigar yuri at his side osgood jogs alongside hollering turner president escalante on behalf of the us government i must protest that man is known soviet agent escalante on the contrary it is your own countrys citizen indiana jones who is the spy this man has volunteered to help track him down and foil his evil communist scheme turner sir you understand this is matter of national security the state department has instructed to locate jones i must be allowed to monitor this operation escalante glances to yuri then waves turner toward the troop trucks with big smile escalante suit yourself we dont want an international incident after all too bad you didnt bring more sensible shoes turner drops back slipping and sliding as he tries to jump onto the back of truck soldiers grab him haul him aboard r 78 yuri if he gets in our way we can always shoot him and blame jones escalante my sentiments exactly now as to our destination angle shifts to reveal third man riding on the apc with his back to us he rises turns its von grauen von grauen you shall remember your promise to ja i shall be the first man to set foot in the lost city escalante playfully to see if wishes can truly be made real was that the bargain von grauen correct but alsoten percent of all the gold and riches we find escalante deal is deal herr doktor unlike your former colleague baron belasko i consider that small price to pay satisfied von grauen lays the map out on the turret von grauen we must concentrate our search points on map here camera zooms slowly on the map closing in on the area circled by hama dissolve to ext jungle day as an aerial shot brings us gloriously to that same area on the dissolve mountainous jungle as far as the eye can see the belasko expedition winds slowly along ridge ext jungle ridge day with indy walking point eyeing his compass marions nearby leading her horse indy turns and calls hama riding on the back of truck doing map calculations indy mr hama weve entered that area you had circled on the map 0 r 79 hama yes indianasan jumps down hurries over with his maps i have been trying to calculate the next leg of the journey based on your nazca photos i believe i have the scale correct but i am uncertain of the rest observe hama lays his map on the ground indy hunkers down with marion joining tern hamas got the star pictograph carefully drawn on clear sheet of plastic which he lays over the map its fivepointed star with one point longer than the others hama the star comes first then the hummingbird if i could determine the direction the star points us it would indicate our path indy star first then hummingbird what do you base that order on hama belaskosan told he specified the sequence and said he would provide further information as we drew closer indy star i dont see how that applies to where we are i his voices trails off as he notices something he rises gazing at the landscape increasingly amazed as the puzzle becomes clear to him he points them out there are five mountain peaks spread widely across the landscape before us indy five peaks five points of star he crouches back down puts his fingers on the plastic and revolves it into place on the map below it we see the five points of the star align perfectly with the mountain peaks hama lets out breath of amazement looks up at indy hama but which of the peaks are the direction we must go indy one point of the stars longer than the others like an arrow thats our direction thatll lead us to the hummingbirdwhatever that is 80 hama pure heroworship n aaahhh brilliant solution indy smiles modestly shrugging off the praise but hama belaskosan is genius 1 indys face falls he sees peter passing by on horseback indy hey belaskosan howd you know the star came first peter you dont expect to give away all my secrets do you trust peter rides on marion tosses indy challenging look marion you might as well hes never wrong still kneeling at the map indy checks his compass muttering indy right i forgot youre an excellent judge of character and hes perfect marion

head it twines furiously in his grasp shes stunned marion i cant believe you did that indy i got over my fear long time ago people change you know off her look relax its just snake he tosses the snake off into the foliage walks on as we dissolve to ext dense jungle day men are hacking away with machetes with indy in the lead indy not looking too good up here this stuff goes on forever marion

the truck yuri suddenly kicks in the drivers side window landing bootheel to indys face before indy can react yuri kicks him in the face again knocking him senseless yuri pulls indy out the window and drops him in the river indy vanishes in the current as yuri slides in and replaces him behind the wheel marion and hama are horrified in the river indy pops up gasping for air he looks around sees horse being swept toward him whinnying in panic indy grabs the reins calming the animal as he urges the horse toward shore the best swimming and snorting frantically hooves finally finding some

toward the riverbank indy pulls oxley to safety crawls few feet up the muddy bank and collapses facedown he tries to catch his breath indy professor you ok and glances up just in time to see oxleys naked feet dart out of frame stunned indy shoves himself off the ground trying to see where oxley went indy professor indy takes off in pursuit various angles and the chase takes them through denser and denser jungle oxley always two steps ahead in fact indy never really sees him clearly just catches bare glimpses of him vanishing around trees or as fastmoving blur through the leaves indy professor wait indys getting lost disoriented in all this green he pauses to listen hoping to pinpoint his oxley by sound and the wild man swings overhead on vine appearing and vanishing like sight

hurtling on like gymnast off the bars with indy not far behind swinging on vines but lacking oxleys animal agility indy lands on branch desperately trying to keep his balance and realizes hes run out of vines he pulls his whip and cracks it forward using his whip now to keep swinging from tree to tree until crack branch breaks with his weight and indy plummets to the ground landing flat on his back he sits up groaning sign of oxley sound now but the jungle birds indy professor from distance marion indy indys swept with relief realizing he would have been devastated if something had happened to her he scrambles to his feet blunders through the growth toward clearing indy marion thank god i thought i lost you new angle and he freezes as he emerges into the clearing not twenty yards away

jumping for it down the incline as wab00000m1 huge explosion blows imy flame out of the mouth and eyes of the stone face moment later the face collapses in smoking hole in the cliff dissolve to yfrv 118 ext grand plaza of the great temple day and our group struggles into the lost city passing vine shrouded colonnades and ancient broken archways entering the grand plaza of the great stone temple of the gods the temple is pyramidshaped in the mayan style gigantic with various levels working upwards toward crown of altars and odd battlements its backlit by the late sun throwing an awesome shadow across the crumbled plaza unlike mayan buildings though this one has massive open entrance looming like dark open doorway some sixty or seventy feet high as mentioned before the river from the canyons is funneled here by the aqueduct raging white rapids thunder across the plaza along the stone channel and disappear directly into the heart of the great temple through that towering open doorway oxley grows more terrified as they approach cowering at the sight of the building as they reach the buildings shadow he hunkers down gibbering in raw animal panic indy crouches before him grabs his flailing wrist in firm grip and the instant physical contact is made oxley calms and that strange lucidity returns indy looks him in the eye indy professor what happened to you here what are you so afraid of oxley tortured hushed i cant remember mysterious wind kicks up billowing dust across the plaza and sending chill of premonition through them all marion indy he turns marions staring up at the temple he follows her gaze and sees silhouetted figure is revealed through the billowing dust hes on the steps leading up to the first level of the temple just standing there watching them backlit by sun the figure comes slowly down the steps machete dangling in one hand in the other hes cradling knapsack in his arm and holding what appears to be glowing head the machete slips from his fingers clanking down the steps he reaches the bottom and approaches us its porfi mind blown one side of his face raw from second degree burn his clothes streaked with blood the glowing head hes holding j0si 0 119 is the crystal skull it drops from his shaking hand indy reacts fast catching it indy porfi where are your friends porfis disoriented trying to speak porfi pablohehe touched the gold and was consumed by the fire of the gods and then the skull spoke to it said we had defiled this placeit said we had to make sacrifice to appease the anger of dioses he turns gaze traveling back up the steps from where he came drops of blood lead up to the first level of the templewhere headless body lies seeping blood down the steps porfi so i cut off franciscos head porfi abruptly yanks decapitated head from the knapsack holding it by the hair the mouth is thrown open in silent scream eyes frozen wide and staring up at the heavens porfis expression now matching his dead friends eyes and mouth wide as can be and he starts to scream over and over again horrible earsplitting shrieks he drops the head in the dust at indys feet and runs off screaming as if hell never stop vanishing into the jungle indy looks to the others everybodys in shock indy we can turn back he meets peters gaze in the look that passes between them we can see theres way either of them are backing down indy turns tight to camera gazing with intense purpose at the huge entrance to the temple turner whoa whoa waitdont we get vote indy not looking back its not democracy and he exits frame marion glares at peter rifle aimed marion that should make you feel right at home ysg 120 the group follows indy turner glances down at the decapitated head hurries after them int the great stone temple day and they enter through the massive open doorway leaving daylight behind they move along the raging rapids of the aqueductand as their eyes adjust huge shapes appear in the darkness dozens of giant wheels are being spun at great speed by the rapids each wheel at least fifty feet tall theyre in single long row down the aqueduct one after the other mounted on line of support gantries hama water heels indy moves closer the gantries appear metallic indy theyreturbines yuri impossible descending from arrays of connectors on each gantry are series of solid gold conduits as thick as mans wrist running across the floor in long weaving patterns viewed from high above the floor of this place would look like giant computer chip schematic indy follows the humming conduits finds dead man on the floor body still smoking the ashes of the hand gripping conduit indy crouches as the others gather marion pablo indy porfi said he touched the gold and was consumed by the fire of the gods indy picks up pebble and tosses it on the conduit the pebble explodes with flash and puff of smoke indy yeah pablo electrocuted these gold rails are conductors gazes around this whole place is like massive power generating plant everybodys wrestling to accept something patently impossible peter that cant be this citys at least ten thousand years old they wouldnt have such technology they couldnt 121 turner generating power for what indy rises dont step on the rails they proceed down the huge corridor of wheels encountering more and more bodies along the way some are ash like pablo others merely skeletal cobwebby remains all long dead at the point where the wheels end they turn corner into long dark corridor indy inches cautiously into the gloom indy were gonna need torch and an overhead fixture starts to glow the light is dim and greenish indy glances to the others astonished as they proceed the overhead fixtures track them as if by motion sensor the ones ahead start to glow as they approach the ones behind them dimming back to darkness the walls are lined with hieroglyphs on both sides images depict human slaves constructing the city priests and acolytes praying to flaming fireballs in the sky blood sacrifices strange tall inhuman forms the group emerges into huge antechamber which really blows their minds its like huge warehouse crammed with stuff they move down the aisle increasingly stunned if you took the contents of the dozen best museums of antiquity in the world and dumped them here well itd be drop in the bucket there are artifacts from every ancient era from all over the world heaped helterskelter escalante madre diosl i am the wealthiest man in the world the others are looking around numb trying to absorb it all peter macedonianegyptianceltic indy sumerianetruscangreek marion z0 roman babyionian indy stops seeing primitive stone tools he picks one up s0fc s0p pflwn 122 indy prehistoric stone age hes blown away his gaze goes to an intact egyptian skiff leafed with gold and hung with cobwebs oars still in place nearby are rows of gorgeously painted egyptian sarcophagi indy i must be dreaming peter its dream its motherload artifacts from every ancient era of mankind theres not museum in the world that wouldnt sell its soul indy try dozen museumsa hundred hama how can this be how could they gather this from all over the world from so many different ages he looks to indy for answers indy one things for sure they were collectors like us marion steps into frame cocks her head look there down at the end of the aisle is an ornate archway leading to another room the archway is startling basrelief of solid gold depicting celestial bodies indy leads the way the chamber of the gods and they enter its dark just the light spilling through the door the room is big though not as huge as the antechamber they just left and its round hama moves to the center of the room where round gold basrelief occupies the floor hama crouches celestial map these starsits the pleiades system and sooner has he spoken than dim greenish light begins to glow from fixtures set into the curved walls but more astonishing than the fixtures is what they reveal thirteen thrones are spaced in wide circle around us on the thrones covered with cobwebs and the dust of ages sit thirteen crystal skeletons all missing their heads v 123 all eyes go to indy he looks down at the skull in his hand looks back to the skeletons he moves forward wondering which skeleton the skull belongs to and he pauses expression going slack he raises the skull cocks his head as is listening then his gaze shifts to specific skeleton and he veers toward it marion how do you know which one indy it told marion and the others trade ominous looks indy mounts the steps to the base of the throne pauses he lifts the crystal skull to the skeletons shouldersand finds that it slots perfectly in place click ephemeral ripples of light begin in the skull swirling down in the body dancing and flowing as delicately as smoke the skeleton now complete glows from within indy backs away gasping everybody shies back oxley loses it completely throwing himself to the floor in fetal ball writhing and moaning in meltdown of mindless terror placing the skull was like fitting key in lock because deep rumble begins the huge basrelief of the pleiades in the middle of the floor starts to open rising out like the lens of camera everybody scatters out of the way as the floor just keeps opening wider and wider steam and brilliant light rising from below along with something big massive dark shape rising up higher and higher looming we get sense of machinery humming beneath the floor not primitive stone mechanisms but machines indy glances into the glowing pit gets brief impression of engineered technology lights descending into blinding pit of hydraulic rams gears superstructure and whumpl the shape comes to stop its round base perfectly fitting the hole in the floor shutting out the light and sound from below whats risen into view is thick circular column of exotic machined design fitting from floor to ceiling ringing the column are thirteen seats facing outward suggesting futuristic astronaut blastseats otherworldly and remarkable but even more remarkable are the thirteen aliens seated in them theyre facing out their lines of sight matching the ring of crystal skeletons facing in skeleton per alien indy and the others gather gazing up at the alien opposite the glowing skeleton its been dead so long its mummified its humanoid but taller some ten feet in height gangly jdfls 124 and angular with an array of ridges and spines spreading from its neck and skull like an exotic headdress like the crystal skeletons the mummy is covered with cobwebs indy notices dusty transparent tubes running out of the column and the seats plugged into the creatures desiccated flesh indy reaches out feeling one of the creatures fingers it snaps off softly in his hand falling to dust at his feet marion what are they indy i dont know but theyve been dead long time hama look they turn the shimmering light in the room is growing brighter because the crystal skeleton is gaining brilliance swirls of light rippling and coursing through its form they shield their eyes as the light gathers most intensely in the skull and twin beams of light shoot over their heads from the skeletons eyes in the alien mummys the two now connected by supernatural force indy notices with dread that the tubes sunken into the aliens flesh have begun seeping fluids indy ive got bad feeling about this and massive booming voice suddenly fills the room voice anung rama amung dool amung doon abaya anung ramaaaa marion wheres that coming from turners backing away pointing turner its the weird guy everybody turns angle on the group as oxley rises up into frame facing camera arms held aloft weird glowing vapor streaming from his nose and mouth hair billowing against gravity as if underwater the man we knew is gone what remains is conduit of unearthly power as we watch his eyes roll slowly up in his head until the pupils vanish completely only the whites are now visible 0 125 his mouth opens living microphone for the gods voice continuing to echo and boom oxleyalien to the sacred place we welcome you and he turns to face the group more and more glowing vapor is forming streaming to oxley from the alien mummy and the crystal skeleton forming rivulets that swirl about his body and create vague wispy shapes in the air above his head indy who are you and when oxley speaks streams of vapor exhale form his nose and mouth forming shapes that dissipate in the air before their eyes like an opium addicts dream oxleyalien we are the ones who fell from the heavens we are the nephalim we are the rubezahl we are the lights in the sky your kind has given us many names you may worship us indy uh thank you 0 glances to the others your worshipfulness peter moves forward eyes gleaming peter when did you come here oxleyalien when our kind was very old and your kind was very young and now the vapor flows in ever more distinct images in the air above the oxleyaliens headdizzying star clusters being traversed at inconceivable speedsarriving at the slowly spinning ball of planet earthdescending toward what would later be the yucatan peninsula and south americaracing over parched arid landscapes and the vapor transforms into primitive ape men throwing themselves shrieking to the ground in terror as awesome booming lights ripple across the sky oxleyalien we nurtured you enhanced you set you on the path to civilization gave you knowledge of the stars and the vapor forms the great stone mayan calendar 126 oxleyalien you came to love us fear us your z worship provided us much that we needed to survive and the calendar swirls into mayan priest wearing grand headdress patterned after the ridges and pines of the aliens heads eyes wide in fervor as he plunges ceremonial dagger into the chest of screaming human sacrifice from the chest swirling up and is inhaled by an alien oxleyalien and when our time was passingwhen our bodies began to diewe placed our godly essence into the thirteen sacred vessels and the vapor transforms into the thirteen crystal skulls floating in the air they descend settling upon the shoulders of thirteen crystal skeletons oxleyalien that we might someday be reborn when others of our kind came to claim us p and the image breaks apart flowing and reforming into the head of the alien itself floating above oxley like the great and powerful oz matching oxleys movements as oxleyalien you have broken our slumber do you bring all the skulls that were taken from this place indy umwell not exactly oxleyalien then why are you here hama we came seeking knowledge the alien pauses pondering oxleyalien yes you always were an inquisitive species it is your strength and your weakness and glowing vapor streams from his image out to indy and the group swirling among them probing 127 oxleyalien there are five among you five with the greatest need the greatest thirst for knowledge all that there is to gain you are like the priests who spilled the rivers of blood in our name and the vapor encircles the five peerthen yurivon grauenescalantefinally indy the vapor glows brighter oxleyalien you are the five you are the chosen and the five men are lifted into the air and brought before the alien they hover there engulfed in forming cloud of vapor and brilliance but more than mere light the cloud growing around them is place of dreams they stare into the swirling promise of all the knowledge in the cosmos stunned by it hypnotized blown away in that seething cauldron lies all the power and glory in the universe hama and turner watch agape marion steps closer terrified marion indy indy peter and the others hover there eyes wide breath gone gazing into the furnace of the gods whisper indy marion marion its marion its what indy reaching out itseverything marion indy dont touch it but the five men are in the grip of fervor each in his own zone of the swirling cloud each man seeing

sucked into the exotic alien machinery of the column of seats indys gaze drops to the mummified alien in its seat the machinery is humming louder now powered by the stolen life forces the fluids pumping faster as indy and the others watch the desiccated flesh of the alien is becoming more supple fuller more alive in fact the alien mummy is beginning to stirto move all that remains in the dream cloud now is yuri alien voices yuri makovsky choose 131 indys eyes desperately go to marions rifle he grabs it from her sits up works the bolt indy cover your eyes marion why indy cause i dunno whats gonna happen and he shoulders it taking careful aim at the crystal skull sitting atop the crystal skeleton turner jones indy glances over this could be ours think of the power think of the possibilities indy i am and blam1 indy pulls the trigger the crystal skull is shot right between the eyes exploding into fantastic shower of spinning crystalline fragments and an incredible amount of energy erupts as the glowing light is released the essence of the gods it pours upward from the shoulders of the crystal skeleton caroming off the ceiling and blazing in all directions the dream cloud vanishes with concussive bang slamming yuri to the floor the essence of the gods is like living fire ripping through the air above our heroes heads careening off walls blazing into the column of alien seats and crackling down through its machinery like live current quickcut angles and the living fire zaps through areas of the ship our heroes will never see crackling down corridors and blazing through banks of machines that might be computers activating systems and mechanisms that have lain dormant for untold ages chamber of the gods and the whole goddamn place begins to shake indy pushes to his feet grabbing marion and the others shoving them toward the door massive blocks of stone now ripping loose and plummeting from the ceiling 132 indy pauses at the door looking back realizing professor oxleys still back there the old mans kneeling on the floor an emptied vessel now too exhausted to rise oxley looks up meets indys eyesand smiles hes fully himself again not wild man not conduit just vernon oxley oxley indy my boy run theres way indys leaving him there he dashes back into the chamber determined to save him but stops as the alien now more flesh and blood than mummy rises from its seat tubes ripping free it looms up behind oxley the old man senses it turns looks up the creature reaches down wraps hand around oxleys throat and lifts him into the air it brings oxley face to face vapor swirling between their mouths as it starts to suck oxleys life force out indy hey and the alien pauses turning indy is shouldering the carbine taking careful aim finger on the trigger indy welcome to earth and blamlblamintamtrtamblamlblaml he empties the clip in into the creature driving it back into the shadows oxley drops to the floor indy dashes in grabs him marion move it jones indy youre the boss and they run like hell moments later the ceiling collapses behind them sealing the alien away forever antechamber of artifacts the group runs up the aisle as the place comes down around their ears chunks of stone are tearing loose from the ceiling high above letting in daylight plummeting like artillery shells into the amazing artifacts all around them low angle of floor as tiny black red frog comes hopping up the aisle z chirping in panic indy and the others come running up behind itand indys foot stomps it flat as they pass by ytfffv 133 reverse angle f0 as the group races away from us turner looks back appalled turner jones you just stomped the president of peru they keep running as the rumbling and shaking grows worse now veritable earthquake marion whats happening indy something bad we gotta get as far away from here as possible fast yuri how indy skids to stop as inspiration strikes he grabs the egyptian skiff wrestling it off its mount everybody pitches in pushing and pulling it desperately up the aisle the corridor of wheels v and out to the aqueduct where the row of giant wheels end they tip the boat onto the sloping aqueduct wall poising the prow above the raging rapids they throw themselves in the boat and slide down swept off in the blink of an eye ext the great stone temple day traveling with the skiff as it comes bursting out of huge tunnel into blinding beautiful daylight shooting the rapids everybody holding on for dear life as the great stone temple drops away fast receding behind them and in the same shot our camera rises into the air tracking them down the thundering river and our camera keeps rising further and further up and up until the skiff is tiny speck being swept along and still we rise still in the same shot until we have birds eye view of the valley of dreams below us the cause of the earthquake now apparent we see parts of the valley is rising up in an enormous disc shapef perfectly round and mile wide in diameter the skiff barely makes it past the edge sailing off down the river as the disc shape rises lifting the landscape with it jungle f0 ruins everything whatevers under all that dirt has been buried there long time long enough that the city was built on top of it then thousand years ago 134 traveling with the skiff f0 as the object rises massively behind the boat straight up in the air cascading million tons of dirt and rock raining ancient ruins and countless trees indy and the others look back and in that gray storm of raining soil they get vague impression of the underside of the saucer and its mindboggling scale theres trio of round spinning lights each the size of football stadium that comprise some extraordinary and unfathomable propulsion system the engines are thrumming unevenly struggling the saucer keeps rising straight up thousand feet now and still climbing our skiff is being swept on by the rapids gaining more distance with every passing moment and just when it seems the saucer may keep rising forever the struggling engines fail sending strange bursts of lightning exploding outward and spreading across the smooth underside of the giant alien craft and the saucer starts dropping straight back down into the very pit from which it rose trillion tons plummeting back to earth the gods themselves are falling from the heavens and our group goes sailing over small waterfall everybody spilling into the water as the boat flies apart and its the sudden drop in terrain that saves them because the saucer impacts with inconceivable force and explodes with nuclear flash that turns the valley of dreams into pit of slag wipe to ext top of cliff day and indy and the others climb up from the river below soaked to the bone they turn gazing back the valley of dreams is now billowing into the sky as mushroom cloud indy and yuri look at each other yuri smilesthen starts laughing harder and harder turner whats the joke yuri we we are the joke after all that to come away empty handed indy glances to marion not emptyhanded not by long shot z0 to yuri were alive older maybe wiser thats something isnt it 135 yuri sees the truth in this he nods offers indy his hand yuri see you around beat marion turner and hama trade glances waiting to see what indy will do indy steps forward smilingand nails yuri with the alltime haymaker of punches
