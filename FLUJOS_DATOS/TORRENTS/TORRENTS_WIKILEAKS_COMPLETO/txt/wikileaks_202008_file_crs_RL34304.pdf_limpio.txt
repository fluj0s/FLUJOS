slightly different elements depending upon whether the offense involves killing or attempted killing 18 usc 1512a1 or some other use of physical force or threat 18 usc 1512a26 in essence they condemn the use of violence to prevent witness from testifying or producing evidence for an investigation and set their penalties according to whether the obstructive violence used is homicide an assault or

federal crimes subsecti on 1512a does not include imposition of fine among the sanctions that follow as consequence of its provisions with one exception it states that subsection 1512a manslaughter offense shall be punished as provided in 18 usc 1112 in add ition to term of imprisonment section 1112 states that offenders may be fined under this title section 3571 of title 18 sets the general fine level for felonies crimes whose maximum term of imprisonment is more than one year at the greater of either not more than 250000 for individuals not more than 500000 for organizations or twice

subsection 1512a offenses may be increased to match the maximum term of any offense involved in an obstructed criminal trial8 subsection 1512as whistle blower offense applies only to violence intended to obstruct the flow of information to federal law enforcement officers9 the definition of law enforcement officers for purposes of subsection 1512a seems too narrow to encompass the members or committees of congress or their staff under most circumstances 10 there are two statutory defenses to charges under section 1512 one covers legitimate legal advice and related services 18 usc 1515c11 and is intended for use in connection with the corrupt persuasion offenses proscribed elsewhere in section 1512 rather than the violence offenses of subsection 1512a the other stat utory defense is found in subsection 1512e and creates an affirmative defense when an individual engages only in conduct that is lawful in order to induce another to testify truthfully the defense would appear to be of limited use in the face of charge of the obstructing use or threat of physical force in violation of subsection 1512a12 continued the offense for purposes of brevity and convenience reference hereafter to fine of not more than 250000 should be understood to include the higher limits for organizations or when the gain or loss associated with the offense is greater although many federal statutes suggest that offenders may be sentenced to fine rather than term of imprisonment at the discretion of the court other provisions of law and the influence of the sentencing guidelines greatly curtail the number of instances in which simple imposition of fine would be considered an appropriate punishment for the commission of felony 18 usc 3553 imposition of sentence ussg 2j12 2j13 base

discussion of the operation of the federal sentencing guidelines see crs report rl32846 how the federal sentencing guidelines work two examples 8 if the offense under this section occurs in connection with trial of criminal case the maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed for the offense shall be the higher of that otherwise provided by law or the maximum term that could have been imposed for any offense charged in such case 18 usc 1512j 9 whoever kills or attempts to kill another person with inte nt to c prevent the communication by any person to law enforcement officer or judge of the united states of information relating to the commission or possible commission of federal offense or violation of conditions of probation parole or release pending judicial proceedings shall be punished as provided in paragraph 3 18 usc 1512a1 the obstruction by physical violence or threat portion of subsection 1512a is similarly worded see 18 usc 1512a2 10 as used in sections 1512 an d 1513 of this title and in this section 4 the term law enforcement officer means an officer or employee of the federal government or person authorized to act for or on behalf of the federal government or serving the federal government as an adviser or consultant authorized under law to engage in or supervise the prevention detection investigation or prosecution of an offense or b serving as probation or pretrial services officer under this title 18 usc 1515a4 11 this chapter does not prohibit or punish the providing of lawful bona fide legal representation services in connection with or anticipation of an official proceeding 18 usc 1512c 12 the sarbanesoxley act redesignated section 1512d2000 ed as section 1512e in prosecution for an offense under this section it is an affirmative defense as to which the defendant has the burden of proof by preponderance of the evidence that the conduct consisted solely of lawful conduct and that the defendants sole intention was to encourage induce or cause the other person to testify truthfully 18 usc 1512e see united states v lowery 135 f3d 957 960 5th cir 1998reversing the defendants obstruction of justice conviction for the trial

the various offenses proscribed in section 1512 subsection 1512f declares that the evidence that is the object of the obstruction need not be admissible and that the obstructed proceedings need not be either pending or imminent as consequence of subsection 1512h murder attempted murder or the use or threat of physical force committed overseas to prevent the appearance or testimony of witness or the production of evidence in federal proceedings in this country or to prevent witness from informing authorities of the commission of federal offense or federal parole probation supervised release violation is federal crime outlawed in subsection 1512a that may be prosecuted in this country 13 as general rule the courts will assume that c ongress intends statute to apply only within the united states and to be applied consistent with the principles of international law unless contrary intent is obvious14 subsection 1512h supplies the obvious contrary intent since contrary intent may be shown from the nature of the offense the result would likely be the same in the absence of subsection 1512h in the case of an overseas obstruction of federal proceedings the courts could be expected to discern congressional intent to confer extraterritorial jurisdiction15 and find such an application compatible with the principles of international law16 the existence of extraterritorial jurisdiction is one thing the exercise of such jurisdiction is another federal investigation and prosecution of any crime committed overseas generally presents wide range of diplomatic legal and practical challenges17 subsection 1512i states that violations of sect ion 1512 or section 1503 may be prosecuted in any district where the obstruction occurs or where the obstructed proceeding occurs or is to occur in the case of obstructions committed in this country the constitution may limit the trial in the 13 18 usc 1512hthere is extraterritorial federal jurisdiction over an offense under

states v bowman 260 us 94 98 1922but the same rule of interpretation of purely domestic application should not be applied to criminal statutes which are as class not logically dependent on their locality for the governments jurisdiction but are enacted because of the right of the government to defend itself against obstruction or fraud wherever perpetrated we can not suppose that when congress enacted the fraud statute or amended it it did not have in mind that wide field for such fraud upon the government was in private and public vessels of the united states on the high seas and in foreign ports and beyond the land jurisdiction of the united states and therefore intend to include them in the section ford v united states 273 us 593 623 1927 man who outside of country willfully

act element venue over subsection 1512k conspiracy is proper in any district in which only an overt act in its furtherance is committed21 regardless of which section is invoked conspirators are criminally liable under the pinkerton doctrine for any crime committed in the foreseeable furtherance of the conspiracy22 accomplices to violation of subsection 1512a may incur criminal liability by

subsection 1512b some of which may fit more comfortably in subsection 1512b corrupt persuasion setting than they do in 1512a violence prosecution the affirmative defenses in subsections 1512e and

though the statute 18 usc 1512f provides that the obstructed proceedings need be neither ongoing nor pending at the time of the obstruction it is one thing to say that proceeding need not be pending

under section 1505 have been relativel few at least until recently and most of these arise as obstructions of administrative proceedings83 the crime of obstruction of such proceedings has three essential elements first there must be proceeding pending second the defendant must be aware of the pending proceeding third the defendant must have intentionally endeavored corruptly to influence obstruct or impede the pending proceeding84 perhaps due to the breadth of judicial construction the question of what constitutes pending proceeding has arisen most often taken as whole the cases suggest that proceeding describes virtually any manner in which an administrative agency proceeds to do its business the district of columbia circuit for example has held that an investigation by the inspector general of the agency for international development may qualify as proceeding for purposes of section 1505 in doing so it rejected the notion that section 1505 applies only to adjudicatory or rulemaking activities and does not apply to wholly investigatory activity85 moreover proximity to an agencys adjudicatory or rulem aking activities such as auditors working under the direction of an officer with adjudicatory auth ority has been used to support claim that an obstructed agency activity constitutes proceeding86 the courts seem to see comparable breadth 82 18 usc 1505 83 eg united

distinction between the informal and formal stages of the sec investigation and whether criminal liability for obstructing an agency proceeding can only arise in the context of the latter in our view

definition of corruptly in 1996 as used in section 1505 the term corruptly means acting with an improper purpose personally or by influencing another including making false or misleading st atement or

money laundering predicate offenses91 section 1505 has neither separate conspiracy provision nor an explicit exterritorial jurisdiction provision however conspiracy to obstruct administrative or congressional proceedings may be prosecuted under 18 usc 37192 and the courts would likely find that overseas violations of section 1505 may be tried in this country93 moreover the general aiding and abetting accessory after the fact continued more inclusive and which longer limits itself to formal activ ities in court of law rather the investigation or search for the true facts is not to be ruled as nonproceeding simply because it is preliminary to indictment and trial see also rice v united states 356 f2d 709 712 8 th cir 1966proceedings before governmental department or agency simply mean

focus on formality rather it is properly answered by careful examination of all the surrounding circumstances if it is apparent that the investigation is legitimate exercise of investigative authority by congressional committee in an area within the committees purview it should be protected by section 1505 while formal authorization is certainly factor that weighs heav ily in this determination its presence or absence is not dispositive to give section 1505 the protective force it was intended corrupt endeavors to influence congressional investigations must be proscribed even when they occur

government must prove that the defendant bodily injured another in retaliation for the victims testimony or service as government informant103 the extent of the injuries need not be extensive104 nor in the case of threat even carried out105 as general rule the intent to retaliate need not have been the sole motivation for the attack106 section 1513 offenses are rico predicate offenses and consequently money laundering predicate offenses107 they are also violent offenses and therefore may result in the application of those statutes in which the commission of violent crime is an element or sentencing factor108 those who aid and abet section 1513 offense are liable as principals and are punishable as if they committed the offense themselves109 an individual who knows another has committed section 1513 offense and nevertheless assists the offender in order to hinder his capture trial or punishment is in turn punishable as an accessory after the fact110 and an individual who affirmatively conceals the commission of section 1513 by another is guilty of misprision111 101 whoever conspires to commit any offense under this section shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy 18 usc 1513e there are two subsections 1513e one prohibits economic retaliation and other conspiracy 1513e is the conspiracy subsection conspiracy to violate section 1513 may be prosecuted alternatively under 18 usc 371 eg united states v templeman 481 f3d 1263 1264 10th cir 2007 102 whoever knowingly with

subsection 1513c after violent proscriptions of subsections 1513a and 1513b but before the economic retaliation proscription of subsection 1513e may raise some question over whether subsectionc provides an alternative sentencing provision for subsection 1513e subsection 1513c states if the retaliation occurred because of attendance at or testimony in criminal case the maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed for the offense under this section shall be the higher of that otherwise provided by law or the maximum term that could have been imposed for any offense charged in

authority of either house of congress as consequence the body which issues the subpoena must enjoy the authority of either the house or senate to do so both to conduct the inquiry and to issue the subpoena129 authority may be vested by resolution rule or statute section 192 speaks only of the houses of congress and their committees but there seems little question that the authority may be conferred upon subcommittees130 the testimony or documents sought by the subpoena or other summons must be sought for matter under inquiry and in the case of an unanswered question the question must be pertinent to the question under inquiry131 the statute outlaws refusal to answer pertinent questions but the courts have yet to say whether the proscription includes instances where the refusal takes the form of false or deceptive testimony there is word on whether the section outlaws any refusal to answer honestly or only unequivocal obst inance on at least two occasions however apparently the courts have accepted nolo contendere pleas under section 192 based upon false statement predicate 132 section 192 bans only willful recalcitrance thus when summoned witness interposes an objection either to an appearance in response to the summons or in response to particular question the objection must be considered and if found wanting the witness must be advised that the objection has been overruled before he or she may be successfully prosecuted133 the grounds for valid objection may be found in rule statute or the constitution and they may be lost if the witness fails to raise them in timely manner134 the fifth amendment protects witnesses against selfincrimination135 the protection reaches wherever incriminating testimonial communication is compelled whether in criminal proceedings or elsewhere136 it covers communications that are either directly or indirectly incriminating but 129 gojack v united states 384 us 702 713 1966 sinclair v united states 279 us 263 296

g344g348g561only those that are testimonial137 organizations enjoy fifth amendment privilege from self incrimination138 nor in most cases do the custodians of an organizations documents unless their act of producing the subpoenaed documents is itself an incriminating testimonial communication139 an individuals voluntarily created papers and records are by definition not compelled communications and thus ordinarily fall outside the privilege as well140 moreover the protection may be waived if not invoked141 and the protection may be supplanted by grant of immunity which promises that the truthful testimony the witness provides or is compelled to provide will not be used directly or derivatively in his or her subsequent prosecution142 aside from the fifth amendment the status of constitutionallybased objections to congressional summons or question is somewhat more amorphous the first amendment affords qualified immunity from subpoena or interrogation whose availability is assessed by balancing competing individual and congressional interests 143 although subpoena or question clearly in furtherance of legislative purpose ordinarily carries dispositive weight the balance may shift to individual interests when the nexus between congress legitimate purpose and the challenged subpoena or question is vague or nonexistent144 in cases of such imprecision the governments assertion of the pertinence necessary for conviction of statutory contempt may become suspect145 the fourth amendment may also supply the basi s for witness to disregard congressional subpoena or question the amendment condemns unreasonable governmental searches and seizures 146 the supreme court in watkins confirmed that witness in congressional proceedings continued privilege against selfincrimination was frequently invoked and recognized as legal limit upon the authority of committee to require that witness answer its questions so early doubts as to the applicability of that privilege before legislative committee never matured when the matter reached this court the government did not challenge in any way that the fifth amendment protection was available to the witness and

what such protection entails147 in fact the courts have addressed only infrequently the circumstances under which the fourth amendment cabins the authority of congress to compel witnesses to produce papers or response to questions when dealing with the subpoenas of administra tive agencies the court noted sometime ago that the fourth amendment at the most guards agains t abuse only by way of too much indefiniteness or breadth in the things required to be particularly described if also the inquiry is one the demanding agency is authorized by law to make and the materials specified are relevant the gist of the protection is in the requirement expressed in terms that the disclosure sought shall not be unreasonable148 at the same time it pointed out that as in the case of grand jury inquiry probable cause is not prerequisite for reasonable subpoena149 in later years it explained that where grand jury subpoena is challenged on relevancy grounds the motion to quash must be denied unless the district court determines that there is reasonable possibility that the category of materials the government seeks will produce information relevant to the general subject of the grand jurys investigation150 the administrative subpoena standard has been cited on the those infrequent occasions when the validity of congressional subpoena has been challenged on fourth amendment grounds151 contempt convictions have been overturned however when fourth amendment violation taints the underlying subpoena or question152 perhaps most unsettled of all is the question the extent to which if any the separation of powers doctrine limits the subpoena power of congress over members and former members of the other branches of government as practical matter however the other branches of government ultimately control the prosecution and punishment for statutory contempt of congress at least under the current state of the law section 194 states that the united states attorney to whom 147 watkins

admi nistrators position that his investigativ function in searching out violations with view to securing enforcement of the act is essentially the same as the grand jurys or the courts in issuing other pretrial orders for discovery of evidence and is governed by the same limitations these are that he shall not act arbitrarily or in excess of his statutory authority but this does not mean that his inquiry must be limited by forecasts of the probable result of the investigation id at 216 internal quotation marks omitted see also united states v powell 379 us 48 57 1964 150 united states v r

by means of false or fraudulent pretenses the extent to which that phrase encompasses intangibles has not always been clear in spite of generous interpretation by many of the lower federal appellate courts that encompassed frustration of governmental functions in many forms the supreme court in mcnally declared that the mail fraud statute did not proscribe schemes to defraud the public of the honest and impartial services of its public employees or officials 204 lest mcnally be read to limit the mail and wire fraud statutes exclusively to tangible money or property the court explained in carpenter soon thereafter that the property of which the mail and wire fraud statutes speak includes recognized intangible property rights there it upheld application of the mail fraud statute to scheme to deny newspaper its prepublication property right to its confidential information 205 the court later confirmed that the wire fraud statute could be used against smuggling scheme that deprived governmental entity of its intangible right to collect tax revenues206 in the interim congress expanded the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes with the passage of 18 usc 1346 which defines the scheme to defraud element in the fraud statutes to include scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services section 1346 extends mail and wire fraud to prohibit the deprivation of their intangible right to honest services of both public and private officers and employees in the private realm it proscribes bribery kickbacks and various forms of selfdealing committed to the detriment of those to whom the offender owes fiduciary duty of some kind 207 in the public sector it condemns dishonesty in public officers and employees although the exact scope of that proscription remains largely undefined some courts have said that honest services fraud in th public sector typically occurs in either of two situations 1 bribery where public official was paid for particular decision or action or 2 failure to disclose conflict of interest resulting in personal gain 208 the bribery examples cause continued 2006 united states v reifler 446 f3d 65 96 2d cir

conflictofinterest provision may sweep and what atypical situations the honest services fraud prohibition may also reach if bribery cases turn on the search for the quid pro quo the other honest services fraud cases begin and in some cases end with the quid little more seems to be required than substantial benefit conferred upon public official and the inferences that flow from that fact209 although technically the crime is complete when scheme to defraud is accompanied by mailing or interstate wire communication the courts usually require that some other breach of law or duty attend the conveyance if for other reason than to confirm fraudulent intent the circuits apparently do not agree on the nature of the taint that must attend the official receipt of benefit particularly whether some breach of ethical or disclosure statutes must also be involved 210 while section 1346 protects governmental entities from the deprivation of the honest services of its officers and employees it does not protect government entities from the deprivation of other nonproperty benefits for example it does not protect them from outside fraud that obstructs the continued official accepts bribe or

ways that public official can steal his honest services from his public employer 1 the official can be influenced or otherwise improperly affected in the performance of his official duties or 2 the

the defendants expected the payments to benefit harwood an influential state legislator defendants say that there was direct evidence that such payments were for specific legislative act such as vote by harwood the government stipulated that harwood presumably because of his partners normal work for lincoln park had recused himself from voting on matters that might affect the company the government say defendants never proved that they sought to have harwood misuse his official power and thereby deprive the states citizens of his honest services it is common knowledge that powerful legislative leaders are not dependent on their own votes to make things happen the honest services that legislator owes to citizens fairly include the informal and behind the scenes influence on legislation there was adequate evidence if any was needed beyond the size of the payment that bucci and potter both believed harwood to be powerful and sawyer ii 239 f3d at 40 n8 forecloses any

officials for honest services mail fraud in contrast the government encourages us to adopt the first circuits test which the district court seemed to follow in crafting jennings jury instructions the first circuit has taken broader approach than the third circuit according to the first circu it the duty to disclose potential conflict can come not only from specific state disclosure laws but also

g346g348g561the test for materiality under section 1621 is whether the false statement has natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decisionmaking body to which it is addressed242 conviction under section 1621 requires not only that the defendant knew his statement was false which he does not believe to be true but that his false statement is willfully presented there is but scant authority on precisely what willful means in this context the supreme court in dicta has indicated that willful perjury consists of deliberate material falsification under oath243 other courts have referred to it as acting with an intent to deceive244 or as acting intentionally245 although contemporaneous correction of false statement may demonstrate the absence of the necessary willful intent to commit perjury the crime is completed when the false statement is presented to the tribunal without statutory bar or defense such as that found in section 1623 which outlaws perjury in purely judicial c ontext recantation is defense nor does it bar prosecution 246

usc 1622 the crime consists of two elements 1 an act of perjury committed by another 2 induced or procured by the defendant perjury under either section 1621 or 1623 will support conviction for subornation under section 1622 247 but proof of the commission of an act of perjury is necessary element of subornation248 although the authorities are exceptionally sparse it appears that to suborn one must know that the induced statement is false and that at least to suborn under section 1621 one must also knowingly and willfully induce 249 subornation is only infrequently prosecuted as such perhaps because of the ease with which it can now be prosecuted as an obstruction of justice continued not it itself be sufficient if believed to support conviction 242 united states v mckenna 327 f3d

prosecution need not prove that the defendant knew that his conduct involved matter within the jurisdiction of federal entity263 nor that he intended to defraud federal entity264 instead the phrase knowingly and willfully refers to the circumstances under which the defendant made his statement omitted fact he was obliged to disclose or included with his false documentation ie that the defendant knew that his statement was false when he made it or which amounts in law to the same thing consciously disregarded or averted his eyes from the likely falsity 265 prosecution for violation of section 1001 requires proof of materiality as does conviction for perjury and the standard is the same the statement must have natural tendency to influence or be capable of influencing the decisionmaking body to which it is addressed266 there is need to show that the decision maker was in fact diverted or influenced267 conviction for false statements or false documentation under section 1001 also requires that the statements or documentation be false that they not be true268 and the same can be said of the response to question that is so fundamentally ambiguous that the defendants answer cannot be said to be knowingly false269 on the other hand unlike the perjury provision of section 1623 continued within the jurisdiction of the federal government because neither lowe not its central
