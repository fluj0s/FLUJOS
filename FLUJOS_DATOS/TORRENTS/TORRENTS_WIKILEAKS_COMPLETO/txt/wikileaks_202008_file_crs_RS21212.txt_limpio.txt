disaster assistance ralph m chite specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division summary the us department of agriculture usda offers several permanently authorized programs to help farmers recover financially from natural disaster including federal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21212 crop insurance the noninsured assistance program nap and emergency disaster loans since 1988 congress has regularly made emergency financial assistance available to farmers and ranchers primarily in the form of crop disaster payments and livestock assistance the fy2007 iraq war supplemental appropriations act pl 11028 as amended is expected to provide an estimated 34 billion in emergency agricultural assistance for crop and livestock losses occurring in 2005 2006 or 2007 for which applications are still being accepted in order to provide regular supplement to crop insurance and nap payments the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill includes authorization and funding for crop disaster program for fy2008fy2011 the 2008 farm bill also authorizes three new livestock assistance programs and tree assistance program over the same period primarily in response to the recent midwest floods and other disasters the fy2008 supplemental appropriations act pl 110252 contains total of 480 million in emergency funding to eligible farmers to defray the cost of cleanup and rehabilitation of farmland and watersheds following disaster ongoing major usda disaster programs over the years usda has had at its disposal three major programs designed to help crop producers recover from the financial effects of natural disasters federal crop insurance noninsured assistance program nap payments and emergency disaster loans all three of these programs have permanent authorization and receive regular annual funding federal crop insurance the federal crop insurance program is administered by usdas risk management agency the program is designed to protect crop producers from unavoidable risks crs2 associated with adverse weather and weatherrelated plant diseases and insect infestations producer who chooses to purchase an insurance policy must do so by an administratively determined deadline date which varies by crop and usually coincides with the planting season crop insurance is available for most major crops the federal crop insurance program was instituted in the 1930s and was subject to major legislative reforms in 1980 and again in 1994 and 2000 the agriculture risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 pumped 82 billion in new federal spending over fiveyear period into the program primarily through more generous premium subsidies to help make the program more affordable to farmers and enhance farmer participation levels in an effort to preclude the need for adhoc emergency disaster payments since 2000 the federal subsidy to the crop insurance program has averaged about 33 billion per year up from an annual average of 11 billion in the 1990s and about 500 million in the 1980s nearly twothirds of the current federal spending is used to subsidize producer premiums and the balance primarily covers the government share of program losses and reimburses participating private insurance companies for their administrative and operating expenses in recent years program costs have been increasing steadily mainly because premium subsidies and company reimbursements are based on total httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21212 premiums and total premiums have been rising in tandem with farm commodity prices under the current crop insurance program producer who grows an insurable crop selects level of crop yield and price coverage and pays premium that increases as the levels of yield and price coverage rises however all eligible producers can receive catastrophic cat coverage without paying premium the premium for this portion of coverage is completely subsidized by the federal government under cat coverage participating producers can receive payment equal to 55 of the estimated market price of the commodity on crop losses in excess of 50 of normal yield or 5055 coverage although eligible producers do not have to pay premium for cat coverage they are required to pay upon enrollment 100 administrative fee per covered crop for each county where they grow the crop rising to 300 per crop per county in 2009 as required by the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 the fee can be waived by usda for financial hardship cases any producer who opts for cat coverage has the opportunity to purchase additional insurance coverage from private crop insurance company for an additional premium paid by the producer and partially subsidized by the government producer can increase the 5055 catastrophic coverage to any equivalent level of coverage between 50100 and 85100 ie 85 of yield and 100 of the estimated market price in increments of 5 for many insurable commodities an eligible producer can purchase revenue insurance under such policy farmer potentially can receive an indemnity payment when actual farm revenue falls below the target level of revenue regardless of whether the shortfall in revenue was caused by poor production or low farm commodity prices insured producers also can be eligible for reduced coverage if they are late or prevented from planting because of flooding for more information on the federal crop insurance program see crs report rl34207 crop insurance and disaster assistance in the 2008 farm bill noninsured assistance program nap producers who grow crop that is currently ineligible for crop insurance may be eligible for direct payment under usdas noninsured assistance program nap nap crs3 has permanent authority under the federal crop insurance reform act of 1994 pl 103 354 as amended and is administered by usdas farm service agency the programs principal clientele are farmers who grow crop that is ineligible for federal crop insurance nap is not subject to annual appropriations instead it receives such sums as are necessary through usdas commodity credit corporation which has line of credit with the us treasury to fund an array of farm programs eligible crops under nap include any commercial crops grown for food or fiber that are ineligible for crop insurance and include mushrooms floriculture ornamental nursery christmas tree crops turfgrass sod aquaculture and ginseng trees grown for wood paper or pulp products are not eligible to be eligible for nap payment producer first must apply for coverage under the program by the application closing date which varies by crop but is generally about thirty days prior to the final planting date for an annual crop like catastrophic crop insurance nap applicants must also pay 100 per crop service fee at the time of application rising to 250 in 2009 as required by the 2008 farm bill in order to receive nap payment producer must experience at least 50 crop loss caused by natural disaster or be prevented from planting more than 35 of intended crop acreage for any losses in excess of the minimum loss threshold httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21212 producer can receive 55 of the average market price for the covered commodity hence nap is similar to catastrophic crop insurance coverage in that it pays 55 of the market price for losses in excess of 50 of normal historic production producer of noninsured crop is subject to payment limit of 100000 per person and is ineligible for payment if the producers qualifying gross revenues exceed 2 million nap payments were 110 million in fy2005 66 million in fy2006 and an estimated 154 million in fy2007 emergency disaster loans when county has been declared disaster area by either the president or the secretary of agriculture agricultural producers in that county may become eligible for lowinterest emergency disaster em loans available through usdas farm service agency producers in counties that are contiguous to county with disaster designation also become eligible for an em loan em loan funds may be used to help eligible farmers ranchers and aquaculture producers recover from production losses when the producer suffers significant loss of an annual crop or from physical losses such as repairing or replacing damaged or destroyed structures or equipment or for the replanting of permanent crops such as orchards qualified applicant can then borrow up to 100 of actual production or physical losses not to exceed 500000 at belowmarket interest rate which is currently 375 once county is declared eligible an individual producer within the county or contiguous county must also meet the following requirements for an em loan producer must 1 be family farmer and citizen or permanent resident of the us 2 experience crop loss of more than 30 or physical loss of livestock livestock products real estate or property and 3 be unable to obtain credit from commercial lender but still show the potential to repay the loan applications must be received within eight months of the countys disaster designation date loans for nonreal estate purposes generally must be repaid within one to seven years loans for physical losses to real estate have terms up to 20 years depending on the repayment ability of the producer crs4 and other circumstances these terms can be extended to 20 years for nonreal estate losses and up to 40 years for real estate losses the em loan program is permanently authorized by title iii of the consolidated farm and rural development act pl 87128 as amended and is subject to annual appropriations traditionally an appropriation was made for em loans within the regular agriculture appropriations bill however most of the funding for the program in recent years has been provided through emergency supplemental appropriations emergency provisions in the consolidated appropriations act of 2000 pl 106113 provided funding to make 547 million in em loans over multiyear period total em loans made were 90 million in fy2001 58 million in fy2002 just under 100 million in fy2003 30 million in fy2004 23 million in fy2005 51 million in fy2006 and 75 million in fy2007 disaster assistance in the 2008 farm bill during the congressional debate on the omnibus farm bill some policymakers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21212 wanted to make permanent in the farm bill some level of disaster payments to supplement the crop insurance program consequently title xv of the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill authorizes new 38 billion trust fund to cover the cost of making agricultural disaster assistance available on an ongoing basis over the next four years fy2008fy2011 through five new programs supplemental crop revenue assistance program the largest of the new farm disaster assistance programs authorized through the 2008 farm bill is supplemental revenue assistance payment program for crop producers the program is designed to compensate eligible producers for portion of crop losses that are not eligible for an indemnity payment under the crop insurance program ie the portion of losses that is part of the deductible on the policy an eligible producer can receive payment equal to 60 of the difference between target level of revenue and the actual total farm revenue for the entire farm the target level of revenue will be based on the level of crop insurance coverage selected by the farmer thus increasing if farmer opts for higher levels of coverage to be eligible for payment producer must be in or contiguous to county that has been declared disaster area by either the president or the secretary of agriculture payments are limited so that the disaster program guarantee level cannot exceed 90 of what income likely would have been in the absence of natural disaster1 the producer also must have at least the minimum level of crop insurance cat coverage for insurable crops and participate in the nap program for noninsurable crops the statute makes an exception for the 2008 crop year by allowing producers who did not purchase crop insurance or nap coverage in advance to be eligible for the program as long as they pay the equivalent administrative fee for coverage within 90 days of enactment final payments for 2008 crop losses cannot be determined until late 2009 since portion of the disaster payment formula is based on the national average market 1 for more detailed description of the authorized payment formula see the full page text box in crs report rl34207 crop insurance and disaster assistance in the 2008 farm bill crs5 price of the commodity which is determined at the end of the marketing year for example the 2008 marketing year for corn and soybeans ends september 30 2009 other farm bill disaster programs in addition to the supplemental crop revenue assistance payment program described above the 2008 farm bill also authorizes and funds four smaller disaster programs through fy2011 1 livestock indemnity payments which compensate ranchers at rate of 75 of market value for livestock mortality caused by disaster 2 livestock forage disaster program to assist ranchers who graze livestock on droughtaffected pastureland or grazing land 3 emergency assistance for livestock honey bess and farm raised fish which will provide up to 50 million to compensate these producers for disaster losses not covered under other disaster programs and 4 tree assistance program for orchardists and nursery growers who can receive payment to cover 70 of the cost of replanting trees or nursery stock following disaster up to 100000 per year per producer emergency supplemental farm disaster assistance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21212 in virtually every crop year between 1988 and 2007 congress has provided ad hoc disaster assistance to farmers and ranchers with significant weatherrelated production losses adhoc assistance has been made available primarily through emergency supplemental appropriations to wide array of usda programs2 2008 supplemental assistance primarily in response to the 2008 midwest floods the fy2008 supplemental appropriations act pl 110252 contains total of nearly 480 million in emergency funding to eligible farmers to defray the cost of cleanup and rehabilitation of farmland and watersheds following disaster of the total amount available 894 million is for the emergency conservation program which assists farmers in the cleanup and restoration of farmland damaged by natural disaster and 3905 million is for emergency watershed protection program which is designed to relieve imminent hazards created by natural disasters and to alleviate future flood risk emergency supplemental disaster assistance has been authorized for 2008 crop and livestock losses since new programs were authorized and funded through the 2008 farm bill as described above 20052007 supplemental assistance title ix of the fy2007 iraq war supplemental appropriations act pl
