families below certain income levels are allowed credit against their federal income tax of 1000 for each qualifying child to qualify for the credit the child must be an individual for whom the taxpayer can claim pendency exemption that means the child must be the daughter grandson granddaughter stepson stepdaughter or an eligible foster child of the taxpayer the child must be under the age of 17 at the close of the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins the child tax credit may be refundable under certain conditions which are different for families with different numbers of children 1 families with one or two qualifying children may receive refund of up to 15 of the taxpayers earned income in excess of 8500 for example household with income of 15000 would be eligible for 975 refundable tax credit2 the earned income threshold amount of 8500 is an exception authorized for single year by the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 in its absence the threshold would have been 12050 in 20083 the threshold will increase further in 2009 due to indexation upon expiration of recent tax cuts in 2010 according to current law families with one or two children will not be eligible for refundable portion of the credit families with three or more children may qualify for more generous refund of the credit for them the refundable credit amount is capped by the larger of the two amounts 1 the excess of taxpayers social security taxes over earned income tax credit or 2 the amount by which 15 of their earned income exceeds 8500 in 2008 the child tax credit is phased out for taxpayers whose adjusted gross incomes agis exceed certain thresholds for married taxpayers filing joint returns the phaseout range begins at modified agi of 110000 for married couples filing separately at 55000 and for single or head of household filers the phaseout begins at an agi of 75000 these phaseout thresholds are not indexed for inflation agi used in this calculation is modified from agi reported on the tax return by adding back certain items the child tax credit is phased out by 50 for each 1000 or fraction thereof by which the taxpayers agi exceeds the threshold amounts the upper end of the phaseout range depends on the number of qualified children and the amount of the credit authorized by law in given year generally it takes 20000 of modified agi above the threshold to completely phaseout 1000 of credit currently the child tax credit is allowed in full against taxpayers alternative minimum tax amt 1 refundable tax credit means that the taxpayer receives the tax credit in the form of refund from the treasury even if he or she does not have an income tax liability 2 the calculation is 15 of 6500 which is the difference between income of 15000 and the threshold of 8500 3 if eesa had not been enacted the earlier example would change and the calculation would be 15 of 2950 which is the difference between 15000 and the threshold of 12050 thus the refundable tax credit amount would have been 44250 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34715g22g145g142g561g5g145g146g149g141g561g22g138 g161g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561 g561

child tax credit to address concerns that the tax structure did not adequately reflect familys reduced ability to pay taxes as family size increased the decline in the real value of the personal exemption by more than onethird over the prior 50 years was cited as evidence of the tax systems failure to reflect familys ability to pay congress acted so that the child tax credit would reduce familys tax liabilities would better recognize the financial responsibilities of child rearing and would promote family values 4 the idea of providing the credit enjoyed broad support across the political spectrum but specifics varied among policymakers the final shape of the measure evolved during conference negotiations as compromise among several competing proposals for example going into the conference the house senate and presidents versions varied in the amounts of the credit general structure of the measure phasein time line income limitations for highincome taxpayers etc 5 in addition the credit was part of broader tax reduction package that had to meet budget rules one of the results of this compromise was limitation of the age of child eligible for the credit to less than 17 years old this age limit is different from other tax provisions for families with children such as dependency exemption or earned income tax credit6 initially for tax year 1998 families with qualifying children under the age of 17 were allowed credit against their federal income tax of 400 for each qualifying child for tax years after 1998 the credit increased to 500 per qualifying child for families with three or more children the child tax credit was refundable the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act of 1998 pl 105 277 allowed the child tax credit as well as other personal tax credits to offset an individuals regular income tax in full for tax year 1998 even though the personal tax credits might be larger than the amount by which the taxpayers regular income tax exceeded his amt7 the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 106170 extended through december 31 2001 the provision allowing individuals to offset their regular income tax by the full amount of their personal tax credits regardless of their amt liability the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 made several major changes to the child tax credit first the child tax credit was scheduled to gradually increase to 1000 over the 2001 to 2010 period table 1 shows the actual values for the child tax credit under

amounts the change applied to 2004 and later tax years but was subject to the egtrra expiration clause in october 2008 congress passed the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110 343 which was signed into law on october 3 2008 under section 501 of the law the earned income threshold used in calculating the refundable portion of the credit is reduced to 8500 from 12050 for 2008 the change is effective for single tax year beginning after december 31 2007 the estimated cost of the proposal is 3129 billion over 10 years 8 the inflation adjustment would not apply to this lower threshold amount in 2009 barring congressional action the threshold would revert back to the higher amount exceeding 120009 g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 three main issues have dominated recent policy discussions about the child tax credit 1 the refundability limits on lowincome families 2 the expiration at the end of 2010 of the egtrra expansion of and increases to the child tax credit and 3 concern over the effects of tax cuts on the budget deficit jgtrra accelerated to tax years 2003 and 2004 the scheduled increase in the child tax credit from 600 to 1000 however it did not accelerate the increase in the refundability of the child tax credit scheduled to take effect in 2005 in 2005 the child tax credit was scheduled to be refundable to the extent of 15 of taxpayers earned income in excess of specified threshold as result many lowincome families did not benefit from the jgtrra increase in the amount of the child tax credit for example in 2003 family filing joint return with one qualifying child and earned income of 16500 would not owe federal income taxes they would however have received refund of 600 for the child tax credit the 600 refund would have been the same as under prior law 10 of the excess of 16500 earned income over the 10500 threshold hence even though the 2003 act increased the child tax credit to 1000 this family saw increase in their refundable child credit compared to prior law if the refundability of the child tax credit had been accelerated to 15 then this family would have received refundable child tax credit of 900 in tax year 2003 15 of the excess of 16500 earned income over the 10500 threshold the fact that jgtrra did not increase the refundability of the child tax credit caused some controversy in congress 10 although additional legislation accelerating the increase in refundability was contained in bills passed in 2003 by both the house and the senate it was not enacted into law congress addressed this issue again in 2004 and with the passage of the wftra increased refundability to 15 effective in 2004 8 us congress joint committee on taxation jcx7808 estimated budget effects of the tax provisions

eligibility for the refundable portion of the child tax credit families with income below the earned income threshold 8500 in 2008 or over 12000 thereafter receive tax benefits from the refundable child tax credit in fact some lowincome families may lose their eligibility for the refundable portion if their income does not keep up with inflation it happens because the threshold is the only parameter of the credit formula indexed for inflation and increases each year with the exception of 2008 in nominal terms the desire to increase the amount and availability of the refundable child credit for lower income households led to change enacted under the emergency economic stabilization act of 200811 by changing the parameters of the formula used in calculating the refundable child tax credit the law made families with earned incomes between 8500 and 12050 eligible for refunds in addition the amounts of the refund increased for many of those previously eligible by up to 53250 equal to 15 of the difference between the old 12050 and the new 8500 thresholds the second policy issue facing congress concerns the sunset provisions of egtrra and the child tax credit all the tax provisions in egtrra are to sunset revert to prior law levels after 2010 this means that absent legislative action in 2011 the child tax credit will fall to 500 per qualifying child the credit will longer be refundable for families with fewer than three children and the child tax credit will not be allowed in full against taxpayers amt finally counterweight to the congressional desire to provide continued tax relief to families is congressional concern over the current and projected size of the federal budget deficit the revenue costs associated with extending the child tax credit changes beyond 2010 would cost 2609 billion over fy2009fy2018 or about 37 billion year 12 g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 economic theory does not provide an answer to the question of how the costs of child rearing should be accounted for under an income tax proponents of an increased child tax credit argue that the current credit is not large enough to offset the costs of raising child in this view children should be considered an investment in the future and as such the costs associated with child rearing should be deducted as are other inve stment costs critics argue however that it was never intended that the federal income tax provide offsets for the full financial responsibility of raising children indeed some even argue that the decision to have children represents choice of how to consume ones income and therefore the costs of raising children should not be consideration when assessing income taxes historically the federal income tax has differentiated among families of different size through the combined use of personal exemptions dependent care credits standard deductions and the 11 us congress house of representatives renewable energy and job creation act of 2008

that families of differing size would not be subject to federal income tax if their incomes fell below the poverty level13 the child tax credit represents departure from past policy practices because it is not designed primarily as means of differentiating between families of different size at or near the poverty threshold but rather is designed to provide general tax reductions to taxpayers with dependent children under the age of 17 including middle and upper income households on occasion congress has debated the merits of increasing the agi phase out limits on the child tax credit increasing the agi phaseout limits for the child tax credit would significantly expand the tax benefits of the child tax credit and provide tax reductions to much higherincome families than the original 1997 legislation the empirical evidence suggests that for most families with children the overall federal tax burden as well as federal individual income tax burden fell between 1979 and 200514 egtrra and subsequent legislation with their reductions in marginal income tax rates reductions in taxes on capital gainsdividend income and marriage penalty tax relief continued the trend of reducing federal taxes on families on the other hand increasing the refundability percentage from 10 to 15 of earned income and the inclusion of combat pay for purposes of calculating refundability as mentioned above provided only modest tax benefits to taxpayers at the bottom of the income spectrum enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 expanded eligibility for the refundable tax credit for some lowerincome families but this change is effective only for single year without further congressional action the earned income threshold will increase to over 12000 in 2009 from 8500 in 2008 as result some lowerincome families may lose their eligibility for the refundable credit in addition even in 2008 families with earned income below the threshold 8500 do not qualify for refund finally differences in age limits used to define children eligible for the credit and other tax benefits cause some confusion the child tax credit has cutoff once child reaches age 17 which is lower than cutoff age for many other tax benefits for families with children for example taxpayers may claim an exemption for dependent child up to the age of 18 or 23 if fulltime student an example of recent confusion involved the qualification rules for the additional 300 per child payment under the economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110185 which pi ggybacked on those for the child tax credit rather than on the dependency exemption eligibility rules as result certain taxpayers who may have expected stimulus payment to include their children did not receive that additional amount 13
