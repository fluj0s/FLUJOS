specialist in resources and environmental policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32384epas proposed policy on wastewater blending background and issues summary in november 2003 the environmental protection agency epa proposed policy concerning wastewater treatment practice called blending the policy was intended to clarify when the practice can be allowed and still adhere to clean water act regulations and requirements some cities use blending to manage peak flows of water and waste into wastewater treatment plants during and after storms as way to prevent conditions that otherwise result in raw sewage backups into homes and other buildings or overflows into nearby waters blending involves routing excess wastewater around the plants biological treatment pro cesses and recombining this excess flow with fully treated wastewater before discharging it to stream or lake although blending has been standard engineering practice for several decades as way to manage peak stormwater flow s controversy exists about the practice both among stakeholder groups and also in ternally at epa where enforcement officials have challenged the practice nd in some cases opposed allowing cities to use it others at epa believe that with certain restrictions the practice is legal and environmentally protective controversies and uncer tainties led epa to announce on may 19 2005 that it will not finalize the policy that it proposed in 2003 this report provides background on blendi ng why and how it is practiced the proposed policy that epa now says it will not finalize associated issues and congressional interest in the topic it will be updated as warranted criticism of blending focuses on three c oncerns legality of the practice impacts on public health and the environment nd other policy issues number of groups and interests weighed in on all of these issues especially in comments on the november 2003 proposed policy environmen tal advocates say that the practice of blending is inconsistent with existing rules that prohibit intentional bypass of treatment facility these groups have also raised substantia l concern about public health and environmental imp acts from discharges of wast that contain pathogenic organisms many cities nd municipal organizations supported the epa policy and practice of blending saying that if cities are barred from blending they are forced to make costly infrastructure investments with limited benefit while number of states supported the epa policy others oppos ed it for reasons including concern that the policy would undermine incentives for cities to remedy the infrastructure problems that result in sewage overflows in congress these issues have dr awn some attention in january 2004 members with differing views wrote to ep to express concerns about the proposed policy house subcommittee held hearing on the topic in april 2005 legislation intended to bar epa from issuing blending rules or guidance has been introduced in the 109th congress hr 1126 also in acting on fy2006 appropriations for epa hr 2361 the h ouse adopted an amendment prohibiting epa from using funds to finalize or imp

agency epa issued proposed policy concerning wastewater trea tment practice called blending it is type of operational practice that is used to prevent conditions that result in sewage backups into homes and other buildings or overflows of untreated waste into nearby waters the proposal was intended to clar ify when the practice can be allowed and still adhere to clean water act regulations and requirements blending has been used for several decades to manage peak flows of water and waste into wastewater treatment plants during storms but it recently has become controversial the practice involves routing excess wast ewater from domestic commercial and industrial sources around the plants biologi cal treatment proce sses and recombining this excess flow with fully treated wastewater before discharging it to stream or lake see figure 1 on page 7 on may 19 2005 after reviewing nearly 100000 public comments on the proposal many fa voring it but many others opposing it epa announced that it would not fina lize the 2003 proposal and will continue to work on alternatives this report provides background on ble nding why and how it is practiced epas proposed policy associated issues and congressional inte rest in the topic controversy exists about whether th practice is lawful under water quality regulations whether it is harmful to human health or the environment and whether it is good from policy perspective s upporters of th proposed polic including many cities municipal organizations and some states say that if blending is restricted or prohibited cities w ill be forced to spend limited pub lic resources on costly water infrastructure improvements that are used infrequently such critics as environmental advocates and other states sa that blending allows trea tment plants to discharge wastewater that could contain harmful pathogenic microorganisms many critics also said that epas proposed policy would have allowed treatment plants to blend even when other more environmentally protective technological options are available key issue was whether the policy would have clarified epa regulations to allow the safe use of blending by cities as epa intended or would have fostered wider use of wastewater management practi ces that critics believe will harm public health and the environment the particular issues concerning ble nding also arise in the broader context of policymakers efforts to control pollution associated with wet weather discharges that happen only during and after major precipita tion events epa believes that these sources including combined sewer overfl ow discharges st ormwater separate sanitary sewer overflows nd nonpoint source runoff are the leading cause of waterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32384crs2 1 us environmental

rules specify maximum amounts of bod that wastewater treatment plants may discharge as measured by the oxygen consumed in st ated period of time usually five days bod5quality impairment in the united states1 the nations initial efforts to control water pollution focused on conventional point sour ces from municipal commercial and industrial wastewater tr eatment plants that are typically characterized by predictable flows and identifiable discharge points since the mid1980s policymakers have turned attention to other nontraditional wet weather po llution sources that are more difficult to control because the sources are numerous and geographically dispersed and waste flows are intermitte nt and largely unpredictable managing these diverse sources presents major policy and technological challenges background wastewater treatment processes in the united states wastewater is di scharged from sources such as homes or industrial plants and is transported via co llection systems consisting of sewers and pumping facilities to wastew ater treatment facility the wastewater components of major concern are organic and inorganic materials that will deplete the oxygen resources of the stream or lake to wh ich they are discharged those which may stimulate undesirable growth of plants or organics such as algae in the receiving water or those with potential undesirable aes thetic effects or dverse health effects on downstream water uses another impor tant wastewater treatment concern is removal of pathogenic bacteria nd viruses that can cause disease treatment plants generally work in two stages primary treatment mechanically separates the coarser solids from the water generally by screening and settling typically removing about 60 of solids and 35 of bod from the untreated waste2 the core element of wastewater trea tment called secondary treatment follows primary treatment it ty pically involves biological pro cesses the biologic process most often used today is the activated sludge process which utilizes microorganisms in an aerobic environment to remove ma jority of the primary pollutants found in wastewater the microorganisms bacteria and protozoa use the remaining nutrients and organic material in the wastewater as their food supply although secondary treatment may remove more than 85 of the remaining bod and suspended solids it fails to remove significant amounts of nitrogen phosphorus or heavy metals nor does it completely remove pathogenic bacteria and viruses if further treatment such as nutrient removal is required to meet water quality standards tertiary biologic or chemical treatment processes can be used following sec ondary or tertiary treatmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32384crs3 3 infiltration

effluent concentration limits for total suspended solids ss and bod5 percentage removal requirements for both ss and bod5 as well as limitation on ph for most types of potws the federal regulations establish 30day average percentage removal requirement of 85 for ss and bod5 the percent removal requirements were established to achieve two basic objectives according to epa 1 to encourage cities to correct excessive infiltration and inflow ii problems in their sanitary sewer systems3 and 2 to help prevent intentional dilution of influent wastewater as means of meeting permit limits4 epa regulations also define standard permit conditions to be included in all clean water act discharge permits one of those standard conditions addresses bypasses which are defined as the inte ntional diversion of waste streams from any portion of treatment facility 40 cfr 12241m under these rules bypass is prohibited unless it is unavoidable to prevent loss of life injury or severe property damage there are feasible alternatives such as use of auxiliary treatment or backup facilities or retention of untreated wastes and proper notice is provided to the appropriate permitting au thority the bypass cannot cause effluent limitations to be exceededhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32384crs4 5 combined sewer systems are remnants of the nations early infrastructure and are found in about 900 communities primarily in older c ities in the northeast great lakes region and the pacific northwest most combined sewer systems were constructed before 1900 when the necessity for separate wastewater treatment was not readily apparentwet weather pollution problems the collection system that conveys wastew ater to the treatment plant is key element of the overall wastewater infrastructure system collection systems are either combined sewer systems which are designed to carry domestic and industrial sanitary waste plus rainwater or separate sanitary sewer systems designed to collect only domestic and industr ial sanitary waste5 treatment plants and collection systems are designed to handle the flow s up to certain volumes under routine or predictable operating conditions more difficult challenge is that of managing flows that occur under peak flow conditi ons during what is referred to as wet weather events rainfall as well as snowmelt extreme wet weather events can introduce larger volumes of water and waste than the plant and collection system can adequately manage resulting in collection system overflows and backups of sewage into buildings and water quality problems from discharges of inadequately treated wa ste during storm events both combined and separate sewer systems can experien ce overflows when the capacity of sewer is exceeded as result of blockages bottlenecks andor undersized pipes the discharge of untreated or pa rtially treated sewage contai ns pathogenic organisms that represent health risk and also may contain toxic andor oxygendemanding pollutants infiltrationinflow of rainwater into sewers is believed to be the primary factor causing peak flows in sewers esp ecially separate sanitary sewers aging infrastructure and associated maintenance challenges can also lead to excess water in sanitary sewer systems high levels of ii that reach the treatment plant increase the hydraulic load on the plant which can reduce treatment efficiency exceed the capacity of components within the plant nd in extreme situations make biological treatment facilities i noperable treatment plant ope rators use combination of strategies to manage these peak flows including implementing operation and maintenance programs enlarging pipes adding or increasing storage capacity building additional treatment facilities or using alternative treatment techniques to move peak flows through the treatment operators of treatment plants and collection systems have long faced these challenges and for the last 15 years or s policymakers have b een addressing various wet weather pollution issues including deve loping strategies to reduce overflows and backups as well as establishi ng appropriate regulatory and enforcement policies by definition sewer overflows are unauthoriz ed discharge points that violate the clean water acts prohibition on discharges that are not in compliance with the limitations and conditions of discharge permit issued pursuant to the cwa nevertheless municipal officials and sanitary engineers say that it is practically impossible to design system that w ill never overflow even under the best of conditions engineers say natural disasters and even pipe failures will lead tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32384crs5 6 combined sewer systems are in fact designed to discharge excess wastewater directly into surface waters when the capacity of the sewe r system is exceeded during heavy rainfall or snowmelt in regulating csos the key concern is first to eliminate overflows during dry weather conditions and then to minimize impa cts of stormrelated discharges the issues involving ssos are somewhat different because separate sanitary sewers are not designed to overflow when storm sewer overflows oc cur they usually are from undesigned outfall points prohibiting and eliminating all ov erflows to the extent feasible is keyunavoidable releases of sewage howeve r chronic overflows result from inadequate system maintenance and deteriora tion not unavoidabl circumstances recognizing the view that sewer overflows are unavoidable at least to degree some permitting authorities have issued clean water act permits to potws allowing overflow discharges despite the statutory prohibition on discharges that do not meet secondary treatment requirements for exampl some permits authorize overflows when they are not feasible to avoid such as circumstances beyond the control of the system operator in rare cases other permits may allow discharges at specified locations when specific permit requirements are met such as meeting effluent limitations monitoring and reporting however in other cases state and federal enforcement officials have held to the view that overflow discharges are inconsistent with the clean water ac t and have brought actions against municipalities for overflows from combined and separate sewe rs thus raising questions about the clarity of epa regu lations and consiste ncy of enforcement administrative actions cso and sso policies in part because of perceptions of inc onsistent policy and rules in 1994 after lengthy consultations with stakeholder groups epa issued national strategy on controlling overflows from combined sewe rs csos designed to reduce cso discharges that often contain high levels of organic and toxic wastes it outlined conditions under which combined sewer syst ems that overflow as result of wet weather events may be authorized through permits or other enforceable mechanisms including requirement that systems dopt nine minimum controls and longterm control plans soon after issuance of the cso polic epa and group of stakeholders initiated discussions for development of similar national policy on controlling overflows from separate sanitary sewers ssos the discussions about an sso policy were based on certain principles desire to clar ify general prohibition on overflows to establish stringent but feas ible standards and re quire specific actions that would help eliminate avoidable overflows and to define circumstances for enforcement against unavoidable overflows6 epa officials nd stakeholders were unable to reach consensus on sso policy issues and eventually epa decided to move ahead with regulations to control sso discharges the clinton administration approved an sso rule proposal late in 2000 the proposal was not published in the federal register before inauguration day in january 2001 and the incoming bush administration suspended it for review ho wever it was widely circulated and was available to the public for some time on epas websitehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32384crs6 7 us environmental protection agency national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit requirements

conditions would look the same as figure 1 but would not show part of the flow being diverted around secondary treatment unitsafter several months of review in november 2001 ep officials announced the intention to propose the sso rule develope d by the clinton administration but with revised preamble language during the re view epa considered number of options including separate publica tion of noncontroversial part s of the clinton proposal chief among the controversies raised was whether epa would open discussion of alternatives to prohibiting ssos or would retain the policy detailed in the clinton rule calling for strict enforcement against any overflows regardless of fault it appears that these and other controversie s persist because as of may 2005 epa has not proposed or published an sso control regulation during the sso rule review epa sta ff also began working on draft guidance on other wet weather peak flow management issues that was nvisioned as separate from but related to the sso rule in december 2001 epa circulated among stakeholders draft guidance document addressing permit requirements and enforcement procedures applicable under ex isting rules to three specific wet weather situations one of the three addressed the use of alternative peak flow treatment schemes at the potw in contrast for exam ple to procedures governing discharges from emergency overflow structures cated outside the boundary of treatment plant practice generally referred to as blending the december 2001 draft was never formally proposed or finalized although it was circulated to states epa regional offices and multiple ot her stakeholders it volved into single proposal published by epa in november 2003 that focused only on blending7 what is blending blending is wastewater flow operati onal technique used by some treatment plants during and after storm events in order to manage high flows in the collection system at such times potw operator modifies the flow of wastewater through the treatment plant during blending primary treatment is provide d for all flows coming into the facility and seconda ry treatment is provided for flows up to the capacity of the secondary biological treatment units the latter typically are designed with less capacity than primary treatment units which can handle significant variations in flow and concentration of polluta nts while the microorganisms in biological units are more sensitive and can be negatively affected by such changes the excess flows are diverted around the secondary biological treatment units and then recombined or blended with flows that have been treat ed by the secondary units the blended effluent is usually disinfected prior to discharge to lake stream or coastal waterbody particularly if the discharg will affect bathing or fishing waters figure 1 illustrates the process8 sanitary engineers and municipal official s say that blending is necessary because if surges of excess flow from storm events enter the secondary treatment units theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32384crs7 figure 1 blending at sewage treatment facility during stormwill wash out the bacteria which comprise the biological processes used during secondary treatment these bacteria are ss tolerant of variations in flow volumes and strength ie more rainwater and more diluteless sewage than are systems used in primary treatment units if the bacteria are washed out it can take weeks or months for biological treatment unit to recover by regenerating the necessary microorganisms in the mean time excess pollutants may be discharged to the environment potw officials say that it is not possible to build treatment plants to capacity where they could treat 100 of all wastewater during peak flows because during the more common dry periods the biological component of the treatment process would essentia lly starve to death source crs as noted above potws have number of technological options for managing peak wet weather flows beyond the boundary of the facility ranging from correcting infiltration and inflow in order to reduce the hydraulic load in the sewer system to constructing equalizing basins or storage tanks to hold rainwater offline until flows can be routed to the treatment plant milwaukee and chicago for example have built elaborate undergr ound t unnel systems to temporarily hold peak flows some cities also are investigatin g or constructing new or i nnovative technologies one of these is highrate clarification process with rapid settling of solids from the waste which both provides some initial treatment and reduces the volume of waste material other technological options involve c onstructing secondarye quivalent treatment units based on physicalchemical not biologi cal processes which can be started up quickly and can sit idle between storm events depending on land availability some of these technologies may be used onsite at the potw others are utilized remotelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32384crs8 9 it is more problematic for these alternative technologies to achieve the percentage removal requirement of epas secondary treatment rules because wastes are more diluted in higher volume wet weather flows than in normal dry weather flows 10 association of metropolitan sewerage ag encies amsa wet weather survey final report may 2003 37 p available at

not cu rrently blend 24 58 said that blending would enable the potw to meet per mit limits all or majority of the time10 proponents of blending argue th at if blending is restri cted municipalities are forced to spend public resources to build struct ures with limited public benefit because of their infrequent use during occasional stor m events while epa has not estimated the national cost of providing sufficien t treatment to preclude blending it has estimated that the cost of correcting sanitary sewer overflow occurrences nationwide rough surrogate is 885 billion11 groups representing municipalities believe that the cost is likely to be higher perhaps from 200 to 300 billion epas blending policy blending has been standard engineerin g practice since the 1970s engineers say as way to manage peak flows during storm events to prevent conditions that result in backups into homes and other buildin gs or overflows of untreated waste into nearby waters neverthele ss controversy exists about the practice both among stakeholder groups and also between severa l of epas regional offices and some at epa headquarters epas office of wate r has generally supported the practice but the office of enforcement and compliance assistance oeca has challenged it officials in oeca have argued that w ithout certain restrictions the practice of blending is not enforceable with appr opriate restrictions they say permits authorizing blending are possible but crafting permits to do so is complex and confusing others in epa believe it is possible to write permits that lawfully allow for blending and the policy that epa proposed in november 2003 was intended to clarify how existing clean water act regulations and permit requirements apply to wet weather blending scenarios httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32384crs9 the proposed policy set forth six criteri for managing peak flows including blended discharges the final blended discharge must meet effluent limitations based on the secondary treatment regulation including applicable percentage removal requirements or any mo re stringent limits necessary to attain water quality standards the facilitys permit application must specify the treatment scenariothat would be used for peak flow management all flow must receive at least the equivalent of primary clarification peak flow treatment should be operated as designed and only be used when flows exceed the capacity of storage units and biological treatment units the facilitys discharge permit must require sufficient monitoring toensure compliance with applicable clean water act requirements the permit also must require that the permittees collection systembe properly operate d and maintained in addition the policy stated that wh ere physically possible and economically achievable blended effluent should not be discharged to sensitive receiving waters such as beaches public drinking water intake s waters with threatened or endangered species or designated outstanding nati onal resource waters and national marine sanctuaries epas proposed policy assumed that if blending is done under the limited terms of the policy the practice w ould be fully protective of human health and the environment issues with respect to blending criticism of blending encompasses three areas legality of the practice impacts on public health and the environmen t and other policy concerns as discussed below number of groups and interests have weighed in on these issues especially in comments on the november 2003 proposed policy environmental advocates oppose the prac tice on legal grounds and they and public health professionals have raised substantial cern based on public health and environmental issues proponents include many cities and municipal and local government organizations including the national league of cities national association of counties and association of metropolitan sewerage agencies amsa among states views differ several states s upported epas proposed policy others supported it with additional re strictions or clarifi cation such as barring blended discharges into impaired waters where water quality standards have not yet been attained and others opposed the prac tice based on variety of policy concerns in some instances individual cities comment ed in support of the policy but agencies of these cites home states opposed it fo r example the miamidade water and sewer department supported it while the water resour ces management division of floridas department of nvironmental protection opposed ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32384crs10 12 the clean water act allows epa to delega permitting responsibility to qualified states and epa has done so for 45 states and one territory epa issues permits in the remaining states and territories however even after delegation epa retains oversight to ensure that stateissued permits comply with the cwas requirements if epa objects in writing to permit the permit may not be issued 402d2legality the focus of legal concerns over ble nding rests on whether the practice is inconsistent with epas existing bypass regulation which prohibits intentional diversion of waste streams from any porti on of treatment facility and requires determination that feasible alternatives to the bypass exist including installation of adequate backup fac ilities 40 cfr 12241m critics argue that these provisions preclude blending and mandate that potws provide larger plant capacities including temporary storage so that all influent flows enter every treatment process unit since secondary treatment units are clearly part of the treatment unit according to this view ble nding violates the bypass rules prohibition of intentional diversion bypass is allowed under epa regulations when it is unavoidable but critics say that the propos ed blending policy would have allowed it as more routine practice in the november 2003 proposed policy and guidance epa interpreted the bypass rule to allow for blending that complies with the criteria spelled out in the policy pr oponents of blending argue that as long as the system is operated as designed and the planned operational reg ime is disclosed to the permitting authority it fully complies with the bypass regulation concern over the legality of blending is the basis of actions brought by epa enforcement officials in several regions especially region iii philadelphia region iv atlanta and region vi kansa s city challenging clean water act permits proposed by state permitting aut horities that would allow for blending12 these epa regions supported by states nd environmental advocates have declined to authorize blending in discharge permits because they believe the practice violates clean water act rules mandating that ll wastewater meet secondary treatment standards some other epa regions have not prohibited or limited blending in potw permits and have generally agreed with supporte rs of the practice that permits could under certain circumstances authoriz rerouting or recombination of waste without being considered bypass for example supporters say if analysis of feasible alternatives has been done nd permitting authorities have been notified blending does not constitute bypass in 2002 group of cities from pennsylvania tennessee and arkansas and amsa brought legal action against epa alleging that the prohibition on blending exercised by so epa regions is not evenly applied among its regional offices and is not s upported by any nationa l regulation the

largest area of disagreement about blending rests on the issue of public health and environmental imp acts supporters of the pr actice contend that so long as the ultimate discharge from potw complies

pathogens including b acteria parasites and viruses can be found in domestic sewage nd may cause both chronic nd acute illnesses ranging from cholera gastroenteritis infectious hepatitis and shigellosis to respiratory and skin infections outbreaks of waterborne diseases are associated both with exposures to contaminated drinking water supplies resulting from inadequate treatment disrupted

causing illness in veral thousand persons annually since 1989 the number of gastroenteritisrelated outbr eaks involving recreational waters has been gradually increasing13 the concern of public hea lth and environmental advocates about blending and other peak flow ma nagement issues is whether effluent containing pathogens is being adequa tely treated prior to discharge epas secondary treatment rules do not specifically limit pathogens while primary wastewater treatment processes ma remove about onehalf of the suspended solids and bod from raw wastewater these processes are not effective in removing microbial pollutants sec ondary treatment removes about 85 of the organic matter in sewage and is considerably more effective at removing microorganisms including up to 99 of viruses which ar known to cause significant percentage of all gastrointestinal illnesses and 99 of bacteria and parasites14 two canadian studies reported that primary wastewater treatment removes on average 76 and 27

with certain organic matter in the wastewater crea ting compounds such as trihalomethanes which are hazardous chemicals these di sinfection byproducts are carcinogenic and may increase risk of cancer to humans thus creating secondary set of health hazards supporters of blending respond to the arguments about public health impacts by acknowledging that primary tr eatment alone does not remove all pathogens but also by pointing to the paucity of data to actually link human health impacts to discharges of raw or partially treated sewage for example to understand the relative magnitude of major sources to wate r contamination project by the water environment research federation studied occurrence of the parasite cryptosporidium in two wisconsin watersheds and f ound that contributions of crypto oocysts from potw effluents were nearly insignificant compar ed with contributions from other sources especially wastes in uncontrolled runoff from farm lands and urbansuburban lands16 while supporters and critics disagree on number of issues they are in broad agreement on one point more monitoring nd investigation are needed to determine the frequency of sewer overflows and assess the number of people made ill from waterborne diseases related to such discharges data on the incidence of waterborne diseases in the united states and other impacts such as closing of beaches and shellfish beds frequently are unable to pinpoint the source or sources of contaminating agents both environm ental advocates and groups representing potw operators want more study of the possible health problems the latter saying that if there are only limited scientific studies documenting problem it is unwise for the nation to spend scarce public res ources to address it environmental advocates say that the lack of data linki ng wastewater discharges to waterborne illnesses does not mean that the connec tion does not exist the problem is in quantifying the health risk these questions were partly addre ssed in an august 2004 epa report to congress that was mandated by the wet weather water quality act of 2000 pl 106554 concerning human health and nvironmental impacts of

as critic s contended that the bypass of secondary treatment in blending s cenario may not adequately protect human health and that current monitoring stra tegies do not accurately assess the amount of harmful bacteria present in surface water after blending water quality criteria for bacteria i n t h federal register notice announcing the proposed blending policy epa said that it encourages states to adopt protective water quality criteria for bacteria in their water quality standards since standards based on sc ientifically sound methods are needed as indicators for determining the human health risk from pathogenic microorganisms in waste discharges18 the likelihood of states doing so voluntarily is uncertain however epa publishes water quality criteria which consist of scientific information on the concentrations of specific constituents in water which protect aquatic life or human health the issue concerning water quality criteria for bacteria stems from the fact that in the early years following actment of the 1972 clean water act epas recommended water quality crite ria were based on specific levels of fecal coliform to be used as the indicator organism to protect bathers from gastrointestinal illness in recreational waters and consequently most statea dopted water quality standards have been based on that indicator si nce the 1970s in 1986 epa recommended that states adopt criteria based on escherichia coli coli and enterococci to demonstrate the presence of fecal polluti on because newer epidemiological studies have found stronger correlation between swimmingassociated gastroenteritis and these organisms than with fecal coliform or other indicator organisms in the beaches environmental assessm ent and coastal health act of 2000 beach act pl 106284 congress require d the 30 coastal and great lakes states to adopt epas 1986 water qua lity criteria for pathogens by april 2004 as required by that law in july 2004 epa proposed federal water quality criteria for 20 states that missed the deadline for adopting more uptodate criteria for pathogens in their water quality standards at that time epa said that 16 states were in the process of adopting revised criteria wh ile four states had not moved forward on the criteria most of the 20 states had standards in place but epa did not think they were adequately protective of human health because they rely on fecal coliforms as the pathogen indicator rather than incorporating limits for coli however wastewater treatment officials and some in the scientific community have questioned use of the 1986 criteria document because it relies on data that are more than 20 years old epa acknowledges that problem and is workin g on additional epidemiological studies of pathogen

of epas november 2003 proposed policy including environmental advocates and number of states belie ve that the proposal would not have definitively restricted blending to wet weather events only some state officials for example said that allowing blending undermines the potws incentive for removing wet weather infiltration and inflow and otherwise improving the collection system19 these and other critics asserted that the policy would allow bypasses to become routine and would relieve treatment plant operators from analysis to determine if there are feasible alternatives to bypassblending according to these critics blending succeeds in meeting per mit discharge limits by virtue of dilution mixing not technological pollution control further blending in effect shifts the cost of treating wet weather flows to drinking water suppliers who become responsible for removing residual microorganisms or harmful disinfection byproducts that enter the water supply after discharge by the potw others recognize the need for potws to blend wastewater in certain temporary circumstances but say that it should not be used as longterm solution in order to avoid tr eating peak and base flows when treatment is feasible and can be done according to standard engineering practice yet while some were critical that the proposed policy would be too flexible others believed that it would be too restrictive some of these critics including municipal officials and san itary engineering professiona ls that support blending believed that the proposal contained numbe r of vague or excessively broad terms that needed to be further refined ch as what is generally accepted good engineering practice for design and operation of potw they also charged that the policy sought to restrict discharge of blended wastes into sensitive receiving waters and that it would have required the system operator to utilize all peak flow capacity of sewers and other storage devi ces before commencing blending these restrictions they say amount to epa dictating design nd operations of the treatment facility which is contrary to the clean water act they argued that ambiguities would allow different epa regions to interpret the policy differently resulting in inconsistencies much like those that epa had hoped to resolve by issuing the policy these critics urged epa to require that the policy be binding in all regions on the other hand number of commenters urged epa to do the opposite to clarify that the final policy as in the proposal would allow states and regions the option to not authorize potws to blend if that is their preference number of critics of epas proposal both those who oppose blending and others who favor it asserted that the policy represented more than just

letter f our house committee and subcommittee chairmen urged epa to issue the policy but said that the draft needed to clarify inconsistent regional enforcement as drafted the pr oposal would overstep fe deral authority and bypass the role of states in clean water decisionmaking the lawmakers said further they asserted that the proposal would tablish new backdoor regulatorytype requirements to be imposed at the discretion of the permitting authority that will lead to less not greater national consistency21 these members called for epa to revise the guidance to make clear that blending is an acceptable practice and to make sure that the policy is implemented in reasonable and consistent manner nationally at the same time bipartisan letter from 64 house members of the congressional coastal caucus criticized the draft policy as an environmental rollback that would endanger public health focusi ng on the concern that blending may lead to discharges of microbial pathogens into waterways

about the practice of blending and received testimony from number of munici pal officials who support blending and environmental advocates who discussed their opposition to it also legislation has been introduced that is intended to prohibit epa from issuing rules or guidance that would authorize blending unless necessary to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage hr 1126 congress took action on similar bill that was introduced at the end of the 108th congress hr 5421 further in approving legislation providing fy2006 appropriations for epa hr 2361 the house adopted an

the proposed po licy in november 2003 epa solicited public comments for 120day period comp iling docket with more than 98000 comments many observers had expected ep to issue final version of the policy in mid or late2004 but the agency did not do so issues that reportedly continued to be unresolved included whether the po licy would apply only to future cso settlements or also to past enforcement settlements if applied retroactively the guidance could force the reopening of co nsent decrees in number of cases and whether the guidance must require m unicipalities to conduc t

public comments and testimony presented to congress the agency had decided to w ithdraw the november 2003 proposal and not finalize the policy the announcement sa id that epa will continue to review alternatives ie revise d policy or perhaps rulemaking to develop the most feasible approaches to treating wastewater and protecting communities not surprisingly environmental advocat were pleased with
