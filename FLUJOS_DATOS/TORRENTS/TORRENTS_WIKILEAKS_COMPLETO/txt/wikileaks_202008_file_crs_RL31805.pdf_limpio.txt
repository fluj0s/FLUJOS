following day in both cases quickly nd with little debate on september 30 2003 the president signed the bill into law pl 10887 the fy2004 dod authorization act include d several contentious issues which were settled only after long negotiations on domestic preference restrictions in the buy american act and the berry ame ndment the dod authorization added provisions to assess the us defense industr ial base and the exte nt of us reliance on foreign suppliers but dropped proposals to require dod to purchase certain items only from american suppliers in the case of the tanker lease dod agreed to proposal by senator warner to lease 20 and buy 80 boeing kc767 tankers rather than lease 100 aircraft proposal less costly than the original lease but more costly than straight multiyear buy the fate of the deal remains uncertain in light of boeings recent firing of highlevel officials for improprieties and an ongoing investigation by the dod inspector general compromises were also brokered on ot her contentious issues on which the administration had threatened veto th administration agreed to new benefit that provides concurrent recei pt of military retirement and disability payments to all military retirees with disability ratings of 50 or higher as well as an expansion of those eligible under the purple hearts plus program enacted last year that provides benefits to military retirees with combat or combatrelated disabilities the administration also agreed to 15month pilot program to offer access to tricare to nondeployed reservists who are unemplo yed or do not qualify for health benefits offered by their employer httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31805crs2 hr 1588 also authorizes the secretary of defense to develop new national security personnel system for dods civilian employees gives dod special exemptions to certain environmental statutes and lifts the current ban on development of lowyield nuclear weapons both the house and senate versions of hr 1588 the authorization bill provide 4005 billion for national defense programs about 15 billion above the request of 3997 billion that the administration submitte d in february the authorization covers not only defense prog rams funded in the defense appropriations bill but also programs funded in the milita ry construction energy nd water and some other appropriations measures the fy2004 dod appropriations bill provi des total of 3687 billion for the defense programs it covers 500 million less than the 3692 billion that was included in both the house and senate ve rsions the total in the conference agreement is slightly below the am ounts provided for defense by the budget committees under section 302b allocations of the congressional budget act and 31 billion below the request this decr ease freed up the same amount for other appropriations bills while staying within the cap on discretionary spending established by the fy2004 budget resoluti on hconres 95 final funding for dod

considered by th senate until january 2004 the final version of dods fy2004 appr opriations cushioned the programmatic impact of the 35 billion cut to the request by making an offsetting rescission of 36 billion from the 626 billion in fy2003 supplem ental appropriations that congress approved in april under budget scoring ru rescissions are counted as credit in the year when they are enacted even

circumstances6 this years debate focused on the exte nt of dods waiver authorities in terms of both the criteria and the items that c ould be covered the administration sought to widen circumstances permitting waivers whereas the house would have either required domestic purchase of additional items such as machine tools or made it more difficult for the secretary of fense to waive current restrictions7 f r example the house bill required dod to identify and then buy from us sources items considered to be critical to the us defense industrial ba as well as assess the extent of us dependence on foreign suppliers the house version also would have prohibited dod from purchasing from foreign countries who had restricted sales of military goods or services because of us operations in iraq provision that could have affected both france and germany the secretary of defense had signaled that the administration would veto the bill if the house provisions were included concerned about the effects of these provisions on us trade relations senator warner requested the state department the us trade representative and omb to address the potential effects of the legislation on trade relationships nd cooperative defens relationships8 reflecting compromise between the hous desire to expand protections for the defense industrial base and senates concerns bout potential effects on us trade relations the conference version dr opped the new restric tions on certain items but required dod to assess potential us vulnerabilities to meet senate and administration concerns bout potential effects on us trade relations the conference bill stated that none of the provisi ons in this industria l base section would apply if the secretary of defense and secretary of state determine that us international agreements would be violated9 to get better understanding of the extent of dod dependence on foreign sources or single domestic sources fo r critical items or components of military systems the defense department is to develop military system essential item breakout list nd identify where these items or components are produced dod is to contract for study that will define the criteria for critical and recommend items to be included on the list to give additional support to domes tic producers of critical items the conference agreement establishes new

section 812 requires dod to contract with federally funded rd center to assess the criteria and the items on the military essential listanother new industrial base tool for dod is authority to give preference in source selection to domestic producers of machine t ools or other capital assets used to make defense goods the bill also requires st udy of the adequacy of us producers in meeting defense needs for beryllium industrial base10 to protect us trade relationships th conference agreement also softened the houses proposed prohibition on buying from countries who opposed us actions in iraq instead the secretary of defense in coordination with the secretary of state is to identify foreign countries who now restrict military sales to the united states because of us c ounterterrori sm or military operations that list can be revised periodically even for those countries dod can purchase goods if the department has compelling and urgent need for the item11 congress agreed to broaden waivers to berry amendment restrictions on purchases of food clothing and similar items from combat operations only to in clude contingency ope rations as well this issue is likely to resurface in th next year or two by february 2005 dod is required to complete an interim re port that assesses which items are deemed essential and the extent of us dependence on foreign sources for those items at that point the debate could revolve around whether additional protections or incentives should be provided to domestic producers of those items12 concurrent receipt adopted until recently the

the precedents for other benefit programs military retirees now must reduce their military retirement on dollarfordollar basis if they wish to recei ve taxexempt disability payments type of offset that is required in many benefit programs the conference bill provides new benefits to military retirees with twenty or more years of service and disability ratings of 50 or higher the conference bill also expands those who would be eligible for special compensa tion under the purple hearts plus program enacted last year for those whose disabilities are due to combat or combatrelated activities the conference version was reached when the senate dropped its proposal for full concurrent r eceipt and the administration dropped its veto threat in response to administra tion concerns the house had not included concurrent receipt in its version of th bill even though support among members was widespreadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31805crs7 13 see section 641 of hr 1588 as enacted and hrept 108354 p

cost of their personneleligibility criteria and phasein of benefit over 200000 military retirees are likely to qualify for the new c oncurrent receipt including military retirees with 20 years of service if they have disability ratings of 50 or above have any disability ratings as long as they meet the criteria for combatrelated disability popularly known as purple hearts plus are guard and reserve retirees w ho meet the criteria under purple hearts plus if they have 20 or more years of creditable service defined as 50 points for performing their annual reserve duties and are disability retirees whose pa yments exceed their retirement benefits had they retired under regular retirement the first phase of the new benefits are sl ated to go into effect on january 1 2004 with full concurrent receipt for those eligible by december 31 201313 in the first year monthly benefits for those eligible will be 100 for those with 50 disability rating 125 for those with 60 disability rating 250 for those with 70 disability rating 350 for those with an 80 disability rating 500 for those with 90 disability rating and 750 for those with an 100 disability rating in the following year those eligible would receive 10 of the difference between the benefit for the previous year and the lesser of their monthly retirem ent benefit or their monthly disability payment in each succeeding year retirees will receive an additional 10 of that difference until th retiree receives the full amount of both disability payments and retirement benefits cost of new benefit cbo estimates that the new benefit would cost 800 million in fy2004 and 221 billion over ten years in outlays for current beneficiaries the annual cost would increase steadily to 2 billion by fy2008 and 35 billion by 201314 although dod does not need to include funds in its budget to cover the costs because the legislati on creates new entitlement program the deficit would increase by annual ou tlays for current beneficiaries unlike current military retirement h r 1588 does not require that dod provide funds to cover the accrual cost of the new benefit for todays military personnel practice designed to capture fully the cost of military personnel this means that general revenues would cover this cost rather than the defense department because dod would not need to budget for this cost15

buy an additional 80 aircraft as proposed by the senate armed servic committee chairman warner in early september17 signing of the contract has been held up because of questions of impropriety by two

force pay for the aircraft when ordered rather than delaying payment by three years when the aircraft are delivered the air force has not identified how to fund the tanker within its current budget plans which di d not anticipate the tanker lease this proposal has been controversial because leases are substantially more expensive than buying the air force cbo crs and gao all found that the lease would cost 5 billion to more than 6 billion more than multiyear buy of the aircraft because the air for ce planned to rely on special purpose entity to finance the deal and because congressional

fairness to involve employees supervisors and managers in the design evaluation and training for the new system to include an equitable method for appraising and compensating employees in the

on position responsibilitie s and types of work sets up performance rating system with rating periods and feedback process includes scoring system that is tied to salary changes and reviewprocess that addresses those failing to meet performance goals and links individual performance factors to agencys goals and ensures scoring comparability although this conference report language is not binding it signals legislative intent33 in hearings dod policy makers stated that it intended to design system like the pay banding system used by dods laboratories fo r the past twenty years the labs are however exempt from the new system until 2008 and beyond that unless the new system gives them greater flexibility34 details about the ne w personnel system are likely to emerge in the next year35 new

changes and 30 days of notification to congress of disputed areas to resolve differences either dod or employee representatives can request help from the federal mediation and conciliation service the new law provides for review of the proposed new system by an unspecified independent third party the authority of this new labormanagement process appears to be broad because its decisions can supercede all other collective bargaining agreements in the department if the secretary of defense desires italics added38 unless renewed however this new pr ocess would only be in effect for sixyear period this new system would also not be subject to the collective bargaining procedures and deadlines th at apply to other federal agencies39 dod could also continue to bargain with employee unions and follow the statutory procedures and deadlines for co llective bargaining affecting all other government agencies40 in another major change hr 1588 gives dod new authority to bargain at the national rather than the local level and makes those decisions binding on all levels some cr itics have raised cerns about how local circumstances will be taken into account in national decisions these decisions could also be reviewed by an unspecified third party hr 1588 appears to endorse two pa rallel systems of labormanagement relations one new collaborative system and the other traditional collective bargaining system as defined in current st atute the legislation does not specify what types of issues would be covered or how responsib ilities will be divided between these two systems to the extent that the two systems overlap the law gives precedence to the new system the new w appears to adopt similar approach in the case of appeals process for employee gr ievances

military personnel as an additional workforce management tool th law allows dod to give separation incentives of 25000 to up to 25000 civilian employees annually for early retirement42 the budgetary implications of the new sy stem are not obvious it is also not clear whether these provisions would significantly limit dods current plans to transfer substantial numbe rs of military jobs to ci

that dod needed additional authority to consider military training requirements as well as wild life protection in managing land on dod installations for that reason the new w permits dod to substitute an integrated natural resources management plan inr mp required under the sikes act for designation of lands as cr itical habitat under the endangered species act as way to protect

species may be weakened with this change under the sikes act the inrmp whic h guides the conservation protection and management of fish and wildlife resources is prepared by the secretary of the military department in cooperation with the us fish and wildlife service the use of military installations to ensure the pr eparedness of the armed forces or military readiness however takes

activities choice that creat ed concern among environmental groups because of the potential precedent for other exemptions other environmental interests opposed amending title 10 because doing so may give the secretary of defense rather than the secretary of interior the primary role in determining whether integrated management plans provide adequate protection according to the senate armed services committee portions of about 150 dod bases could be designated as cr itical habitat were this exception not permitted50 the conference report suggests that the new language will provide balance between military training requirements and protection of endangered or threatened species51 congressional action on the mari ne mammal protection act the conference agreement adopts two of the ad ministrations proposed changes to the marine mammal protection act including new twoyear exemption authority and new definition of harassment debate about the implications of both of these changes was heated new exemption authority under new provision the secretary of defense after consulting with the secretary of commerce and the secretary of the interior could exempt any action or cat egory of actions from compliance with the marine mammal protection act for two years if the secretary determines it is necessary for national defense52 at his discretion and af ter consultation with the commerce and interior departments the secretary of defense could renew such exemptions for additional twoyear periods the conference report suggested that this national security exemption parallels that included in other environmental laws while environmental interests argued that national defense exemption is broader than that provided in other statutes53 dod has not in fact used existing

the conference agreement also adopted the administration proposal to use narrower defin itions of harassment of marine mammals for dods military read iness and scientif ic activities of federal agencies than are applied to other agencies under current law the standard requires that activities be prohibited if they would have potential to injure or disturb marine mammals55 the new language defines dods ac tivities as harassment only if an act injures or has the significant potential to injure or disturbs the activities of marine mammals by disrupting natural behavior patternsto point where those patterns are abandoned or significantly altered italics added56 to limit the application of the exemption the act defines readiness as training combat operations and testing the definiti on that was included in the fy2003 dod authorization dod had asked to broade n the application to include support activities57 in reaction to recent court case that limited dods deployment of the low frequency surtass sonar because of the potential impact on marine mammals the fy2004 dod authorization exempts dod from complying with current standards for evaluating the impact on marine ma mmals based on specified geographical regions or the small numbers dod contended that these standards were inappropriate for marine mammals that migrate over broad expanses of the ocean and that using negligible impact standard would be more scientific way to make decisions rather than on the basis of the number of mammals affected58 other changes and future actions congress also made other changes requested by the administration including allowing dod purchase credits from mitigation bank to offset those lost on dod installations and exempting dods restoration advisory boards from issuing financial disclosure statements and from providing notice of their activities in the federal register59 these boards are the primary avenue through which local co mmunities learn about cleanup decisions on military lands the issue of when and where to carve out exemptions from environmental statutes for dod can be exp ected to resurface next year as the administration continues its efforts

that benefits for military retirees with disabilities will be expanded scoring differences between c ongress and the administration cbo scored the cost of dods reque st as 4005 billion 800 million higher than the administrations estimate see table 4 and table 5 the difference between the two estimates reflects primarily cbos assessment that dod legislative proposal to set up new account the

working capital funds and therefore does not include an funding for the new account see p 7 and p 306 82 the 302b allocation process was establis hed by the congressional budget act of 1974 for brief discussion see crs report 98815 budget resolution enforcement would cost about 675 million compared to zero expenditures assumed by dod according to dod the rationale for settin g up this new account with an indefinite appropriation is to allow dod to cover the differe nce between the amount budgeted for fuel costs and actual market prices80 since dod assumes that its estimate is correct the administration provided funds for the account cbo however believes that fuel prices in fy2004 are lik ely to be about 5 higher per barrel than dod assumes 27 barrel compared to 22 barrel and scores the likely cost of the new account at 675 million base d on the level of dods annual fuel purchases although the fy2004 congressional budget resolution adopted cbos higher scoring it appears that congress is unlikely to agree to set up the new account neither the house nor the senate vers ion of the fy2004 dod authorization act includes funds for the account81 instead both houses transfer that 675 million in the cbo estimate for that account to ot her programs the house and senate appropriators also rejected dods proposal for this new fund and eliminated the 675 million for the account dods appropriations allocation sign of potential pressure on dods budget top line in the future is the outco of decisions about the distribution of funds to the various appropriations subc ommittees to guide their markup process known as setting 302b allocations82 the annual congressi onal budget resolution sets the total amount of discretionary spending available to the appropriations committees and recommends spending allo cations for each budget function the appropriations committees however have discretion to set allocations for each subcommittee the conference agreement on the budget resolution allocates 7847 billion in discretionary budget authority to the ppropriations committees for several weeks after the budget resolution was agreed t committee leaders debated how to allocate funds among the subcommittees and especially how to absorb what they identified as 5 to 7 billion gap in spending requi rements and amounts av ailable departing from traditional practices where house and senate committees work separately on subcommittee allocations committee leaders negotiated acr oss both houses with their leadership and with the white house to establish common framework within which to base their initial allocations on june 11 house and senate ppropriations committee chairmen nnounced an agreed package that woul d free up sufficient resources to address the funding gap and remain within the overall fy2004 disc retionary budget cap of 7847 billion ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31805crs29 approved by all parties including th president the appropriations committees reduced defense spending by 31 billi on and moved 22 billion in fy2004 advance appropriations to fy2003 trends in dod spending plans assessing longterm trends in the defe nse budget is difficult because of the effect of the large amount of supplementa l funding r eceived since september 11 2001 in the emergency terrorism res ponse supplemental of 2001 and the fy2002 supplemental that funding which is

and civilian personnel systems and defense acquis ition practices according to secretary of defense rums feld not only do our armed fo rces need to be flexible light and agile but also t he same is true of the n and women who support them in meeting the frequent sudden chan ges in our security environment83 including the global war on terrorism to meet this goal the administration delivered broad ranging legislative proposal entitled the defense transformation for the 21st century act to congress on april 10 2003 shortly before congresss twoweek april recess among other things the legislative proposal would have given the secretary of defense authority to redesign the civil service system g overning the 700000 civilian employees in the department of defense provided additional flexibility in managing senior military officers modify certain acquisition requirements and exempted dod from certain environmental statutes some members of congress expressed concern that dod had delivered such an ambitious proposal at time when congre ss was about to rece ss and shortly before markup of the defense authorization b ill was planned although dod witnesses discussed their plans to submit the pr oposal earlier in the year and met with congressional staff in the preceding couple of months the specific proposals were not available before april 1084 as noted above crs compar all of the proposed new measures with current law in crs report rl31916 defense department transformation proposal side by side with current law by robert l goldich gary j pagliano barbara l schw emle and

budget was the first budget to reflect fully president bushs commitment to challenge the status quo and balance the need to meet current challenges from the global war on terrorism and nearterm threats with the need to transform dod in the longer term85 dod contended that transformation is now fully underway with new emphasis placed on unmanned vehicles precision guided munitions special

defense policy s been whether the defense department will be able to afford all of the major weapons modernization programs that have been on the drawing boards particularly toward the end of the

action will be in later update last year and again this year the defense department has tried to calculate the amount that is being devoted to modernizati on programs that it re gards as particularly transformational according to dod comp troller dov zakheim these programs add up to 243 billion in the fy2004 budget and 239 billion over the period of the six year fy2004fy2009 future years defense pl an fydp under secretary zakheim said that dod made room for these prog rams in part by cutting about 82 billion from projected service budgets over the c ourse of the fydp the cuts include termination of number of army programs to upgrade current weapons early retirement of 26 navy ships and 259 aircra ft and an attendant reduction of 10000 in the navys personnel endstrength and ear ly retirement of 115 air force fighter aircraft and 115 mobilitytanker airc raft as well as efficiencies91 final conference action will be addresse d in later update in the fy2004 budget the defense partment requested 744 billion for weapons procurement and 618 billion for research development test and evaluation rdte major aspects of the administration re quest and some key issues include the following army transformation in recent years the army has been pursuing three major initiatives simultaneously 1 upgrades to the current legacy force including improvements in m1 tanks and bradley fighting vehicles 2 development and deployment of an interim force made up of six brigades equipped with stryker wheeled armored vehicles and designed to be more rapidly deployable than heavy armored forces and 3 pursu it of an objective force include the future combat system family of new armored vehicles and other systems designed to fundamentally change the way the army will fight in the future in addition the army has been continuing to develop the comanc he helicopter though late last year the defense department decided to cut pl anned total comanche procurement by about half in the fy2004 budget request the defens department cut back number of planned upgrades of army legacy systems including highprofile m1 and bradley upgrades in the wake of the armys success in the iraq war there was extensive discussion in congress about the wisdom of these planned cuts the house armed services committeereported ve rsion of the authorization adds 727 million to the request to continue m1 and

for bradley fighting vehicle upgrades and 424 million for m1 tank upgrades offset by cuts of 140 million in other m1 projects these are among the programs that the administration wants to terminate as part of the 82 billion in 6year savings that officials announced wh the budget was released the house appropriations bill adds the same amount for bradley upgrades and 155 million for m1 upgrades the house appropriators also urged dod to budget for enough m1 upgrades in the future to complete equipping the 3rd armored cavalry regiment with modernized tanks in eff ect the house rejected dod plans to cut back on army legacy force upgrades though house appropriators also indicated th at they may be satisfied once sufficient upgraded bradleys and m1 s are procured to equip 2 and 13 divisions of what the army calls its counterattack force of heavy armored units stryker interim combat brigades the house appropriations also added 35 million for long lead items for stryker armored vehicle procurement to equip the 5th and 6th stryker brigades dod has in the past at least considered halting the interim combat brigade program after four brigades are ployed house appropriators sent strong message that they expect dod to fill out the planned six brigade force the senate ppropriations committee also added 35 million for long lead items for stryker procurement though its report language

things continued advanced procurement funding for cvn21 an aircraft carrier to be procured in fy2007 one issue in congressional hearings on the fy2004 navy program concerns the planned size and structure of the na vy the 2001 quadrennial defense review qdr revalidated the plan for 310sh ip navy established by the 1997 qdr but also stated that forcest ructure goals in the 2001 qdr including the 310ship goal were subject to change pending the ma turation of dods tran sformation efforts in february 2003 in submitting its proposed fy 2004 defens budget dod officials stated that they had launched studies on future requirements for undersea warfare and future options for forcibly entering overseas military theaters these studies have the potential for changing among other things the planned number of attack submarines and the planned size nd structure of the am phibious fleet since attack submarines and amphibious ships ar two of the four major building blocks of the navy the others being aircraft carriers and surface combatants dod by launching these two studies appears to ve taken steps to back away from the 310ship plan at the same time the secret ary of defense has explicitly declined to endorse plan for 375ship fleet that has been put forward in recent months by navy leaders as result of these events there is now uncertainty concerning the planned size and structure of the navy dod may l onger support the 310ship plan but neither has it endorsed the 375ship plan or any other replacement plan this uncertainty over the planned size and structure of the navy affects surface combatants as well as submarines and amphibious ships because the biggest single difference between the 310ship and 375ship plans is in the area of surface combatants the 310ship plan includes 116 surface combatants all of whic h are cruisers destroyers and frigates while the 375ship plan includes 160 surface combatants including not only cruisers destroyers and frigates but as many as 60 smaller littoral combat ships as well congressional action sena and house markup table 9a shows action on major navy programs in the house and senate defense authorization bills and

program that cong ress required last year did not adequately review alternatives or establish priorities among navy combat requirements 2 that navy cost estimates did not include firm figures on the various modules that would be installed in the common sea frame and 3 that cost s of the program could compete with higher priority navy sh ipbuilding in constrained budget environment in the future

of new advanced aircraft including the air force fa22 fighter the navymarine corps fa18ef aircraft and the multiservice f35 joint strike fighter in addition the air force is continuing to procure c17 airlift aircraft and the marine corps is continuing to develop the v22 tilt rotor aircraft while congress is continuing to review whether to approve proposal to llow the air force to lease boeing 767s as tanker aircraft the fa22 has been particular focus of attention recently because of continued cost growth in the program and b ecause of the air forces desire to expand it the air force sees the fa22 as its hi ghest priority and in the long run would like to increase the total number of aircraft to be procured particularly to build version of the aircraft conf igured especially for deep strike ground attack role to replace f15e aircraft as they retire in the future the air force even changed the formal designation of the aircraft from the f22 to the fa22 to emphasize its ground attack capabilities the department of defense however s approved only three wings of aircraft for the air superiority mission and key budget decision in the fy2004fy2009 fydp was that the air force may plan to buy only as many aircraft as it can with the total funds projected last year to be ava ilable for the program with continued cost growth this number has shrunk from the 330 aircraft the air force has wanted to outfit three wings each with 72 deployable aircraft plus attrition reserves plus aircraft in repair and transit etc to 295 and most recently to 276 for its part congress has imposed cap on the total deve lopment cost of the program which the air force wants congress to lift another issue that remains contentious is whether to permit the air force to lease commercially produced aircraft for use as tankers in the fy2002 defense appropriations act congress approved proposal to allow the air force to begin negotiations with boeing to lease 100 767 airc raft to be converted to operate as air toair refueling tankers this measure wa s controversial in part because federal budget rules generally discourage leases on the premise that direct purchase will be cheaper for the government in the long run though it may require more upfront money in agency budgets through all the controversy the air force and boeing continued to try to hammer out the details of lease agreement after much internal debate within the administration on may 23 the defense depa rtment announced th at it had approved an agreement under which the air force will lease 100 767s through 2017 delivery will begin in 2006 and will be completed by 2011 and the cost through 2017 will total about 13 billion in constant fy2002 dollars purchasing the aircraft would cost an additional 4 billion

administration proposal to study development of new robust nuclear earth penetrator warhead and to set limits on rd on any new or modified nuclear weapons94 the debate continued this year in response to an administration request that congress lift ban on the conduct of rd into lowyield nuclear weapons that has been in effect since 1993 referred to the sprattfurse amendment the provision was enacted as section 3136 of the fy1993 defense authorization act pl 103160 that section states it shall be the policy of the united states not to conduct research and development which could lead to producti on by the united states of new low yield nuclear weapons including precision lowyield warhead as part of its nuclear posture review issued in december 2001 the administration announced that the united states would investigate the use of modified nuclear weapons to destroy deep lyburied and hardened targets in rogue nations such as north korea and would pur sue concept development studies for new lowyield nuclear weapons for that and some other missions95 in its legislative request this year dod argues that lifting the ban is necessary to train the next generation of nuclear weapons scientists and engineers and explore the full range of technical options to respond to new or emerging threats including using low yield nuclear weapons against buried nd hardened bunkers that could contain chemical and biological agents96 to carry this out dod requested 6 million to conduct advanced concepts research in to lowyield nuclear weapons and 15 million to continue rd to do research on robust nuclear earth penetrator that could modify either the b61 or the b83 nuclear weapons in the current inventory to be more able to pene trate hardened sites congressional action modify rest

penetrator weapon99 there was wideranging debate in the senate about an am endment offered by senators feinstein and kenne dy to restore the ban but the amendment was tabled by vote of 51 to 43 samdt 715 both supporters and opponents of the ban focused on the administrations interest in expl oring the possibility of using lowyield nuclear weapons as way to attack d eeply buried hardened bunkers that could contain chemical or biological weapons100 to those who oppose the ban research to explore the use of lowyield nuclear weapon or nuclear earth penetrator weapon against hardened underground bunkers should be explored as method that c ould be effective and could generate less collateral damage s upporters of continuing the ban argued that even 5kiloton nuclear weapon would genera large losses of life nd much collateral damage supporters of the ban also argued that exploring this new mission for nuclear weapons could lead to requirements to st new nuclear wea pons and undercut the us commitment to the underground nuclear testing moratorium as well as us policy to prevent the spread of nuclear w eapons to other nations those who want to lift the ban argue that us actions to reinstitute research on new nuclear weapons would not affect us efforts to discour age nations from pursuing nuclear weapons whether nuclear weapon is necessary fo r this mission is also controversial some observers believe that only nuclear version could destroy hardened deeply buried bunkers and others argue that the us could develop precise conventional bunkerbusting weapons or other approaches th at could be equally or more effective than nuclear weapons in disabling rdened bunker or containing chemical or biological weapons101 some scientists and engineer s have questioned whether low yield nuclear weapon could be effective against deeplyburied underground facility particularly if its preci location is not known102 other conventional alternatives could include developing nonnuclear

226 hamdt 4104 personnel pay and benefits issues and readiness issues proposals to change selection of senior military leadership as part of its transformationa l package dod requested series of provisions that would give the president and the secretary of defense additional flexibility to select and retain dods senior military leadersh ip examples include allowing the president to reappoint service chiefs nd the chair and vicechair of the joint chiefs of staff for as many twoyear term s as desired to repeal mandatory terms for certain general and flag officers and to reassign many senior officers in senate confirmed positions without returning to c ongress to retain senior officers dod also wants to raise the normal maximum retirement age from 62 to 68 and to modify retirement rules so that senior officers can retire after less than three years known as timeingrade rule but still receive retirement based on their highest rank according to dod witnesses these proposed changes would allow dod to move senior military leaders to where they are needed to retain those whose skills are important and to retire those who may longer be performing as needed critics voice concern that these changes could re duce incentives for younger officers who could see their opportunities limited by older officers who stay longer105 other proposals in this package would add flexibility to use reservists by allowing dod to activate reservists for an add itional 90 days of training and by expanding the reasons that the president can call up reservists to include domestic disasters accidents or catastrophes dod would also be allowe d to provide medical and dental screening of reservists prep aring for mobilization change endorsed by the authorizers106

reduced by phasing in benefits see table 12 below107 the administration opposed lifting the 111year old prohibition against concurrent receipt of benefits that stem from the same period of service because of both its high cost and the precedent for ot her federal benefit pr ograms with similar provisions the resolution in conferen ce is described earlier dod opposed this provision last year

june 1 2003 senate adds new health care benefit for nonactive duty reservists another provision added on the senate floor with major cost implications is the grahamdaschle amendment that would provide for nonactive duty reservists access to tricare medical benefits for enlisted personnel who pay annual premiums of 330 for an individual and 560 for family and officers who pay 380 for individuals and 610 for families and for activated reservists payment of their current health care premiums up to the per capita costs of tricare if enacted cbo estimates that this provision would cost 466 million in fy2004 rising to 21 billion by fy2008 as more nonactive duty reservists opt for the coverage because of the attractiveness of the rates see table 12 the proposed annual premium of 560 is ss than onethird of the national average of 1800 for family coverage in 2000 most of the cost is to pay for access to tricare benefits for nonactive duty reservists 80 of wh om already have health care

closures in 2005 following pro cedures that were used in earlier rounds in 1991 1993 and 1995 congressional action the senate rejected an amendment that was offered by senators dorgan and lott that would cancel the 2005 round of base closures the administration has signaled that veto is likely if congress includes either delay or cancellation of the 2005 round which th administration cons iders essential to its plans to reduce the size and cost of dods infrastructure and free up funds for transformational programs113 during floor debate senator dorgan argued that new round should be delayed because of the certainties of deter mining the size and makeup of dods force structure after th september 11th terro rist attacks and because of the economic effects on co mmunities of potentia l base closures114 the house armed services committeereported authorization bill includes provision that would require the defense partment to preserve sufficient basing structure to support possible expansion of the force in the future though the full committee reversed subco mmittee measure that would have eliminated the 2005 round the house and senate authorizers did not include the administrations proposal to merge personnel accounts of the activeduty and reserve forces number of active and reserve duty personnel frequent issue in recent years has been whether current active
