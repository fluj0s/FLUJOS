eurpra dir anita friedt reason 14 b c and d background 1 snf venezuelan officials expected to receive shipment of unmanned aerial vehicles uav and related material from iran via turkey by may 2009 as of early march venezuelan officials believed that the equipment would be repackaged and labeled as electronic equipment then transported overland from iran to turkey once in turkey the equipment would be loaded onto maritime vessel for continued shipment to venezuela the us believes this shipment constitutes arms and related materiel which iran is prohibited from transferring pursuant to security council resolution 1747 paragraph 5 2 s this case appears to be similar to one from january 2009 where iran attempted to ship drums of nitrate and sulphite chemicals and dismantled laboratory instruments which could possibly be used for making bombs to venezuela via turkey in response to us concerns that the shipment may have been violation of unscr 1747 turkish officials inspected the cargo and made decision to return it to iran refs and b action request 3 s drawing from the points in paragraph 5 which may be left as nonpaper post is instructed to approach appropriatelevel turkish officials and request that they investigate this activity and if the cargo is found to be in violation of unscr 1747 that the got use all available means to prevent the transshipment of this cargo and detain it objectives 4 s post should seek to achieve the following provide turkish officials with information regarding irans attempt to ship unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and related material to venezuela via turkey emphasize to the turkish officials that security council resolution unscr 1747 paragraph 5 prohibits iran from transferring any arms or related materiel emphasize that these goods are produced by an iranian entity listed in the annex to unscr 1747 urge the government of turkey got to take action against this shipment pursuant to unscr 1747 and possibly 1737 and in accordance with the gots laws and authorities thank the got for its willingness to interdict and take positive action with regards to similar shipment in january as nato ally we try to provide turkey with as much info as possible on these issues which could help lead them to take action in detaining shipments and emphasized that should we receive additional information regarding this shipment we will provide it as expeditiously as possible talking pointsnonpaper 5 srel turkey begin talking pointsnonpaper we would like to share some information with you in an effort to highlight transfer of proliferation concern and to ensure that iran does not make use of your territory to transfer items proscribed by security council resolutions 1737 1747 and 1803 the us has information indicating that venezuelan officials expected to receive shipment of uav and uavrelated equipment from iran by may 2009 as of early march venezuelan officials believed that the equipment would be repackaged and labeled as electronic equipment then transported overland from iran to turkey once in turkey the equipment would be loaded onto maritime vessel for continued shipment to venezuela venezuelan officials assessed that shipment of electronics coming from turkey to venezuela would be less alerting than shipment directly from iran we believe these items are military uavs and related items constituting arms and related materials and are thus captured by unscr 1747 and subject to the asset freeze called for in unscr 1737 security council resolution 1747 paragraph 5 prohibits iran from supplying selling or transferring any arms or related materiel it also requires all states to prohibit the procurement of such items from iran by their nationals or using their flag vessels or aircraft and whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of iran this system is produced by the qods aviation industries qods aeronautics industries aka qods aviations industries is designated in the annex to unscr 1747 and as such these items would be subject to the asset freeze provision of unscr 1737 regardless of whether the item is mtcr controlled or otherwise prohibited in paragraphs 3 or 4 of the resolution as such we request your assistance in preventing the transfer of goods in violation of unscr 1747 and 1737 additionally it is possible that some uavrelated equipment may be mtcrcontrolled per mtcr item 12a1 if the equipment is designed or modified to support other iranian uavs that meet the item 1a2 or 19a2 criteria such items are included in document s2006815 the list of items materials equipment goods and technology related to ballistic missile programs transfer of these items would be violation of unscr 1737 per paragraph 3 we deeply appreciate the government of turkeys continued cooperation support and willingness to enact prompt and thorough efforts in promoting interdictions designed to prevent the transfer of sensitive materials by iran end points
