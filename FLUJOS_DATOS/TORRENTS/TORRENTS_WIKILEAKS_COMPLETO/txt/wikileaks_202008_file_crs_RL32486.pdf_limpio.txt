american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32486marine protected areas mpas federal legal authority summary recent events including the release of the presidents us ocean action plan and reports issued by the united states commission on ocean policy and the pew oceans commission have prompted reex amination of us ocean policy and debate over an ecosystem approach to ocean resource management one proposed mechanism for conserving ocean resources is the marine protected area mpa conceptualized as zoning system for the portions of the ocean under us jurisdiction this has been highlighted by the issuance of the revised draft framework for developing the national sy stem of marine protected areas draft framework issued on march 17 2008 by the national marine protected areas center part of the national oceanic nd atmospheric administration noaa the introduction of hr 21 in the 110th congress has also focuse d attention on the health of ocean resources the relative merits and the potentially negative consequences of such an mpa system have been widely discussed dvocates of additional protection argue that more comprehensive system as outlin ed in the draft framework should be established others argue that the current system is effectively managing ocean resources and that additional restric tions would be economically harmful apart from the relative merits of each pos ition there is some question as to the applicability of current fede ral law to the oceans and wh ether new protections could be imposed administratively without add itional legislation to some extent regulatory authority depends upon the nature of the jurisdiction that the united states has claimed over various ocean resources vi savis other nations and visavis the states consistent with international law the united states claims jurisdiction over marine areas extending 200 nautical miles from its coast and has regulated resources in the zones composing this ar ea under multiple legal authorities several current laws whic h might provide authority for the creation of mpas are aimed specifically at the ocean environment the national marine sanctuary program established by th marine protection research and sanctuaries act the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act and the coastal zone management act each specifically contempl ate various levels and forms of aquatic resource protection additionally certain generally applicable laws while primarily intended for use on land would arguably support the designa tion of an mpa in some circumstances indeed us mpas within the territorial seas have been established as national monuments national parks na tional wildlife areas and most recently as reserve via executive order this report outlines us jurisdiction over ocean resources and analyzes the existing laws to assess their application to marine environmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32486contents introduction 1 u s j u r i s d i c t i n v r m

manifestation of this debatemarine protected areas mpas federal legal authority introduction scientific documentation of the ecological condition of the oceans such as the reports recently issued by the united states commission on ocean policy and the pew oceans commission has been cited as evidence of deteriorating aquatic conditions the president responded to these reports by creating the committee on ocean policy within the white hous council on environmental quality1 the bush administration has also released us ocean action plan report setting forth administration support for development of global ocean observing system various state local and federal partnershi ps in ocean stewardship and management individual fishing quotas and greater use of marketbased systems for

transportation system the plan also indicates that the president will pursue coral reef local ac tion strategies us accession to the convention on the law of the sea and passage of legislation to more clearly define the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations noaas responsibilities within the department of commerce2 recently there has been debate over whether the development of more comprehensive system of marine re source preservation is appropriate3 currently number of us marine sites have been signated for and receive special protections under laws specifically aimed at

airspace over the territorial sea as well as to its bed and subsoil28 thus the united states is generally considered to exercise full sovereign authority over its territorial sea visavis other nations the united states supreme court has also recognized us authority to impose significant protective measures on ocean resources in this area29 thus it would appear relatively clear that in the

are reviewed by the secretary of commerce and are subject to the secretarys approval84 while magnusonstevens establishes basic polic and framework for fishery regulation and management it does not

objects to be protected116 while the precise language of the st atute might appear to limit monuments to landmarks structures or other objects which are situated on the lands and limits what may be reserved to parcels of land the executives power under the antiquities act has been interpreted quite broadly117 the act has been interpreted to cover submerged lands under us jurisd iction in fact submerged lands eg coral reefs have been included in na tional monuments on several occasions but always apparently in connection with pr otection of some associated surface lands such as islands118 in addition to the submerged lands themselves the act has been read to authorize protection of the wate r column above submerged lands as well provided that qualifying object located on the submerged lands could not be adequately protected absent water column protection119 this reading of the act was apparently embraced by the clinton administration when the president expanded protection for the buck island reef national monument where in add ition to protection for submerged lands themselves fishing is now prohibited120 monument designation protecting only wate r resources and not an underlying land based monument would seem to strain the nguage of the statute it should be noted again however that the act has been interp reted broadly and it does not appear that there has ever been successful challenge to designation an additional issue is whether the us government owns or controls these submerged lands as contemplated by the antiquities act this question is complicated by the breakdown of the s ea into various jurisdictional zones ownership and control may vary depending on which seaward area is involved as discussed above the united st ates asserts full sovereignt and

do not belong to the states where us jurisdiction over ocean resources is arguably at its strongest there has been definitive resolution as to whether us authority over the area amounts to ownership or control for purposes of the antiquities act there are however several authorities s upporting the conclusion that the us does own or control at least portions of the territorial sea as contemplated by the antiquities act first the supreme court has held that the united states owned the lands within the territorial sea and that the property clause of the us constitution authorized congress to dispose of such lands121 additionally prior to president reagans proclamation extending us jurisdiction over the seas to parallel international law on the subject the territorial sea was limited to three miles from the shoreline during this time the supreme court did state that there can be serious question that the president in 1949 had the power under the antiquities act to reserve the submerged lands and waters within the onemile belts122 as national monument since they were then controlled by the government of the united states123 these holdings support the concept of federal owne rship or control and would most likely be applicable to those areas extending twelve miles from the shore which are under federal jurisdiction the submerged lands act discussed belo w has altered this balance to some extent the submerged lands act sla124 would appear to impact federal ownership and control the sla established or confirmed state title to and ownership of the lands beneath the navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective states and the natural resources within such lands and waters125 the boundaries of the states were designated as generally including the submerged lands up to three geographical miles from each states coast126 the federal governme nt retained however its navigational servitude and rights in and powers of regulation and control of said lands and navigable waters for the constitutional purposes of commerce navigation national defense and in ternational affairs127 further these rights are paramount to but do not include the states proprieta ry rights of ownership or the rights ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32486crs18 128 id 129 united states v califor nia 436 us 32 36 1978 130 subaqueous exploration archaeology lt d v unidentified

authority the territorial sea only extended three miles from shore the subseque nt expansion of the rritorial sea would not appear to fundamentally alter the type of control asserted over the ocean resources just the geographic scope of control thus it seems reasonable to conclude that the courts reasoning in determining that the antiquities ac t applied within the threemile area would now apply to areas outside the three mile region but still within the twelve mile boundary 132 43 usc 1331 et seq 133 us v california 381 us 139 148 1965 emphasis addedmanagement administration leasing use and development of th lands and natural resources128 thus it is clear that visavis the st ates the federal government does not now own the submerged lands and waters to the extent that such rights have been ceded to the states although the area remains in us ownership visavis other nations determining federal control may be somewhat more elusive significant federal controls have been both ceded and retaine d and as indicated above the standard for determining control does not appear to have been provided by statute or court decision however the s upreme courts decision in united states v california which held that the sla transferred dominion over the three mile coastal region to the states and thus nullified previ ously valid designation under the antiquities act may support the argument that the president would not have authority to designate national monument in t hose areas affected by the sla129 further at least one federal court decision has held that the antiquities act is inapplicable to state submerged lands basing its conclusion on united states v california 130 areas within the territorial sea but bey ond the region affected by the sla would appear to remain subject to federal ownership or contro l as contemplated by the antiquities act131 further support for this position is found in the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla132 in describing the ocsla the us supreme court has stated that congress declared that the united states owned all submerged land in the continental shelf seaward of the lands granted to the states133 however it would not appear that the court was interpreting wh ether the united states had ownership or lesser interest in outer continental shelf lands in that decision as this assertion would appear to be nonbinding dicta the ex tent of the us claim to submerged lands under the ocsla remains unclear indeed the ocsla does not state that the us owns outer continental shelf submerged lands the statute defines the

subsoil and seabed of the outer continental shelf appertain to the united states and are subject to its jurisdiction control and power of disposition as provided in this subchapter 135 the use of these terms would appear to indicate that the us interest in outer continental shelf submerged lands does not amount to ownership by virtue of the ocsla itself at least as to those areas beyond the territo rial sea however even beyond the territorial sea us waters may still be subject to c ontrol as contemplated by the antiquities act as discussed earlier in its eez zone beyond its territory coastal nation has sovereign rights to explore exploit conserve and manage marine and seabed resources136 the presidential proclamation establishing the us eez states that the united states claims these rights in the 200 nautical mile area allowable under international law137 the extent of control claimed by the us over the eez is less extensive than that which it has claimed and exercised over the territorial sea recognition of contiguous zone allows fo r additional regulatory authority over the area extending 24 nautical miles from the coast for specified purposes it is not immediately clear if the levels of regulatory authority in these zones would be determinative factor in deduc ing if the us exercises control under the antiquities act however it should be noted that the united states claims significant authority consistent with internati onal law to regulate the eez and contiguous zone for environmental and economic purposes138 thus whether control claimed over these submerged lands is sufficient to meet the requirements of the antiquities act remains an unsettled issue national park system while only congress itself can designat national park the national park

determine and report to congress whether an area possesses national significance and is suitable and feasible for inclusion in the national park system142 in determining the eligibility of site for inclusion the secretar must consider nine factors i the rarity and integrity of the resources ii the threats to those resources iii whether similar resources are already protected in the national park system or in other public or private ownership iv the public use potential v the interpretive and educational potential vi costs associated with ac quisition development and operation vii the socioeconomic impacts of any designation viii the level of local and general public support and ix whether the area is of appropriate c onfiguration to ensure longterm resource protection and visitor use143 thus while the secretary is directed to evaluate site suitability and while the enumerated factors may militate for or against inclusion of any particular area there is indication that marine sites coul d not be included in the secretarys recommendations or the national park system itself congress in fact has broad power to make such design ations and has included mari ne resources notably coral reefs in the national park system for example congress created the national park of american samoa to preserve and protect the tropical forest and archeological and cultural resources of american samoa and of associated reefs144 hence fishing in the designated areas is prohibite d unless for subsistence purposes145 management of parks is dele gated by statute to the national park service which is directed to prepare general management plans these plans must include among other things measures for the pr eservation of the areas resources146 broad general authority to prescribe rules related to the management of the national park system is also granted to the secretary of the interior147 moreover the secretary of the interior is specifically authorized to promulgate rules

to waters located within areas of the national park system148 thus while significant legislative action is required for the designation of any national park marine resources are not outsi the scope of the system now in place furthermore the broad management power s generally availabl under the national park service organic act and congress pow er to further refine marine resource management could provide flexible and comprehensive regulation because the united states owns and exercises full sovereignty over its territorial seas establishment of park in that zone would not appear to pose particular jurisdictional problems although state ow nership as expressed in the sla may require consideration designation w ithin the other zones may prove more complicated the national park service or ganic act makes pparent distinction among waters and hence ocean resources base d on the various zones in fact in 16 usc 1a2h the act states that the secretary of the interior shall promulgate and enforce regulations concerning boating and other activities on or relating to waters located within ar eas of the national park system including waters subject to the jurisdiction of the united states provided that any regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be complementary to and not in derogation of the authority of th united states coast guard to regulate the use of waters subject to the jurisdiction of the united states149 thus arguably under the terms of national park service organic act designation of park in the waters of any zone appears permissible as form of regulating ocean resources so long as consistent with the sovereignty or jurisdiction that the united states claims the national wildlife refuge system the national wildlife refuge sy stem administration act of

appear to contemplate the possibility of marine re sources receiving wildlife refuge status nothing in the language of the act would ppear to preclude this understanding of the statute the refuge system currently includes lakes and ma rshes and freshwater swamps certain coastal areas and submer ged lands and waters although it would appear that each ocean refuge is in so way connected to

resources has been circumscribed the fws as created by the fish and wildlife act of 1956 was composed of the bureau of commercial fisheries and the bureau of sport fisheries and wildlife153 the bureau of commercial fisheries which had authority over fishery manage ment was transferred to the department of commerce and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration by executive action154 the bureau of sport fisheries and wildlif remained in doi although its authorities related to the protection of migratory marine species of game fish were also transferred by the reorganization plan155 under the resulting reorganization the fws retained authority over only those bu reau of commercial fisheries functions related to 1 great lakes fishery research and activities related to the great lakes fisheries commission 2 missouri river re servoir research 3 the gulf breeze biological laboratory of the said bureau at gulf breeze florida and 4 trans alaska pipeline investigations156 thus it is relatively clear that the fws does not retain significant jurisdiction over ocean resources under the authorities originally granted to the bureau of commercial fisheries however the fwss jurisdiction under other laws would not appear to be ffected by the 1970 reorganization indeed its authority to manage resources as part of the national wildlife refuge system was not involved in the transfer of the duties of the bureau of co mmercial fisheries and thus would appear to remain intact to the extent provided for in specific congressional authorizations there is single method for

activities in refuge areas and is authorized to permit the use of any area within the system for any purpose whenever he determines that such uses are compatible with the ma jor purposes for which

territorial sea170 because of the extent of the us claim to owne rship and sovereign jurisdiction over the territorial sea the territorial sea could arguably be considered within the united states on the other hand it is arguab that within the united states does not include any area beyond the us coastline however as multiple refuges currently contain portions of the territorial sea and as there is little to indicate that the territorial sea is not meant to be considered part of the united states for purposes of the nwrsaa it would seem that refuge designation within the territorial sea is permissible whether designation in the eez or contiguous zone would be permissible under current law is more questionable conforming to international law the pr esidential proclamation establishing the eez states that the eez remains an area beyond the territory and territorial sea of the united states in which all states enjoy the high seas freedoms of navigation overflight the laying of submarine cable s and pipelines and other internationally lawful uses of the sea171 as pointed out in natural resources defense council v united states department of the navy while the eez is not part of united states territory the united states does enjoy certain sovereign rights there including sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring exploiting conserving and managing natural resources172 thus while the united states would likely be empowered to create refugelike protections for areas within its eez if congress deemed it appropriate it is doubtful that the areas beyond the territorial

in the 2000 amendments to the national marine sanctuaries act175 which were enacted shortly before president clinton issued the nhir orders the amended act also directs the secretary of commerce upon the creation of reserve to initiate its designation as marine sanctuary under the national marine sanctuaries act176 further the amendments state that in the period before designation of the reserve as marine sanctuary the nhir be managed in manne r consistent with the purposes of the national marine sanctuaries act177 these requirements are reflected in the executive orders as well178 thus far the nhir has been designated and the process for redesignation as marine sanctuary has begun as well it should be noted however that unless the provisions of an executive order are enacted into law an executive order can be delayed abandoned or expressly overturned by later order the congressional authoriza tion here does not compel designation and while it authorizes the creation of reserve it w ould not appear to imbue the clinton orders with any additional force of law the regulatory authority exercised over the nhir pursuant to the executive orders derives from several preexisting lega l sources generally an executive order is used by the president to direct some action within the executive branch executive orders may be based upon th presidents constitutional powers andor upon specific statutory authority the orders at issue he re cite several author ities in support of the presidents designation including the constitution the nmsa magnusonstevens the marine protection res earch and sanctuar ies act the czma the endangered species act the marine mammal protection act the clean water act the national historic preservation act the nwrs aa and other pertinent statutes179 thus president clinton directed the federal agen cies to protect the nhir as authorized by the applicable statutes the executive orders would not appear to authorize or establish any new regulatory capabilities th at were not available under preexisting law the orders themselves establish certain baseline protections for the designated area they limit development of the reserves resources and generally prohibit oil and gas exploration and produc tion anchoring on coral reefs alteration of the seabed discharges into the reserve and under certa in circumstances the taking of biological

threatened or endangered species and generally prohi bits federal agencies from harming these species though direct action or through federally funded activities185 species protection under the has

addresses only species management the law generally prohibits the taking of marine mammals but allo ws for incidental takings during fishing operations it does author ize the secretary of commerce to

should also be noted that the precise boundaries of the hawaiian islands national wildlife refuge are relatively unclear the refuge was established by president theodore roosevelt in 1909 by executive

agency jurisdiction could result in some level of tension while in most instan ces the executive orders appear to vest primary management authority in th secretary of commerce pursuant to congressional authorization the secretar would not appear to have primary jurisdiction over portions of the nhir the reserve boundaries are established in executive order 13178 stating the reserve shall be adjacent to and seaward of the seaward boundaries of the state of hawaii and the midway atoll national wildlife refuge and shall overlay the hawaiian islands national wildlife refuge to the extent that it extends beyond the seaward boundary of the state of hawaii200 thus portion of the nhir includes portion of national wildlife refuge the secretary of commerces management authority may be problematic in this area because of general statutory requirement that the national wildlife refuge system be managed by the secretary of the interior through the fws201 however as indicated in the legislative history surroundi ng the development of this jurisdictional limitation and the cases interpreting it doi may delegate some of its responsibilities and coordinate management activities with state or federal agencies202 the courts have indicated that the level of discretion that can be vested in other entities with regard to refuge management is limited and that doi must retain ultimate authority and responsibility for refuge resources203 it is arguable that the law authorizing presidential designation of the nhir had some impact on the general placement of refuge authority in doi the law states thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32486crs29 204 act of december 21 2000 pl 106554 1a4 div b title i 144f act of november 13 2000 pl 106513 6g 205 united states v faus to 484 us 439 453 1988

this could be interpreted as an authorization for the president to effectively place primary management authority for wildlife refuge in the hands of the secretary of commerce should the pres ident choose to include such an area in the reserve as described above this could re sult in the application of th generally weaker reserve protective standards to the refuge on the other hand it is arguable that had congress intended such result it would have spoken to this issue di rectly there is general presumption that congress will specify its intention that new statute is meant to supersede an earlier one205 further courts will generally read subsequent enactment as an amendment or repeal onl when the conflict between two provisions is irreconcilable or the subsequent enactment is clearly intended as substitute206 applying this general canon of statutor construction would appear to favor an interpretation of the reserve designation provision that leaves the primary refuge management authorities with fws alone still the statute arguably authorizes cooperative management effo rts among the relevant agencies even if primary authority remains with doi the executive orders would not appear to definitively clarify where management authority rests they direct that the secretary of commerce or his designee manage the reserve and that the management system facilitate coordination among the state nd federal agencies involved207 these statements appear to indicate an intention that the secretary of commerce have ultimate regulatory responsibility on the other hand there is some indication that regulatory authority over the hawaiian islands national wildlife refuge is separate from the rest of the reserve for example the pr ovisions that guide the preparation of the reserve operations plan rop state that the rop must provi for coordinated management between the reserve and the hawaiian islands national wildlife refuge208 similarly the orders direct the secretary of commerce to negotiate any necessary memoranda of understanding with the secretary of the interior and the state of hawaii regarding management c oordination between the reserve and the wildlife refuge209 thus arguments could be made that ultimate refuge authority has been placed in either of the agenci by the executive orders however as described above should c ourt find that the congressi onal authorization of the creation of reserve was not intended to supersede the general requirement that refuge authority rest in doi an execu tive order would not appear to be the

relatively vague it would appear however that wespac is intended to remain an active regulator under magnusonstevens and continue with such activities as it has heretofore undertaken as described above wespac as the regional fishery management council is pr imarily responsible for th development of fishery management plans in accordance with magnusonstevens subject to approval by the secretary of commerce210 wespac has apparently voiced some concern that certain requirements contained in the executive orders and the nhir regulations may violate the magnuson act by preventin g resource utilizati on as permitted under law211 this opinion may result from an understanding that magnusonstevens generally requires fisher management plans to include conservation and management measures that achieve optimum yield from each fishery while preventing overfishing212 these management measures are to be based on the best scientific information available213 thus it is conceivable that the base restrictions required by the executive orders could conflic t with the levels of sustainable fishing as determined by the regi onal council however the maximum sustainable yield from any fishery is to be reduced by the relevant social economic and ecological factors214 further conservation and management activities are required to rebuild restore or maintain fishery res ources and the marine environment215 it would appear to be within the presidents authority to direct fishery management so that conservation of the marine environment is the primary objective if however specific restrictions on res ource exploitation could not be supported as necessary by scientific information as required by law additiona l fishing may have to be permitted unless the more stringent restrictions could be based on some superseding authority conclusion in light of the recent publication of the revised draft framework for developing the national system of mari ne protected areas and the introduction of hr 21 in the 110th congress it is important to understand the statutory and regulatory background for the designation of mpas series of statutory authorities exist for the creation and management of mpas the national marine sanctuaries act would appear to be dir ectly aimed at the creation of mpas although in practice the protections provided areas designated under its authority have not necessarily been extensive other legislation such as the coastal zone ma nagement act and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32486crs31 magnusonstevens fishery conservation nd management act also have the potential to protect marine resources in fashion similar to mpas more general preservation laws may also be an opti on for the protection and management of marine resources the antiquities act the national park service organic act and the national wildlife refuge system administration act appear to generally allow the designation of marine resources as national monuments national parks or national wildlife refuges however use of these various conservation authorities for the creation of an mpa would carry concerns peculiar to each particular statute and would be limited by the extent of us jurisdiction over offshore lands and waters their application to the territorial sea would generally appear permissible application beyond the territo rial sea is less certain
