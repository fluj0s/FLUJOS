remaining funds ar allotted on the basis of the number of qualifying adults in each state or outlyin g area overall and funds permitting state or outlying area shall receive grant in any fiscal year that is less than 90 of its grant in the preceding year for purposes of the allocation formula states include the 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico and outlying areas include guam american samoa the northern mariana islands the virgin islands the federated states of micronesia the republic of the mars hall islands and the republic of palau special termination provisions apply to allocations for the federated states of micronesia the re public of the marshall islands and the republic of palau for additional information regarding the freely associated states please see crs report rl31737 the marshall islands and micronesia amendments to the compact of free association with the united states by thomas lum for purposes of the aefla allocation form ula qualifying adult is defined as any person who is at least 16 years of age is beyond the age of compulsory school attendance in the state does not have high school di ploma or the equivalent and is not enrolled in secondary school ed obtains these data by means of special tabulation from the decennial census they are updated once every 10 years the house bill would not directly change the allocation formula provisions but it would make two changes to the underlying definitions first the aefla definition regarding high school diploma or the equivalent would be changed to secondary school diploma general ducational development ged credential or another staterecognized equi valent 211 second the defin ition of outlying areahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32867crs10 would be changed to eliminate eligibility for micronesia and the marshall islands presumably to reflect their new compact s of free association 203 of aebsflea and 101 of wia the senate bill would change the definition for outlying areas by removing micronesia the marshall islands and palau from the list of eligible areas however palau would be eligible for the second form ula allocation that is the allocation that is proportional to qualifying population palau would not be eligible for the initial 100000 flat grant for which the remaining ou tlying areas are eligible the senate bill would not change the definition of qualifying adult for purposes of the allocation formula the government accountability office gao would study the adult education allocation formula regarding whether the distribution sufficiently serves the eligible population and whether the form ula data accurately reflects the eligible population study results must be repor ted to congress within three years of enactment 211 of aefla 205 of the senate
