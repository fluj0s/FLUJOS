memorandum to from s schmidt date may 15 2008 subject clinton strategy according to both internal polling and exit polls by independent news organizations the democratic party is becoming increasingly polarized along certain segments of its base the recent result in west virginia while generally unsurprising and definitely unlikely to cause any real shift in the race highlights the growing bitterness between certain supporters of clinton and the obama camp in general this unique situation has created an opening that could help depress the turnout of key democratic demographics in november the specific group we are targeting is crosssection of white female voters over the age of 40 internal polling reveals that this group is the most likely to support john mccain after obama wins the nomination however we expect obamas numbers to improve following clintons drop our job is to make sure that number stays as low as possible our limited financial resources and the medias attention on the democratic race however prevent us from reaching this group our aim is to point out specific issues that we believe resonate well 1sen obamas connection to rev wright 2his inexperience 3his links to the corrupt chicago political machine however we cannot fully achieve this goal without greater commitment on the part of mccains fundraisers and our various media partners in lieu of that we have developed number of inexpensive ways to reach this audience we have already worked to reinforce the clinton campaigns narrative about the unfair treatment that some networks specifically msnbc have given her camp we are also planning to unroll new campaign to highlight obamas experience deficit simultaneously our team has been testing new lines of attack through independent proclinton communities on the internet our hope is that our message here will spread by wordofmouth our local community organizing has also been successful we have organized dozens of meetups across the country for clinton supporters and we have used that time to stress the importance of punishing the dnc for choosing the undemocratically selected farleft obama at the moment this is nothing more than headache for the obama campaign with greater commitment on your part i hope to see it metastasize into something much more let know if you need more detail s
