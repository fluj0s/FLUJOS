international law 904 october 1996 pp 625640 international trade rules of origin introduction recent trade policy issues have pointed to the framework used by the united states and other countries to regulate imports including the process of determining country of origin using rules of origin roo such rules can be very simple noncontroversial tools of intern ational trade as long as all of the parts of product are manufactured and assemble d primarily in one country1 however when finished products component parts originate in many countries as is often the case in todays global trading environment determining origin can be very complex sometimes subjective and timeconsuming process the determination of products country of origin can also have significant implications for an imported products tr eatment with respect to number of different us trade programs and govern ment policies for example the united states currently has restrictions on th import of products from certain countries including burma cuba and north korea as part of larger foreign policy considerations the us government also seeks to promote the growth of imports from developing nations via the generalized system of preferences gsp and other programs in an effort to foster economic growth and prosperity in those nations these policies and many others rely on c ountry of origin dete rmination in order to fulfill their stated goals and objectives and in turn the determin ation of country of origin relies on us implementation of rules of origin certain key characteristics of contemporary globalized manufacturing may also prove challenging to the roo process and its implementation pro cedures these key characteristics include multinational manufacturing the subcontracting of manufacturing and highlycompetitive manufacturing some observers mention that the combined effects of these three characteristics have created globalized manufacturing environment that is sufficiently intricate and flexible to make the application of roo more complex potentially misleading or both in addition businesses operating in the current gl obalized manufacturing environment are increasingly able to respond to changes in us trade policies by manipulating their supply chains in ways that are able to circumvent the intended goals and objectives of those policies this report first provides general overview of the us roo system including its implementation as it pplies to manufactured impor ts second advantages and disadvantages of the roo schemes as implemented by the united states are also discussed third the report illustrates ways in which the application of the rules ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34524crs2 2 19 cfr 1341 the customs territory of th united states is defined in general

forefront of the continuing bates on trade liberalization or globalization nevertheless the role of roo schemes both preferen tial and nonpref erential is central to the international trading system and trade negotiations in order for goods to receive the benefits of trade agreements which the united states has entered into or trade preferences that the united states grants to certain countries

including government procurement laws trade reme dy actions country of origin labeling requirements and other provisions the roo methodology employed in deter mining country of origin has become matter of debate among economists and other trade policy experts for several reasons first the united states has ente red into number of bilateral and regional free trade agreementseach with its own preferential roo schemewhich adds new complexities for importers and manufacturers desiring to benefit from these agreements thus inserting economic inefficiencies into the international trading system second since cbp has little legisl ative guidance in interpreting roo the agency often makes casebycase country of origin determinati ons based on its own regulations and precedents some impor

environment in which components of g oods originate in many countries and assembly occurs in completely different country some observers suggest that one country origin determinati ons may be misleading in some respects fourth some express concern that current systems for determining country of origin may run counter to or may be insufficient to enfo rce other us trade policies or trade objectives proliferation of preferential roo the intent of preferential ru of origin is to ensure that goods from countries that qualify for dutyfree or reduced rates of duty under preference or fta are able to receive these favorable ta riff benefits and that products from countries that are not parties to the agreement or preference are excluded concerns about inefficiency since preferential rules of origin are fta or trade preference specific assembling the proper documentation to ensure that products qualify for benefits under one of these programs can be very complex and costly process some in the business community mention that the administrative costs associated with navigating the increasingly complex patchwork of regulations involved in establishing origin can outweigh the tariff benefits of ftas23 some economists also complain that the proliferation of ftas between trading partners has led to an inefficient spaghetti bowl approach to trade policyto large degree because of rules of origin requirements24 the lack of transparency of preferential roo is also matter of concern for some an oftenrepeated example of this is this is the socalled tripletrans formation rule for apparel products within the nafta meaning that the raw materials fiber the cloth and the garment itself must all be processed within the fta region in order to be naftaeligible25 the triple transformation rule is not immediately discernable to th average person nor are the costs of compliance however others might argue that ftas can still provide importers with greater flexibility in sourcing goods and more co steffective means of entering the us market importers always have the option of importing products under mfn in which case nonpreferential rules of origin would apply stat us if they determine that this is the most costeffective method of try therefore an fta could be seen as providing importers and manufacturers with additiona l flexibility in choosinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34524crs8 26 kunimoto robert and sawchuck gary nafta rules of origin government of canada policy research initiative discussion paper june 2005 pp 67 27 ibid p 3 28 ibid 29 krisha kala understanding rules of origin european financial management association efma meetin gs helsinki 2003 p 1 30 ibidsuppliers as well as modes of entry i under preferential or nonpreferential roo importers can weigh the costs of compliance combined with the more favorable fta tariff rate against impor ting goods from suppliers outside the fta for example study of rules of origin under the nafta illustrated that when the mfn tariff on product is equal or more fa vorable than the nafta tariff importers will typically choose to import under the mfn rate in order to avoid the additional compliance costs however when importers determine that the nafta rate plus additional transaction costs is more favorable they choose to enter the goods under the nafta26 importers may in some cases decide not to enter goods under an fta but the availability of such preferences gives them greater flexibility to purchase and import products in the most costeffective manner available the fact remains however that the utilization of trade preferences under preferential rules of origin is sometimes costly and can inhibit the use of preferences in some cases in addition from trade policy perspectiv preferential rules of origin are essential to reserve the bene fits of an fta for those c ountries who have entered into the agreement without preferential r oo it would be possible for imports from nonfta countries to enter the fta partner w ith the lowest external tariff and then serve the rest of the region under the fta rate this could force convergence of external tariffs and possibly competitive devaluation of external tariffs in the region27 therefore preferential roo have pivotal role in 1 reserving the benefits of the fta for those countries who have tered into the agreement and 2 ensuring that each fta party can maintain separate and independent external trade policy28 the key challenges of constructing rule s of origin in preferential trading relationships therefore are first finding the balance between the effectiveness and the efficiency of roo and second s implifying them and making them more transparent influence of domestic industries some critics of rules of origin tests used in ftas allege that because roo are negotiated pr oduct by product and industry by industry there is enormous scope for wellorga nized industries to essentially insulate themselves from the effects of the fta by devising suitable roo thus diminishing its trade liberalizing effects overall29 as result more restrictive and often more complex roo are often crafted to compensate domestic manufacturers that stand to lose protection as result of an fta or preference30 in addition whole categories of goods may be completely restricte d however others state that such measures are often successful in softening the opposition from import competing groups thus enhancing the political feasibility of subsequent ftahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34524crs9 31 ibid 32 chase

nafta the science and art of political analysis new york columbia university press 1998 pp 157158 34 19 cfr 177implementation after congressional approval31 thus many supporters of ftas believe that the complexity of roo for cer tain products may be critical factor in garnering support for the fta in addition some studies indicate that more restrictive rules of origin such as higher local content requirements may so encourage producers of finished goods in an fta region to shift from lowercost s uppliers of intermedia goods outside the fta to highercost suppliers within the ft region often us suppliers in order to qualify for more favorable fta tariff be nefits thus more restrictive roo can be used to provide protection to these regional suppliers as well as maintain existing protection against outsiders to the extent that they provide sufficient incentive for fta producers to buy more inputs inside the region32 therefore more restrictive local or regional content requirements can spread the benefits of the fta to manufacturers of intermedia products in the region this in turn can lead to additional support for an fta within th domesticregional manufacturing sector the following example illustrates the interest that the us automobile sector demonstrated in influencing r oo during negotiations on the nafta all three us automakers had an interest in reasonably high rule of origin to make it more difficult for european and ja panese competitors to locate assembly plants in canada or mexico and thereby ship finished autom obiles to the united states dutyfree but gm differed from ch rysler because of its joint venture with isuzu in canada gm favored lower rule of origin around 60 percent regional content requirement for reasons that reflected their own patterns of production and competitive position ford and chrysler preferred higher rule approximately 70 percent auto parts makers had every incentive to push for as high as percentage as possible ce high percentages protected them from foreign competitors33 cbp country of origin determinations country of origin rulings can be quite complex and lengthy especially when questions on what processes

facts36 proposed changes in january 1991 cbp then known as the us customs service began proposing more simplified and standardized rules for determining origin when it put forward ru intended to replace the present country of origin rules with more objective and transparent standards which will provide greater certainty and predictability for both the trade community and the customs service in making country of origin dete rminations required under existing laws and regulations37 this proposal applied only to terminations involving goods that were wholly obtained or pr oduced in single country 38 on january 3 1994 the customs service established interim regulations for determining when the country of origin of good is one of the parties of the north american free trade agreement nafta in order to fulfill an obligation under annex 311 of the nafta that provided that all parties should establish marking rules to determine when goods originate in nafta country39 on the same date the customs service published an add itional notice that proposed amending its existing origin rules so that they would be more objective and transparent and thereby to provide greater certainty and predictability for both the trade community and the customs service as required under existing laws and regulations40 customs acknowledged that application of the substa ntial transformation ru as applied on casebycase basis when an article is not wholly the growth product or manufacture of one country often invol ves subjective judgements as to what constitutes new and different article or as to whether processing has resulted in an new name character and use41 in particular cbp suggested that the interim rules of origin used to implement the nafta commitment mentioned above be applied to

contributed to major transformation of modern manufacturing new manufacturing techniques have made it possible for less skilled workers to manufacture higher quality products with little waste or loss

locations to the site of final assembly making the manufacturing process more complex and intricate as result an in creasing variety of produc ts incorporate parts and components from many different

manuf acturing process toward subcontracting or outsourcing production for many light consumer goods such as toys and electronics major retailers or brandname distributors tr aditionally considered us companies have disengaged themselves from direct participation in the manufacturing of their products relying instead on global trading companies to manage their product supply chains well known

the finished ipod was generally considered product of china the last place of substantial transformation effects on rules of origin as illustrated above in the increasingly global manufacturing environment the assembly point of th manufactured product and of its individual components are frequently different these rapidly accelerating changes in the manufacturing process can lead to additional complexities in roo determinations because officials must ascr ibe origin to single country for import purposes in turn these complexities can lead to apparent inconsistencies for example in some cases cbp officials may decide that the assembly process the value added by labor costs is sufficient to confer origin as it is the last place of substantial transformation59 in other cases officials have determined that the final assembly process and labor costs incurred are actually not sufficient to confer this essential character60 on the other hand since cbp has the legal flexibility to be able to consider the totality of the circumstances and makes such decisions on casebycase basis the agency is able to fully consider the extent and technical nature of the processing that occurs in each country thus taking in to account the resources expended on product design and development exte nt and nature of postasse mbly inspection procedures and worker skill required during the actual manufacturing process when making country of origin determinations61 therefore the flexibility to analyze individual components and manufacturing processes could lead to more precise

objectives in the modern manufacturing environment us or multinational company responsible for product design and manufacture may have very little knowledge about where and how imported goods are made because the actual manufacture of the products has been subcontracted to gl obal manufacturing comp any that operates in many countries while some major retailers and brandname distributors have established social responsibility codes and employ vendor compliance officers to make sure that contracted f actories comply with agreed codes of conduct others rely on their global trading companies to ensu re that their products are being made according to their corporate rules and pro cedures while the origin of the product might be easily determined ie as the last place of substantial transformation for mfn purposes the possible lack of knowledge about intermediate steps in the manufacturing of the product can pose cerns for product safety and in some cases import security in addition the global manufacturing market can be very responsive to changes in economic conditions such as the imposition of trade remedies and trade embargoes multinational manufacturers are increasingly able to shift the location of their operations in such way that they are able to receive country of origin determination that would void the additional duties payable in an antidumping case or fend off any barriers to entry caused by trade embargo62 this may be the reason that more trade remedy cases are brought forward on chemicals raw materials and intermediate goods rather than on fini shed manufactured goods or textiles and apparel63 quotas an oftenmentioned example of ci rcumvention of us quotas existed under the former world trade organiza tions multifibre agreement mfa and agreement on textiles and clothing atc64 under first the mfa and then the atc number of wto members includi ng the united states placed quantity quotas on clothing imports from number of countries in the case of the united states the trade policy objective was in part to protect the us textile and apparel industry and in part to pr ovide certain developing count ries with access to the us market which they would not otherwise ve however when one countrys quota was used up clothing manufacturers were of ten able to adjust the assembly of the apparel items being produced to obtain the

uppression of peaceful protests in burma legislation was introduced in both the hous of representatives and the senate to further tighten economic and trade sanctions on the military junta in power65 these bills include language to block the import of products made using precious gemstones mined and lumber harvested in burma such legislation was deemed necessary because the the burmese freedom and

states provided that they are cut polishe d or otherwise sufficiently transformed in third country such as india china or th ailand so that origin is conferred to that country another current issue dealing with enforcement of us policy objectives is the treatment of goods and pr oducts manufactured in the kaesong industrial complex kic located in north korea66 while the kic is physically located in north korea many of its manufacturin g operations are owned and run by south korean companies the south korean government has asked the united states to treat the products made in the kic by south

origin are central components of trade policy preferential rules of origin are especially important for ensu ring that only goods qualified to receive benefits under an fta receive those benefits and may also be constructed to ensure that importcompeting us producers are not adversely affected by the fta thus possibly assuring degree of public support for the measure nonpreferential rules are essential for making sure that goods coming from countries that enjoy mfn status with the united states are charged the proper tariffs and are also key to supporting other us trade laws such as country of origin labeling at present cbp makes country of orig in determinations primarily based on an established body of regulato ry and legal precedents for many imports determining origin is relatively straightforward howe ver if the matter is in doubt the origin question is decided on casebycase basis with input records and samples provided by the importer of record although origin rulings are very facts pecific there is sometimes uncertainty over what will be deemed as substan tial transformation businesses sometimes criticize cbp and the current process as lacking clarity consistency and predictability72 additionally given the expanding use of preferential roo as the united states potentially enters into add itional ftas determinin g country of origin or waiting for

differ ences congress could through legislation or other means encourage the administration to exercise leadership in this area with view toward reaching resolution to these negotiations in fact one of the principal negotiating objectives set forth in the trade ac t of 2002 was the conclusion of an agreement on rules of origin74 the lack of transparency and apparent economic inefficiency of preferential rules of origin continue to be matter of concern for some however as the ustr recently announced the nafta partners imp lemented liberalizing changes to the nafta rules of origin including certa in apparel products covering about 15 billion in annual trila teral trade and the nafta free trade commission agreed in august 2007 on another set of liberalizing changes to the nafta rules of origin covering over 100 billion to be implemented some time in 200875 this illustrates that it is possible for preferential roo to be simplified through mutual agreement of the parties even after an fta is implement ed if congress desires to provide greater preferential access to the us market and gain reciprocal access to the markets of trading partners it could encourage further liberalizing preferential rules of origin and could also encourage us negotiators to develop uniform set of preferential roo or roo template to be applied in future fta negotiations since the processes of globalization scribed above are likely to continue making origin determinations even more complex congress might also consider providing cbp with additiona l legislative guidance especially in the area of non preferential rules however such efforts may adversely affect importers and manufactures who benefit from the current system in addition even though the determination process may be complex and lengthy cbp now has the flexibility to examine the complete manufacturing pr ocess including design sources of intermediate components labor costs and assembly processes in order to make its country of origin determination some trade policy analysts have called for the liberalization or abolition of preferential rules of origin others advocat the abolition of rules of origin entirely because they inject large amount of inefficiency in th world trading system and because they can effectively serve as form of protection for importcompeting industries this approach might be the simplest way of count eracting the negative effects of preferential roo for example by excluding sensitive products from trade preference schemes76 some observers argue for the multilateral elimination of tariffs which they say would eliminate the need for roo entirely77 however the end of tariffs would automatically lead to the end of all preference programs and the benefits of ftas as well because the gains that accrue to these trading relationships are largely based on receipt of more favor able tariffs or dutyfree access of goodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34524crs20 in addition eliminating rules of origin tirely could pose issues for other trade policy objectives such as country of orig in labeling implemen ting trade
