is highly volatile naturallyoccurring element it is potent neurotoxin that can cause brain lung and kidney damage mercury also has properties that make it usef ul in variety of house hold medical and industrial products and processes it is compone nt in such products as thermometers flourescent lamps electrical switches dental fillings and batteries this report discusses the health effects of mercury how it is released into the environment and current federal and state activities and recent legisla tive activity in congress to control mercury releases into the environment humanrelated activities have significantly changed the natural distribution of mercury in the environment for example mercury is released during manufacturing processes or when mercurycontaining pr oducts are ultimately discarded as waste significant sources of mercury include coalburning power plants cement manufacturing operations and the incineration of munici pal hazardous and medical wastes for discussion of air emi ssions of mercury see crs report rl31881 after mercury vapors enter the air they are ultimately converted to the highly toxic methylmercury exposure to methylmercury can cause wide array of health problems including damage to the brain and central nervous system potential sources of human exposure to mercury incl ude eating fish or shellfish contaminated with methylmercury breathing mercury vapor from spills or contaminated workplace or absorbing mercury through dental work both federal and state regulations gove rn the use of mercury in products and manufacturing processes fede ral regulation is done under the authority of several statutes and multiple agencies regulations are intended to control releases of mercury to the environment reduce or liminate the use of mercury in products or specify disposal requirements also th us environmental protection agency epa has established voluntary efforts nd education outreach programs aimed at reducing the use of mercury in products and manufacturing pro cesses and at better managing mercuryc ontaining wastes recent legislative activity by states has gone beyond the healthbased criteria associated with the use or disposal of pa rticular products inst ead many states are trying to reduce the problems associated with mercury by restricting its use altogether for example some states ve banned mercury use or required warning labels on certain mercuryc ontaining products some st ates have also implemented recycling or disposal requirements for certa in types of mercury containing products recent legislative activity at the fede ral level has mirrore d activities undertaken by many states bills introduced in the 108th congress seek to reduce the use of mercury in such products as thermometers lighting produc ts and dental fillings and to provide warning labels on mercurycontaining products legislation has also been proposed requiring that mercurycontaining waste be removed from the waste

highly volatile naturallyoccurring element it is potent neurotoxin that can cause brain lung and kidney damage mercur exists in three forms elemental metallic organic and inorganic all forms of mercury are toxic but the degree to which it is toxic to humans depends on the form it takes this report discusses the health effects of mercury how it is released into the environment and current fe deral and state activities and recent legislative activity in congress to control mercury re leases into the environment elemental mercury is distributed throug hout the environment naturally by such processes as volcanic activity movement of rivers lakes and streams and biological processes since the industrial revoluti on the distribution of mercury has changed significantly due to humanrelated nthropogenic activities for example elemental mercury is used in manufactur ing processes such as the production of chlorine gas and caustic soda known as ch loralkali production it may also be an added ingredient in det onating devices cosmetics pharmaceuticals blood pressure devices electrical switches thermometers fluorescent lights dental fillings and batteries during such processes the us or accidental spill of mercury allows it to vaporize once it is released into the atmosphere elementa l mercury may undergo photochemical reaction that transf orms it into inorganic mercury inorganic mercury vapors are introduced to the environment through additional anthropogenic sources such as coalbur ning power plants mining operations cement manufacturing operations and the inci neration of municipal hazardous and medical wastes inorganic mercury may also migrate to water or soil after mercury containing wastes are disposed of on land when airborne inorganic mercury is ev entually deposited on land or into water where it may be transformed into the highly toxic organic form methylmercury this process which is not complete ly underst ood is known as methylation methylation is microbial process controlled by certain bacteria and enhanced by chemical and environmental variables such as the presence of organic matter and oxygen1 methylmercury poses particular risk because it concentrates in animal tissue as it moves up the food chain process known as bioaccumulationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31908crs2 2 second national report on human exposure to environmental chemicals us

agency for toxic substances and disease registry toxfaqs on mercury april 1999health effects of mercury the health effects of mercury on humans depend on the form of mercury and the intensity and length of time of exposure2 humans may be exposed to mercury by breat hing its vapors through ingestion or by absorption through the skin the nervous sy stem is sensitive to all forms of mercury exposure to elemental mercury vapors and to methlymercury is more harmful than others because the mercury in these form s is capable of reaching the brain and potentially causing permanent damage3 selected health effects of mercury specific to each form are summarized in table 1 table 1 selected health effects of mercury mercury typeprimary exposure route health impacts elemental vapor inhalation and absorption through the lungs readily enters the bloodstream and crosses the bloodbrain barriershortterm exposure to high levels can damage the lungs longterm exposure to low levels can cause neurological damage inorganic ingestion and absorption through the gastrointestinal tractpotentially toxic to the kidneys neurological and behavioral disorders possible organic methylmercuryingestion and rapid and extensive absorption through the gastrointestinal tract readily enters the bloodstream and crosses the bloodbrain barrierhighly toxic and potentially damaging to the nervous system especially in the developing nervous system of fetus or child under six source table prepared by the congressional research service crs based on data from the us health and human services agency for toxic substances and disease registry and centers for disease control and prevention and from the us environmental protection agency epa december 1997 mercury study report to congress human exposure to mercury would likel come from one or more of the following sources eating fish or shellfish contaminated with methylmercury breathing vapor from mercury spills eg from broken fever thermometersor contaminated workplace air eg dent or health services industries that use mercurycontaining devices or chloralkali plants and absorbing mercury through dental work or

is discussed by epa in its report background information on mercury sources and regulations available online at httpwwwepagovgrtlakesbnsdocs mercsrcemercreghtml undatedmercury in products and waste mercury conducts electricity is liquid at room temperature combines easily with other metals and ex pands and contracts evenly with temperature changes these properties make mercury useful in variety of household medical and i ndustrial products and processes for example mercury is an added component in electrical switches thermostats cosmetics pharmaceuticals dental amalgams scientific instruments thermometers and mercury vapor lamps eg fluorescent or high intensity discharge lamps in 2001 manufacturers within the united states used between 200 and 300 metric tons of mercury as part of their manufacturing pro cesses or to create products that rely on mercurys properties4 while coalfired power plants are the greatest single source of air emissions of mercury significant mercury re leases to air land and water are also attributed to the use of mercury in products and manufacturing processes in such cases mercury is released during manufacturing either from processes where the mercury is exposed to air or when mercurycontaining produc ts are broken while in use mercury releases also occur when mercurycontaining produc ts are ultimately discarded as waste either through land disposal or inci neration for discussion of air emissions of mercury see crs report rl31881 mercu ry emissions to the air background and legislative proposals currently there are limited choices for the management of mercurycontaining wastes essentially it can be incinerated disposed of or stored longterm on land or recycled each option ultimately returns the mercury to the environment as an element it does not degrade and cannot be eliminated from the waste cycle once it is introduced it can only change forms federal and state regulation of mercury both federal and state regulations gove rn the use of mercury in products and manufacturing processes thos requirements regulate mercury either directly or indirectly5 regulations with direct impact on mercury involve restrictions or requirements related to the use or release of mercury in products or manufacturing processes for example the regu lations promulgated under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 42 usc 321 established handling and disposal requirements for mercurycontaining wastes the indirect regulation of mercury is achieved through setting health and risk based environmental standa rds environmental standards specify maximum acceptable mercury concentration limits for cer tain media merc ury limits that have been established include those for groundwater and drinking water fish tissue and mercurycontaining waste disposed of in landfills standards indirectly regulate mercury because they do not specify how certain limit must be achieved forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31908crs4 6 40 cfr 14162example the maximum contaminant level for mercury in drinking water established under the safe drinking wa ter act 42 usc 300f is 002 milligrams per liter6 it is left up to public water systems to determine how they will reduce mercury concentrations if they are above this level federal regulati on of mercury federal regulati on of mercury is done under the authority of several statutes regulations to c ontrol releases of mercury to the environment are generally centered ar ound healthbased criteria regulations may also serve to reduce or eliminate the use of mercury in products or to specify disposal requirements for example rcra and the clean air act 42 usc 7401 have provisions intended to reduce or control releases of hazardous constituents to the environment including mercury also limitations on rcuryadded products have been specified in regulations pr omulgated under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 7 usc 135 and the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca 21 usc 301 the regulation of mercury also falls unde r more than one agencys jurisdiction for example epa regulates mercury in pesticides and mercury releases to air water and land the food and drug administra tion fda regulates mercury in drugs cosmetics food and dental products the occupational safety and health administration osha regulates mercury air exposures in the workplace federal requirements regulating mercury are summarized in table 2 table 2 federal regulation of mercury statutory authorityrequirements regarding the use or release of mercury pursuant to attendant regulations federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 7 usc 135 1972 banned or phased out the use of mercury in paints and certain pesticides federal food drug and cosmetic act

httpwwwepagovgrtlakesbnsdocsmercsrcemercreghtml undated voluntary activities init iated or funded by epa in addition to regulatory requirements epa is pursuing number of voluntary initiatives to reduce or eliminate the industrial uses of mercury epa is also participating in variety of outreach programs aimed at educating sectors of the population that either manufacture or use mercuryc ontaining products following is sample of voluntary mercuryreduction and ducationaloutreach activ ities initiated by epa epa identified mercury as one of the persistent bioaccumulative toxic pbt chemicals being targeted as priority pbt as such epa has issued draft national action plan for mercury aimed at reducing the intentional introduction of mercury into all environmental media ie air water land7 draft strategy to monitor pbts is anticipated by the end of 2003 on september 9 2002 epa identified 30 priority chemicals including mercury that are commonly found in zardous wastes epa is working with manufacturers to either voluntarily reduce the use of those chemicals by 50 or to eliminate them from pr oduction processes altogether the united states through epa and cana da have been working jointly since 1997 to reduce certain target pollutants including mercury in march 2003 the great lakes binational toxics st rategy 2002 was released to report on the progress in achieving the polluti on reduction goals established under the joint strategy8 the us goal of 50 reduction in national mercury emissions by 2006 was nearly met at 40 the us goal of reducing the national use of mercury by 50 was exceeded9 in 1999 with funding from epas great lakes national program office the university of wisconsin extensions solid and hazardous waste education center developed mercury in school s educational outreach project key project activities included creating and maintaining basinwide clearinghouse for information on reducin g mercury usage increasing mercury recycling and improving mercury management in schools and educating students and teachers bout eliminating mercury in 2001 funding was provided by epa to extend the merc ury in schools education and outreach program nationwidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31908crs7 10 for more information about hospitals for healthy envir onment h2e see httpwwwh2eonlineorg on june 24 1998 epa and the american hospital association aha signed memorandum of understanding to dvance pollution prevention efforts in us health care facilities one goal of the agreement was the virtual elimination of mercurycontaining waste from health care facilities waste streams by 2005 the agreement also led to the creation of hospitals for healthy environment whose aim is to educate health care professionals about pollution prevention opportunities in hos pitals and health care systems10 state actions to control mercury due to the method in which mercury is transported through the environment it is deposited in some areas of the us in greater concentrations than others this makes potential mercury contamination local or regional issue accordin g to epas 1997 mercury study report to congress the following geographical areas were determined to have the highest annual rate of position of mercury the southern great lakes and ohio river valley the northeast and southern new england and scattered areas in the south with the most elevated deposition occurring in the miami and tampa areas the potential for regional impacts is one reason many states have enacted their own legislation aimed at c ontrolling mercury recently veral states have moved beyond the healthbased criteri associated with the use or disposal of particular products instead they are looking to redu ce waste disposal probl ems by restricting mercury use altogether for example great lakes states such as minnesota are banning or limiting the sale of certain mercurycontaini ng products and imposing recycling requirements and dispos restrictions on others table 3 summarizes the types of legislation enacted in selected states or activities undertaken by state organizations to control mercury

not been reintroduced in the 108th the bills dealt with mercury storage and disposal and the reevaluation of safe levels of mercury in seafood those bills were the merc ury storage and safe disposal act of 2001 hr 2266 the seafood safety and mercury screening act of 2002 hr 3885 and the mercurysafe seafood act of 2001 s 555 13 the amount of mercury in an individual vaccine is small however the fda announced in june 1999 that infants given multiple thimerosalpreserved vaccines were exposed to mercury levels that exceeded epa safety guid elines the fda national institutes of health nih centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the american academy of pediatrics have urged vaccine manufacturers to reduce or eliminate thimerosal in vaccines as soon as possible deadline has been spec ified for more information see the fdas report thimerosal in vaccines at h ttpwwwfdagovcbervaccinethimerosalhtmrecent legislative action variety of legislative proposals have been introduced in congress to minimize or eliminate the use of mercury generally the legislation is aimed at protecting children from exposure to mercury or at reducing mercury in products or waste11 recently introduced legislation relate d to mercury is summarized below12 legislation aimed at protecting children the leave child behind act of 2003 hr 936 and s 448 introduced on february 26 2003 by representative george m iller and senator christophe r dodd proposes to amend section 313f of the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra 42 usc 11023f these bills would require the epa administrator to establish reporting thresholds for releases of specific toxic chemicals including mercury that the administrator deter mines may present significant risk to childrens health or the environment depe nding upon the persistent use or existence of that chemical in the environment there has been legislative activity in both the 107th and 108th congress related to the use of mercury in childhood vaccines particularly the presence of the mercury containing preservative thimerosal pr ovision added to the homeland security act pl 107296 which revised the public h ealth service act 42 usc 300 was interpreted as protecting vaccine manuf acturers from potentia l financial liability related to the use of thimerosal the preservative is added to formulations for influenza diphtheriatetanus tetanus hepatitis b and rabies13 opponents of the provision argued that it would effectively end lawsuits for injuries caused to children after multiple mercury exposur from thimerosal in infant vaccines on january 10 2003 senators olympia snowe susan co llins and lincoln chafee announced an agreement with senate leadership to address concerns that arose from the addition of the vaccinerelated language the nguage in pl 107296 was subsequently removed in the consolidated appropria tions resolution for 2003 pl 1087 on march 19 2003 representative dan bu rton introduced the national vaccine injury compensation progra m improvement act of 2003 hr 1349 the bill would amend the public health service act 42 usc 300 with respect to the national vaccine injury compensation program vicp by extending the statute ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31908crs10 14 see representative burtons dear colleag ue letter regarding facts and fiction about thimerosal in vaccines printed on the autism society of washington web page at httpwwwautismsocietyofwaorgnewscongresshtmlimitations on filing claims for vaccinerelated injuries and increasing the base amount of funding available to those in jured while the bill does not refer to concerns about thimerosal specifically representative burton has discussed in hearings and publications the connecti on between the exposure to the mercury containing preservative and neurological developmental disorders of autism and speech and language delays14 legislation aimed at reducing mercury in products or waste the omnibus mercury emissions reduction ac t s 484 introduced on february 27 2003 by senators patrick leahy and olym pia snowe pr oposes to am end section 3002 of the solid waste disposal act 42 usc 6922 the bill intends to reduce releases of mercury from all major sources of air emissions including solid waste incinerators to does so the bill requires the epa administrator to identify mercury containing materials that must be separated from the waste stream before incineration the list must include mercurycontaining items such as fluorescent light bulbs and tubes batteries pharmaceuticals laboratory chemicals and reagents electrical devices such as thermostats relays and switches and medical and scientific instruments to facilitate separation the bill requires rcurycontaining materials to be labeled to indicate mercury content further the bill requires the phaseout of mercury in consumer products within three years allowing for the possibility of exceptions for essential uses the legislation also includes provision prohibiting the defense department from selling mercury currently in the national defense stockpile the mercury reduction act of 2003 s 616 introduced on march 13 2003 by senator susan collins proposes to amend the solid waste disposal act the bill calls for nationwide ban on the sale of mercury fever thermome ters it would also provide grants for exchange programs to help consumers exchange mercury thermometers for digital thermometers the bill directs epa to ensure that the mercury is properly collected and stored as opposed to recycled and reintroduced in commerce in order to keep it out of the environment the bill would also create multiagency task force on mercury to address the issue of longterm management of surplus mercury from such sources as thermometers stores held by the departments of defense and energy nd other medical comme rcial or industrial sources the bill was approved by the senate environment and public works committee by voice vote on april 9 2003 s imilar legislation s 351 was passed by the senate in the 107th congress but was not considered by the house the next generation lighting initiativ s 167 introduced on january 15 2003 by senator jeff bingaman has the obj ective of developing by 2012 advanced solidstate lighting technologies based on whitelighte mitting diodes such lighting would be required to meet certain illumination criteria and not contain harmful pollutants such as mercury found in current lighting products eg fluorescent lamps research to develop lighting that meets the bills objectives would be carried out by consortium of private firms trade associations and institutions of higher education chosen by the secr etary of energy similar component is in the energyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31908crs11 policy act of 2003 hr 6 as passed by the house on april 11 2003 while the bill deals with broad range of energy related issues part 2 section 21111 proposes the same next generation lighting requi rements as those delineated in s 167 the mercury in dental filling disc losure and prohibition act hr1680 introduced on april 8 2003 by representa tive diane watson would amend section 501 of the federal food drug and cosmetic act 21 usc 351 the bill proposes to prohibit the introduction into interstate commerce of mercury intended for use in dental fillings after january 1 2008 effective december 31 2004 the bill also would require mercurycontaini ng dental amalgams to be labeled with information regarding the health effects related to mercury conclusion mercury is potent neurotoxin that can be harmful both to humans and the environment the primary route by whic h humans are exposed to mercury is from eating fish contaminated with methylmercury humans may also be exposed to elemental mercury vapor in either the workplace or through the use of mercury containing consumer products eg in ntal amalgams or broken flourescent bulbs or fever thermometers once mercury is introduced into the environment it cannot be removed however it can transform into more toxic forms such as methylmercury particularly when it is introduced into the environment through anthropogenic means both federal and state authorities have taken action to control the introduction of mercury into the environm ent that originates from the use of mercury in products and manufacturing processes the current tr end in many federal and state legislative actions is to reduce mercury releases by eliminating it altogether either from its use in manufacturing processes or as an added component to products many states have passed such legislation few federal initiatives have been enacted into law
