delaying the passage of the re maining fy2005 appropriation bills the house appropriations committee reached an agreem ent on its 13 appropr iations subcommittee allocations in may howeve r the senate did not reach an agreement on its subcommittee allocations until september 2004 how the h ouse and senate resolve their differences regarding rd funding remains to be s een one approach that legislators have traditionally used would be for the house and senate agreeing to split the difference in their funding proposals as indicated in the ta ble this approach would result in number of civilian rd agencies receiving increases or actual declines below fy2004 funding levels to ddress these concerns the senate approved an additional 81 billion in spending for three fy2005

civilian agencies would see their rd budg ets decline below fy2004 levels the president reportedly has told congressional republicans to finish the remaining 9 appropriations bills quickly in the

thanksgiving when the special session is scheduled to nd at fy2004 levels some senate aides have stated that the president wants higher di scretionary spending vels than approved by congress including the restoration of hous nasa cuts associated with his moonmars initiative consequently some speculate that congress is likely to approve higher spending caps along with acrosstheboard cuts for civilian discretionary spending that will help to bring tota l discretionary spending closer to 821 billion7 limitations on rd activities the current cr allows agencies without enacted fy2005 appropriations to fund exis ting rd programs and activities at fy2004 funding levels however the resolution pr ohibits agencies from funding new research programs or new initiatives until their fy2005 appropriations bills are passed by congress in general under the continuing resolution new projects or initiatives that had been planned for fy2005 can be funded furt her some agencies representatives are concerned that if the proposed 35 federa l pay raise goes through and rd funding does not increase it will have big impact on the agencies ability to fund additional personnel and needed infrastructure includi ng information technology infrastructure 8 the cr has forced some agencies to put off construction of new facilities or stop construction until their respective fy2005 ppropriations bills ar passed construction has moved forward with those programs that have been fully funded but not others for example representative from nsf stated that to keep major research and facilities construction on track nsf might have to request formal reprogramming to cover increasing costs for some ongoing projects9 further while most civilian rd agencies will continue their request for research pr oposal activities many will have to delay or restrict the number of awards given until they know the fate of their fy2005 budget request representatives fro m nist have indicated that they have enough fy2004 funding to maintain the at p program until late november if congress does not provide fy2005 f unding for atp by the end of d ecember nist would have to initiate procedures for terminating the program10 for some agencies like the national science foundation nsf there has been some concer n that budget uncertainties might affect its ability to recruit top graduate students

of federal rd spending while civilian rd would decline to 552 billion or to 42 of total federal rd spending11 this represents the first decline in federal civilian rd funding since 1995there is some concern that the bush administration may be increasing defense rd at the expense of ci vilian rd primarily because most of the increase in defense rd is for the developm ent of weapons systems that arguably have little impact on the discovery of new knowle dge and the transfer of technological innovation to the commercial market place this issue was raised during the reagan administration when
