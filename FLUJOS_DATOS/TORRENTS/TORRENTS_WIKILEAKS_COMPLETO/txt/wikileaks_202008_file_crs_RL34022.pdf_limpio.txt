remainder of the subaccounts were presumably funded at their fy2006 level however if funded at the fy2006 level the sum of the setasides would not have equaled the total provided to the account 15905 million compared to 15920 m illion the fy2007 supplemental appropriations act pl 11028 amended the fy2007 yearlong cr to provide 1282 million for administrative fees compared to the fy2006 level of

appropriation provided for use in the next fiscal year in fy2007 the advance provided for fy2008 4193 million was 7 million less than the advance available from fy2006 4200 million this leaves 7 million more available in fy2007 than would have been available if the advances had been equal as they had been in recent years this 7 million was not allocated in the fy2007 appropriations law leaving the discretion to hud as to how to use the funds it is unclear how those funds were allocated for more information see discussion under heading advance appropriation below the setasides within this account total to 16436 7 million less than the amount shown here the reason for the discrepancy involves the treatment of an advance appropriation as noted in table note d in fy2007 4193 million was provided in advance appropriations for fy2008 in fy2008 the conferees proposed providing 4 200 million for fy2009 the difference between the two amounts 7 million would not have been available until fy2009 and was therefore not included in the total fo r more information see discussion under heading advance appropriation below f the setasides within this account total to 16426 m illion 35 million more than the total for the account shown here the reason for the discrepancy involves the treatment of an advance appropriation the advance appropriation provided in fy2007 for use in fy2008 was 4193 million while the amount provided in fy2008 for use in fy2009 was 4158 million the difference between the two amounts 35 million is available for use in fy2008 but is not considered new budget authority authorized by the appropriations act so it is not included in the total for the account for more informatio n see discussion under heading advance appropriation below g the amount actually available for renewals is 723 million less than the amount shown here 13971 because the enacted appropriations law includes rescission of 723 million in advance appropriations provided in fy2007 for use in fy2008 because of the way that congress designed the allocation formula that reduction will be taken from renewal funds see discussion under the heading voucher renewals below advance appropriation each year for the past several years the tenant based rental assistance account has incl uded an advance appr opriation generally congress provides the account with new budget authority equal to an amount of funding available to be used in the curre nt fiscal year as well as an advance appropriation to be used in the subseque nt fiscal year and each year the amount of budget authority newly available for the account is equal to the amount of funding provided for use in the curre nt fiscal year plus the advance appropr iation provided in the previous fiscal year for most ears the advance available from the prior year and the advance that is provided for the subsequent year has been the same 42 billion as result the new budget authority for the tenantbased rental assistance account has equaled the budget authority newly available for the account each fiscal year for example as shown in table 4 the fy2006 appropriations act authorized 11374 million in new
