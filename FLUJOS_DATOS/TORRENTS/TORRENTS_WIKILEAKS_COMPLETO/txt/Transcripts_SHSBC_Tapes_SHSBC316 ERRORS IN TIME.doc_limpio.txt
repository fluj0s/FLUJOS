errors in time lecture given on 18 july 1963 well glad to see you all here dry summer summers gone now you know i find out when summer is gone by watching the banyan tree its on the other side of the house there and when its leaves start to turn brown why we know autumn is amongst us so break out your boots and dogsleds this is what audience eighteen july eighteen july ad 13 saint hill special briefing course and another lecture on dating now ive already told you ive already told you that dating is very highcaliber activity very important in auditing and that the tone arm sticks only because of wrong dates got that thats really the real reason tone arms stick frankly its the only reason tone arms stick and you might have asked yourself some time or another if you do have this much track why does everybody around believe so implicitly that they have lived only once see it might seem rather odd to you that the insistence on this fact that people have lived only once the near psychotic frenzy with which people go into insisting they have lived only once it must really take something to shut off somebodys memory to that degree it really must take something actually gpm doesnt account for it the goal to be dead in the gpms is not enough because that doesnt say youve lived only once that just tells you to be dead so you might ask yourself why is it that man is so wrongdated now when i was able to run down the common denominator of people who cant run on the time track i found out that the common denominator was not whether or not they got sonic and visio but whether or not they got tone arm motion very good weve just covered that in lecture and the reason they dont get tone arm motion is wrong time wrong dates all right so much for that behind all aberration there must be lie and you can mark that down in letters of fire aberration cannot exist in the presence of truth aberration can only exist in the presence of lie if somebody is hung with lumbosis you can make very sure that there is lie connected with the lumbosis elementary my dear watson that is one of the common denominators of scientology that is one of the truisms one of the maxims something that weaves through everything there are others of similar nature for instance dont talk to pc or person or talk around person who is unconscious you know and its that sort of thing and want to know something about aberration thats better contribution than anything wuff wuff pavlov ever dreamed up didnt you know that was his name later part of his life you know his papers as far as im concerned go barkbarkbarkbark comma barkbarkbark comma barkbarkbark semicolon reg was kind enough to dig up some pavlov i wanted some pavlov i was studying how not to write up technical data i didnt know that was why i wanted pavlov i just knew it must be important to do some study on this and thats what i found i didnt find that dogs were very informative i know more about dogs than he does but i mean just as dogs dogs are friends of mine and he didnt like them but wuff wuff pavlov gives us marvelous example of how not to write up technical information its heroic man try it sometime he wanders all over the pastures and the fields and dales and so forth and he finally gets down to his something orother its much more important to him that he used surgery comparable to that applied to human beings when operating on dogs and he goes on at great length about the surgery precautions taken on his dogs and he was taking perfectly healthy happy dogs and cutting out half their bladder or half their esophagus or half of something he never could go all the way you know he and he admitted that this more or less damaged his laboratory animals and therefore he had to take surgical precautions and it isnt textbook on surgery hes giving of course the conditions of his experiment he never gets around to the experiment but anyway wuff wuff pavlov is marvelous example of lot of things he is man who is totally dedicated to the dramatization of one engram the darwinian theory man from mud hes physiologist turned psychologist and hes in wild protest against the psychologists because remember the psychologists of his day believed in the soul some of them were still around who did after all psychologist means psyche ologist and hes the great physiologist and you want to look at how you get aberrated because your neurons have turned into morons i was there trying to ask question im not wandering afield from what im talking about here i was trying to ask i was asking question why is it that the russians know nothing about some of the basic laws of social behavior why is it that they overlook these laws and i thought they have pavlov and pavlov stresses the salivation of the dog not his salvation his salivation thats all he was interested in the salivation of the dog when stimulated by beefsteak and the whining of the dog when beaten with clubs so they would he would mix these two stimulus response mechanisms up and so on and i wanted to know if pavlov had ever drawn the conclusion i havent found this out yet i cant wade through the stuff but if hed ever drawn the conclusion that reward was also part of existence that was what i was trying to draw do the russians know this is this part of the russian mental technology and apparently it is not and apparently that fact reads through pavlov without being punched up as near as i can tell he doesnt say existence consists of reward and punishment see that is not the thesis now thee and knowing more about this would immediately conceive that if somebody had dog salivating or whining under punishment or reward that he would conclude that there were two stimuli and one was reward and one was punishment but this is far too simple and pavlov never made these comparisons apparently as far as i can tell wading through the stuff isnt that interesting i consider that extremely fascinating because the whole russian system is caving in because they havent got this little factor of reward that is what is wrong with the russian communist system frankly thee and could probably sit down and figure out communist system that would be geewhizzer that would probably work the probably the fault is not with communism the fault is the lie which lies behind communism which is the physiological nature of man now with that lie back of communism communism becomes scourge see it becomes an aberration there are probably many things about communism that arent aberrative you could probably do lots of things with the idea of the communal activity of man you could probably do lot of things with collectivism we do things with collectivism we try to make it work the russians are not interested in making it work because theyve misunderstood the nature of man and this is not lecture on russia im just showing you the lie back of aberration so communism becomes fought and communism becomes very disastrous when practiced and the poor sods that are walking around with communism wonder where their next muzhik is coming from they dont know and thats because when pavlov did his work he never said that life consisted of reward and punishment he does total anatomy of punishment and heres this drifting factor reward which is apparently on automatic the reason capitalism works is because nobody has analyzed it and people want pay and they give them pay i almost started riot amongst bantus by telling them that if communism came to south africa this was real mean of why they wouldnt they wouldnt get paid that communisms didnt pay you for your work and they thought this was terrible and they were spitting on the street and stamping and damning khrushchev see i mean it was very upsetting to them because the one thing the very very commercial little culture the bantu has and boy you talk about the importance of debts some guy owes some money why that debt will be passed down and next generation and next generation somebodys greatgreatgreatgreat grandchildren are still worried about those two cows you see that uncle zidd or something is owed they just the idea of commerce and money and that sort of thing is very deeply ingrained in these people and to tell them that communism was system of getting them to work so they didnt have to be so they wouldnt be paid that just about finished it now if capitalism was earnest about fighting communism and so forth it would dig up few salient truths and let them have it see because that is the lie back of communism the lie back of communism is man is physiological animal going forward on the basis of punishment stimulus response and of course man does not does not respond to punishment stimulusresponse very ununiform response youve had the experience yourself you take somebody and you say if you dont soandso and soandso im going to raowrrfrrrrrhhrrrhhh and that you told this to cringed and said oh yes all right all right dont beat and b c and d said why you s knock your block off see youd knock their heads in and theyd get back up and they still wouldnt do it and you knock their heads in and they get back up and they still wouldnt do it and its not constant dont you see in other words not all living beings succumb to the stimulus of promised punishment the whole roman empire caved in because sect called the christians moved in who didnt stimuli or who didnt respo when they got the stimuli of punishment the court said were going to burn you at the stake and they said burn away we will become martyrs and the roman empire couldnt handle them that was it that was it see theyd met their theyd met their match very important extremely important now stimulusresponse then is half of the picture dont you see man does not go as total stimulusresponse mechanism down in various homely locales ive heard kin ketch more flies with honey then kin with vinegar youve heard that sort of thing well theyre talking about the reward part of existence see thats very important the reward part of existence now the christian had greater reward promised him than the punishment in the first place he had to die in order to go to heaven and he simply considered this very accommodating on the part of the roman empire and its courts it got him there that much quicker and so the roman empire could do nothing with the christian the christian overthrew the roman empire and it became the holy roman empire literally factually yes you see well there was lie there was lie involved then in the roman empire so it didnt it didnt survive and what was that lie well they must have been subscribing to the same thing pavlov was writing about that man is stimulusresponse creature who responds to punishment and threat of punishment and that to get something done you threaten or you punish and if you threaten and punish enough you will get things done well i will give it to the roman empire they got quite ways they got further than anybody else but there was lie involved there in that there wasnt whole statement of the proposition there was also reward and the funny part of it is that men will do more things for reward than they will for punishment so they had just cut out threequarters of the pie and then said that the remaining quarter of the pie was the totality of the pie and tried to carry an empire along on that basis and of course it folded and what do you know after all these years you think things change actually in this very finite period of time since the roman empire and the equally religious fervor of the communist russian empire you get the same fault cropping up so you have the philosophy which they adopt is the one which assures them that punishment is all they adopt this philosophy and they have immediately adopted something which gives them commercial upset economic upset and although theyre very clever people and have great deal on the ball on the subject of economics they say economics are ninetenths of life life is only onetenth political theyve got lot of things like this they have terrific propaganda machine they have practically every newspaper editor in the world working for them khrushchev has more press agents than any other single ruler in the world and yet in spite of all this on one of their collective farms they go around and take look at the tractor and its wheels have fallen off and they want to know wheres the tractor driver and they dont know where he is well hes down in the woods well wheres the woods whats who else is in the woods this manager will be saying and well hes down there and theyre picking berries oh theyre picking berries well all right and he goes down and he says to the guys down in the woods what are you doing picking berries and all the old women and everybody down there says well got to do something to make living and they found out that they can pick berries and put them in boxes and sell them in the local town and they can make couple of quick rubles see to hell with the collective farm see halfaruble reward for sweating it out in the woods picking berries is much better than noruble reward because theyre going to get their heads blown off if they dont drive the tractors and plow the fields see you get the idea so theyre running into this all the time this causes them then to go into terrific campaign of some kind or another you know they go into this terrific campaign what you want to be is the new man the total communist the this the that the those guys are just sweating themselves to pieces all the time and theyre trying to compensate for this lie they think capitalism produces in some peculiar and mysterious way more goods than communism and they dont know why this is theyve never analyzed why this is because pavlov didnt tell them capitalism has many many things wrong with it but it hasnt clipped off totally not until they invented internal revenue anyway the totality of award so you can still you can still if youre very very clever and so on you can still keep some of your pay if youre careful but its still reward system now as that reward system dwindles so dwindles the actual health of the society and the more internal revenue and the less reward and the more threat of punishment and the more you can go to jail if you dont turn over all your pounds shillings dollars francs or something to the local incometax people you see the more that works why the more difficulty their society gets into see youre not spending any time to work out how to how do you go about making healthy economic society they never spend any time on that theyre just chipping away at this award and punishment so actually theyre starting to borrow pavlov too so here is lie here is lie the statement that man acts totally because of punishment and only because of punishment that man is driven animal that lie all by itself is destroying the social structure of man because man doesnt go like that you see but we enter this lie upon the stage and here we go all youve got to do is have great big lie floating around someplace and you have trouble now it is perfectly all right to have difficulty isolating the truth as long as you are continuing to try to isolate the truth thats the difference you sit down hard on one lie and say that now is the truth and youve done the trick you see you say pavlov has written all there is to know about the human mind and at that moment youve had it because he hasnt he hasnt even written about the human mind and the reason i mentioned his prose is because its obvious why nobody has ever read him you cant so sort of tradition has grown up as to what pavlovs work is all about see and we have not even the work of pavlov motivating this kind of thing weve got superstition about what the work of pavlov is about its never been properly presented you see weve got lot of lies around and so forth but were not betting on those lies to carry us through see thats perfectly all right you can have whole bunch of misconceptions and still not do your nut but the second you settle completely on lie and say now that that is the truth from that moment on youve had it and youve had it to the degree that that truth can be pervasive in your life you can say joe is good man when you know when really the truth is hes bad man and this may cause you some inconvenience but it wont destroy your sanity itll cause you some worry but you say i have lived but once and then believe it defend it and contest it and of course youre going to have trouble from there on out it takes lie of this magnitude to continue the aberration of man it takes magnitudinous one now to maintain such lie must at the same time take fantastic amount of duress i mean youd have to work at it to maintain that lie and whenever you find maintained lie youll find somebody is working at it this guy has got headache well i dont know that you could do an all therapy on this basis this guy has got headache you find the lie connected with the headache and you could probably resolve the headache that very well might be an open sesame to all psychosomatic healing you know you could probably work whole parade of stuff out lets find the lie connected with see recall lie about headache see something like that and bang the guys headache is gone you see youre working now with one of these first principles when youre working with lie you got that now lets carry this just little bit further i didnt mean to get off into communism i thought you might be amused now carrying this off little bit further lets find lie about what see now that weve found out lie is this pervasive see now what would be the most disastrous type of lie and the most disastrous type of lie as common denominator although there are many disastrous types of lies would be about time so lets combine these two things you see you see what lie can do all by itself that has nothing to do with time all right now lets combine it with something which has the power to freeze tone arm on pc that matter big mid ruds on what bad things youve done to him in the session matter what horrible this as and that as and what processes you were to run without paying any attention to lies or time you see matter what you do to correct this tone arm if you do not pay attention to wrong time it will not correct you got that see this is the only one capable of putting total freeze on tone arm well total freeze on tone arm is total freeze on case so this gets fantastic this gets very very very very dreary indeed so we must be looking here at something like pervasive common denominator of aberration when we say lie about time this immediately brings to view processes by the ton you start thinking up processes you can just string them out by the hour recall lie about time you see recall lie about time recall lie about time recall lie about time see this kind of this kind of process would just string on and on and on and on and on dont you see now its interesting that if you if you oh you can think of others you can think of others lets just date everything in somebodys life thats an ordinary one he believes hes lived but once well lets date everything in that life that has lived but once soon as we got that thing kind of dated up youre liable to find out that hell fall through now just think of think of this approach see you might even apply this on an institutional level to just getting the whenness of things the whenness of things you know for instance when is this emeter guy would have to think for long time hed finally decide it was now see might be quite deaberrative might straighten out his time track most interestingly of course thats highly experimental not advanced as something that is proven but im just giving you an idea that you can extrapolate this idea of lie about time almost anyplace you want to look and you will have some interesting results on processing line see because that combines then the single action that is the most aberrative action which is an alterisness of truth or denial of truth with the one thing which if aberrated brings about then the greatest messup from the viewpoint of person we wont call it anything technical but it just messes him up most time messes him up the most and we get these two things in combination of course we get lie about time and were off to the races well having recognized this situation i looked it over very carefully we have the gpms and we have things of this nature and looked those over and then i said to myself i said well now i said ronnie if youve gotten this far this sort of thing lets just take look at this now you suppose some peculiarly and particularly brilliant blankety blank somewhere on the track has also discovered this and used it to aberrate ah well if thats the case then there must be such thing as false time track complete with times lets see if we can find some and i found some give somebody false past implant him with false past complete with pictures complete with times and times in the order of magnitude of the thetans actual existence trillions and trillions of years we could also give him some weird and incomprehensible dates thatd be little fillip on the thing you know that would be some way to throw new curve into it give him one thousand and sixtynine times trillion to the tenth let him chew on that for while and he never can find out what date that is and you would effectually have blocked out the past by making it so confusing to be entered and so dreary and so terrible and so awful that nobody would want to have anything to do with it now nobody ever would spend any time enhancing the powers of the thetan unless he was more diabolical than is believable but theyd certainly tend to make them derogatory theyd make the life as thetan seem very very dangerous very unpleasant because look look at the horrible things that can happen to you and therefore if all these horrible things can happen to you why then of course you dont want to have anything to do with it and you could get guy fixed up with sufficient number of false pasts that hed even dramatize false past hed become fiction writer or something like that hed even hed even automatically give you false story of his past dont you see he could get quite loopy on this subject if he were driven in with enough explosion enough bang and so on and if the incident itself were hung up with double explosion you know leftright bangbang sort of doubleri of the thing you see plus and minus ri of the thing hang it up on the track real good and just give him good long time track lets give him lets give him few trillion years to chew on or few trillion trillion years to chew on and lets give him some incident on that track lets give him nice history that goes along with that track lets give him pictures lets even give him some times when hes been implanted of course we couldnt give him much of an implant but we could give him clue that he might have been implanted at this point you know let couple of the pictures leak out looks like theyre implant pictures thatd sort of keep him tacking that point of the line wouldnt it and by giving him enough false track and maybe giving him four or five or six false tracks he would rapidly get of the opinion that the one thing he shouldnt do is to return on the time track because if he does it is far too painful and confusing and youd have him saying at last in selfdefense ive only lived but once yes that is one of the tricks that has been pulled now you say false past thats good terminology by the way find some auditors may trip it around on their tongue but you can learn how to say it false past is better than phony pictures or something like that in discussing this with pc you say false past well he understands this and r3r is good enough to be able to find moment when false past was installed date it and get its duration really takes some doing now having dated it and gotten its duration to actually run it out now the incident pretends let us say to be many trillions of years long and the actual duration of it is seldom more than three or four hours so you get the appearance of enormous durations and you get the appearance of tiny durations you know two or three hour duration or eighty billion trillion squillion to the nth tex boonk see years youll get two durations on the thing some vast duration and some little duration and the incident can be run out but dont get mad at the pc if he keeps stepping in the mud you know and finding himself going to the beginning of the incident and wondering whether or not hes saw it now these incidents have as common denominator these incidents have as common denominator and the very few of them i have the few i have seen i expect there are other kinds i have seen some of them and they are confused to this degree the point where you approached and the moment when you approached is quite commonly repeated in the incident so you walked up set of steps to get there so you now have visio that looks like youre walking up set of steps in the incident same set of steps so youve got two walkings up the steps one is in the incident one is the actual one and therell be two departures theres the actual departure in which one was usually anaten and didnt know whether he was going or coming and the picture of his departure and thetanwise of course itd be picture of exteriorizing from the area its getting dim in the distance in other words there are two beginnings and two endings on such an incident now they also occasionally have mechanism that shows troops marching away and troops marching to you this is how they communicate the beginning and end of things the beginning of things of course troops marching to you the end of things troops marching away from you and these incidents usually start with the troops marching away from you and end with the troops marching to you this was the common action i mean that set of pictures was therapy at one time and is used consistently in therapy so they copied this therapy device in this other action only in therapy they show you the beginning of something by i think the troops marching to you and in the end they show you the end of thing about the troops marching away from you sometimes theyre sailors sometimes theyre sailors in pompon hats sometimes theyre people who look like west point cadets but youll see these two marchings connected with it sometimes in these incidents so knowing these things you actually can find beginnings and ends of it but its very confusing of course because the couple of hours there that arent taken up give you whole time track they give you some catastrophic accident that happened to you you see and then you remained dormant for long time and things were very mean and so forth well the way you can tell false track is it really doesnt move youve got motion to such limited degree that it doesnt make very much sense let show you what i mean as you walk in this that door back there you see the front of this room dont you when you turn around you see some more of the room dont you and when you sit down you see some more of the room in front of you but from different viewpoint and level right and then when you look down you have scanned area of passing your eyes down toward book or meter or something like that you see and you have the continuous sound channel that goes all the way along that accompanies this any sound in the room is continuous well that is proper sequence very proper sequence well false track never looks like that theyve not got the time for it dont you see theyre crowding all this thing so you get picture if the picture is in motion and they can be you get picture of the front door then you get picture of the front of the room then you get picture of the book in front of you see and they seldom add the sound that goes with it many pc who doesnt think he has any sonic is simply running falsetrack incidents where there is none diabolical isnt it makes you go wog just to think about it now coupled with this is the fact that there is actual track you have actual track and this track of course is more sequitur but again can be in segmental pictures if theres points of anaten youll get the pictures right up to the point where you knocked yourself out see and then youll pick up pictures after this point you dont have complete series of pictures but they dont go chop chop chop let give you let give you an actual one thetan is lying on the ground airplane comes overhead thetan sees airplane come overhead it just sort of moves into view airplane falls apart we stand up and take look but thats simply picture of the parts of the airplane falling you see and then airplane parts are all over the ground only theyre plastic parts its not wrecked airplane see we just get jump jumpjumpjump see its something like the movie director would cut when he was making documentary you know typical modern documentary children starving in armenia children starving in egypt children starving in washington children starving see you know cutcutcutcut cutcut this is typical of one of these false incidents now why does the thetan look at the false incident why is he more likely to be on false incident than he is on true incident well false incident is safe theres bite to the stuff theres hell of bang now dont think it isnt aberrative to get one of these bangs at the beginnings and ends and the somatics that went with it but once youve got those somatics under control its much easier to look at false track than it is just like youd rather lot of people would rather look at movie of life than live see see its safe because one really never lived it theyre usually derogatory or unhappy state of affairs of some kind or another and theyre often quite theyre not well plotted there isnt anything very good about it its messy but in running the incident out of course the false track is part of the incident youre running out right so the pc in running these two and half hours gets the sensation of running several million trillion years of track very often except it doesnt take that long to do it only he would gasp if he thought he was having to scan through many trillions of years of track this would just fill him with uhhhhh oh you see the time factor is too great when he really thinks of the number of pictures there could be on just one trillion years of track you see hell say well am i going to be here the rest of the night you know this is the idea he gets in session well the longest it could take if it were one for one would be couple of hours anyway the somatics being wrong and the scenery being wrong and the character of the scenery being wrong the whole thing is therefore lie this is lie about time it tells him where he has been when when he wasnt there it puts trillions of years into two hours there couldnt be fancier lie about time now they very often have wheels running over to the side with numbers on them so you can get all the dates you want on the side of the picture sound familiar but thetan also can do this he also can visualize numbers to give himself years ago and that sort of thing now the one thing you can be absolutely sure of one thing you can be absolutely sure of with false with on question of false track and dates on false track and that sort of thing is that there are gpms that i know of there might be signs of them implanted on the false track but actual runnable gpm could possibly be on falsetrack implant basis that would just be totally pointless in the first place you cant on falsetrack gag get guy to go over the top of the ferris wheel several times with the full kinesthesia and motion dont you see and have him struck from both sides with all kinds of firings and that sort of thing so you know you know that if youre running gpm that youre not on false track otherwise beware now it would be adventurous to say that you know you are not on false track if you are running this lifetime im afraid thatd be an adventurous statement however because ive seen some false track with brownstone houses on it that i could never account for in this lifetime now many pc many pc starts to recover his sanity by just getting him to run entering the room see he can verify that that is the picture he walks in the room and sits down in the chair and then you have him close his eyes and he walk he runs the incident of walking in the room and going and sitting down in the chair now he knows thats his picture and he knows that is present time and he knows it isnt an implant makes him feel pretty comfortable kind of weird weird operation but dont discount it as its value in this sort of thing because of course total swamp of memory is the target of this and desire not to go back into the past these are the immediate fruits of it now lets look at actual track what about actual track can you also find actual track oh yeah thats pretty easy to find its pretty easy to find gpms are very easy to find the dates of gpms this sort of thing thats all perfectly accurate dont you see but youre always walking there with the possibility that youve got some false track may turn up on this pc so theres two things you want to know when youre when you find an incident and date it two things you really want to know is one does it contain oppositefiring items like that is to say is it gpm and the other thing you want to know about it does it contain false track not does it contain any pictures this very often will not register when i say false track im using term that we would use but not necessarily on pc better to say false past does it contain any false past because all these picture implants have the ambition of teaching somebody false past now you need all this data you need all this data as discouraging and as upsetting and as miserable and as disheartening as it is and i know you will go home tonight and lie down and say god thats terrible ooooo aaaah are my pictures real am i really real remember the old lady that the robbers caught and cut her clothes up and when she finally got home her dog barked at her and nobody knew her and she finally decided when she sat down can this really be you know she herself didnt know her after while well theres particular reason to get in that state and its perfectly all right if you do because its simply restimulated state and the cure of the state is when dating just make sure that you dont have any gpms in it or if you do maybe youre looking for gpms thats none of the neither of these things debar you from running the engram but lets just make sure we know what were running you scan somebody through gpm and youre going to go blangbangbang and hes going to stir it all up but he cant see the pictures and you dont know whats going on its much easier to just not move him to the beginning of the incident but move him to the first pair of items and you dont move anybody anyhow you just say give the first pair of items in that gpm see after youve if you want to establish what it is you havent got pattern its offdate and that sort of thing just what are the first pair of items hell give you something work it out muddle through when youve got it all straight why you can scan him through the whole incident its perfectly all right if you do that also but on false track what it tells you is be very very alert to getting wrong date for the incident and wrong duration because any incident which contains false track is of very short duration how long does it take to give somebody featurelength picture in 3 d with complete somatics hitting him in the breadbasket of several trillion years if you only give him few pictures of each see doesnt take very long well thats the criteria now the darwinian theory now ill give you some idea of the influence of false track upon this society the darwinian theory which probably influenced pavlov to the greatest degree is just an implant that is an implant from man to mud and it starts out oddly enough with the goal to persist starts with the goal to persist which i consider very very interesting because theres not another item in it there isnt even not persist there you see they didnt have the word you know they didnt have doublefiring item and then they show you your arrival which you see actually they have you in cell for while so they show you being in the cell and then show you arriving in the room to be implanted got that so youve actually if you were conscious when you went in the room it youve got now two arrivals in the same room see and then they show you complete with pictures not unlike modern motionpicture screen they show you all that has happened to you very briefly they give you background on how mean you are and then they show you getting implanted and actually the implantation takes place the picture never touches the pc i mean never touches the person being implanted but simply stacks mass around his body all the time hes looking at the picture hes having hell knocked out of him many feet away from the picture by electronic mass stacking around his body see hes being hit with waves around his body you see so he this mass gets associated with the you know it holds it in the picture and so forth and there isnt another thing said theres not one word said and one of the things youve got to be careful of in running false past is getting the pc all mixed up with giving you fantastic number of items or something like this you understand but in this particular darwinian one nothing is said you occasionally do get something said in one of these things you do sometimes get sonic in these false past lives or you get conversation or you get this or you get that but beware beware of running things in incidents which arent there its almost more deadly than missing things which are there dont overrun these incidents you know you can take gpm and you could just pull conversation out of it by the hour did you know that and every item is wrong did you realize that the guy is sitting there in the middle of the gpm and you dont know what the goal is and you dont even know that its this type of gpm you might have landed by accident in the middle of the helatrobus implants or something of the sort maybe the goal is to leave and he just gives you item after item of goodbye farewell adios you know and you know he just gives you item after item of goodbyes and farewells its just the goal to leave its just leave nix leave absolutably see left not left or nix left absolutably you know hes giving you wrong items and youll pay the penalty for getting wrong items sooner or later the whole incident tends to fold up if you want to see an incident get crunchy get wrong date wrong duration or run things out of it that arent in it so this is point that you have to watch now this incident this incident now with wheel dating device which gives you series of numbers that gives you gives you the time of these events shows you being implanted shows you finished implanting shows you leaving being pushed out of the implant room even shows you couple of your fellow crew members or something like that there who are tied up ready to be put into the room shows you being put aboard spaceship shows you being taken to another planet shows you being dumped in the sea and shows you start from the sea and become seaweed and become this and to work up stage by stage giving the millions of years which elapse on each step see and you go on and on up the line each step each step each step on an evolutionary channel and you run all the way through on these evolutionary channels lot of this stuff starts looking awfully 3d after youve been looking at them for while and shows you eventually arriving at the state of being man see gives you bit more louseup in the way of pictures ending pictures beginning something of this sort and then they push you out through that exact corridor past the exact two dummies that are tied up to the exact spaceship put you in the exact capsule drop you into that exact sea and expect you to make some seaweed and go on up the beach we were fooled only to the degree of some of the incidents of what to audit are actually out of that some of the incidents of what to audit are actual some are out of that darwinian implant see now thats very interesting to recognize how they can make you live your life twice because that one pretends to go into the future not into the past gorgeous louseup see i know i caught this with myself but after they dumped down at the bottom of the sea i said hohum skip it and went over and picked up young fishermans baby and so forth and hung around there for while catching my breath didnt bother to go through all this seemed pointless but the idea thats very finite thats very short time ago thats only couple of hundred million years ago lot of characters around here got this most of them become scientists that actually is the sole foundation of the darwinian theory thats the lot evolution theres such thing bodies dont evolve they deteriorate but they dont evolve you can trace all kinds of reasons how they evolve and why they evolve and you can figure it all out but the truth of the matter is when you get horses on planet somebody came along and mocked up some horses now they also mocked up these horses with the capability of growing hair or not growing hair youve got adjustment factors but not evolution factors so you confuse the adjustment factors and prove the whole theory of evolution and now you know man came from mud and you can write book like pavlov and get the whole world poisoned you see how this one goes all of this is based on what its based on errors in time errors in time because an individual has this incident its wrong time wrong place going wrong the whole way and it took up two hours and actually looks like it takes up seven million see there are such incidents just before the helatrobus implants they were practicing these just before the helatrobus implants youre liable to pick one up on pc within the few hundred billion years earlier than the helatrobus implants or perhaps even after the helatrobus implants youre liable to pick up one of these falsetrack incidents so they last theyre liable to be found almost any place now if you know that these things exist you can whip it see its all in what you what you know exists when you first collide with one youre going to be geewhiz you know and youre going to be much more nervous than you need to be if you know there is such thing as false past incident and you check up for these things at the risk of invalidating the pcs actual track you get yourself sailing along there and you got this incident and its at fortyfour trillion years ago perfectly valid date you see the reason im talking to you so strenuously about this is youre just about to be correcting somebodys dates as matter of fact you were at it today you start correcting the dates of incidents and youre going to run into this other phenomenon its going to drive you mad man if you dont know it exists you cant correct dates on case unless you know this other phenomena exists because its full of false dates see pc and you could work at it correcting false dates i dont know another couple of hundred hours all out of one twoandahalfhour incidents the thing to do is to when you start correcting dates of incidents the first thing you should look for is an incident that contains false past not an incident contains false dates dont worry about false dates so much you just want false past but remember that it can also contain false future so that mustnt be totally dismissed as possibility fortunetellers practice that to this day its very popular false futures they get you sitting over the crystal ball you know and they say i see dark man coming into your life and hell be six feet tall if you give two bucks and hell only be five foot eight if you dont give theyre tailor making future and most fortunes depend on the fact that pcs have future implants that they dramatize and tend to dramatize they want to always know about the future theyre really not nervous theyre just dramatizing an implant you must ask for false past thatll give you the most lousedup because future doesnt too often contain dates but also check for false futures an incident about false futures and between the two of these things why youre all set false present well everybody knows its false anyway the task is not very difficult one providing you know this information as far as gpms are concerned you go back on the track on gpms and you got gpms at eighteen trillion trillion years ago and haha they start banging you in the head and firing left and right and youre going over the rolly coaster and youre doing this and youre doing that yes theres always the possibility there could be an implant that also refers to this gpm but that cannot be done what type of equipment is used now in order to implant false dates and so on its usually quite its quite varied but it really never moves off the basis of something you look into or something you look at attended by electronic blasts and thats the common denominator of all such equipment in other words you can have room and the person is put on bed and the screen and so on is at diagonal up in front of them or at the other end of the room and it shows threedimensional view of events or something like that meantime the person is being hit with this and that it could be as simple as some kind of scope that has movie running in the back of it you put your face or your face is put up to this scope and anchored there with some electric blasts and at this close range why the thing runs off at mad rate and there it goes with appropriate jolts in the right places it could also be it could also be full set which is lugubriously and this is earlier track when they didnt mind mass so much if you find any back there they probably have full sets connected with them they move them like stage set one of the trick ways of building these things you take these two crayons here you notice that it that they are not consecutive line if i hold them like this and if you pull them down like this they look like theyre consecutive line dont you see but theres hole between the two of them so the set moves up and then goes this way around the person you understand if person is anchored there on stake or something like this you see when they when the set moves then why they just jog the set and he passes through this slit which he cant see looks very mysterious to him hes in one environment total 3d environment hes in the next environment total 3d environment after his sonic and visio picks up little bit however he can hear the scene shift they really make lot of noise and that type of thing by the way is used in some very early implant serieses types of pictures of this kind the helatrobus the bear and gorilla and glade implants none of them use pictures they sometimes theres only the only picture i know of used in the helatrobus implants is on railroad on which you travel sideways at vast rate of speed and when you meet the railroad when you come down to the railroad youll see that theres section house right at the point where youre put on the track theres house there see and then as you move down the track just before you move down the track board goes up in front of you and its the same section house so actually youre moved at sixty miles an hour sideways with the same section house sitting in front of you and this is supposed to confuse you enormously but almost any thetan matter how anaten he is can see that its just board shoved up in front of him in the gorilla and bear gpms and so on they do put figure on the cart with the thetan theyve theres guy in pink shirt with monkey peeking out from behind him put on the ride carts guy in pinkstriped shirt very very interesting thats their that was their badge the hoi polloi and youll see this bird with pinkstriped shirt sometimes you have gorilla in front of you sometimes its the gorilla who is spitting things at you and that sort of thing they use figures but this is not the same thing im talking about dont think youre mixed up in one of these things just because in an implant why somebody jumps up with picture see or something like that thats just momentary picture this is not the same intention thats just to get you to make pictures or louse up your pictures or something like that were talking about another type of incident another type of incident entirely where youre hit with electronic blasts at the same time youre hit with series of pictures which purport to be past or future for the individual and when you run into that one when you run into that one why if you dont recognize that these things can exist why youve had it now this also gets in the road of running an actual incident youve got an actual planetbuilder incident and it looks pretty wild to you and it doesnt look like the pc could possibly have done it and so forth and you date it and its got perfectly right date and so on and youve got read of any kind on false pasts or anything of this character and yet theres that picture and it seems very incredible to you that the pc could be running this at that particular level or line and that sort of thing you can get tangled up on this but just dont forget to run the incident get tangled up all you please but run the incident if its right incident its right incident if its wrong incident youll never be able to find the beginning of it about the most maddening activity you can get into is get into one of these falsepast things and go whirring along at mad rate trying to find the beginning of the incident of course you never make it you eventually will find beginning of an incident but itll be an incident of such fantastic magnitude that youve got yourself aw the hell with it you know it could take you four five six sessions just to try to find the beginning of that sequence of events well theres sense in beating your brains out if you cant find easily the beginning of an incident you better get interested in whether or not this thing has got false past or false future in it that all depends of course on having your date right now how do you clean up somebody how do you clean up somebody with something like this your approved technology at the present moment is clean up his wrong dates im giving you this material because right now some of you are engaged in running prepcheck on wrong dates and its very good thing you are youre getting tremendous tone arm action youre getting results on this sort of thing and this is all very happy thing remember this when you start correcting dates the first thing youre going to run into is any falsepast or falsefuture incident that you have triggered on the pc and youre going to run into it headon so you beware of redating dont redate incidents endlessly the first order of business is get in there and pitch on the subject of an incident containing false past and when youve got that found because itll be there when youve got that found and when youve got it run dont just find it and date it and walk off because look youre not going to date anything else from there on except the track that is in it you can date endlessly you could run pc maybe thousands of hours cleaning up this false track which didnt exist they can see it and so forth so look if you got your hands on an incident now heres one of your rules of the game when youve got your hands on an incident even though its hell to run and upsets the pc and everything else and so on when youve got your hands on an incident which contains false past or false future you finish that incident you understand finish it from one end to the other do anything necessary to get it the hell off the track the best way to handle it of course is with r3r you just do standard r3r on the thing and remember that its pretended duration will be in the millions or billions or trillions or quadrillions and its actual duration is probably in the matter of hours at the most day or two so i have to give you all this data now and its good thing that its turnedup because you just start correcting dates on pc and about the first thing youre going to trip into is the phenomena of false past with all its attendant false dates and the moment you get collided with one of those things youve had it you want to do pc an awful lot of good however get rid of one of them dont mistake theyre hell to get rid of you take the pc to the beginning of the incident and he goes to the beginning of the incident only the beginning of the incident is also inside the incident as well as at the beginning of the incident you get the idea he finishes up he finishes up the incident he leaves the incident at the point where it says he left the incident but thats picture of his leaving the incident and you havent run out his leaving the incident you got the idea these things usually have minimum of two beginnings identical and two ends identical if you know that why you can sometimes pull the fat out of the fire this thing you dont do anything with it unless it starts running badly if it runs badly why re duration the actual incident itself and square it around and just do routine workmanlike auditing job it doesnt need anything extraordinary about this thing the pc will eventually plow on through it all you need is very standard auditing very standard r3r just its usual steps you get into fight with the pc about the thing however its always perfectly kosher to tip him off and say well are there two beginnings ask on the meter are there two beginnings to this incident pang pang well you know you got false past incident see there are two endings the reason youre having trouble with reaching the end of the incident are there two endings to this incident pang pang yeah you got your two endings on the end of the incident pc says huh there are as well as another beginning and ending of the incident that merely says it begins and ends at this point which is inside the point when it really begins and ends talk about confusion these things are confusing to handle but standard processing right as of this minute handles them and youre going to run into them headon the instant that you start correcting anybodys dates its one of the first things thatll raise its hand and elect to fall in your lap as an auditor is one of these incidents well what if youre what if youre in x unit and youve been ordered to do prepcheck on wrong dates on the pc and so forth and the pc starts sliding all over the track and youre not supposed to do anything but correct that let tell you the wrong thing to do let tell you the wrong thing to do get your hands on one of these falsepast or falsefuture incidents thats full of dates get it dated precisely and then walk off and leave it and try to do something else youre not going to get anything else done i can tell you thats wrong i wont tell you what else to do because ill probably contradict the orders your instructors will be giving you but i can tell you what not to do dont walk off and leave it because you have run into restimulated and excited thousands of dates hundreds or thousands of dates have been excited just like that and if somebody didnt have that pcs auditors report and that pc ceased to be audited in some way somebody would be wading through that for long time trying to find the actual incident again one of the rules of auditing one of the little rules that goes along with dont talk to people who are unconscious you know around people who are unconscious and dont and all aberration is at the bottom of the aberration lie lie causes aberration along with that is the fact that when you got your paws on something you handle it thats maxim that i go by in my own auditing when i find that lying under the needle of my emeter is something thats bothering the living daylights out of the pc not because he put it there but because it arrived there in the course of auditing i handle it i dont expect the pc to go on struggling with this thing as ptp while i do something else because im supposed to when i get my hands on something in case i handle it you understand it makes for little much less trouble with case you get your hands on something your this thing is going crash on wrong dates crash on wrong dates well rrrr what the hell you got the pc right there on wrong dates what are you going to do now are you going to skip that you see walk off and leave it well you know its toplevel stuff how come wrong dates what are these wrong dates all about lets deal up few of these wrong dates lets find out what this wrong date thing is youre unfortunately liable to find yourself in process youre not permitted to run just remember this if you louse up your pc well i always make sure that you get two thousand words and remember this i never ask how it was done thats good enough see somebody loused up pc why bang im very interested at that point he loused up the pc im not interested if he loused up the pc because the instructor said or because he did or because the bulletin said or the this said or the that said or something else said im just interested in that he loused up the pc see i have very shortcircuited view of the whole thing because auditing is auditing youre supposed to do auditing i can lay you down thousands of rules on the subject of auditing i can guide your footsteps very directly i can give you information on the subject of auditing i can do everything else but i cant sit in that chair and audit your pc you understand and auditing from my point of view is supposed to produce beneficial results on pc thats my narrowminded attitude you understand so that heres the heres the pc heres the pc and were supposed to produce good results on the pc well if you dont know how to do this or how to do that or something else i can show you how to do this or how to do that well you cant ever tell what is going to come up in this case when its going to come up youre not you cant tell now when youre auditing pc when youre auditing pc very often pc comes into session in fit shape to go on with what youre running on the pc its very heroic of you to try to keep on running what hes on but remember that you can sometimes not accomplish anything by doing just this you sometimes have to handle the pc right there in front of you now similarly you innocently set forward to do fundamental action on case like straighten out his dates and you suddenly see yourself staring down the barrel of the incident responsible for the wrong dates now remember theres your big auditing cycle your big auditing cycle is to accomplish what youre trying to accomplish with the case and you better figure out what youre trying to accomplish with the case that youre auditing in this case youre trying to straighten out the pcs dates right all right thats your big auditing cycle right all right so youre trying to straighten out the pcs dates now if you go ahead and handle his lumbosis god help you see i mean that has nothing to do with it youre trying to straighten out his dates thats q and or messup see youre trying to straighten out the big auditing cycle on this pc were going to get the wrong dates off this case and suddenly you are presented with something which is outside the perimeter of the permitted process or something like that what do you do with it i can tell you what not to do with it neglect it now thats what you must not do with it because you very often cant get your paws on it again youve made big problem for somebody else you cant straight when you listen when youve found the source of the pcs upset what other source is there to find see you got that so if youre supposed to be running which ruddy rod have you stuck between your ears and you all of sudden find yourself staring at the source of his upset about ruddy rods i can tell you how not to help the pc ignore the fact that you have found the source of it this results in an invalidation of the source and nothing happens you understand you have to ask yourself why are you running this thing about ruddy rods between the ears thats the big auditing cycle dont ever subordinate your big auditing cycle to the minor auditing cycle you understand see theres your big auditing cycle and then theres your process auditing cycle youre supposed to flatten this process see but your big one is what youre trying to intend with the pc and then youre what process youre running on the pc and then youve got your other auditing cycle which is your repetitive give and take of auditing commands dont you see all right the second that you some auditors can just get on this give and take of auditing commands and neglect even the process theyre trying to flatten see and some running the process theyre supposed to flatten actually can run into the denouement of the big auditing cycle thats the end see the big auditing cycle theyve collided with the thing this person has been terrified of ghosts this person has been terrified of this particular subject every time they go to bed at night why they wont turn out the lights you see theyve been this way since childhood or something of this character and all of sudden youre running this process of some kind or another youre straightening out something and the big auditing cycle turns up and drops into your paws see they say not really im ghost haha hahaha what do you know ive always been afraid of myself now what are you going to do from this on what are you going to be complete knucklehead going to be complete jackass having found the source now youre going to try to do what im just bringing it to your attention what else is there left to do there isnt anything else left to do somebody cognites his chain level his level item assessment out say what do you know its soandso and its thlul and its du duddl and fadtdddt and well haha what do you know thats in the bag thats why that level operated and you say the level you say the level be leery of cats tone arm is down now what are you going to do flatten the chain you have to ask yourself this question what chain what chain are you going to flatten where it now isnt that is known as your big auditing cycle thats what youre intending to do with the person if you dont know that i can see you someday auditing person up to ot and they arrive at the point of ot and you get very upset because you havent completed your auditing cycle you understand so thats present in all auditing having found the source of the aberration in wrong dates what you going to do look for another source what you havent got in your mind then is the big auditing cycle what were you intending to do with the pc what does this process intend to do with this pc wrong dates well its supposed to straighten out the pcs wrong dates what else and all of sudden you didnt even ask for it and you possibly in lot of cases wont get it right away unless youre running r3r work all of sudden youve got your paws on the source of the pcs wrong dates what you going to do run the process of course what nonsense youre going to go on and say give another source for wrong dates give another source for wrong dates give another hes just given you the source for wrong date see what the second that you say give another source for wrong dates what are you looking at youre looking at invalidation of the source for wrong dates and from that point on you have thereafter defeated your auditing see that so theres where itd go so all of sudden this guy suddenly says hey hey hey hey theres bupututit and zuzuz up and all that track i thought i uhmmmulp you speak about wrong dates well there it is see what are you going to do now you make your peace with the instructors but remember i count on you to handle the pc thank you very much
