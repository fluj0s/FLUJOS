congress that if congress established carfa the commission should use the bush administrations pr ogram assessment rating tool part to evaluate programs4 this report also briefly di scusses the results commissions proposal which appears similar in some respects to presidential reorganization authority which lapsed in 1984 and has not been renewed by congress5 the results commissions proposal

integration initiative of the presidents management agenda pma that congress enact legislation to give the president authority to recommend the creation of results commissions20 the president also proposed establishment of sunset commission which is not analyz ed in detail in this report21 in justifying the proposal the administr ation asserted dysfunctional program overlap is why many of the 30 percent of programs rated by the part instrument are rated either ineffective or unable to demonstrate results22 the administration also claimed that overlapping jurisdicti ons in congress provide daunting hurdles to legislative remedies for the poor performance of duplicative programs23 another reference to the results commissions pr oposal included in the administrations fy2006 budget offered this justification the federal governments ability to serve the american people is often hampered by poorly designed programs or uncoordinated overlapping programs trying to achieve the same objective overlapping jurisdictions in the executive branch and congress provide daunting hurdles to legislative remedies to the poor performance of duplicative programs because the potential for savings and productivity are great the administrati on plans to propose legislation that gives the president the authority to propose results commissions these commissions would consider and revise administration proposals to improve the performance of programs or agencies by restructuring or consolidating them congress would approve individual re sults commissions to address single program or policy areas where duplicati on and the overlapping jurisdictions of executive branch agencies or congressional committees hinder reform proposals approved by the commission would then be approved by the president

necessity for further c ongressional action under expedited procedures to establish unlimited number of presidents pr oposed results commissions while the proposed carfa act would without using expedited proce dures establish one commission appointment and size of membership eg 7 members appointed by the president under the results commissions proposals versus 12 members appointed by the

probably not be considered an agency under the carfa legislations continued1984 but has been the subject of occas ional congressional interest in the subcommittee hearing on hr 3276 omb puty director for management clay johnson iii testified that the results co mmissions legislation was proposed instead of reorganization authority because the administration judged there was zero chance of reorganization authority ever being approved by congress29 because of the major differences between th proposed carfa act and the results commission proposals as described above detailed discussion nd analysis of the results commission proposals are not within th scope of this repor t however many issues concerning presidential reorganiza tion authority are discussed and analyzed in detail elsewhere30 overview of carfa legislation provisions the balance of this report analyzes the carfa legislation as introduced in the bills sponsored by representative tiah rt and senator brownback in the 109th congress hr 2470s 1155 for topics wh ere the two versions are the same the discussion in the sections below does not differentiate between the bills for topics where the two versions of the carfa legislation substantively differ from one another the sections scribe the differences duties of the commission president and joint congressional leadership as drafted in hr 2470s 1155 th legislation would establish 12 member carfa and require the review commissions members to be appointed within 90 days of the legislations enac tment the house version would require the president to appoint all 12 members of this review co mmission the senate version by contrast would provide for hybrid commission ie appoi ntment of members by both the president and certain memb ers of congress with four members appointed by the president two appointed by the senate majority leader two appointed by the senate minority leader tw appointed by the speaker of the house and two appointed by the house minority l eader both versions would require the president to designate chairpers on and vice chairperson from among the commission members it appears that officers and employees of the federal government and nonfederal individuals could be ppointed as members the proposed carfa would be required to under the house version evaluate ll executive branch agencies and programs excluding agencies

the scope provided by both the house and senate versions as reasonable first step while critics have viewed this sort of scope as overly narrow or reflecting an implicitly partisan outlook as described above in the 109th cong the scope of the senate ve rsion of the carfa legislation was expanded by eliminating the prior exclusions which remain in the house version and including the eop

version of the carfa gislation determin ation that certain agencies or programs fit one or more definitions of duplicative wasteful inefficient outdated irrelevant or failed would require the commission to make recommendations as outlined in the bill to realign or eliminate the agencies or programs in the senate version by c ontrast if an agency or program were determined only to be wasteful or inefficient the commission would be allowed but not required to recommend r ealignment or elimination in addition under the house version the legislation proposed by th commission would be required to provide that all funds saved by imp lementation of the commission s plan be used to support other domestic programs or pay down the national debt under the senate version there would be requirement regarding uses of saved funds the legislation would also require the president not later than one year after the date of enactment to establish systematic method accord ing to certain requirements for assessing the effectiveness and acc ountability of these agencies and programs submit to the commission assessments of not less than onehalf ofall the legislations covered programs

problem we must overcome in this effort is that almost every program in the federal government matter how ineffective or spendthrift has its own core of supporters it would be wishful thinking at best

amount to the congress delegating its authority i answer this concern by noting that carfa is an appropriate exercise of congressiona l oversight and authority nothing substantive happens unless the congress passes the commissions proposed legislation others have concerns over the xpedited process for carfa because amendments at either the committee level or on the floor are not in order i answer this concern by noting that the only chance we have for successfully eliminating government waste through carfa is straight upordown vote brac was successful because members had to vote on the whole package in the case of carfa if members could offer amendments to exempt specific programs or agencies carfa will not be successful44 echoing some of the same themes earlier in the year the carfa legislations house sponsor representative tiahrt had offere d the following observations in us capitol update dated ma rch 12 2004 on his website many members of congress have recognized the need for an independent body with the appropriate resources to review the federal bureaucracy and identify programs that are duplicative ineffective or inefficient by giving congress an upordown vote on single package it will eliminate great deal of the political wrangling that usually accompanies cuttin g government program frankly it also recognizes the fact that members of congress simply do not have the

brac would take parochial politics out of the budget process and make members decide in an up or down vote whether they wanted to realign and streamline the use of taxpayers dollars going to

the defense base cl osure and realignment act of 1990 pl 101 510 104 stat 1808 as his model that legislation stated that the president should consult with the speaker of the house of represen tatives concerning the appointment of two members the majority leader of the senate concerning two members and each of the minority leaders of the house of representativ and the senate respectively regarding one member for total of six consultations the brac framework did not explicitly require that the commission be composed of equal num bers of democrats nd republicans but did require senate confirmation of all membersfor the braclike process to work then you must have professional information professional data and serious hardworking members of the commission that will not allow politics to impinge on their thinking and congress needs the assurance that it will not be political the most important thing you must have in this legislati on is insulation from politics so that the members will not be concerned about having political reprisals taken against them the need of professional criteri and professional judgment by serious hardworking commission that commands the respect of the members55 progressive policy institute testimony the hearings final witness paul we instein jr of the progressive policy institute ppi testified that the ex ecutive branch needs toptobottom overhaul and that ppi has long advocated crea ting commission to reinvent government and eliminate corporate welfare56 furthermore mr weinstein stated our organization has long believed that the best way to achieve comprehensive reform of the executive branch is to combine the commission function with mechanism to require congress to vote on its recommendations senator brownbacks carfa legisl ation would

composed of equal numbers of republicans and democrats57 second under the headin g expanded scope mr weinstein recommended including all executive branch agencies programs and targeted tax incentives in the commission s scope of review third under the heading multiple rounds he recommended that the commission be allowed to submit more than one round of recommenda tions in order to provide the proposed carfa with needed flexibility in the face of complicated work and to build public support and increase the likelihood of success fourth nd finally under the headline additional criteria mr

interest to congress if the carfa legislation receives further consideration during the 109th congress or if congress opts to consider alternative approaches to reviewing executive branch operations and making improvements for ease of presen tation these items are grouped into three sections potential issues regarding review commission potential success factors for commission and potential alternatives or comp lements to review commission potential issues regard ing review commission congress and the president have variety of policy and procedural tools that can help them assess governme nt operations organization and performance one such tool that has been used occasionally by congress has been the statutorily created review commission during the 20th century congress and the president established number of review commissions that were intended to promote improved efficiency effectiveness accountability nd transparency in the executive branch with varying emphases these commissions typically reviewed executive branch organization operations and management as well as ssociated public policies detailed assessment of each of these efforts is beyond the scope of this report58 however characteristics of past review commissions can highlight potential points of contrast with the carfa legislation or other review commission proposals in particular the present

which operated from 1947 to 194959 and the brac commission established under pl 101510 three of which operated from 1991 to 1995 during time periods that did not overlap60 congress has many options to weigh if it chooses to consider commission proposal instead of or along with othe r alternatives three alternatives or complements are discussed later in this report the following subsections of the report analyze six types of issues that c ongress might consider in the context of commission proposal as noted earlier they are the commissions membership the scope of the commissions review and recommendations definitions of key terms standards and criteria for decision making expedited congressional consid eration of the commissions recommendations and transparency and participation each subsection cites some of the potential implications advantages and disadvantages that might accompany number of choices that congress could make using the carfa legislations provisions from hr 2470 and s 1155 109th congress as point of comparison commission membership when considering the advantages and disadvantages of review commission pr oposal several topics relating to the commissions membership may be of interest to members of congress and stakeholders for the carfa legislation these include how the membership is to be determined coverage of the federal advisory committee act and coverage of conflict of interest laws in additi on the brea kdown of carf commissions membership between federal and nonfederal members would have significant implications for the coverage of thes laws and the commissions operations appointment and removal one of the key parameters of statutorily created commission is how its membership is to be determined under the house version of the carfa legislation h r 2470 all 12 commission members would be appointed by the president thus giving th president considerable influence over the commissions views activities and reco mmendations proponents might view thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32726crs26 61 examples of expedited consideration incl ude committee discharge after 15 calendar days 10hour limitation for debate and prohibition against amendment 62 the longestablished rule is that in the face of statutory silence the presidents power to remove is incident to his power to appoint see carlucci v doe 488 us 93 99 1988 myers v us 272 us

would still be able to reject the commissions recommendations critics however might see this provision as giving too much legislative power to president especially in view of the legislations provisions for expedited congressional c onsideration including prohibition on senate filibusters61 and the legislations potential policy implications for large set of federal agencies and programs by c ontrast the senate version of the carfa legislation s 1155 would provide th at 8 of the commissions 12 members be appointed by house and senate leaders 2 each by the speaker and minority leader in the house and 2 each by the senate majority and minority leaders and the remaining 4 by the president proponents might view this arrangement as way to retain congressional contro l over the commission as well as make the commission at least somewhat bipartisan on the other hand critics might argue that if president and congressional leaders were to appoint members only from their respective political parties the carfa would always have twotoone ratio between parties because the presidents ppointees would all go to one party in addition president might prefer to ve appointing authority over all commission members rather than only onethird of them another potential issue relates to removal power if the president is given statutory authority to appoint someone to particular statutoril created office the appointee holds that ffice at the pleasure of the pres ident even for specified term of years unless the statute expressly limits the presidents removal power or the nature of the duties given to the officeholde r is solely adjudicatory therefore for presidentially appointed commission memb ers under either the house or senate version of the carfa legislation unless f or cause removal pr otection were added for members the president could remove members at will from the commission and appoint new members62 furthermore if the presidency changed hands during the life of the carfa the new president could remove the commissions members and replace them with appointees of his or her own this removal pow er could make the commissions membership activ ities and recommendations responsive to the needs of the president but on the other hand could disrupt the commissions activities and be seen as undermining its independence under the senate version of the carfa legislation the speaker of the house the house minority leader the senate majority leader and the senate minority leader would each be required to appoint two members to the commission each congressi onal leader would also have authority to remove at will commission member whom he or she ppointed unless for cause removal protection were added for commission members63 other prominent

example re quired equal numbers of mocrats and republicans and hybrid appointment by both the presiden t and members of congress for some observers the hoover commission framework might be seen as advantageous because it could be viewed as more bipa rtisan under that framework however congressionally appointed co mmission members are appointed by majority members of each chamber potentially without any i nvolvement of minority members on the other hand critics might argue that membersh ip selected by both majority party and minority party members could prevent the commission from coming to consensus or generating an integrated or consis tent package of recommendations the brac commission approach to appoin tments by st required senate confirmation of the presiden ts appointments as well as consultations with majority and minority leadership in the house and senate supporters of the brac approach might argue that the approach lessens th appearance and like lihood of politicization of the commissions recommendations by giving senators some ability to influence the presidents nominations eg or the president might risk subsequent filibusters of the nominations64 and holds the presidents legislative power in check however the president can circumvent the need for senate confirmation of commissions members by us ing recess appointments65 as demonstrated in the 2005 brac round president george w bush took this action on april 1 2005 when he announced recess appointments of ll nine brac commission members66 opponents of the brac approach might mainta in that it constrains the ability of the president to ppoint nominees flexibly and indirectly through these nominees constrains the presidents ability under carfa act to recommend his preferred policies to congress faca the carfa legislation is silent on whether the commission would be considered an advisory committee that is covered by the federal advisory committee act faca 5 usc appendix 2 86 stat

3rd ed chicago american bar association 1998 pp 125127 if the carfa were composed wholly of fulltime federal officers and employees however faca would not cover the proposed commission 69 this provisions inclusion of the pres ident as recipient of the commissions recommendations appears to be matter of comity between the branches because the legislation appears designed to provide information for congressional consideration and does not task the president with any formal role in considering the commissions recommendations that said the legislati on also does not prohibit the presidents involvement in formulating influencing or acting upon the commissions recommendations either directly by influencing commission memb ers or indirectly through the presidents appointment and removal powersenacted the issue of faca coverage might have implications regarding the commissions membership because faca requires that an advisory committees membership be fairly balanced in terms of points of view repr esented section 5b of faca faca defines covered advisory committee to include any committee or similar group that is 1 established by st atute or organization plan 2 established or utilized in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the president or one or more federal agencies and 3 not composed wholly of fulltime federal officers or employees68 because the commission w ould submit its recommendations primarily to congress see s ection 3b of the carfa legislation not to the president or an agency it appears carfa might not fall within facas definition of advisory committee and therefore might not be covered by faca however section 3f of the legislation calls for report containing the commissions plan with recommendations and proposed legi slation to be submitted to both the president and congress69 therefore unless court we re to address this question it is not clear whether the commission would be covered by faca some observers might prefer that carfa if establis hed not be covered by faca in order to allow appointment of memb ers without the statutory obligation to appoint commission that is fairly balanced nd therefore give fl exibility to appoint members with the views skills and backgrounds an appointing authority wishes however other observers might criticize this approach as one too easy to politicize and instead prefer that faca cover the co mmission in order to help ensure that balance of views is present during the commissions work conflict of interest laws and regulations conflict of interest matters might also be of

for example see david burnham questi ons rising over us study and role of continueddivestiture70 the carfa legislation is silent with regard to the commissions location in the executive or legislative branch the legislation also does not say directly whether nonfedera l carfa members ie those who are not officers or employees of the federal government woul d nevertheless be c onsidered officers or employees of the federal government for pur poses of conflict of interest laws even so based on the legislati ons provisions it appears that nonfederal commission members would not be considered officers or employees of the federal government for purposes of conflicts of interest for example nonfederal members of the commission would not be compensated secti on 5a of the legisl ation makes explicit reference to some carfa members potentia lly not being officers or employees of the federal government and section 5c3b states that commission members would not be federal employees unde r several provisions of title 5 us code it appears these members would therefore not be subject to an federal conflict of interest laws or regulations howeve r if carfa were deemed an advisory committee under faca or if commission memb ers were deemed federal employees or special government employees sges then the conflict of interest provisions would probably apply71 even if the conflict of interest laws nd regulations were deemed not to apply to nonfederal commission members some observers might still raise conflict of interest concerns previously for example president ronald reagans private sector survey on cost control popularly known as the grace commission was established by executive order on june 30 1982 as an advisory committee under faca72 the commissions activities were sometimes controve rsial the commission was funded and staffed by the private sector with 161 presidentially appointed members of an executive committee mostly chief executive officers of corporations and approximately 2000 staff over the co mmissions life who were loaned from their companies and organizations73 some members of congress and the public expressed concerns about pot ential conflicts of

would have si gnificant implications for the coverage of faca and c onflict of interest laws and possibly for perceptions of the commissions recommendations following from the preceding analysis three scenarios present themselves if all carfa members were federa l ie officers or employees of the federal government faca would not cover the commission but commission members would be subject to conflict of interest statutes and regulations if all carfa members were nonfederal faca might or might not cover the commission and it appears the commissioners would not be subject to conflict of in terest laws and regulations if carfa commissions membership were mixed between federal and nonfederal members faca might or might not cover the commission and some members w ould be subject to conflict of interest laws while othe rs apparently would not each of the three scenarios would have implications for the operations of the commission and also perhaps for how the commissions

scope to all agencies and tax expenditures might be to assess public policies from more holistic perspective regardless of whether policies are associated with annual or permanent appropr iations or direct federal outlays or tax expenditures because diverse agencies and policy tools might be targeted at the same or similar public po licy problems in addition some observers might argue that broadening the commission s scope to include all agencies and tax expenditures would be necessary to void the appearance of partisanship other options regarding review commi ssions scope might be of interest to congress for example if congress chose to consider the legi slations scope other policy tools like loans loan guarantees tax laws and regula tions could also be explicitly included under the gislations definition of program which as introduced was defined as an activity or function of an agency section 3a3 it is not clear that this definition of program would necessarily include these and other policy instruments in the commissions scope moreover s ection 3d of the legislation contains provisi ons related to program assessments that are arguably similar in structure and content to the admin istrations part an instrument that is focused on evaluating the use of appropriated funds thus to the extent that the part is seen as an essential or complementary tool for the carfa and possibly as the systematic method for assessing the effectiveness and accountability of agency programs that is required by the legisl ations section 3d carfa might tend to concentrate on appropriated funds to the exclusion of other policy tools definitions of key terms the carfa legislation uses number of special terms when specifying the commissions duties specifically when requiring the

and ramifications would likely turn on these definitions some of these term s are defined by the carfa legislation to varying extents and others are not defi ned if the legislation were enacted as introduced the commissions members and st aff would arguably need to define further and operationalize some of the terms alternatively during the course of any consideration of the legislation congre ss might elect to include more detailed definitions in the legislation or establish legislative history demonstrating congressional intent each pproach might bring advantages and disadvantages for example defining the terms later would obviously grant significant flexibility and discretion to the commission and allow commission members to modify the definitions as they proceed with the co mmissions work however this discretion could also potentially open up the commission s actions to charges of bias in the absence of clear or consensus definitions in view of these tensions definitions of key terms might be of inte rest to congress in consid eration of the carfa act program the carfa legislation defines program as any activity or function of an agency80 the term activity is not defined in the legislation but according to merriamwebsters co llegiate dictionary is defined as pursuit in which person is active or an organi zational unit for performing specific function also its function or duties81 thus an activity can be what person or an organization does or alternatively dis tinct part of an organization the term function is used in several contexts in title 5 of the us code the codification of laws on government organization and employees while title 5 does not define function the implementing regulations for transf er of functions 5 usc 3503 and reductions in force

could best be served with regard to how programs shoul d be defined and who should define them realignment the carfa legislation calls upon its commission members to recommend certain programs and agencies for realignment but does not define the term the brac commission law by cont rast provided technical and applied definition for the term realignment in the context of decidi ng whether to close cut back or reorganize military installations the term realignment includes any action which both reduces and relocates functions and civ ilian personne l positions but does not include reduction in force resulting from workload adjustments reduced personnel or funding levels or skill imbalances84 unless the term were further defined by congress carfa woul d likely have flexibility to define the term as it wishes some discussion may help shed light on possible definitions merriamwebsters co llegiate dictionary defines realign as to reorganize or make new groupings85 and align as to be in or come into precise adjustment or correct relative position86 thus the terms common usage suggests an emphasis on reorganization this possible emphasis is arguably consistent with representative tiahrts discussion of the proposed carfa act in the 108th congress in his remarks on the house floor which referred to the elimination or the realignment of duplicative wasteful and outdated functions italics added87 the emphasis is also arguably consistent with the legislations provision that duplicative programs be consolidated or streamlined section 3c 1 terms often used as synonyms for restructuring and reorganization the organization design literature often indicates that an organizations structure and purpose are complexly intertwined concepts when considering organizational architectures88 depending on an observers perspective these concepts may arguably be intertwined to such an extent that the terms reorganization or realignment can be construed to imply

thus it is possible that the proposed com mission could define the term realignment as allowing both organizational and policy changes89 consistent with the carfa legislations directions to recommend the realignment of programs and co rresponding policies that are judged duplicative wasteful or inefficient other terms to describe certain programs section 3c of the carfa legislation enumerates number of desc riptive terms that commission would be required to use in its work and would potentia lly need to define further specifically under the legislation commission would be required to recommend programs or agencies that fall under most of these finitions to be rea ligned or eliminated however the senate version of the carf legislation s 1155 would allow rather than require realignment or elimination of agencies or programs found to be wasteful or inefficient duplicative section 3c1 of the carf legislation would require carfa to recommend that duplicative agencies and programs be realigned the definition of duplicative is operationalized in this way if 2 or more agencies or programs are performing the same esse ntial function and the function can be consolidated or streamlined into single agency or program how would commission interpret this term the term has long history concerns about overlap and duplication in federal government progra ms were expressed as early as 1920 when congress established joint committee on reorganization90 similar concerns were echoed in the late 1940s when the legislation enacting the hoover commission was being considered the hoover commissions c oncluding report prominently remarked on the wastes of overlapping and duplication91 m r recently other terms in addition to duplicative and overlapping have been used to describe several agencies or programs engaging in activities that some observers see as similar or related these terms include crosscutting fragmented and redundant gaos analysis of mission fragmentation and program overlap in federal agencies for example provides the an alytical foundation for much of the current discourse regarding federal programs that appear to do similar or related things92 n

evaluationscommissions presidential appointees house version or mix of presidential and congressional appointees sen ate version advocates of these provisions might argue that it is proper to give the commission flexibility to define these terms and that in any case their recommendations packaged as an implementation bill would still be subject to an upordown vote by congress however critics might argue that the terms are inherently subjective and that the legislations expedited procedures for congressional considerati on discussed and analyzed further below would not allow sufficient scrutiny of commissions recommendations and implementation bill if commission were to craft definitions for these terms it is possible that the commission would create and use standards fo r making some of these decisions as discussed in the following section standards and criteria for decision making the subject of decision making standards arose during the hearing in the 108th congress for s 1668 with senator voinovich discussing need to establish nonbiased criteria for recommending the elimination of programs96 former majority leader armey also testified that politics should not be allowe d to intrude in such process omb deputy director for management clay johnson iii testified that co mmission should use the bush administrations part to help make its determina tions section 3d of the carfa legislation which would requi re systematic assessment of programs by the president and the commissions cons ideration of these assessments contains framework of provisions that is arguably similar in structure and contents to the administrations part97 if congress chose to evaluate the carfa legislation congress would have precedent for paying close attention to commissions standards and criteria for making recommendations in the brac statute for example the secretary of defense was required to ar ticulate and publish in the federal register the proposed criteria for base closures with an oppor tunity for public comment 104 stat 1810 1811 section 2903b98 should congress wish to ex plore the topic of standards three perspectives from the program evaluation and social science literatures might be helpful in assessing standards that c ould be used by an eventual carfa the concepts of validity reliability and objectivity 99 in program evaluation and social science research validity has been defined as the extent to which any measuringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32726crs38 100 see edward g carmines and james woods validity in michael s lewisbeck alan bryman and tim futing liao eds the sage encyclopedia of social science research methods vol 3 thousand oaks ca sage p ublications 2004 p 1171 the authors elaborate thus the measuring instrument itself is not validated but the measuring instrument is validated in relation to the purpose for which it is being used 101 see peter chen and autumn d krauss reliability in michael s lewisbeck alan bryman and tim futing liao eds the sage

concept see martyn hammersley objectivity in michael s lewisbeck alan bryman and tim futing liao eds the sage encyclopedia of social science research methods vol 2 pp 750751 103 ibid p 750 thus analysts often ask whether given instrument can be improved ie whether the instruments chances of reac hing valid and reliable findings have been maximized an implication of these terms is that it is possible for an instrument to be objective but not valid measure of what it is intended to measure 104 see william m hix taking stock of the armys base realignment and closure selection process santa monica ca rand 2001 pp xvxvii the rand corporation is public nonprofit 501c3 corporation whose mission is to help improve policy and decisionmaking through research and analysis

of individual res ponses on measure that is the extent to which several attempts at measuring something are cons istent eg by several human judges or several uses of the same instrument101 finally the term objectivity has been defined as whether an inquiry is pursued in way that maximizes the chances that the conclusions reached will be true102 the opposite concept is subjectivity suggesting in turn concepts of bias prejudice or unfairness thus making judgment about the objectivity of test or researcher involves judging course of inquiry or an inquirer against some rational standard of how an inquiry ought to have been pursued in order to maximize th chances of producing true findings emphasis in original103 framework similar to the validityreliabilityobjectivity trio of concepts as summarized above was once used to assess brac commissions standards for decision making specifically in th context of the 1995 brac commissions consideration of us army bases an independent analysis by the rand corporation identified 10 cr iteria that should characterize an effective brac process104 the first criterion used by rand focused on the reliability of the assessment process the second criterion focused on objectivity and the remaining eight criteria arguably focuse d on several dimensions of validity with regard to the carfa legislation commission would need to make numerous determinations fo r nondefense discretionary programs in the executive branch whether program is duplicative wasteful etc how should one validly reliably and objectively determine program is irrelevant for example general consensus among stakeholders and research ers might exist on how to make these determinations for some programs as the commission elects to define the termhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32726crs39 105 for analysis of the part along these dimensions see crs report rl32663 the bush administrations program assessment rating tool part 106 if congress chose to enact the carfa proposal it is possible that congresss involvement with the commission would begin long before consideration of the actual implementation bill for example the commi ssion might engage in multiparty negotiations with the president congress and other entities or interest groups before submitting its final implementation bill for an overview of expedited legislative procedures see crs report rs20234 expedited or fast track legislative procedures for more detailed discussion see crs report 98888 fast track or expedited procedures their purposes elements and implications 107 for more

congress could as k if the carfa legi slations assessments might be completed validly reliably and objectively including by the administrations part an instrument whic h has been lauded by some observers and the subject of criticism among others105 to the extent that the part is seen as an essential or complementary tool for carfa and probably as the systematic method required by the legi slations section 3d pe rspectives on the part may help highlight or clarify issues for c ongress should it consider the proposed carfa act expedited congressional consideration distinctive feature of the carfa legislation is its provision for expe dited consideration by congress of the commissions recommendations packaged together in an implementation bill106 depending on an observers outlook these arra ngements could be considered to offer distinct advantages or disa dvantages for example possi ble advantages include the assurance that congress would actually c onsider the work of the commission less ability for members to engage in logrolling vote trading that could undermine the commissions recommendations and the preven tion of potential filibusters in the senate possible disadvantages however include less ability to engage in the compromises that are necessary for democratic system to function diminished power for minority groups in the senate nd movement away from the rights and prerogatives of individual senators to engage in extended debate unless an extraordinary majority votes to invoke cl oture the advantages and disadvantages relating to logrolling and constraint on members of the senate are discussed below logrolling and the carfa legislation when the brac commission legislation was being cons idered in 1990 there was broad consensus that the number and extent of military installations needed to be reduced in order to save funds107 supporters of the brac process ar gued that parochial politics prevented the closure of bases which they believed were longer needed critics countered that it was congresss responsibility to make these determinations not commissions and that presidential administrations had in the past used base closing decisions for political purposes in add ition there were many concerns about how these military installations were to be chosen if commissions recommendations could be amended during the legislative process memb ers of congress could face strong incentives to exclude some or all installations from the list perhaps viahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32726crs40 108 see discussion in ronald g shaiko

carfa act was notably different from brac in its provision for vote on approval for the continuedbartering votes on base closures with votes on other seemingly unrelated matters if this happened to large extent then the primary reason for pursuing the brac process saving funds might be undermined thus one ju stification for creating the brac commission framework was that it would prevent or at least limit vote trading or logrolling108 under the brac framework when commissions recommendations reached congress congress would be allowed only an upordown vote on resolution disapproving the package in its entirety w ith amendments if such resolution were passed within 45 days the recomme ndations would then be automatically implemented members of c ongress would not be able to make deals to exclude installations from the list of facilities to be realigned or closed which would preserve the integrity of the original list and its corresponding projected budget savings as recommended by the commission and transmitted by the president these provisions together with additional ones to help insulate the process from political manipulation by presidential administrations and make it open to the public became what were considered key attr ibutes of the brac statute109 concerns about logrolling were expresse d by the house sponsor of the proposed carfa act representative tiahrt during the 108th congress carfa is based on process with an tablished record of successful program elimination and prioritizing of spending the base realignment and closure commission or brac as it is called is similar only in how it deals strictly with military bases whereas hr 3213 will establish commission to conduct comprehensive review of federal agencies and programs and recommend the elimination or the realignment of duplic ative wasteful and outdated functions carfa provides for disciplined sp ending review process for nondefense nonentitlement programs congress will simply have to vote up or down on the commissions recommendations in their tirety the congressional logrolling that normally bogs down the process will be shortcircuited in this way real reform can emerge and the deficit and debt program can be brought under control110httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32726crs41 110 continued commissions recommendations rather than th brac legislations vote on disapproval 111 public choice theory

harvey s rosen public finance pp 119121 under costbenefit analysis person seeks to estimate the costs and benefits of an option for different actors typically by denominating both costs and benefits in dollar terms b the distributi on of benefits and costs among individuals and groups and c whether the total benefits fo r society outweigh the total costs resulting in computation of net benefits which can be positive or negative in any policy decision there will typically be winners those who have positive net benefits and losers those who have negative net benefits many econom ists are uncomfortable with costbenefit analysis if it computes overall net benef its for an option without taking account of distributional concerns among these winners and losers particularly if the the analysis is used to justify decisions without making comp ensating side payments to any losers see for example edward m gramlich guide to benefitcost analysis 2nd ed englewood cliffs nj prentice hall 1990 pp 3033 and paul samuelson and william d nordhaus microeconomics 15th ed new york mcgrawhill 1995 p 76 in such case economists argue that costbenefit analysis is equivalent to making interpersonal comparisons of the utility satisfaction nominated in dollars that stakeholders get from an option according to microec onomic theory when interpersonal utility comparisons are made without these side payments it becomes difficult or impossible to know if an option would actu ally make society better off 113 harvey s rosen public finance p 121according to public choice theory111 logrolling can improve or degrade societal welfare depending on the specifics of the situation including how strongly different individuals value several issues nd how value is to be measured112 which of these two approaches vote trading versus vote trading is better in given situation is open to interpretation and bate according to one textbook vote trading is controversial its proponents argue that trading votes leads to efficient provision of public goods just as trading commodities leads to efficient provision of private goods proponent s also emphasize the potential for revealing the intensity of preferences and establishing stable equilibrium moreover the compromises implicit in vote trading are necessary for democratic system to function on the other hand opponents of logrolling stress that it is likely to result in special interest gains not sufficient to outweigh general losses large amounts of waste can be incurred113 in sum different stakeholders may have different views on how the carfa legislations noamendment provisions would affect logrolling moreover theory alone does not indicate whether logrolling or the absence thereof would have beneficial or adverse consequences for society as whole compared to the other option httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32726crs42 114 article i section 5 of the constitution provides that each house may determine the rules of its

rights and senate procedures 117 section 7e of the carfa legislation not that the house and senate would still be able to change their rules in cluding the rules set out in the carfa legislation at any time continuedthree issues that congress might consid er in light of this discussion are whether legislation ba sed partially on the brac model which targeted military bases for realignment and closure based on widespread consensus would be appropriate for the case of reviewing nondefense discretionary agencies and programs under the house version of the carfa legislation or all executive branch agencies and programs under sena version for realignment or elimination when widespread cons ensus might or might not exist and when the commissions member ship would not require senate confirmation whether vote trading or the lack thereof in considering proposed carfa act would be likely to imp rove societal welfare and whether members believe the propos would be fully legitimate exercise of legislative power an abdication of that power or something in between constraint on potential f ilibusters in the senate section 7 of the carfa legislation would provide for expe dited congressional c onsideration of the commissions implementation bill as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the senate and house of representatives114 in the senate this provision would prohibit amendments and almost all pr ocedural delays unless majo rity of the senate did not wish to vote on or pass the commissions implementation bill thus in contrast to customary senate procedures which give individual sena tors considerable power to influence or delay the senates business senators would lose the ability to filibuster the implementation bill if any wished to prevent it from coming to vote115 in other words for purposes of considering th implementation bill proposed carfa acts expedited procedures could diminis h the power of minorities in the senate116 proponents might argue that the legislati ons expedited procedure provisions would make senate consid eration of the commissions r ecommendations more responsive to majority rule and speed consideration of the proposal opponents of this approach might maintain that it take s power away from minority gr oups in the senate and emphasizes the rights and prerogatives of individual senators to engage in extended debate unless an extraordinary ma jority votes to invoke cloture if one or more senators wished to modify the rules contained in the carfa legislation ie if the ca rfa act were enacted the senate could choose to do so by making changes to the expe dited consideration provisions117 this could be donehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32726crs43 117 continued in full recognition of the constitutional right of either house to

report by henry b hoguein several ways for example the senate could change the expedited procedures by unanimous consent if senator object ed to the unanimous consent request to change the expedited procedures superma jority of threefifths of all senators chosen and sworn normally 60 votes would be needed to invoke cloture and allow the senate to vote on the proposed changes to the expedited procedures by statute or standing order and finally invoking cloture to vote on an amendment to the senates standing rules woul d require supermajority of twothirds of all senators present and voting up to 67 votes in th house of representatives by contrast making changes to the carfa procedural rules would require only simple majority vote on the adoption of special rule some thing majority could achieve easily in essence then while the expe dited procedures would appl equally to both chambers in effect they would be considerably more restrictive on the senate than on the house transparency and participation another topic that congress could choose to consider is the transparency with which the carfa would be required to operate and related i ssues of public par ticipation past re view commissions have worked under wide range of requirements to open their work to public visibility participation and occasional accompanying scrutiny the brac commissions for example operated under the explicit requi rement that each meeting of the commission other than meetings in which cla ssified information is to be discussed shall be open to the public section 2902e 2a in addition the brac statute specified that all the proceedings information and deliberations of the commission shall be open upon request to the chairmen and ranking members of several congressiona l committees and subcommittees section 2902e2b by contrast the hoover commissions authorizin g statute was silent on the subject of transparency and participa tion the hoover commission predated the enactment of faca which sets out requirements govern ing public access to meetings and records as well as public participa tion and other open governme nt laws more recent review commission the 911 commission wa s explicitly excluded from facas requirements and required to hold public hearings to the extent appropriate118 as discussed previously in this report it is unclear whether carfa would be covered by faca or affected by its requirements eg advisory committee meetings are presumptively open to the public carfa would also probably not be subject to the government in the sunshine act 90 stat 1241119

departments government corporations government controlled corporations independent regulatory agenci or any other establishment in the executive branch of the government including the executive office of the president however if the commission were deemed strictly advisory in nature it would not be covered by foia if cong ress chose to enact the carfa legislation and in the event that the commission were considered an establishment in the executive branch foia would likely be he ld to cover the commission based on the fact that under section 4 of the legisla tion the carfa would have investigatory powers if court were to address this question in energy research foundation v defense nuclear facilities safety board 917 f2nd 581 dc cir 1990 the court held that the board which was responsible for reviewing evaluating investigating and making recommendations to the department of energy regarding standards and safety issues pertaining to nuclear facilities of the department was subject to foia basing its decision on the fact that the board had investigatory powers120 in sum therefore it is not clear the extent to which carfa would be able to conduct its work outside public and congressional view g convene meetings hold hearings and formulate recommendations if it chose to pursue that course some might see advantages associated with an approach that kept the commissions activities largely outside public or cong ressional view for example supporters might maintain that by limiting public involvement carfa would avoid public or interest group pressure as it weighed individual and difficult policy recommendations issue by issue from th perspective of supporters this could potentially help carfas recommendations to be formulated seen and considered as cohesive package furthermore because the co mmission would be advisory carfas recommendations still would have to be considered by congress albeit under expedited procedures and signe d by the president before any recommendations became law however some disadvantages could also be associated with an approach that other observers might see as lacking tran sparency and participation for example the commissions recommendations might lose credibility if observers were not sure who was involved both inside and outside government in formulating them in addition critics might argue that the legisl ations expedited congressional procedures would not allow for enough time or public participation to c onsider what could be large changes to large subset of federal programs or for b

implications 2 commission should have ties with central managerial agencies in the executive branch and with committees w ith general management responsibilities in congress others besides the commission must have stake in the success of the exercise 3 commissions should be cognizant of the distinctive legal character of governmental organization and activities included in any commission review should be review with recommendations of the general management laws pertinent to the mandate of the commission 4 there should be some consensus in advance among commission members regarding the organizational principles to be applied in their review and recommendations commissions do not tend to be effective vehicles for generating consensus if none previously existed122 gao also weighed in with lessons regarding successful government restructurings the lesson of the two hoover commissions is clear if plans to reorganize government are to move from recommendation to reality creating consensus for them is essential to the task in this regard both the process employed and the players involved in making any specific reorganization proposals are of critical importance the success of

undertaking specific reorganization legisla tion as it did with the homeland security act of 2002 116 stat 2287 when it created the department of homeland security or alternatively reauthorizing executive reorganization authority127 in the past reorganization was viewed largely as technical exercise that could be delegated to experts in the executive branch in recent decades however commentators have seen reorganizations as also having potentially significant institutional policy and political consequences128 in 1995 gao explored many of the associated issues129 in 2003 the comptro ller general recommended streamlining and simplifying the federal governments organizational structure to address duplicative overlapping nd conflicting and out dated government programs policies and operations130 furthermore the national commission on the public service second volcke r commission recommended fundamental reorganization of the federal government into limited number of missionrelated executive departments in order to enhance mission coherence and role clarification131 according the second volcke r commissions proposal the choice of agency subordinate organizations and personnel systems traditionally the subject of congressional ttention and negotiation w ould be defined by the president and subject to oversight by omb and the office of personnel management

organizationa l performance grouping organizations together can be vi ewed as doubleedged sword on one hand grouping eases the flow of information within the boundaries of the group by providing common language common goal and indeed even common view of the world the group beco mes an identifiable subculture of the larger organization and the sharing and processing of information become easier but the boundaries inevitably become barrier s making it more difficult to share information outside the group and often engendering conflict competition and lack of cooperation among groups its essential to keep in mind that organizations in the final analysis are political systems with complex patterns of power and influence if new grouping patterns seem to elevate one gr oup over another channel increased resources to particular activity or substantially alter reporting relationships some manager or group will be seen as winning at the expense of someone else strategic grouping by definition separa tes some jobs and individuals at the same time it brings others together133 it is possible that congress had similar concerns when enacting the homeland security act when congress included s ection 888 preserving coast guard mission performance 116 stat 2249 in the bill which prohibited the secretary of the department of homeland security dhs from substantially or significantly reducing the nonhomeland security missions of th coast guard furthermore in the 108th congress s 910 nonhomeland secur ity mission performance act of 2003 was reported from committee favorably with ame ndments articulating concerns that non homeland security missions eg maritime search and rescue fisheries enforcement asylum for refugees protecting against counterfeiting etc be preserved and not crowded out by homeland securityrelated activities134 similar concerns could apply to other proposed executive branch reorganizations establishing commission like the carfa might arguably entail some advantages compared to reorganization wh ether that reorganization were undertaken through the regular legislative process or executive reorganization authority for example in contrast to reorganization th rough the regular legislative process the carfa legislation would expedite congre ssional consideration of the commissions recommendations without the risk of am endments undermining the cohesiveness of the package the carfa legislation woul d arguably impose fewer restrictions upon the commissions recommendations compared with executive reorganization authority which if renewe d would impose number of restrictions on what reorganization plans could contain eg prohibition on abolishing statutoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32726crs49 135 critics of proposal like the carfa act could point out that congress has protected these prerogatives before the reorgani zation act of 1977 as amended was allowed to expire after the supreme court ruled in ins v chadha that the legislative veto statutory check on executive branch discretion was unconstitutional 462 us 919 1983 136 for more information on gpra see crs report rl30795 general management laws compendium entry

thus have more flexibility to deal with broad range of policy matters other observers might see disadvantages in the carfa proposal compared to reorganization through the regular legisl ative process or executive reorganization authority compared to carfa pursuing reorganization or policy changes through the regular legislative process could be seen as preserving important congressional prerogatives under the constitutions separa tion of powers and checks and balances subjecting proposals to mo re deliberation transparency and public participation135 in addition congress enacted majo r legislative changes to tax laws in 1986 social policy in 1996 farm subsidies in 1996 and homeland security agencies in 2002 by relying on existing processes and institutions the carfa legislation could also be seen as having disadvantages compared to executive branch reorganization authority if congress were concerned about giving too much power to the president because executive branch reorganization authority if renewed would be subject to many restrictions re garding what the president could propose for expedited congressional cons ideration the executive branchs legislative powers would be arguably more constrained under renewed reorganization act than new carfa act use gpra another potential alternative or complement for the carfa legislation which congress might consider is continued or expanded usage and oversight of the government performance and results act136 congress enacted gpra to accomplish several goals including to systematically hold federal agencies accountable for achieving prog ram results imp rove congressional decisionmaking by providing more objec tive information on achieving statutory objectives and on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of federal programs and spending and improve internal ma nagement of the fe deral government137 thus gpra established statutory foundation intended for examining issues among others that carfa would also emphasize the extent to which gpra has been ccessful in moving toward these goals has been subject of discussion and debate in congress and the legislative branch in the

and the bush administrations part initiative still ot hers might question whether gpra or its implementation have focused on the right things apart from the carfa legislation number of observers have advocat ed for continued use of the bush administrations part as complement to gpra in order to forge link between performance and budgets140 however some others have criticized the part for inconsistency its emphasis on serving the needs of the executive branch without the significant involvement of cong ress and other stakeholders and its focus on individual programs instead of issues th at cut across several agencies eg food safety141 proponents of carfa might argue that it would bring several advantages compared to using gpra alone including 1 producing an integrated and internally consistent set of recomme ndations for congressional c onsideration 2 potentially insulating the commissions deliberations from daytoday politics thereby potentially allowing the commissioners more flexibility to investigate controversial options and develop innovativ recommendations 3 potentially establishing some measure of independence for the commissi ons recommendations

compared to using gpra one including 1 potential duplication of effort with federal agencies in evaluatin g programs and agencies 2 arguably less transparency and participation in form ulating and

considerati on of legislation that might otherwise have stood little chance of enactme nt had there been opportunity for more scrutiny of commission recommendations bolster agency program evaluation capacity through chief program evaluation officers congress could also consider bolstering program evaluation capacity in federal agencies as potential alternative or complement for the carfa legislation many observers have asse rted that agencies frequently do not adequately evaluate the performance or results of their programs or integrate evaluation efforts acro ss agency boundaries possibly due to lack of capacity management attention and commitment or resources142 bolstering the program evaluation capacity at federal agenci could arguably address many of the same issues that carfa would address if congress found adequate progress has not been made in evaluating federal programs and agencies and if congress deemed these to be serious problems congress might establish chief program evaluation officer cpeo positions in major agencies to bring mo re attention to this func tion chief officer positions have proliferated in recent years143 because programs can differ

interdisciplinary evaluation methods differ from program to program144 common theme behind the creation of each of these chief officer positions was many observers belief that senior managers within executive branch agencies paid insufficient attention to given functional perspective eg financial manage ment information technology in managing their agencies therefore observers believed that each functional perspective needed to be elevated to higher position within ag encies management ranks as means to ensure that longstanding problems would be addressed145 this situation may hold true for th program evaluation function in some agencies the comptroller gene ral stated in late 2002 that unfortunately there is reason to be concerned about the capacity of federal agencies to produce evaluations of their programs effectiveness many program evaluation offices are small have other responsibilities and produce only few effectiveness studies annually even where the value of evaluations is recognized they may not be considered funding priority146 if agency program evaluation staff and organizations struggle for visibility even with regard to their own programs these units might face an even more difficult task in attempting to look across agencies at cr osscutting overlapping duplicative or fragmented program areas if congress chose to establish cpeo positions in major agencies it might also consider establishing corresponding in teragency council of cpeos cpeos might be tasked to help the agencies ensu re quality performance information evaluate crosscutting programs in addition to the agencys indigenous programs and reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32726crs53 147 however for other functional areas presidents william clinton and george w bush both have used interagency councils of chief officers viz the cfo council and cio council to undertake complex initiatives and foster interagency collaboration 148 for example the first hoover commission s concluding report commented that time limitations given the level of resources at the commissions disposal constrained the breadth and depth of the commissions activities limitations of time made it manifestly impossible for this commission to inspect all the activities of the government thus in the early stages of planning our attention was directed upon the largest spending activities of the government with the expectation that these functi ons would provide the most fruitful ground for economy and savings as result some smaller agencies either were not surveyed at all were partially studied or were considered only from the standpoint of how they might be related to the executive structure as whole our exclusion of these agencies does not imply that their operations should not also be carefully appraised on th contrary our own findings offer clear evidence of the value of further continui ng study into the remaining relatively untouched areas of the government in our opinion the logical course would be to assign this task to both the office of the budget and to the depa rtments themselves through their management research staffs they would ppear to be best equipped to do the job on continuing basis see commission on organization of the ex ecutive branch of the government concluding report pp 4546findings and information to congress unde r current law it is ones explicit job to do this coordination147 proponents of pursuing this option ap art from the carfa legislation might argue that establishing these chief officer positions could create seat at the table for program evaluation in agency senior management teams potentially helping agencies to improve performance or coordi nate programs with overlapping missions however critics might argue that establishing another type of chief officer would be excessive for agency leaders and management teams if this option were viewed in context with the carfa legislation as an alternative or complement it could be seen by observers as bringing potential advantag or disadvantages for example some might see bolstered agency program evaluation efforts as an essential complement for carfa commission could then draw upon the work of program evaluation units and officers in federal agencies148 on the other hand some observers might see carfa as essentially duplicative of the agency cpeos and unaccountable to congress
