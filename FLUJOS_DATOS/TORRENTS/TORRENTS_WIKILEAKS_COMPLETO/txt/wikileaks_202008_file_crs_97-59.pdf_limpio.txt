limitations on the power of congress to tax are found in the constitution there is only one express exception to fe deral taxing power found in the united states constitution article i section 9 provides tax or dut shall be laid on articles exported from any state the constitution divides all taxes into two classifications direct taxes and indirect taxes direct taxes must be vied according to the rule of apportionment and indirect taxes must be levied according to the rule of uniformity it is important to note and emphasize th at these are classifications for purposes of how taxes ma be levied not denials of taxing power the federal government may enact direct taxes but if it does so they must be apportioned among the states the classification of direct taxes and th rule of apportionment are set forth in article i section 9 clause 4 of the constitution which states capitation or other direct tax sha ll be laid unless in proportion to the census of enumeration herein before directed to be taken there are two types of direct taxes that therefore have to be apportioned taxes on property real or personal and capitation taxes head taxes congress has in the past levied taxes on property in 1813 congress levied direct tax on property totaling three million dollars which the stat ute apportioned among the 18 states and then among the counties parishes of each state1 thus for example 36901844 was apportioned to virginia and 635450 of that amount apporti oned to fairfax county provisions for assessing and collec ting the tax were contained in the act of july 22 18132 direct tax on property to taling 20 million was levied in 1861 apportioned among the states territori and the district of columbia3 congress has never enacted head tax the classification of indirect taxes and the rule of uniformity are set forth in article i section 8 clause 1 of the constitution which stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9759crs2 4 united states v ptasynski 462 us 74 1983 5 157 us 429 rehearing 158 us 601 1895 6 28 stat 509 1894 7 157 us at 581 8 id at 583the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states but all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the united states all taxes which are not direct are indirect and subject to the rule of uniformity the rule of uniformity requires that an indirect tax not discriminate geographically4 for example it would violate the rule of uniformity to enact special income tax ratefor residents of the state of texas howev er it does not violate the rule to have special income tax rate for indi viduals who make over 50000 per year 2 is the federal income tax direct or indirect tax the most direct answer to this question is that since the ratification of the sixteenth amendment it makes practical difference which classification one gives to the income tax as stated above the only distinction between direct tax and an indirect tax is that the direct ta x must be apportioned as discussed below the sixteenth amendment without classi fying the income tax empowers congress to lay and collect taxes on incomes fro m whatever source without apportionment prior to the ratification of the sixteenth amendment the question of classification of the income tax was central to the determination as to its constitutionality in pollock v farmers loan and trust company5 the supreme court struck down the income tax act of 18946 the 1894 act imposed federal income tax on the gains profits and income received in the preceding calendar year by every citizen of the united states whether said gains profits or income be derived from any kind of property rents interest dividends or salaries or from any profession trade employment or voca tion carried on in the united states or elsewhere after extensive examination of the history of the constitutional provisions dealing with the federal taxing power the court found that the constitution had sought to avoid the levy of burdening tax on accumulations of property real or personal except as subject to th regulation of apportionment7 the court concluded that tax imposed on the rent s or income of real estate was not significantly distinct from tax on the property itself and was therefore direct tax within the meaning of the constitution8httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9759crs3 9 28 stat 509 10 158 us at 637 11 see nicol v ames 173 us 509 1899 tax on certain sales and exchanges of property knowlton v moore 178 us 41

that all income taxes were direct taxes rather it held that although income taxes are generally indirect taxes in the nature of excises subject only to the rule of uniformity income taxes on the gains derived from investments in real or personal property d so substantial an impact on the underlying assets that they should be viewed as direct taxes falling on the property in this respect the 1894 tax would have been valid to the extent that it was imposed on gains profits or income derived from salaries or from any pro fession trade employment or vocation9 nonetheless on rehearing pollock the court struck down the entire 1894 act because it believed that to void only the tax on income derived from investments in real and personal property and leave the tax burden solely upon wages and other form s of compensation income would be contrary to the congressional intent10 some uncertainty followed in the years after pollock the court held repeatedly that various taxes imposed by the congre ss were indirect in nature and could be levied without regard to the rule of apportionment11 the sixteenth amendment to the united states constitution was ratified in 1913 and provides that the congress shall have power to and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration the congress immediately took advantage of this perceived clarification of its power and enacted another federal income tax substantially similar to the 1894 tax12 the 1913 tax was imposed on gains profits and income derived from salaries wages or compensation for personal service of whatever kind and in whatever form paid or from professions vocations businesses trade commerce or sales or dealings in property whether real or personal grow ing out of the ownership or use of or interest in real or personal property so from interest rent dividends securities or the transaction of any lawful business carried on for gain or profit or gains or profits and income derived from any sour ce whatever including the income from but not the value of property acquired by gift bequest devises or descent in 1916 the supreme court examined the new income tax in light of the sixteenth amendment and the other cons titutional provisions di scussed above and found that it was constitutional in its entiret the review of the 1913 income taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9759crs4 13 240 us 1 1916 14 id at 1617 15 id at 18 for more recent cases disc ussing the apportionment question see united states v collins 920 f2d

brushaber v union pacific railroad company 13 in which stockholder of the union pacific railroad company sought to enjoin the corporation from paying the recentlyimposed income tax on the grounds that the tax was unconstitutional the supreme court in decision written by chief justice white first noted that the sixteenth amendment did not authorize any new type of tax nor did it repeal or revoke the tax clauses of article i of th constitution q uoted above direct taxes were notwithstanding the advent of the sixteenth amendment still subject to the rule of apportionment and indi rect taxes were still subject to the rule of uniformity rather the court found that the sixteenth amendment sought to restrain the court from viewing an income tax because of its close effect on the underlying property as direct tax the court noted that the inherent character of an income tax was that of an indirect tax stating moreover in addition the conclusion reached in the pollock case did not in any degree involve the holding that income taxes generically and necessarily came within the class of direct taxes on prope rty but on the contrary recognized the fact that taxation on income was in the nature an excise entitled to be enforced as such unless and until it was concluded that to enforce it would amount to accomplishing the result which the requirement as to apportionment of direct taxes was adopted to prevent in whic h case the duty would arise to disregard form and consider substance alone and hence subject the tax to the regulation as to apportionment which otherwise as an excise would not apply to it14 the language of the sixteenth amendment the court found in brushaber was solely intended to eliminate the principle upon which the pollock case was decided that is of determining whether tax on income was direct not by consideration of the burden placed on the taxed income upon which it directly operated but by taking into view the burden which resulted on the property from which the income was derived since in express terms the amendment provid that income taxes from whatever source derived shall not be subject to the regulation of apportionment15 3 what does the court mean when it states that the income tax is in the nature of an excise tax an excise tax is tax levied on the manufacture sale or consumption of commodity or any of various taxes on priv ileges often assessed in the form of license or fee in other words it is tax on property transaction or on an activityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9759crs5 16 hollingsworth v virginia 3 us 378 1798 this case involved the bill of rights which had been referred to the states wit hout having been presented to president washington 17 38 stat 785 1913not tax on the property itself sales tax is clear example of an excise tax the tax is not on the property directly but rather it is tax on the transaction when court refers to an income tax as being in the nature of an excise it is merely stating that the tax is not on the property itself but rather it is tax on the transaction of receiving gain from the pr operty or labor the tax is based upon the amount of the gain not on the value of the property 4 was the sixteenth amendment properly ratified did the president sign th resolution which became the sixteenth amendment president taft did not sign the resolution which became the sixteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states the supreme court ruled in 1798 that resolutions of congress proposing amendments to the constitution need not be submitted to the president16 therefore the failure of president taft to sign the proposed amendment has effect upon the constitutionality or legality of the sixteenth amendment b do clerical errors in th ratifying resolutions of the various state legislatures nega the ratification of the sixteenth amendment the sixteenth amendment became part of the constitution of the united states in 1913 when certified by the secret ary of

its adoption it was contended however that the ratifying re solutions of tennessee and west virginia were inoperative because the resolutions of t hose states had been adopted in violation of their rules of legislative procedure in answer to this contention the court held the proclamation by the secretary certif ied that from official documents on file in the department of state it appeared that the proposed amendment was ratified by the legislatures of thirtysix states nd that it has become valid to all intents and purposes as part of the constitution of the united states as the legislatures of tennessee and of west virginia had power to adopt the resolutions of ratification official noti ce to the secretary duly authenticated that they had done so was conclusive upon him nd being certified by his proclamation is conclusive upon the courts20 in support of this conclusion the court relied upon the reasoning of field v clark21 in that case the court held that an enrolled bill was conclusive evidence of statutory enactment the court noted that such bill is signed by the speaker and the president of the senate an attestation that it passed congress as signed and when the president signs it also indicates his attestation that the measure was properly passed by congress the respect due to coequa l and independent depa rtments requires the judicial department to act upon the assura nce to accept as having passed congress all bills authenticated in the stated manner22 the court in leser felt the same respect must be given the certification by the secretary of state23

returns yes taxpayers do have protection of the fifth amendment when filing their tax returns however this has never been interpreted to permit blanket refusal to give any information on the return the fifth amendment states person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself the supreme court has held that the privilege against selfincrimination though founded in the constitution itself does not fr ee taxpayer from the obligation to file an income tax return27 an individual may however refuse to provide specific item of information if that information would tend to incriminate the individual for instance while the amount of income person received in year would not be protected the source of the income might be incriminating and therefore the privilege could be invoked28httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9759crs8 29 id 30 pl 99514 100 stat 2085 99t h cong 2nd sess 1986 31 see 1 usc 202the court has set out the ppropriate procedures to be followed by taxpayer who wishes to assert the privilege against selfincrimination with respect to an item which should otherwise be reported on an individuals tax return the taxpayer should assert the privilege on the return submitting all other information if the internal revenue service brings criminal charges against the taxpayer for failure to file complete return the taxpayer may raise the privilege against selfincrimination in defense the judge would then dete rmine whether or not the privilege was justified and if it wa s justified the criminal charges would not be pe rmitted to stand however the irs may recompute the income tax of taxpayer who refuses to provide requested data if the irs determines from its own investigation that taxpayer owes additional taxes it may assess deficiency in this case the taxpayer has the burden to establish the correct lia bility absent evidence supplied by the taxpayer the assessment by the irs will be presumed accurate29 in this respect the taxpayer may assert the privilege against selfincrimination to prevent being compelled to give certain information but one result may be lia bility for additional income taxes 6 is title 26 of the united states code internal revenue law this question stems from the fact that some titles of the united states code usc have been enacted into what is called positive law and others have not title 26 internal reve nue has not been enacted into positive law the usc is divided into fifty titles of these fifty titles twenty and part of another have been enacted into positive law if title has been so enacted the text of that title constitutes legal evidence of the laws in that title if the title has not been so enacted the title is only prima facie evidence of the actual law the courts could require proof of the statutes underlying the title which are the positive law when the title has not been enacted into positive law the office of law revision counsel whic h has the responsibility for preparing titles for enactment into positive law states that titles are chosen for enactment into positive law on two bases some are chos because of cong ressional mandate that the laws be codified otherwise the office of law revision counsel prefers to select titles which cover areas of minimal legislative activity the tax laws do not meet either one of these criteria the underlying statute and the positive

question is usually based on one of two arguments historical or definitional the historical argument derives from the congressional debates on the sixteenth amendment in 1909 most of the debate centered on the taxing of income from capital assets and the taxing of corpor ations the proponent s of the position that wages are not taxable income claim that the sixteenth amendment was therefore only intended to allow taxation of income from capital the fallacy of this argument is that taxation of wages had never been found unconstitutional and therefore an amendmen t to the constitution was not necessary to permit this type of taxation the si xteenth amendment was enacted in response to the supreme court decision in pollock v farmers loan and trust company33 in which the income tax act of 189434 was struck down the 1894 act imposed federal income tax on the gains profits and income received in the preceding calendar year by every citizen of the united states whether said gains profits or income be derived from any kind of property rents intere st dividends or salaries or from any profession trade employment or voca tion carried on in the united states or elsewhere the court in pollock found that the constitution had sought to avoid the levy of burdening tax on accumulations of property real or personal except as subject to the regulation of apportionment35 the court concluded that tax imposed on the rents or income of real estate was not significantly distinct from tax on the property itself and was therefore direct tax within the meaning of the united states constitution36 the pollock court did not however hold that all income taxes were direct taxes rather it held that although income taxes are generally indirect taxes in the nature of excises subject only to the rule of uniformity income taxes on the gains derived from investments in real or pers onal property had so substantial an impact on the underlying assets that they should be viewed as direct taxes falling on the property in this respect the 1894 tax would have been valid to the extent that it was imposed on gains profits or income rived from salaries or from any prohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9759crs10 37 28 stat 509 38 158 us at 637 39 this argument has been uniformly rejected see commr v glenshaw glass co 348 us 426 42930 1955 reese v united states 24 f3d 228

macomber 252 us 189 1920 42 id 43 it should be noted that mr doe does not have to receive money for the property for there to be realization of his gain as long as the total value of money property and moneys worth he receives is greater than hi s basis he has realized gainfession trade employment or vocation37 nonetheless on rehearing pollock the court struck down the entire 1894 act because it believed that to void only the tax on income derived from investments in real and personal property and leave the tax burden solely upon wages and other form s of compensation income would be contrary to the congressional intent38 therefore since only the taxation of income derived from capital had been found to be unconstitutional unl ess apportioned the debate on the sixteenth amendment centered on the taxation of this type of income the definitional argument concerning the taxation of wages is based on the contention that labor worth certain amount is exchanged for money worth the same amount and therefore there is income to be taxed39 this argument fails from lack of understanding of the concept of ta xable income there are three basic requirements which must be satisfied before income is considered taxable income the requirements are gain realization and recognition the sixteenth amendment clarified the power of congress to lay and collect taxes on income from whatever source derived40 income has been defined as gain derived from capital from labor or from both combined41 the operative word in this definition is gain gain in the tax context is the surplus when the basis of an item in many cases basis is synonymous with cost is subtracted from the items fair market value for example john doe purchases piece of real estate with fair market value of 5000 for cost of 5000 one year later the property has appreciated in value to fair market value of 6000 mr doe has gain of 1000 current fair market va lue 6000 minus 5000 basis the gain in the example above is not taxable gain though because it has not been realized the supreme court has ruled that income is not taxable until it has been realized ie received or the right to receive has been established42 therefore if mr doe sold his property for 6000 he would realize his gain of 100043 the next question which must be answer ed is whether congress has determined that this type of gain should be taxed in other words should this gain be recognized congress has determin ed by enacting internal reve nue code irc section 61ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9759crs11 that every type of gain should be taxe d unless it has been specifically excluded in some other part of the tax code section 61a provides except as otherwise provided in this subtitle gross income means all income from whatever source derived the except as otherwise provided clause anticipates specific nonrecognition provisions good example of nonrecognition provision is irc 103 which excludes the interest from certain state nd local bonds from gross income interest on these bonds is gain and when paid or constructively receive d it is realized but congress has specifically decided not to recognize it wages to be taxable must pass the same type of examination for example if john doe works 5 hours for 500 per hour is the 2500 he receives taxable income to him as we have seen in the above an alysis we must determine if there has been gain which is realized and recognized to see if there was gain we do not look only to the fair market value of the labor but rather we determine the difference between what was received and the basis cost in the labor generally one has zero basis in ones own labor therefore does gain is 2500 minus 0 or 2500 this gain is realized when doe is paid or has right to receive payment the gain is recognized specifically in irc 61a1 compensation for services and there is nonrecognition section which is generally applicable to wages therefore john doe has 2500 of taxable income 8 do we have voluntary tax system we do not have voluntary tax system in the sense that payment of taxes is optional there are specifi c provisions of law which re quire the payment of income taxes there are civil and criminal penalties for failing to pay these taxes or file the required returns several ra ther tenuous arguments have been put forward to support the contention that paying income tax is optional first statements by many including some by past irs commissioners have been taken out of context to support this position the phrase voluntary tax system is commonly used in discussion of our tax compliance system the united states does have system of collecting taxes that depends to certain extent upon voluntary compliance although this country doe s have withholding on certain types of income much of the income tax revenues come from tax on other sources of income such as interest dividends selfemploymen t etc where the individual must supply the information for the system to function efficiently supplying this information is not voluntary in the meaning of optional however if large percentage of the citizenry did not report their income our system of collection would not workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9759crs12 44 helvering v mitchell 303 us 391 1938 united states v gerads 999 f2d 1256 8th cir 1993 schiff v united states 919 f2d 830 2nd cir 1990 cert den 501 us 1238 1991

commr tc memo 1884 223 48 see newman v schiff 778 f2d 460 8th cir 1985efficiently leading to the often misunders tood statement that we rely upon voluntary compliance in our tax system44 another argument which purports to support the optional na ture of our tax system is based upon the privacy act noti ce contained in the irs 1040 form the privacy act of 197445 requires among other things that each agency soliciting information from the public state the authority which authorizes the solicitation whether the disclosure requested on the fo rm is mandatory or voluntary and the effect of not providing the information the privacy act notice in the irs 1040 form instruction booklet does not use the wo rd mandatory therefore the argument is put forth that filing the return is voluntary the privacy act notice in the irs 1040 form instruction booklet states that the authority to seek the information is found in i rc 6001 and 6 011 and their regulations that one must file return show

mandatory is not required and that the notice in the 1040 form meets the requirements of the privacy act46 another semantic argument put forth in this area revolves around the use of the word liable in tax acts the contention is made that the income tax statute does not use the magic words individual is made liable and therefore an individual is not liable for income taxes the federal courts have not had much time for this argument characterizing it as arrogant sophistry47 and blatant nonsense48 the first description is perhaps the most apt the proponent of this argument has set up standard that all taxes must meet the income tax does not meet this standard he therefore concludes there is something wrong with the income tax the problem is not in the income tax but in the standard there

of proposed assessment giving the taxpayer an opportunity to seek administrative review of the determination within the next thirty days if the taxpayer fails to request administrative review or if

fails to do so the irs may collect the tax through judicial proceedings or through its power of levy and distraint the power of levy and distraint gives the irs the ability to seize the assets of taxpayer and sell them applying the proceeds to the outstanding tax liability58 the supreme court has held that the exercise of these powers is constitutional and that such extrajudicial seizures and sales do not violate the protections of the fourth amendment against unreasonable search and seizures because the taxpayer will already have ample opportunity for j udicial review of the deficiency59 the court has referred to the power of the irs to levy on taxpayers property as an essential part of our selfassessment tax system whi ch enhances voluntary compliance in the collection of taxes60 the

taxes imposed by the code whether the income is received from sources within or without the united states112 the reason that source of income rule s apply primarily to nonresident aliens and foreign
