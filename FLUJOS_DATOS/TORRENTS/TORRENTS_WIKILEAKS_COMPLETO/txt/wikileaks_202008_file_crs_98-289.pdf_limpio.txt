justice system while at the same time eroding public confidence in the governments ability to protect its citizens3 under existing practices ther have been four traditiona l methods utilized by law enforcement to address the problem of w itness intimidation these methods include requesting high bail for known int imidators aggressively prosecuting reported intimidators closely managing key witnesses and expanding victimwitness program assistance services however these trad itional approaches to addressing witness intimidation appear to have had limited effect gangs have become more interstate in their scope of operation and th eir ability and willingness to tr ace witnesses to other states has expanded thereby creating the need for greater federal role in responding to gang related witness intimida tion this is also compounded by the fact that the nature and sophistication of witness prot ection programs varies widely among the states some jurisdictions have programs but have chosen not to f und them other localities lack funds and personnel and in general have witn ess relocation capability4 according to the house report there is currently federal law directly addressing the interstate relocation of witnesses5 the purpose of the hearings held on june 16 19976 was to examine the growing problem of gangrelated intimidation and retaliation against witnesses
