profit review 2005 updated january 12 2007 robert pirog specialist in energy economics and policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33373oil industry profit review 2005 summary the increase in world oil prices that began in 2004 and continued into 2005 led to increasing revenues and net incomes for ll sectors of the oil industry in 2004 and continuing into 2005 increasing world dema nd led by china india and the united states created tight market in both il production and refining at time where spare capacity was already at historically low levels in addition in 2004 and 2005 world political events including the war in iraq political unrest in nigeria and the political climate in venezuela among others contributed to market psychology that pushed up prices in the us domestic market the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita continue to be felt both in oil producti on and oil refining the hu rricanes also contributed to the profitability of the oil industry in the us market however while profits were high the oil market demonstrated its ability to supply consumers as feared shortages associated with the hurricanes were very limited the profits of the five major integr ated oil companies accounted for three quarters of all the profits ear ned by the integrated oil companies in this group oil production led the way as the most profitable segment ev though production of oil and natural gas generally declined on percentage basis the percentage gr owth in profits for the independent oil and gas producers was even higher than the integrated oil companies their total profit however was only bout 15 of the profit of the integrated companies independent refiners and marketer s earned 92 profit increase in 2005 compared to 2004 valero the largest firm in this group and the largest refiner in the united states led the way with 99 incr ease in profit and earne d almost two thirds of the profit of the group as whole high levels of profit c oupled with declining growth rates for profit appear likely to continue in 2006 the potential vola tility of the world oil market leaves any forecast for the industry uncertain this

us crude oil was up 365 in 2005 compared to 2004 refinery capacity utilization rates ran in excess of 90 for much of the year and two hurricanes katrina and rita struck the us gulf co ast the location of major portion of the us oil production and refining industry as result of these and other domestic and world oil market conditions the oil industry as whole brought in record revenues and earned r ecord profits in 20051 in 2005 the oil industry recorded reve nues of 162 trillion of which 81 was accounted for by the fi ve major integrated oil companies profits for the industry totaled almost 140 billion 76 of which were earned by the five major integrated oil companies with the largest company exxonmobil earning over 25 of the total profit although the financia l results for the industry were at record levels the performance of the various s ectors of the industry as well as individual companies within those sectors varied leaving some firms as relative underperformers compared to the industry leaders this report analyzes the industrys profit performance in 20052 while recent profits in the oil industry are of interest to investors analysts and public policy specialists among others longer term pe rspective is important in understanding the performance of the industry for example as recently as 2002 the financial picture in the oil industry was far different with declining earnings in key sectors such as refining the oil industry historically has been cyclic with periods of high earnings often followed by sharp declines driven by movements in the world price of crude oil for this reason projections of future industry performance based on current performance are likely to be mistaken integrated oil company profits integrated oil companies operate in both the upstream exploration and production and the downstream refining nd marketing segments of the industry among the integrated oil companies listed in table 1 the five largest companies are usually

in table 1 in an advertisement appearing soon af ter the oil companies announced their 4th quarter 2005 financial results the american petroleum institute api sought to compare the returns earned in the oil industry to other american industries3 they compared return on sales in the oil i ndustry to returns ear ned in seven other industries as well as us industry as whole for the period october 2000 through september 2005 they found that the oil and natural gas industry earned only 03 more than industry as whole and was ra nked sixth of the eigh t covered industries just above the average for all us industry4 the integrated oil companies earning returns of 82 on sales in 2005 exceeded the historical api rates of return by over 41 since calculating return on sales dilutes the effect of growing total profits of the industry due to higher prices and growin g revenues another standard percentage measure of profitability return on equity is presented this measure indicates the success of the company and industry in earni ng profit by utilizing the invested capital of the owners the shareholders of the co mpany this measure is widely used byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33373crs4 5 exxonmobils return on assets another common profit measure was 174 in 2005 6 the key question for investors and others is whether these returns will continue in the future something unknowableinvestors and financial analysts in evaluating the performance of firms seeking access to capital markets by this measure the integrated oil companies returned 268 in 2005 over three times the return on sales the industry leader exxonmobil earned 3255 these rates of return are likely to assure these firms and the industrys position as desirable investment as l ong as the price of oil

oil companies in 2005 tables 1 and 2 show that upstream net income growth led overall corporate net income growth for most of the companies and they earned almost 50 of their total net income from upstream activities although oil and gas production was up by less than 1 fo r each product in oil three of the four largest producers experienced declining output in natural gas four of the five

february 28 2005 p 8factors7 for example the bp refinery at texa s city was out of operation in the third quarter 2005 due to an explosion and fire8 the effect of these events was that despite high refining margins several firms were unable to take full advantage of the earning potential that was available because of unexpected plant closures while it might appear from the data in table 3 that contrary to popular belief refining and marketing were underperformer s in 2005 the results must be set against the performance of 2004 while net in come grew by onl 139 in 2005 this followed net incomes that had increased by 967 in 2004 allowing refining to lead industry profits in that year9 in other words the increases of 2005 were above and beyond the gains made in 2004 hurricanes katrina and rita also affect ed downstream profitability while the effects of the hurricanes served to rais refining margins and product prices they accomplished that by closing substantial fraction of the area capacity refinery utilization rates dropped to 75 at the beginning of october 2005 from 97 at the end of august 2005 many of the ma jor refiners including exxonmobil conocophillips chevron shell bp and valero all had re fineries that were forced to close as result of damage to the fac ility or to support infrastructure the result was that many companies were not able to take advantage of the high margins and profits because their facilitie s were nonoperational the high returns to operating refineries did provide an incentive to companies with damaged facilities to get them back on line as quickly as possible independent oil and gas producers table 4 presents financial results for 2005 for the independent oil and gas producers their revenues were only about 4 of that of the integrated oil companies but their net incomes were over 14 of that of the integrated oil companies with the exception of von and andarko whic h lost 134 and 139 of their oil production respectively as we ll as 74 and 231 of their natural gas production all the companies in this group were able to expand output however the declines posted by von and anda rko led the group as whole to show decline

profile supplement vol 56 46 march 9 2006 p 11 note percent change values reflect changes from 2004 independent refiners and marketers benefitted from the same set of market conditions that affected the integrated oil companies these factors include refinery outages as result of hurricanes katrina nd rita wide price spread between high quality light sweet crude and lower quality heavy sour crude high product prices and high throughput at their operable refineri it was reported that refiner margins exceeded 30 per barrel in september 2005 as result of hurricane katrina gasoline prices on the new york mercantile exchange reached peak equivalency of 122 per barrel while crude oil also high priced was just above 70 per barrel this 52 spread between crude oil and petr oleum products was key factor in the profitability of the entire refining i ndustry in the fourth quarter of 200511 t h independent refiners and mark eters earned one third of th eir 2005 profits in the fourth quarter of 2005 2006 profit outlook crude oil prices finished the firs t quarter of 2006 above 65 per barrel residual effects from the hurricanes still i nhibit domestic production of crude oil and natural gas and although it is likely that hi gh prices have slowed the pace of demand growth to some extent oil market conditions remain tight these factors suggest that profit levels are likely to re main high in the oil and natural gas industry at least through the first quarter of 2006 and possi bly throughout the year unless the world price of oil unexpectedly declines httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33373crs8 unless there is sharp worsening of market conditions profit growth rates although not necessarily prof its themselves are on track to decline markedly in 2006 given the high profit growth rates atta ined in 2005 these rates are likely to be sustained only by rapidly rising prices in the oil and petroleum product markets even though profits may remain at histori cally high levels this outcome might be interpreted as disappointing by the financ ial community affecting the ability of the oil companies to attract capital for risky projects through the financial markets the positive net income performance of th oil industry developed so quickly and the magnitudes were so large in 2005 th at they seemed to perhaps overcome plans to use the money as result the major firms in the industry built up their cash reserves with exxonmobil chevron nd conocophillips the three largest integrated us oil companies together holding over 40 billion in addition special dividends were paid to shar eholders and stock repurchas plans were common in the industry this year may see the beginning of ne w investments in the industry resulting from the earnings of 2005 time lags be tween earnings and increased investment activity are not uncommon in the oil industry because many of the companies in the industry have global perspective inves tment may or may not take place in the united states in addition the balance betw een refining investment and exploration and production will also likely reflect the pr ofit expectations of the industry even if investment takes place outside the unite d states it will still contribute to world capacity in world market that is linked and interdependent increased oil production and refining capacity anywhere in the world can benefit the us market in terms of potential supply availa bility and relative price stability conclusion while the oil industry recorded high profits in 2004 they increased to record levels in 2005 combination of factors from political unrest to the effect of large hurricanes tightened the oil and petroleu m products markets driving up prices but not resulting in widespread shortages for consumers the industry approaches 2006 with fi nancial position that could result in expanded investment and capac ity either in the united states andor worldwide expanded capacity is likely to reduce the near term ability of the industry to maintain the profit levels of 2006 but may be necessary in the longer term
