enforce international antid oping activities for non professional sports one of wadas first achie vements was to devel op an international framework for harmonizing antidoping pol icies rules and regulations among international amateur sport organizations and public authorities called the world anti doping code the code as nong overnmental foundation however wada cannot legally bind governments to its policies including the code in 2003 191 c ountries including the united states signed the copenhagen declaration on antidoping in sport6 the copenhagen declaration is political statement of intent to identify the code as the foundation in the world wide fight against doping in sport ensure that national anti doping policies conform with the code and acknowledge the role of

professional sport associations and institutions us policy the administration states that ratifi cation of this treaty is priority11 on february 6 2008 the president transmitted the treaty to the

need for ratification stating that it would solid ify our nations place as leader in the worldwide effort to rid athletics of cheating through chemistry13 many including members of congress argue that interna tional commitments to antidoping can help set positive example for lite and aspiring athletes and help discourage their use of performanceenhancing substances14 major impetus for us action on ratifying this treaty stems from concern that lack of ratification would result in ban from hosting and participating in some international competitions including future olympic games the ioc requires that governments become party to the interna tional convention against doping in sport by january 1 2009 and failure to do so would result in those countries being barred from participation in future

convention against doping in sport does not apply to us professional sports so athletes of us professional teams however may already follow the code whose guidelines the convention embraces when they participat in international tournaments under the jurisdiction of organizations that already imp lement the code this has already been the case for example when national basketball association or national hockey league players participate in the olympic games or world championships article 20 of the convention however requires that states parties encourage professional sports associations and institutions to develop antidoping principles consistent with the code effectiveness of antidoping tests many observers argue that the value of international antidoping efforts including the international convention against doping in sport are limited by lack of effective antidoping tests that can positively identify prohibited substances historically the search for better methods to detect doping substances has lagged behind the discovery and use of ne w undetectable substances22 for example though the use of anabolic st eroids was already reportedly widespread by the early 1970s reliable test method for detecting them was not found until 1974 and they were only added to the iocs list of prohibited substances in 197623 more recently antidoping efforts suffered setb acks

possibility of gene doping whereby genetic therapies may be used to enhance athletic performance24 athletes rights protection the international convention against doping in sport requires states parties to adhere to the principles of the code some observers however question whether the code suffi ciently protects athletes who may be accidentally implicated in doping violation25 these critics argue that the code imposes excessively stringent punishments including potentially careerending suspensions that offer little distinction between intentional doping and the detection of trace levels of prohibited substances originating from the c onsumption of contamin ated or mislabeled nutritional supplements26 some of these concerns may be addressed in revised version of the code which will go into effect january 1 2009 further some question the legitimacy of wada as an authority in international anti doping policy accusing wada of not being sufficiently transparent in its decision making and resistant to outside scrutiny27 some critics have also questioned wada procedures for handling drug testing samples and avoiding c ontamination as well as for dealin g with false positives and other potential testing mistakes cost of enforcing an tidoping regulations the international convention against doping in sport commits states parties to funding wada and domestic anti doping tests although ratification of the convention does not impose new costs upon the us government it would commit the united st ates to continuing such funding in the future some critics argue that the cost of antidoping activities especially legal costs of adjudicating doping cases outweighs the bene fits of deterring the use of performance enhancing substances in sport28 usadas legal expenses for example represented more than 15 18 million of its total expe nses in 2006 already in 2008 usada has sought more than 1 million in external fi nancial support from wada for its legal case against us cyclist
