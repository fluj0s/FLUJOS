case also affirms the courts abiding interest in the allocation of state and federal au thority over envir onmental matters statutory background this is tale of two statutes the firs t is the federal power act 1920 enactment since amended that establishe s broad federal role in th development and licensing of hydropower3 the act requires fercissued li cense for the construction operation and maintenance of hydropower dams located in any navigable water of the united states4 importantly here the act mandates that ferc include variety of environmental considerations in its licensing process fercs charge to balance the nations energy needs with environmental considerations is subject to major constraint our second statute the cwa5 under the cwa ferc may not license an activity involving discharge into waters of the united states unless the applicant first obtains certification or waiver from the state in which the discharge originates6 such certification require d by cwa section 401 and known as 401 certification must among other thin gs assure the federal agency that the proposed project will not cause violati ons of state water quality standards7 t h conditions and terms in the st ates certification designed to assure such compliance with such standards are to be incorporated as conditions in the fercissued license8 plainly 401 certification is powerful means by whic h states can affect the characteristics of ferclicensed projects and since ferc license s may be issued for up to 50 years the importance to the states of having input at the licensing stage is hardly surprising however the application of the 401 certifi cation requirement rns as mentioned on whether the proposed project will cause discharge into federal jurisdictional waters and therein lies the issue in sd warren co do the companys hydropower dams which impound water pass it through turbines and reintroduce it to the same waterway downstream of the dam bring bout discharge within the meaning of section 401 facts and state supr eme court decision the sd warren co owns five hydropower dams on the presumpscot river in maine which generate electricity for the companys paper mill each dam is

about equal to inflow in seeking renewal of its ferc licenses for the dams sd warren filed applications for state water quality certification with the maine board of environmental protection dep and in 2003 the dep appr oved certificati on subject to conditions sd warren then challenged the 401 certifi cation requirement in state trial court arguing that its dams did not produce the requisite discharge under the cwa the trial court disagreed and the state supreme court affirmed the reintroduction of the water downstream of the dams is indeed discharge the state high court held and thus 401 certification applied the cwa does not define the term discharge it reasoned but merely says that whe n used without qualification it includes discharge of pollutant and di scharge of pollutants9 these latter phrases however are defined to mean any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source and b any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than vessel or other floating craft10 based on this definition the court found that an addition is key feature of any covered discharge sd warrens dams resulted in such an addition because when removed from nature to pass through the dams the water loses its status as waters of the united states thus when redeposited into the natura l course of the river there occurs an addition to the waters of the united states nor said the state supreme court can the cwas explanation of discharge be limited to discharge of pollutants since the provision uses only the word includes suggesting that the listed addition of any pollutants examples do not exhaust the universe of covered discharges us supreme court decision the supreme court unanimous ly affirmed the maine supreme court the water released from hydropower dam it held cons titutes discharge within the meaning of cwa section 401 thus ferc licensing of ch dams is subject under that section to state conditions regarding water quality the courts rationale was different from the maine high courts however not depending on the existence of an addition to the navigable waters as prerequisite for discharge the court found that lacking statutory definition discharge had to be interpreted in its everyday dictionary sense as flowing or issuing out this is the sense of the word it found that it had assign ed to the term in previous water cases including its one previous case involving cwa section 401 all of sd warrens arguments that dis charge as used in section 401 should be read more narrowly were rejected most broadly the court noted that the cwa is not concerned only with the addition of pollutants but more broadly with any adverse alteration in water quality such adverse alterations it said are risk inherent in limiting river flow and releasing water through turbines in particular dams can causehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22429crs4 changes in the circulation of river leading to less dissolved oxygen and other chemical modifications changes in river like thes the court found fall within states legitimate legislative bus iness it is the very reason the court concluded that congress provided the states in section 401 w ith power to enforce state law policy implications the sd warren co case tested the legal question of what is discharge for the purposes of section 401 this seemingly narrow question has br oad policy implications for the ability of states to control the water quality impacts of federally licensed or permitted facilitie s particularly but not solely w ith respect to hydropower projects at the heart of the cwa is the concept of shared administration of water pollution control programs between the federal government and states congress established two different and complementary pathways to acco mplish the ambitious objectives of the law 1 federally promulgated t echnologybased effluent re duction limitations administered through national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits authorized by cwa section 402 which are aimed at discha rges of pollutants and 2 state water quality standards to regulate water pollution more generally water quality standards consist of criteria narrative or numeric that limit ambient concentrations of specific pollutants and designated benefi cial uses such as recreation or water supply states are to protect existing and beneficial uses of water by enforcing their water quality standards under section 401 states must certify that federally licensed activity complies with the applicable provisions of the cwa regarding effluent limitations water quality standards standards of performance toxic po llutant standards or any other appropriate requirement of state law it provides stat with two distinct powers one the power indirectly to deny federal pe rmits or licenses by withholding certification i f state denies certification the federal agency may not issu the license or permit and two the power to impose conditions upon federal permits by placing limitations on certification generally section 401 certifica tion has been applied to hydropower projects seeking license from ferc and for dredgeandfill activities in wetlands and other waters that require permits from the army corps of engineers under section 404 of the cwa and sections 9 and 10 of the rivers and harbors act it also is applied to permit requirements for industrial and municipal point source di schargers under section 402 of the cwa the npdes permit requirement in addition it has the potential to be applied to other activities that could affect water quality point that has increasingly become an issue in recent years some states have come to view section 401 as an important tool in their overall programs to protect the physical and biological in addition to the chemical integrity of their waters so have begun using section 401 to address wide range of impacts to the quality of their waters including impacts to aquatic habitat such as wetlands where issues of nonchemical impacts arise in the 32 states that do not have independent wetlands regulatory programs the water quality certification process may be the only way in which state can exert any direct control over projects in or affecting wetlands that must obtain section 404 per mit through section 401 some states have addressed such impacts of project as inad equate river flow i nundation of habitat dissolved oxygen levels and imp acts on fish and other wildlifehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22429crs5 11 the

procedures hearing 105th congress 1st session oct 30 1997 shrg 105381 pp8081the sd warren co case highlighted these issues with respect to hydropower facilities the federal power act preempts states from independently regulating hydropower thus making 401 cer tification critical to protec ting water quality standards states say hydropower projects contribute to water pollution as that term is broadly defined in the cwa11 in number of ways thus causi ng rivers to fail to meet water quality standards hydropower da ms can harm the physical integrity of rivers by creating lakes flooding upstream areas and limiting downs tream flow they can harm biological integrity by changing conditions upstream and downstream such as barring passage of fish to spawning areas they can harm chemical integrity by resulting in discharge of water that is too warm or too cold for affected fish species more or less turbid or containing greater or lesser amounts of dissolved oxygen the expanded use of section 401is acknowle dged and criticized by groups such as hydropower interests electric u tilities and others according to their view in many states the 401 process has evolved from focused re view of compliance with state water quality standards to much more expansive parallel state licensing or permitting scheme often requiring attention to factors such as aesthetic flows instream levels fish passage and recreational access some state agencies also assert authority to impose broad range of procedural and substantive requi rements under other state law in the united states there are more than 1600 hydroelectric projects at over 2000 dams across the nation that are regulated by ferc under the fe deral power act the cour ts ruling is believed to be especially significant for california oregon washington and idaho in the west michigan and wisconsin in the great lake s region connecticut new hampshire new york maine and vermont in new england and alabama and parts of north and south carolina in the east about twothirds of th dams are due to be relicensed over the next 12 to 15 years the renewal process whic h can take four or more years to complete involves reevaluation of hydropower project s impact on local water resources and fish and wildlife species 2001 ferc staff report found that timely issuance of 401 certification is significant factor in most delayed licensing proceedings adding costs and uncertain environmental or other public benefits12 because new licenses typically authorize operations for 30 to 50 years original licenses were for terms up to 50 years and generally were issued prior to enactment of the cwa and other current federal environmental laws states have keen interest in ensuring that their water quality concerns are addressed during the relicensing process the full extent of this interest was ex pressed in congressi onal testimony in 199713httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22429crs6 14 see eg alaska dept of environmental

insecticide fungicide and rodenticide actrestricting the ability of states to ensure that federally licensed uses of state waters do not violate state water policies threatens what is widely and rightly perceived as core prerogative and obligati on of state government states use section 401 to make sure that their citizens can swim fish boat on drink and otherwise enjoy their waters as they wishif there ever was st ates rights issue this is it states are committed to controlling water uses and quality within their borders under both state law and the cwa section 401 conditioning is an important tool it should not be weakened in the view of varied stakeholders includi ng the industry states and environmental organizations the courts unanimous decision will not change the way federally licensed hydropower dams operate because it pr eserves states opportunities to require certification that water protection laws will not be violated by the activity of such dams how the decision might be extended beyond hy dropower dams to pply to any federally licensed or permitted activity involving the clean water ac t is an open question since the ruling could be applied to projects i nvolving irrigation and water supply systems where questions of water quality standards also may arise legal comments interestingly the us supreme court agreed to resolve the sd warren co case in the face of decadesold acceptance of the role of state water quality certification in federal hydropower licensing and an absence of any split in the circuits on this point as we speculated earlier the courts interest in the case might have been provoked by the important question of federalstate power allocation it raises buttressing this possibility is the fact that in recent years the court has accepted host of cases posing issues of environmental federalism spite in some cases the seeming mundaneness of the statutory construction issues i nvolved andor the lack of ci rcuit split examples include decisions under several federa l environmental statutes14 in the us supreme court sd warren co prompted the usual prodigious outpouring of amicus briefs one sees in important federalis m cases particularly notable were the brief filed by 34 states and that filed by the united states each taking the side of maine indeed the united states was granted divided argume nt time in support of maine parenthetically the case was argued on february 21 2006 the first day of hearing oral arguments for newly appoi nted justice samuel alito the clearcut nature of the sd warren opinion and its unanimity suggest that the existence of state certification prere quisite in connection with ferc hydropower licensing is unlikely to see furthe r litigation however whether the scope of that certification authority will see further action in the courts remains to be seen
