background in the spring of 1998 the vencor corporation began the process of withdrawing its nursing facilities from participation in the medicaid program at the same time vencor began discharging medicaid patients from certain nursing homes in one case fiftyfour medicaid residents in its rehabilitation and healthcare center of tampa florida wer given discharge notice on march 30 1998 the resid ents were not told that vencor was withdrawing from medicaid but rather that the discharges were necessitated by facility renovations adverse publicity and action by the florida agency for health car administration caused vencor to reverse its policy regar ding medicaid residents in florida and in other states however the incident highlighted an issue which has prompte d congressional attention ie whether medicaid residents should have the right to remainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20118crs2 the medicaid patients protections apply to all residents of participating facility facility1 must establish and maintain identical policies and practices regarding transfer discharge an d covered servicesregardless of source of payment 42 usc 1396rc4 42 cfr 48312a2v states that f or resident who becomes eligible for medicaid after2 admission to facility the facility may charge resident only allowable charges under medicaid see 42 cfr 483123 see sections 1919h of the social security act 42 usc 1396rh and implementin g4 regulations at 42 cfr 488400 et seq 42 cfr 4884385in nursing home once the facility voluntaril ceases to participate in the federal program transfer and discharge provisions under the medicaid statute under current law nursing facilities that choose to participate in the medicai d program must comply with specific r equirements relating to patients rights as set forth in section 1919 of the social security act 42 usc 1396rc2 generally nursing facility may not transfer or discharge any resident of participating facility unless th e1 transfer or discharge is necessary for the residents welfare or because the resident s health has improved enough to leave the facility or unless the safety or health of others in the facility is endangered or for nonpayment for services or if the facility ceases t operate resident may not b discharged for nonpayment for services on the basis that the medicaid payment rate is less than the private pay rate when patient converts from private pay status to medicaid resident various documentation and notic e2 requiremen ts apply to transfers or discharges that are permitted under the medicai d statute civil remedies are p rovided under the medicaid statute for use by the secretary3 of the department of health and human services hhs and the states when nursin g facility violate s the transfer and discharge requirements these remedies include federal4 civil monetary penalties of up to 10000 per day under certain circumstances5 since medicaid nursing home participation i s voluntary in most cases nursing homes may choose to end their participation in the progra m once facility has left the program the transfer and discharge protections of the medicaid statute longer apply to th facility thus hhs has authority to prevent evictions of medicaid residents or other residents after facility has left the program hr 540s 494 and congressional action hr 540 the nursing home resident protection amendments of 1999 wa s introduced by rep resentative jim davis of florida on february 3 1999 companion bill s 494 was introduced by senator bob graham in the senate on march 2 1999 these bills would prohibit transfers or discharges of residents of nursing facilities as result of voluntary withdrawal from participation i n the medicaid program if the nursing facility continues to provide nursing care services specifically facility would b prohibited from transferring or discharging any residents of the facility whether or t medicaid recipients solely because of its withdrawal from medicaid participation this means that medicaid residents would be allowed to continue to stay in the facility and thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20118crs3 the provisions of these bills would not affect current regulations allowing nursing facility to6 operate distinct parts of their facilities as medicaremedicaid or medicaid certified beds 4 2 cfr 4835 thus it is possible that private pay resident who converts to medicaid payment status may not be able to remain in the facility if medicaidcertified bed is not available the nursing home even though i t has withdrawn from the medicaid program would have to continue to accept the states medicaid payment rate as payment in full for suc h residents with respect to private pay residents in the facility at the time of withdrawal from the medicaid program the facility would be required to permit such private pa residents to convert to medicaid and continue to reside in the facility for as long as it is appropriate for them to do so in addition all medicaid participation agreemen t6 requirements would co ntinue to apply to all individuals who were residents of the facility on the day before the day the facility withdrew from the medicaid program until suc h individuals longer need care under hr 540 and s 494 nursing f acility would be required to advise individuals who enter the facility after the facility has voluntarily withdrawn from the medicai d program that the facility is not participating in medicaid and that the facility ma discharge the resident from the fac ility if the resident becomes eligible for medicaid this notice must be given to new resident orally and in writing and the facility must obtain from the individual written acknowledgment of the receipt of such information at th time he or she becomes resident hr 540 was the subject of hearing on february 11 1999 before the health and environment subcommittee of the house commerce commit tee support for the bill was expressed by the health care financing administration of hhs and various senior citizen organization s such as the american association of retired persons the national senior citizens law center and the american health care associat ion these groups argue that the additional transfer and discharge protections of hr 540s 494 are necessary t prevent the eviction of residents from facilities that in essence have become their homes furthermore many people who initially com to nursing home as private pay patients do so with the expectation that they will be able to remain in the facility once they have depleted their assets and become eligible for medicaid payments on the other hand others have expressed concerns about the potential financial burden that facility might incur if it has to ca rry residents at the medicaid payment rate indefinitely after the facility has chosen to withdraw from the medicaid program hr 540 was reported ut of the health and environment subcommittee on march 2 and on march 4 the bill was reported out of t he house committee on commerce onth march 10 the house passed hr 540 s 494 was reported favorably by the senat eth finance committee on march 4 on march 15 the senate voted
