economics government and finance division fannie maes and freddie macs financial problems summary the decision to place fannie mae and freddie mac in conservatorship raises questions about their impact on the housing and finance markets to certain extent the housing mortgage and even general financial markets are in an unprecedented situation this action by their new regulator the federal housing finance agency fhfa came after turmoil in the housing mortgage and financial markets has raised doubts about the future of fannie mae and freddie mac which are chartered by congress as governmentsponsored enterprises gses and were widely believed to have an implicit guarantee from the federal government the treasury will buy mortgagebacked securities from the gses and raise funds for them each gse gave treasury 1 billion in senior preferred stock and warrants to acquire at nominal cost 80 of each gse treasury pledged to invest up to 100 billion in each gse and committed to invest more if necessary now the formerly implicit guarantee is nearly explicit the federal reserve earlier took actions to allow fannie and freddie to borrow directly from the discount window privilege normally available only to primary securities dealers and banks that are member of the federal reserve system the securities and exchange commission has issued an emergency order restricting short selling of fannie and freddies stock the fhfa replaced the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo as the gses safety and soundness regulator ofheo repeatedly assured investors that fannie and freddie have adequate capital but as highly leveraged financial intermediaries fannie mae and freddie mac had limited capital to cushion them against losses this report will be updated as

federal housing finance regulatory reform act of 2008 11 list of tables table 1 gse profitability since 2006 9 fannie maes and freddie macs financial problems this report presents in question and answer form the issues surrounding the financial conditions of fannie mae and freddie mac questions about conservatorship what is conservatorship conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac which are governmentsponsored enterprises or gses involves the federal housing finance agency fhfa taking control of the gses as conservator the powers of the board of directors officers and shareholders are transferred to fhfa conservator can also cancel certain contracts this is authorized by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 the goal of conservatorship is to preserve the gses assets and to return it to sound financial condition that will allow the conservatorship to be ended why did the fhfa place fannie mae and freddie mac under conservatorship as regulator of fannie mae and freddie mac fhfa announced that it had placed fannie mae and freddie mac under conservatorship because of their deteriorating financial position and the critical importance that each company has to the continued functioning of the residential financial markets1 fhfa has said that continuing audits of the gses determined that their financial positions were weaker than previously thought and that the gses were unlikely to survive without conservatorship fhfa cited previous public statements that the gses needed to increase their capital and needed to strengthen management controls over operations why did fhfa act on september 7 2008 instead of earlier or later fhfa in general followed the same approach that the federal deposit insurance corporation uses when it places bank in conservatorship series of requests for changes to the corporation and increased capital followed by the sudden takeover providing deadline could provide the regulated entity with an incentive to take risky gambles in last attempt to avoid being seized by the government the fdic usually seizes bank by suddenly showing up on friday afternoon closing the bank and locking the doors this gives it time to make necessary changes over the weekend and resume business operations on the next business day 1 federal housing finance agency statement of fhfa director james b lockhart september 9 2008 available at httpwwwofheogovnewsroomaspxid456q1 1q2none crs2 according to media reports some large foreign investors had been reducing their holdings of gse debt mortgagebacked securities mbs and stock2 this would have made it more difficult for the gses to borrow money to finance their portfolios going forward for example bank of china ltd is reported to have sold or not replaced maturing 46 billion of gse debt which reduced its gse debt holdings to 173 billion as of june 30 2008 these same media reported that treasury officials contacted foreign central banks and others to reassure them of the creditworthiness of gse debt fhfa worked with treasury the fed and the gses over the weekend of september 6 and 7 2008 ofheo and fhfa continue to take administrative actions to transfer authority and resources to fhfa for example on september 4 2008 fhfa announced that it was publishing legal notice of its existence in the federal register3 what will treasury contribute fannie mae and freddie mac have signed contracts to issue new senior preferred stock to the treasury which has agreed to purchase up to 100 billion of this stock from each of the gses4 if necessary the treasury has agreed to contribute cash in the amount equal to the difference between each gses liabilities and assets effective immediately september 7 2008 each gse issued treasury 1 billion of senior preferred stock and warrants options to purchase common stock if the warrants are exercised treasury would own 799 of each company as part of the contracts each gse has agreed to restrictions on paying dividends issuing new stock and disposing of assets the gses can increase their respective retained portfolio of mortgages and mbs to 850 billion as of december 31 2009 but have to reduce their respective portfolios by at least 10 annually until each reaches 250 billion5 if gse were to reduce an 850 billion portfolio by 10 annually it would take more than 10 years to reduce it to 250 billion

according to freddie macs quarterly report for the quarter ending june 30 2008 its mortgage portfolio was worth 792 billion available at httpwwwfanniemaecomirearningsindexj html and httpir10kwizardcomfilesphpsource1372welc_next1xcomp0fg23 respectively crs3 treasury agreed to make open market purchases of gse mbs6 there are specific limits to these purchases but they are subject to the statutory limit on the federal governments debt treasury has said that it expects to profit from the spread between the interest rate that it pays to borrow money through bonds and the mortgage payments on the mbs the gses will guarantee payment of the mbs this program expires december 31 2009 treasury agreed that if the gses have difficulty borrowing money treasury will create government sponsored enterprise credit facility gsecf to provide liquidity to the gses secured by mbs pledged as collateral7 this facility will terminate december 31 2009 future what are congress options for restructuring the gses going forward congress has many options for reorganizing fannie mae and freddie mac including but not limited to the following it could decide not to change their structure however since the treasury has pledged financial support to the gses the claim that the federal government does not support fannie mae and freddie mac might not be believed in this case some might argue that it is inappropriate to provide financial support of two mortgage companies but not to others it should be noted that treasury has not announced direct guarantee of outstanding gse debt treasury has said that it will lend to the gses whatever funds are necessary so that the gses can pay their debt this arguably allows the statement that the federal government does not guarantee gse debt to remain technically accurate congress could make fannie mae and freddie mac part of the government both gses were originally government corporations and this would be return to that environment fannie mae and freddie mac could become federal home loan banks the 12 regional banks are collective gse that is owned by their member institutions and their stock is not publicly traded fannie mae and freddie mac could be split up into large number of gses instead of two gses that are too big to fail there would be ten or some other number of smaller gses that would each be small enough to fail congress might wish to explicitly state what the risks to stockholders bondholders and business partners would be 6 us treasury fact sheet gse mortgage backed securities purchase program september 9

wwwtreasgov p r s s r l s s r p r t s gsecf_factsheet_090708pdf crs4 fannie mae and freddie mac and possibly additional new gses could be converted into utilities each could issue mbs possibly guaranteed by the federal government which would charge fee for the guarantee there are number of options for how the fees could be set the government could establish standard fee or it could auction off the right to issue specific amount of mbs the government could sell new gse charters to the highest bidders treasury secretary henry m paulson jr has proposed using bonds backed not only by the issuing corporations legal obligation of repayment but also by the pledge of specific collateral as way to allow banks to supplement or even replace the gses role in mortgage markets8 what will happen to fannie maes and freddie macs affordable housing initiatives there have been official announcements concerning the gses affordable housing initiatives both the housing mortgage goals set previously set by the department of housing and urban development and the new national housing trust contained in the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 can be suspended if gse requests this and presents sufficient justification section 1128 of the act allows fhfa to revise the housing goals and section 1131 of the act allows fhfa to suspend contributions what will happen to stockholders and other stakeholders the powers of common stockholders who formerly elected the boards of directors and approved certain enterprise actions are suspended the conservator has assumed all of their authority previously the common stockholders owned 100 of the gses as result of the warrants issued to the treasury they could own only 20 of the enterprises in the long run 20 of healthy enterprise could be more than 100 of gses whose liabilities exceed their assets in the short run the price of the gses common stock has declined but if the gses recover stockholders be better off compared to their situation at the time that conservatorship was undertaken to the extent that current and former employees have invested in common stock in the short run they are likely to see decline in the value of their financial assets the long run outcome is not clear both gses had employee stock and option plans the gses agreements with treasury prohibits issuing new stock consequently those programs cannot continue until the gses emerge from conservatorship gse employees except for the chief executive officer ceo of each enterprise are being urged by fhfa to continue working as before the ceos are replaced but have agreed to assist in the transition employees may decide to look for other employment but the decision is theirs 8 henry m paulson jr secretary of the treasury remarks by secretary henry m paulson jr on recommendations from the presidents working group on financial markets press release march 13 2008 available at httpwwwustreasgovpress releaseshp872htm crs5 while the conservator is authorized by federal law to cancel certain contracts fhfa has said that current contracts continue in force who invests in the gses there is little information available about who holds gse stock bonds and mbs the fed reports statistics for combined ownership of government agency and gse debt and gse mbs at the end of 2007 nonunited states investors held 1479 trillion of 7397 trillion other large investors were us commercial banks 929 billion life insurance companies 388 billion state and local government retirement funds 317 billion mutual funds 566 billion assetbacked securities issuers 378 billion and the gses themselves 710 billion more recent reports from the gses show more than 40 of certain debt issues being held by foreign central banks what will happen to executive compensation the housing and economic recovery act strengthened fhfas regulation over executive compensation and golden parachutes the senior preferred stock agreement signed by each gse with fhfa requires the gses to get approval for new compensation agreements with executives after accounting irregularities were uncovered in 2003 and 2004 ofheo sued fannie maes and freddie macs previous ceos franklin d raines and leland c brendsel respectively to recover part of their compensation in both cases out of court settlements were reached which included the payment of fines and donations to charities when will conservatorship end the conservatorship will end when fhfa determines that fannie mae and freddie mac have adequate capital and have improved their controls and risk management sufficiently the housing and economic recovery act charges fhfa with developing new capital standards for the gses to replace those established in the federal housing enterprises financial safety and soundness act of 1992 pl 102550 while it is reasonable to expect that conservatorship will end either with the gses recovery or with their being placed in receivership and liquidated there is nothing mandating this outcome context why did fannie maes and freddie macs stock prices decline over the last year changes in the perception of the risks that fannie mae and freddie mac face in terms of future profitability and even continued financial viability has reduced the price that investors are willing to pay for share of the enterprises there was also concern that intervention by the federal government would reduce the value of the common stock between the end of 2007 and august 1 2008 fannies stock lost 72 of its value while freddies fell by 77 as part of the treasurys financial aid package of september 7 2008 the gses agreed to issue warrants to the treasury worth 799 of their outstanding stock if treasury were to exercise the warrants current stockholders would own 20 of each enterprise this is one explanation why the gses stock prices declined further since september 7 2008 crs6 fannie mae and freddie mac are gses whose charters limit them to buying single family and multifamily home mortgages originated by others this lack of diversification makes them more exposed to housing and mortgage market problems than other financial institutions such as commercial banks that have other lines of business the gses have special relationship with the federal government sometimes called an implicit guarantee that has allowed them to borrow at interest rates only slightly above those paid by the federal government the two gses were very highly leveraged versions of banks they borrow money to lend and they maximize profits by keeping their capital reserves close to the minimum permitted by their regulators like banks the gses are required by law and by their regulators to maintain certain ratio between their loans and reserves to protect against loan losses key component of reserves is shareholders equity or the current value of the shareholders investments however unlike banks the gses can only purchase home mortgages that others have made has anything like placing fannie mae and freddie mac under conservatorship ever happened before this is the first time that gse has been placed under conservatorship it appears to also be the first time that the federal government has made continuing commitment to company other than government companies on more general level the federal government has intervened in the past to assist many companies9 what has congress done previously to improve the financial condition of the gses congress has previously acted to assist gses that were in financial difficulty when fannie mae was losing significant amounts of money in 1982 congress passed the miscellaneous revenue act of 1982 that provided some tax benefits for fannie mae10 the farm credit system another gse was aided with the agricultural credit act of 1987 which authorized the issuance of 4 billion in bonds to support system members11 section 1117 of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hr 3221 pl 110289 authorizes the treasury to purchase any amount of gse securities debt or equity if necessary to provide stability to financial markets prevent disruptions in the availability of mortgage credit or protect the taxpayer this means that if either of the two gses becomes unable to raise funds in private markets the federal government could simply purchase the debt securities that the firms were unable to sell elsewhere or recapitalize either firm by purchasing stock possibly becoming the majority shareholder this authority expires on december 31 2009 this action sent signal to the markets that the treasury was prepared to intervene rather than let either gse fail if this had been enough to maintain 9 crs report rl34423 government interventions in financial markets economic and historic analysis of subprime mortgage options by n eric weiss discusses some of these actions 10 pl 97362 96 stat 1726 et seq 11 pl 100233 101 stat 1568 et seq crs7 confidence and to persuade investors to continue to purchase gse debt treasury purchases would have been necessary what are other actions the federal government has taken to address the financial condition of the gses under existing law including the housing and economics reform act treasury the federal reserve and fhfa currently have the power to take certain actions even prior to the act the gses charters authorized the secretary of the treasury to lend each gse 225 billion but this is more symbolic amount than total solution on the basis of fannie maes issuance of 1588 trillion in short term debt in 2007 the 225 billion would have lasted less than 125 hours on the basis of the 5986 billion of short term debt that freddie mac issued in 2007 the 225 billion would have lasted just under 33 hours12 on july 13 2008 the federal reserve board of governors granted the new york fed the authority to lend directly to the gses13 section 1118 of pl 110289 requires the new gse regulator to consult with the fed to ensure financial market stability in addition to the feds general authority to be lender of last resort the gses charters give the gses special relationship to the nations central bank14 the federal reserve can use the gses bonds purchased on the secondary market for open market operations15 this could indirectly help the gses by adding to the demand for their debt and increasing its liquidity on july 15 2008 the securities and exchange commission sec issued an emergency order restricting short selling in the stock of 19 financial institutions including fannie and freddie16 the sec acted to prevent the possibility that false rumors could drive share prices down and cause the market to lose confidence thereby cutting off the firms access to credit markets as happened to bear stearns in march 2008 the order restricting short sales of fannie mae and freddie mac stock was renewed on july 29 2008 and expired on august 12 2008 at 1159 pm what was fannie maes and freddie macs financial position in placing the gses under conservatorship their

ofheo which was fannie maes and freddie macs safety and soundness regulator before july 30 2008 repeatedly said that the gses had adequate capital18 in other words according to ofheo the gses had sufficient funds to survive their current financial difficulties this statement was difficult to verify independently details of the gses portfolios and guarantees contain confidential proprietary information in broad terms the gses purchased slightly more than 169 billion of private label subprime mbs in 2006 and 2007 they purchased slightly less than 58 billion of alta mbs in the same time period out of combined total mortgage purchases of 1677 trillion19 at the end of 2007 the subprime and alta mbs represented 135 of the gses total assets prior to 2007 the gses had not reported combined loss for full year since 198220 table 1 summarizes the losses and profits that fannie mae and freddie mac have made since 2006 they started 2006 earning quarterly profits but in the third quarter july august and september lost money they were profitable for the entire year of 2006 and in each quarter of 2007 until the third quarter they have not had profitable quarter since for the entire year of 2007 the two gses reported combined losses of slightly less than 52 billion to make certain that the gses have adequate funds to cover potential losses fhfa like all financial regulators imposes capital requirements at the end of 2007 the two gses had 248 billion surplus more than the regulatory capital requirement of 584 billion they had surplus of 508 billion more than the riskbased capital requirement of 388 billion21 these amounts can be compared with the combined retained mortgages portfolios of 1434 trillion and the 3501 trillion in mbs that the gses guaranteed for total of 4934 trillion22 17 fhfa statement of fhfa director james b lockhart september 9 2008 available at httpwwwofheogovnewsroomaspxid456q11q2none 18 ofheo statement of ofheo director james b

source fannie mae http wwwfanniemaeco mir and fr ed d ie mac httpwwwfreddiemaccominvestorser the regulatory capital surplus amounted to 050 of the 4934 trillion and 103 of the riskbased capital surplus if the gses were to face losses in excess of their income by these percentages they would be forced to either reduce their capital requirements by selling mortgages and mbs from their portfolios or raise new capital from investors the gses hold subprime and alta mbs that are far in excess of their surplus capital ofheo reported that the credit quality of the gses mortgage portfolios declined in 200723 risks what risks do fannie mae and freddie mac face in todays economic environment fannie mae and freddie mac purchase home mortgages they package some for sale as mbs and hold others in their investment portfolios the gses guarantee timely payment of principal and interest of the mortgages in their mbs as mortgage foreclosure rates have climbed since 2006 and as home prices have fallen the value of the mortgages and mbs that the two firms hold in their portfolio has also fallen uncertainty about the duration and severity of the housing slump means that markets cannot now gauge the riskiness of 23 ofheo pp 2021 3334 crs10 the gses with much confidence or precision the treasurys support has reduced this risk but it is not clear if stockholders will benefit the gses finance their portfolios of longterm typically 30year mortgages with shortterm borrowing typically three months to five years this increases the gses profits because shortterm borrowing is usually less expensive than longer term loans this creates interest rate risk which is the risk that if shortterm interest rates increase profitability can be reduced or can even turn to losses to try to reduce these risks the gses use variety of financial derivatives in worst case scenario the interest rate on shortterm loans to the gses could increase enough to cause substantial losses and investors could stop entering into derivative contracts with the gses24 this would leave the gses who anticipated being able to roll over their short term debt unable to refinance treasurys financial promises of gse credit facility gsecf and to purchase mbs greatly reduces these risks what risks do fannie mae and freddie mac create for the us government there is the risk that one or both gses will be unable to repay the loan this risk that this could result in loss to the federal government is reduced by requiring collateral in the form of mbs but the value of such collateral could decline25 the initial 1 billion of preferred stock paying 10 annual dividend 100 million annually reduces the risk to treasury of loss what risks do fannie maes and freddie macs financial problems create for homeowners and those planning to become homeowners fannie maes and freddie macs financial problems create risks for homeowners who want to stay in their homes and who do not want to refinance homeowners would continue to pay their existing mortgages the same way as they do today treasurys actions of agreeing to lend money to the gses and to purchase mbs from the gses should stabilize the secondary mortgage market and provide continuing flow of funds to purchase new homes and to refinance existing mortgages in 2007 the gses financed 913 of the conforming mortgage market26 in the current financial environment if the gses were unable to buy mortgages from originators it is not clear that other investors are prepared to step into the secondary mortgage market 24 derivative is financial contract whose value is linked to another financial instrument price or variable for example two companies could trade derivative whose value was linked to the difference in the interest rates on twoyear and tenyear treasury bonds 25 the government has received stock in previous market interventions and has sometimes returned small profit see crs report rl34423 government interventions in financial markets economic and historic analysis of subprime mortgage options by n eric weiss 26 the 2008 mortgage market statistical annual volume ii bethesda md inside mortgage finance publications 2008 pp 3 9 conforming mortgage is one that is under the conforming loan limit which is as high as 729750 in high cost areas crs11 the conservator could modify credit requirements for anyone wanting to refinance take out second mortgage or get home equity line of credit presumably the conservator will balance the goal of returning the gses to their own control with the goal of encouraging homeownership the economic stimulus act of 2008 raised the loan limit for federal housing administration fha guaranteed loans in most high cost areas of the nation to the same maximum that the gses are permitted to purchase27 as result fha guaranteed loans can in theory replace most conventional loans what is the difference between the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 and the
