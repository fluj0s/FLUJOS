nations office on drugs and crime unodc and is headed by the same director who ser ves as deputy directorgeneral of unov within the division of management the gener support section is designated to provide oversight of the property management functi on and the commercial operations unit cou is responsible for the daytoday property ma nagement operations for several united nations funds and programmes in the vienna internat ional centre except for the office for outer space affairs oosa and specialized agenc ies 7 the cou is responsible for all aspects of i nventory control to include maintaining the property management database submitting financial information to the division of management unodc for inclusion in the financial s tatements and conducting physical inventory for unodc field offices oversight for property management falls under the fund budget unit 8 property is categorized as either expendabl or nonexpendable as of 31 october 2006 the total value of property in the unovunodc inventory system was 209 million 1 property with individual acquisition cost of at lea st 1500 is classified as nonexpendable and is reported in the notes to the financial state ments of the united nations for financial statement purposes the value of nonexpendable pro perty was 105 million as of 31 december 2005 in 2006 unovunodc wrote off prop erty valued at some 588000 and acquired nonexpendable property valued at 25 mil lion ii audit objectives 9 the audit objective was to determine if the re were adequate controls over property management including their proper accounting trac king monitoring and safeguarding in accordance with united nations policies and procedu res specifically the audit determined if unovunodc had adequate controls over its inventory and if those controls were functioning as intended unovunodc conducted periodic physical inventory in accordance with prescribed policies and procedures and unovunodc had adequate procedures for the writeof f sale or disposal of property as well as procedures for lost stolen or damaged items 1 this amount includes inventory of clients 2 2 iii audit scope and methodology 10 the audit consisted of preliminary audit of unovunodc property management oios auditors obtained an overview and conducted walkthrough of each aspect of property management sampled data assessed the reliability of data contained in the automated system for property management and determined if adequate controls were in place to provide reasonable assurance that assets were safeguarded oios auditors reviewed unovunodc records supporting documentation and files for ca lendar years 2005 through october 2006 as result of the preliminary audit oios did not believe it was necessary to conduct more in depth audit of unovunodc property management 11 oios auditors reviewed existing policies nd procedures reports generated from the automated property management systems for vienna nd to limited degree for the unodc field offices the auditors conducted discussions with staff from commercial operations unit the receiving department and members of the property survey board in addition the auditors reviewed other property management reports minutes of the property survey board and discussed the unovunodc insurance policy and c overage the auditors compared the unovunodc property management policies and procedu res with those established at united nations headquarters in new york the audito rs also conducted limited review of the procedures for property management at unodc fie ld activities the audit did not include an assessment of the automated system iv audit findings and recommendations overall assessment 12 overall oios found that controls over pro perty management at unovunodc were adequate and unovunodc could provide reasonable ssurance that property was safeguarded however the following areas needed im provement and are further discussed in the succeeding sections of this report square4 unovunodc needs to update the property management policy 9151t dated 1994 to reflect pertinent changes in regards to st ai20035 and property management manual although property controls are tight to ensure that properties are safeguarded and their records are pr operly maintained they do not provide enough assurance for proper accountability by responsible offices and divisions square4 unovunodc needs to conduct physical inventory in ccordance with united nations policy delegation of authority to departments and offices 13 according to stai20035 each head of partment or office shall designate property records custodian prc as the focal point the designation of prcs was also cited in the a575 board of auditors report dated 3 july 2002 at the time of our review 3 unov did not have prcs instead the responsibility for property management and inventory had been given to the commercial operations unit c ou 14 two cou staff members shared the bulk of r esponsibility for property management at unovunodc this included all aspects of property management ranging from entering new property into the automated property management database deleting property from the database conducting inventory to preparing and si gning forms for lost stolen damaged or loaned property preparing property for disposal nd entering this information into the database the cou also prepared reports for submis sion to the financial resources management service for inclusion in unovunodc bian nual financial statements as well as prepared reports for the property survey board psb and executed the recommendations of the psb 15 while the auditors found that overall prop erty management at unovunodc was adequate concentration of the controls of the prop erty management functions solely on the two cou staff did not provide for appropriate segre gation of duties or responsibilities for example if an employee borrowed equipment the prop erty staff entered the information directly into the sybase inventory control database but the employee was not required to sign or complete form requisition for furniture nd fixtures as stated in the manual if property is lost or damaged the responsible office or employee notifies the property office and the property office staff completes and signs t he form case report recommendation form not the individual responsible for the loss according to our discussions other than it personnel for technical support one else had access to the automated system property reports were not provided to offices or division ma nagement for review and employees were not required to sign or complete forms this pract ice did not allow sharing of accountability and responsibility for property management with res ponsible offices and staff and put the two employees in precarious situation 16 in case of disagreement there is suppo rting documentation to determine if procedures were followed in case of discrepancies i n the automated system in one instance an employee borrowed night vision gogglesbinocular s and two searchlights according to records the employee returned the items sometime i n may 2001 however the automated records still showed that the night vision goggles were not returned an investigation was conducted and the property staff stated that the em ployee returned the other items but not the night vision goggles the staff members stated tha t all the equipment was returned at the same time in may 2001 because of the lack of c ompleted and signed form requisition for furniture and fixtures the issue was never re solved after many months of waiting for the matter to be resolved the human resource manag ement section processed the staff members form for retirement without collecting fun ds for the lost equipment because it was never determined who was at fault if the staff d been required to complete and sign the form requisition for furniture and fixtures when borrowing and returning the equipment and then signed by the property staff it is likely that the issue could have been resolved and funds collected if the goggles were not returned 17 oios believes that unovunodc should updat the policy to reflect current procedures and put those procedures into practice particularly for the completion of forms by the responsible officedivision this will protect both the property staff and unovunodc 4 employees and will also place some of the responsi bility for property management on the divisions and offices property records custodians 18 stai20035 on for property management q uoted below requires that property records custodians prc be assigned each head of department or office shall designate property records custodian as the focal point for the facilities man agement division the property records custodian shall be responsible for keeping records of all property assigned to his or her department or area of responsibility 19 unovunodc has not instituted this practic and has not assigned prcs we believe that if unodcunov institutes this practice to some degree the assignment of prcs will ensure segregations of duties and share accountability and responsibility for property management with offices and staff recommendations head2right the director division of management should ensure unovunodc update its property management policy to reflect cu rrent policies and procedures as stated in stai20035 to include pr ovisions for the completion and signing of the appropriate property forms by staff office heads and property managers rec 01 head2right the director division of management should designa an appropriate number of property records custodians as stated in stai20035 rec 02 unovunodc accepted both recommendations and stated that they are updating their property management policy and that they are in the process of appointing additional custodians estima ted target date for implementation is may 2007 oios will record the recommendations as implemented upon receipt of copy of the updated p roperty management policy and list of the additional property custod ians physical inventory 20 unovunodc had not conducted physical in ventory in over five years instead there has been an effort to conduct it since novemb er 2004 and plan to continue it through august 2007 as offices move from one floor for as bestos removal and back inventory is conducted and records updated united nations poli cy requires that entities conduct physical inventory once every two years and prescribes the use of bar coding and scanning to facilitate physical inventory during the asbestos removal pr oject unovunodc was still conducting inventory manually in our discussions with an unovunodc official it was stated that the bar code system and scanner was tes ted but there were too many problems such as software incompatibility issues and reconci liation problems between the scanning 5 system and the automated property record system s result unovunodc discontinued the use of the bar coding and scanning to conduct p hysical inventory 21 during the exit conference the chief of ge neral support section raised concerns about the requirement to conduct 100 percent physical i nventory and in draft revision of the property management guidelines dated january 2005 proposed that physical counting of property items shall take place when received and d isposed however the draft was never finalized to some degree oios also ponders the n ecessity to conduct 100 percent physical inventory every two years and the possibility of bi annual inventory sampling ie high dollar items attractive items or 10 percent inventory wi thin certain dollar ranges etc in todays environment the type and amount of equipment has c hanged to include high tech equipment attractive items and security related items that the need to count very large number of items or low risk items may be too time consuming given resource constraints on the other hand however if the bar codes and scanner system were used to conduct physical inventory it would minimize resource demands the designated prcs would also assist with physical inventories recommendation head2right the director division of management should requir and ensure that physical inventory is conducted biannually in accor dance with stai20035 explore the use of bar coding and rec tify the past problems with the scanning equipment in order to facilitate conducting physical inventory and consider alternative approaches to nable comprehensive physical inventory such as phased inventory taking inventory sampling etc rec 03 unovunodc accepted the recommendation and stated t hat they are reviewing their inventory management policy estima ted target date for implementation is may 2007 oios will record the recommendation as implemented upon receipt of the result of the unov unodc review of their inventory management policy or an updated pol icy on physical inventory taking attachment client
