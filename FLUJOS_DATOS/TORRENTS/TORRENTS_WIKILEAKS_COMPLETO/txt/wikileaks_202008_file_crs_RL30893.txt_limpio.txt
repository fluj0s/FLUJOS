the family and medical leave act summary congress passed the family and medical leave act of 1993 fmla pl 103 3 as one means of easing the time conflicts that have developed in the past few decades as more married mothers began to work increasingly on fulltime basis outside the home while employed single parents always have felt the pressure of trying to fulfill both workplace and childrearing responsibilities this workfamily juggling act increasingly has spread to married couples with young children the aging of the population and the lengthening of life spans makes it increasingly likely that individuals also will have to grapple with the demands of their jobs and the obligations of caring for elderly relatives the family and medical leave act requires private employers with at least 50 employees on their payrolls for at least 20 workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year and public employers regardless of size to extend jobprotected unpaid leave of at least 12 weeks to employees who meet lengthofservice and hoursofwork eligibility requirements eg worked for the employer at least 12 months and for minimum of 1250 hours in the 12 months preceding the start of their fmla leave employees may elect and employers may require them to substitute accrued paid leave for fmla leave leave under the act is available to employees upon the birth of child or placement of an adopted or foster child to care for newborn newly adopted or newly placed foster child and to care for their own childs spouses or parents serious health condition employees are entitled to take leave associated with serious health condition on an intermittent basis or work reduced schedule eg fewer hours per day or days per week experience under the fmla is assessed in 2001 report which is based upon an employee and an employer survey commissioned by the us department of labor almost 62 of public and private sector employees worked at covered employers and met the acts eligibility criteria during the 18month survey period that spanned 1999 and 2000 although the share of eligible employees at covered worksites who took fmla leave increased significantly over time fmla leave takers accounted for only 19 of all employees estimates of the number of employees who took leave under the act in 19992000 ranged from 22 million to 61 million onefifth of fmla leaves were taken on an intermittent basis employees most often took fmla leave to care for their own health conditions twothirds of persons who took leave for fmlareasons received some pay employees most often said lack of funds was the cause of their not taking leave for fmla reasons almost 64 of employers rated the act as verysomewhat easy to administer in 19992000 which was greatly below the 85 recorded 5 years earlier many more employers reported in 2000 than in 1995 that the law had negative impact on individual productivity and absences the human resources professionals who responded to 2000 survey of the society for human resource management indicated that productivity loss was the most costly consequence of the fmla in addition 63 of respondents said that because of the fmla their firms had had to

fmla 16 explanation of and experience under the family and medical leave act congress passed the family and medical leave act of 1993 pl 1033 as one means of easing the time conflicts that have developed in the past few decades as more and more married mothers began to work outside the home the majority of american women have always been mothers and now majority of mothers are also employees1 while employed single parents always have felt the pressure of trying to fulfill both workplace and childrearing responsibilities the workfamily juggling act increasingly has spread to married couples with dependent children ie under age 18 both spouses have been breadwinners in the majority of these families since 19782 in 2000 for example the husband and wife were in the labor force in 67 of marriedcouple families with dependent children the share of married mothers caring for their own infants ie less than 1 year old and bringing home paychecks has grown greatly as well the labor force participation of mothers with infants was 53 and 648 of them were employed fulltime ie 35 or more hours per week more broadly 60 of all women were in the labor force 75 of all working women held fulltime jobs and 47 of all labor force participants were women because of the aging of the babyboom generation and the lengthening of life spans it also is increasingly likely that individuals will have to grapple with the competing demands of their jobs and of caring for parents or elderly relatives in the mid1990s the typical informal or family caregiver of an older friend or relative was an employed married middleaged woman who sometimes had dependent child at home3 according to one estimate about onefifth of working parents are members of the sandwich generation ie providers of both elder care and child care4 with women more likely than men to be unpaid caregivers and with mothers more likely than not to be in the labor force working women in general and working mothers in particular are widely viewed as the chief beneficiaries of the family and medical leave act fmla this report summarizes the major provisions of the fmla the regulations at 29 cfr part 825

results from the latest survey commissioned by the us department of labor dol about experience under the act an overview of the fmla and its regulations prior to passage of the fmla the provision of family and medical leavelike that of many employee benefitswas at the discretion of individual employers some employers offered their employees sick leave to care for their own illness and family leave to care for the illnesses or immediate family members while other employers did not an employees request for leavewhether paid or unpaidcould be denied and the family caregiver risked losing hisher job if absent from work further some employers had formal leave policies that were applied uniformly to their workforces while others had informal policies and the granting of leave depended on the particular circumstances the fmla described in detail below prescribes minimum level of familymedical leave benefits in those jurisdictions that have enacted their own statutes employees are entitled to the most generous benefit provided under the federal or state law5 for example in 2002 california became the first state to provide for partially paid family and medical leave in addition employers may offer or negotiate with unions for familymedical leave that is more generous than contained in pl 1033 eg covers employees who have worked for the employer less than 12 months6 by whom to whom and for what reason the act requires private employers who have had 50 or more employees on their payrolls for at least 20 workweeks in the current or preceding 5 for example several states have passed legislation that allows employees to take family leave for reasons other than those in the fmla laws in such states as california illinois massachusetts minnesota north carolina rhode island vermont and the district of columbia require employers to provide employees varying amounts of time away from work to attend some of their childrens school activities employers in utah must grant employees leave to accompany their children to court appearances and those in oregon cannot take adverse actions against employees required to attend court hearings involving their children in massachusetts employers must give employees timeoff to accompany children or elderly relatives to medical or other appointments in vermont employers must grant employees leave to go to medical appointments or to meet similar obligations us bureau of labor statistics state labor laws monthly labor review various january issues since 1994 6 according to the society for human resource managements 2003 fmla survey 57 of the human resources professionals who responded said their locations offered job protected leave beyond that required by the federal statute crs3 calendar year and who are engaged in commerce or in any industryactivity affecting commerce and public employers ie federal state and local governments7 and local education agencies8 to extend jobprotected9 unpaid leave to employees who have worked for these organizations at least 12 not necessarily consecutive months minimum of 1250 hours excluding paid or unpaid leave time in the 12 months preceding the start of their fmla leave and who work at facility where 50 or more persons are employed by the employer within 75 miles for the following reasons the birth of child of the employee and to care for the newborn child the placement with the employee of child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child10 to care for an immediate family member ie spouse child under age 18 unless incapable of selfcare due to an activitylimiting disability or parent11 with serious health condition that necessitates the employees presence or 7 in 1996 pl 1041 the congressional accountability act extended fmla coverage from staff of the house and senate to employees of other legislative branch agencies and pl 104331 extended fmla coverage to staff of the white house and to specified presidential appointees 8 the fmla contains special rules for employees of local educational agencies as defined in the elementary and secondary education act and any private elementary or secondary school 9 generally employees returning from fmla leave must be restored to their original jobs or to jobs equivalent in pay benefits and other termsconditions of employment employers do not have to reinstate employees or continue their fmla leave if the individuals would have been terminated had they been working during the leave period eg as part of mass layoff employers also may refuse to reinstate to their jobs the highest paid 10 of employees namely key employees if doing so will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to business operations employers are required to provide written notification to employees who request leave for fmlapurposes of their status as key employees and the reasons for which they are being denied job restoration in determining whether restoration of key personnel would cause substantialgrievous injury employers can consider such things as their ability to do without the individual or the expense of restoring the employee if permanent replacement had been hired during the leave period employers must give these employees reasonable period to return to work after receipt of the notification 10 fmla leave taken to care for newborn child or newly placed child must end within 12 months after the birth or placement 11 in some states common law spouse would be eligible crs4 to care for the employees own serious health condition including maternityrelated disability that makes them unable to perform the functions of their position serious health condition has been interpreted to mean an illness impairment injury or mentalphysical condition that involves any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care ie an overnight stay in hospital hospice or residential mental facility period of incapacity requiring absence of more than 3 consecutive days from work school or other regular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by or under the supervision of health care provider any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care period of incapacity that is permanent or longterm due to condition for which treatment may not be effective eg alzheimers stroke and terminal diseases or any absences to receive multiple treatments including any period of recovery therefrom by or on referral by health care provider for condition that likely would result in incapacity of more than 3 consecutive days if left untreated eg chemotherapy physical therapy and dialysis if the need for leave is related to serious health condition employers may require employees to obtain multiple certifications from health care providers12 employees have minimum of 15 calendar days to get certification in support of their own or an immediate family members serious health condition continuing treatment means treatment at least twice by health care provider or once if it results in continuing regimen of care courts have disagreed about what constitutes continuing treatment eg some have ruled differently as to whether taking prescription medication after having seen health care provider meets the definition employees may opt and employers may require them to use accrued paid vacation personal or family leave for unpaid fmla leave taken due to and for the care of new bornadoptedplaced child and for the care of eligible family members with serious health conditions employees may opt and employers may require them to use accrued paid vacation personal and medical or sick leave to care for their own or an eligible family members serious health condition substitution of 12 in addition to licensed doctors of medicine or osteopathy and licensed podiatrists dentists clinical psychologists optometrists or chiropractors health care providers include nurse practitioners nursemidwives clinical social workers christian science practitioners any health care provider recognized by the employer or the employers group health plan manager and an aforementioned health care provider who practices outside the united states according to the laws of the country in question crs5 accrued paid sick or family leave for unpaid fmla leave is subject to the employers policies concerning the use of these benefits length and form of leave eligible employees at covered employers are entitled to maximum of 12 workweeks of leave for fmla reasons in 12month period13 to give employees not only the time but also the flexibility to balance the demands of work and family pl 1033 allows employees to take their 12week entitlement on an intermittent basis in other words the leave may be taken in separate blocks of time for the same fmla reason flexibility also was built into the act by permitting eligible employees to work reduced schedule ie fewer hours per week or per day employees are entitled to intermittentreduced schedule leave to care for their own spouses childs or parents serious health condition they must obtain the agreement of their employers to use these work arrangements in connection with the two other fmlaqualifying reasons in those cases where employees can foresee the need to take intermittent or reduced schedule leave they must work with their employers to schedule it to avoid disrupting business operations employers may temporarily transfer employees to job with equivalent compensation that more easily accommodates their altered work hours employers must account for intermittent fmla leave in the shortest increment that their payroll system uses for other types of leave so long as it is 1 hour or less employee and employer notification when employees can foresee the use of fmla leave they should provide 30 days notice to their employers when the need to take leave is unforeseen employees are to provide notice as soon as practicable this has been interpreted to mean that employees give employers notice within 12 business days of realizing their need to take leave employees should provide enough information to allow employers to determine whether the leave is for fmla reason although employees do not have to refer to the act when notifying employers in those cases in which employers were not made aware that an employee was away from work for reason covered under the statute and in which employees want the leave to be counted toward their 12week entitlement employees are to give timely notice of their intent ie within 12 business days of returning to work covered employers must provide information to their employees about the law the information is to be conveyed in posting approved by the dol and in employee handbooks or other written material 13 for the 12month period employers may chose calendar year fixed 12month leave or fiscal year or 12month period before or after an employees leave under the fmla begins crs6 in addition employers must provide written notice within 12 business days of having received an employees notice of need for leave stating that the leave will count against the employees fmla entitlement detailing whether the employee must furnish medical certification and among other things explaining the employees right to substitute accrued paid leave for unpaid fmla leave and whether the employer is requiring such substitution the employees right to job restoration upon returning from leave and whether the individual is key employee see footnote 8 and the employees obligation to make copremium payments for maintenance of employerprovided group health insurance supreme court decision the supreme court decided in march 2002 ragsdale v wolverine worldwide inc that even if an employer does not timely designate leave as falling under the act the appropriate remedy is not the automatic provision of an additional 12 weeks of fmla leave the divided court held that the employee has to prove heshe was harmed as result of the employers failure in this instance the employee had taken the maximum amount of leave allowed by the company 30 weeks which is more than twice the mandated minimum in the fmla the supreme courts decision overrides the dols regulation at 29 cfr 825700a which states that if employees take paid or unpaid leave but their employers do not designate it as fmla leave the leave taken does not count against the 12week fmla entitlement the court noted that the duration of leave under the statute was carefully balanced compromise that the regulation would have extended for some employees and that it might have prompted employers with more generous leave policies to curtail them which is antithetical to the intent of lawmakers expressed at the time of the acts passage maintenance and accrual of benefits the only fringe benefit that employers are required to continue providing to employees on fmla leave is group health insurance if employees have chosen cash payments in lieu of group health benefits employers need not maintain those payments the obligation to continue the absent employees health coverage ceases ifwhen employees tell employers that they do not intend to return to work when the leave period ends or if they do not return to work at that time for those employers who require employee contributions toward health insurance the employers obligation also stops if employees are more than 30 days late in paying their share of the premium and if employers have given them 15 days advance written notice informing them of the impending cessation of coverage other kinds of benefits eg paid leave and seniority do not accrue while employees are on unpaid fmla leave if these benefits do not accumulate for individuals while they are on other types of unpaid leave although fmla leave is not considered break in service under an employers retirement plan the leave time does not count toward the plans eligibility or vesting requirement crs7 recordkeeping requirements employers are required to keep records in accordance with the fair labor standards act and with the fmlas regulations unless the dol believes violation has occurred or it is investigating complaint the department cannot require an employer to submit records more than once over 12month period covered employers with eligible employees must maintain certain information in particular form for at least 3 years the information includes basic payrolling records eg the employees name and other identifying information compensation and hours worked dates of fmla leave hours of leave if taken in increments of less than 1 workday copies of employee notices of leave submitted to the employer copies of employer notices given to employees any documents describing benefits policies or practices concerning the taking of paid and unpaid leaves and records of any disputes between an employee and the employer regarding designation of leave under the act enforcement it is unlawful for employers to interfere with employees exercising their rights under the statute further employers cannot retaliate or discriminate against employees based on their fmla usage when making decisions regarding such things as hiring promotion discipline or termination for all private state and local government employees and for some federal employees the wage and hour division in the dols employment standards administration administers and enforces pl 1033 it operates nationwide toll free referral service 18664879243 if after investigating complaints the wage and hour division cannot resolve the matter to its satisfaction the dols office of the solicitor may seek to compel compliance through the courts employees also may bring private civil action if they believe there has been violation of the act they do not have to file complaint with the government before filing suit if an employer violates the fmla the employee may recover such things as wages benefits other lost compensation and liquidated not punitive damages in the case of willful violations see appendix table 1 in the case of the congress and some congressional agencies eg congressional budget office the office of compliance handles fmla enforcement some other legislative branch agencies eg general accounting office gao and the library of congress loc handle fmla enforcement internally14 14 see board of directors of the office of compliance review and report on the applicability to the legislative branch of federal laws relating to terms and conditions of employment and access to public services and public accommodations appendix iii dec 31 1998 crs8 the office of personnel management issues the fmla regulations applicable to federal employees employees in the executive branch unlike those at private firms the gao and the loc for example are not entitled to sue for alleged violations of the fmla executive branch employees can only obtain appellate judicial review of merit systems protection board decisions in the federal circuit the fmla has 2year statute of limitations that starts from the last date of violation the statute of limitations is extended 1 year for willful violations experience under the act pl 1033 established the commission on leave which sponsored surveys of employees and employers covering an 18month period in 1994 and 1995 to assess the impact of familymedical leave policies in january 2001 the dol released balancing the needs of families and employers family and medical leave surveys 2000 update it is derived from surveys of employees and employers covering an 18month period in 1999 and 2000 the information that follows is drawn from this report unless otherwise indicated it should be noted that various business groups raised objections and suggested changes to the survey they believed it was meant in part to elicit support for the clinton administrations desire to broaden the act eg by minimizing the negative consequences of the law for employers and for the coworkers of fmla leave takers employer coverage and employee eligibility according to the employer survey the fmla applied to 108 of private sector establishments in 1999200015 yet at the same time 583 of employees who worked at private sector employers were covered by the act these disparate proportions reflect the fact that most worksites in the private sector are relatively small and therefore exempt from pl 1033 but most people are employed by relatively large firms according to the employee survey which covered both public and private sector workers 889 million persons worked at covered establishments and met the fmlas eligibility criteria in 19992000 covered eligible workers accounted for 617 of all employed persons in the united states an additional 215 million individuals or 149 of all employees worked at covered employers but did not fulfill the acts lengthofservice and hoursofwork eligibility requirements thus almost one in five employees at covered worksites were ineligible to utilize the fmla during the latest survey period another 336 million people or 233 of all employees did not work at covered establishments 15 the actual unit surveyed was an establishment ie worksite rather than an employer these words will be used interchangeably in this report crs9 knowledge of the fmla almost 60 of employees regardless of whether they worked at covered or noncovered employers reported that they were aware of the fmlas existence in 19992000 about onehalf of employees at all worksites said they did not know if the law applied to them personally however employees at covered establishments were significantly more likely than those at noncovered establishment to know their correct status under the statute nonetheless just 379 of employees at covered employers correctly knew that the fmla applied to them far more covered establishments 840 than employees correctly knew that the law applied to them noncovered establishments showed greater confusion about their status however with 555 reporting that they did not know whether the act applied to them although employers stated that they most often got their information about the fmla from existing company policies or practices 894 the number that also obtained information from the labor department increased significantly between the 19941995 539 and 19992000 831 survey periods the third most often cited source of fmla information which also posted significant increase over the 5year period from 570 to 779 was attorneys or consultants use of fmla leave use of the fmla increased substantially over time according to the employee surveys 183 of all eligible persons at covered worksites who took leave for fmla reasons in 19992000 did so under the act16 this was significantly above the 116 recorded for 19941995 as shown in table 1 those who exercised their fmla entitlement during the latest survey period also accounted for significantly larger share of all leavetakers and of all employees the rate of leavetaking under pl 1033 also increased significantly over time according to the employer surveys17 in 19941995 there were 36 fmla leave takers per 100 covered employees in 19992000 the figure was substantially higher 65 fmla leavetakers per 100 covered employees the absolute number of employees who took leave under the act in 19992000 was much higher according to the employer survey 4661 million employees than 16 leavetakers in the employee survey who said that they had heard of the act were asked whether their longest leave was taken under the fmla much of the information presented from the two rounds of employee surveys concerns the longest leave taken if more than one leave was taken because respondents were not asked about multiple leaves in the initial survey 17 establishments that stated they were covered by the fmla were asked the number of employees who had taken leave under the act crs10 according to the employee survey 2233 million employees18 some of this discrepancy could be because employees were unaware that employers counted their leave toward their fmla entitlement or because employers counted employees who took leave under the fmla multiple times table 1 employees taking their longest leave under the fmla survey period

of families and employers family and medical leave surveys 2000 update washington dc january 2001 leavetakers are individuals regardless of their status under the fmla who took leave during the survey period for fmlareasons intermittent leave although pl 1033 allows persons who need familymedical leave to take it for short periods of time so long as it does not exceed 12 workweeks in 12month period the great majority of fmla leave is not taken intermittently according to both the employee and employer surveys about 20 of fmla leaves were taken intermittently in the latest survey period reasons for using fmla leave as shown in table 2 employees said attending to their own health was the predominant reason for taking leave under the fmla in both survey periods caring for newborn newly adopted or newly placed foster child was the second most common reason returning to work after fmla leave virtually all fmla leavetakers said they resumed working for their same employer about 980 in both survey periods the establishment survey yielded much different results however with 298 of covered worksites reporting nonreturning fmla leavetakers in 1999 2000 for example while 526 of those employers with nonreturning fmla leavetakers said only one person did not come back to work those with two or more nonreturning leavetakers increased significantly between the survey rounds from 146 to 474 under certain circumstances the law permits employers that have maintained the health benefits of employees on fmla leave to ask nonreturnees to repay 18 the results of the establishment survey were adjusted to take into account public as well as private worksites crs11 costs19 more than 13 of employers with nonreturnees tried to recover health insurance costs and about 46 said they were successful in their efforts the issue of the cost of pl 1033 to employers is addressed later in this section table 2 reasons for longest leave taken under the fmla percent of leavetakers under the

cases and accounts for figures not totaling 100 impact on employees not surprisingly many of the 238 million individuals who took leave for fmla reasons in 19992000 whether or not they were eligible covered employees felt the experience was positive sizeable majorities of these leave takers thought the time away from work had positive impact on their ability to care for family members 787 on their own or family members emotional well being 701 and on their own or family members physical health 63020 in addition most of these leavetakers 726 were verysomewhat satisfied with the length of their longest absence21 more than 9 out of 10 persons who took leave for fmla reasons were able to maintain their benefits eg health life and disability insurance pension 19 employers cannot seek repayment if the employee does not return to work because of continuation of the same health condition that precipitated the fmla leave or because of circumstances beyond the employees control 20 of those leavetakers who thought the leave had positive effect on their own or family members physical health 935 reported that they felt the timeoff made it easier for them to comply with doctors instructions and 837 that it led to quicker recovery time substantial minority 320 said the leave delayed or avoided the need to enter longterm care facility 21 the median length of the longest leave taken was 10 days crs12 contributions and vacation or sick time in addition about twothirds of leave takers said they received some pay during their time off and 429 of paid leave takers had money coming in from multiple sources22 most paid leavetakers 722 received their full paychecks for the whole leave period but 582 of the leave takers who received or partial pay reported difficulty making ends meet23 and virtually all leavetakers who returned to their same employers went back to the same or an equivalent position 971 among individuals whose coworkers had taken leave for fmla reasons 462 indicated that they assumed additional duties 321 worked more than their usual number of hours and 229 worked different shift nevertheless majority 674 said that their coworkers leave for fmla reasons did not have any impact on them this question touches on the idea of workfamily backlash ie young unmarried or childless employees who resent or are demoralized by coworkers for taking leave because they are asked to perform extra work to compensate for the leavetakers absence it is raised again in the policy issues section of this report when the subject of intermittent leave is taken up employer compliance with pl 1033 employers indicated that they most often conveyed information about the act through postings on bulletin boards 924 or through employee handbooks 919 the law requires covered employers to notify their workforce by these two means fewer employees at covered establishments 558 reported that their employers had posted notices about the statute under the statute covered employers may require employees to provide documentation if they need leave for serious health condition virtually all establishments 920 did so for employees who took leave under the fmla in 19992000 employers also may require employees to use their accrued paid leave rather than unpaid fmla leave majority of covered employers 632 said they followed this practice covered employers also are supposed to provide employees with written notice of how much fmla leave they have taken and how the law relates to preexisting leave and benefit policies most establishments said they complied with 823 providing the former and 926 providing the latter despite employers presumably having gained greater familiarity with the 1993 law and its 1995 final regulations they appear to continue to have difficulty complying with it the society for human resource management shrm in its 2000 fmla survey declared that the act stands in contrast with other employment laws which have caused less confusion over the years as the law becomes settled and 22 sick leave was the source of pay most commonly reported by leavetakers 614 followed by vacation leave 394 and personal leave 257 23 of the 238 million leavetakers who were away from work for fmlareasons in 1999 2000 82 million or 345 received pay and 44 million or 185 received partial pay those leavetakers with or partial pay frequently coped with their loss of wages by limiting extras using savings earmarked for this or another situation putting off paying bills or cutting leave time short crs13 more understood by both employers and employees in the first full fiscal year following the fmlas implementation the wage and hour division found violations in 616 of the complaints lodged by employees the ratio of violations to total complaints has varied little over the ensuing years and in fy1999 stood at 612 complaints lodged under the law have most often involved an employers failure to reinstate an employee returning from fmla leave to the same or an equivalent position 46 of the complaints filed on average since the acts implementation another 22 dealt with an employers refusal to grant leave and an additional 16 were related to employer discrimination against employees who took leave under the act see appendix table 1 according to the dols summary of litigation the departments solicitor brought suit in 32 cases through fy1999 for unresolved fmla violations24 the court cases most often concerned an employer who had terminated an employee while they were on fmla leave other cases dealt with employers who failed to restore returning employees to their same or an equivalent position and with employers who denied requests for fmla leave employer administration of the fmla in 19992000 employers most often 983 handled the work of fmla leave takers by temporarily assigning it to other employees25 hiring an outside temporary replacement came in distant second at 413 the use of this option as well as hiring permanent replacement fell significantly since 19941995 possibly due to the tightening of the labor market between survey periods in terms of the ease or difficulty of administering the act employer responses varied widely at one end of the spectrum 860 of employers said they found it verysomewhat easy to determine whether the law applied to their organization and 834 found it verysomewhat easy to determine whether certain employees were eligible at the other end of the spectrum 544 of employers replied that they found it verysomewhat difficult to administer the fmlas notification designation and certification requirements and 528 found it verysomewhat difficult to coordinate the fmla with other federal laws on an overall basis majority of employers 636 rated the act as verysomewhat easy to administer but the proportion dropped significantly from its 1995 level 851 this finding could be related to the need for more employers to become familiar with the law and its regulations because as previously discussed the rate of fmla leavetaking increased significantly over the 5year period 24 the wage and hour division reported that it resolved 88 of all complaints filed from august 1993 through fy1999 25 this also was the most frequently used option among employers who said they relied on more than one method to cope with an employees absence crs14 impact of the benefit mandate on covered employers several provisions were included in pl 1033 to minimize its impact on employers employers indicated they found the requirement that employees give advance notice of foreseeable leave to be the most useful of these provisions followed by the requirement that employees provide written medical certification for serious health conditions the least useful provision intended to help employers manage fmla leave was allowing them to deny job restoration to key employees large majority of employers said that the fmla had noticeable effect on their establishments performance ie 765 said it had effect on productivity 876 on profitability and 877 on growth in the relatively few instances that employers thought the act had any impact they were much more likely to believe it hurt rather than helped their bottom line two to three times as many employers reported negative as opposed to positive effect on the three measures of business performance similarly most employers reported that pl 1033 did not have perceptible impact on the individual performance of employees ie 670 said it had effect on productivity 763 on absences 859 on turnover 956 on career advancement and 647 on morale however significantly more employers reported in 2000 than in 1995 that the statute had negative impact on individual productivity and absences according to the shrms 2000 fmla survey the human resources hr professionals who responded indicated that productivity loss was the most costly consequence of the fmla in addition 63 of respondents said that because of the act their firms had had to keep some employees who otherwise would have been terminated for poor attendance the opportunity to take fmla leave intermittently has concerned employers because it could be more disruptive to business operations and be more burdensome from recordkeeping standpoint than if the leave entitlement were exercised just once in 12month period according to the dolcommissioned establishment survey however 812 of covered employers stated that intermittent leave did not have any impact on productivity and 937 said that it did not affect profitability another measure of the fmlas impact on covered employers is the costs it imposes such as those involved in administration benefit continuation and the temporary replacement of leavetakers eg hiring and training costs although majority of establishments said in response to the dolcommissioned survey that these costs had not changed since they became covered by the act sizeable minority reported higher fmlarelated expenses see table 3 respondents to the shrms 2000 fmla survey indicated that after productivity losses the next costliest items associated with the law were the time and effort expended by hr staff and the replacement of leavetakers however the majority of survey respondents said that it was too difficult to quantify the overall cost of fmla administration 30 or that they had not done so 66 crs15 table 3 changes in selected costs since coverage under the fmla began by establishment size percent of covered establishments with type of employer 251 or more all covered
