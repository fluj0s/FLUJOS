estimated that abuse of the new shipper bonding privilege was responsible for about 40 of the uncollected duties from fiscal years 2001 to 2007 this report will be updated as events warrant background us antidumping ad laws 19 usc 1673 et seq authorize the imposition of remedial duties if 1 the international trade administration ita of the department of commerce determines that foreign merchandise is being sold or is likely to be sold in the united states at less than fair value and 2 the us international trade commission itc determines that an industry in the united states is materially injured or threatened with material injury or that the establishment of an industry is materially retarded due to imports of that merchandise similar statute 19 usc 1671 et seq authorizes the imposition of countervailing duties cvd if the ita finds that the government or any public entity of foreign country has provided prohibited subsidy on the manufacture production or export of the merchandise and the itc determines injury these laws are part of larger body of statutes also known as trade remedies in the united states ad and cvd actions represent the vast majority of activity under the trade remedy laws crs2 from fy2001 to fy2007 duties assessed on entries of goods subject to ad and cvd orders1 were distributed to the petitioners and other parties in support of successful ad and cvd cases pursuant to the continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa more commonly known as the byrd amendment although the cdsoa was actually repealed as of october 1 2005 in sec 7601of the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 the repeal language provided for continued disbursement of adcv duties assessed on entries of goods until october 1 2007 cdsoa disbursements amounted to 284 million in fy2004 2261 million in fy2005 and 3800 million in fy2006 and 2644 million in fy20072 duty collection issues us customs and border protection cbp reportedly has had considerable difficulty collecting the actual amount of ad and cv duties owed on subject merchandise this problem received special attention beginning in fy2001 the first year in which us industries were eligible to receive disbursements under the cdsoa httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22290 according to cbp records uncollected duties from fy2001 through fy2007 amounted to more than 613 million3 for example louisiana crawfish producers estimated and cbps annual disbursement reports later confirmed that between fy2002 and fy2004 cbp collected only 255 million of about 1955 million in ad duties owed on crawfish4 recent report by the government accountability office gao estimated that the ability of new shippers to temporarily post bonds in lieu of cash deposits while the ita conducts an investigation of their sales in the us market accounted for about 40 of these uncollected duties5 any shortfall in collections of ad or cv duties affects us producers of the subject merchandise in two ways 1 the protection afforded by the ad or cv action intended to assist the domestic industry to compete against unfairly traded lowerpriced goods is diminished and 2 domestic producers are not able to collect all of the duties available to them under the cdsoa6 in addition with the repeal of cdsoa duties that would 1 after the ita and itc reach final affirmative determinations of dumping or subsidy ita instructs cbp in an ad or cvd order to assess these duties on the targeted merchandise 2 19 usc 1675c repealed by section 7601 of pl 109171 the repeal means that for all entries of goods after october 1 2007 adcvd duties are as they were prior to the cdsoa enactment deposited in the general account of the us treasury 3 government accountability office gao antidumping and countervailing duties congress and agencies should take additional steps to reduce substantial shortfalls in duty collection gao08381 march 2008 p 13 hereinafter gao report 4 prior to fy2001 all ad and cv duties were deposited in the general fund of the us treasury cbp has included listing of all uncollected duty amounts by case number in its cdsoa annual reports since fy2003 see httpwwwcbpgov the requirement that cbp report the amount of adcvd duties collected and uncollected duties was in effect repealed with the cdsoa 5 gao report p 24 6 because the united states uses retrospective system of adcvd collection some industries are still receiving disbursements for goods that entered the united states prior to october 2007 crs3 normally be directed to the us treasury ie on targeted merchandise entering after october 2007 are foregone new shipper reviews in the course of an ad or cvd investigation by the ita the agency generally determines separate weighted average dumping margin or subsidy rate for each exporter or producer of subject merchandise that was investigated individually during the period of investigation poi and an estimated generally much higher allothers rate for all those not individually investigated7 these are the duty rates assessed if the investigation results in final affirmative determinations by the ita and itc and an ad or cv duty order is subsequently issued since most exporters who are individually investigated are likely to receive significantly lower rates than the allothers rate it is often in the interest of an exporter to request an investigation so that it can be assigned separate rate after the conclusion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22290 of an ad or cvd proceeding if the ita receives request from an exporter or producer who 1 did not export the subject merchandise during the initial poi and 2 is not affiliated with any producer or exporter who exported the merchandise the ita must conduct review to establish an individual ad or cv duty rate for the exporter8 this type of review commonly known as new shipper review may take from 270 to 450 days to complete depending on complexity9 prior to april 2006 any importer purchasing from the new shipper undergoing investigation received the right at his or her option to post bond or security in lieu of cash deposit to cover the additional ad or cv duties to be assessed at the completion of the review10 congress suspended this new shipper bonding privilege until june 30 2009 sec 1632a of pl 109280 as result all importers must now post cash deposit to cover the estimated ad or cv duties in terms of collecting the duties owed this eliminates the risk of delinquency provided that the final duty rate assessed is equal to or less than the cash deposit rate however if the ultimate duty rate is higher than the cash deposit posted risk that the difference is uncollected remains11 7 19 usc 1673dc1b 19 usc 1671dc1b the ita can also determine instead single estimated countrywide subsidy rate if it determines that it is not practicable to determine individual rates see 19 usc 1671dc1biii 19 usc 1677f1e2b 8 19 usc 1675a2b firm from nonmarket economy nme country such as china must also demonstrate the absence of jure and facto government control over its export activities in order to be assigned separate rate in ad investigation similar restrictions apply to new shippers from nme countries 19 usc 1675a2biv 9 19 usc 1675a2biv 10 19 usc 1675a2biii the bond amount set by cbp was generally significantly lower than the amount of duties likely to be assessed 11 gao report p 25 crs4 alleged abuse of new shipper rules many us producers of goods subject to ad or cvd orders cited the new shipper bonding privilege as one of the ways that importers circumvented the duties owed one method that was reported involved exporters subject to high ad duty rates setting up shell companies in the source country to act as new shippers other such companies were set up in the united states to act as the importer of record or arrangements were made with other collusive importers these new shippers exported minimal amount of the goods at fair price and subsequently requested that the ita undertake new shipper review of its export sales price12 while the new shipper review was underway the importer posted bond generally for substantially lesser amount than the adcv duty amount that was assessed at the end of the investigation13 administrative authorities sometimes discover this or other types of fraudulent arrangements in the course of the new shipper review if not discovered however the new entity can receive very low dumping margin and continue to supply the market with the original shippers merchandise at much lower adcv duty rate than previously assigned even if the arrangement was discovered the receiving company can succeed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22290 in importing unlimited quantities of the subject merchandise for many months14 second since the united states uses retrospective system of assessing adcvd tariffs the time between the actual entry of the merchandise and receipt of the final bill assessing the duties is 33 years on average which can add to the risk that duties are uncollected especially when dealing with illegitimate importers15 during the elapsed time the shipper the importer or both may have gone out of business or have declared bankruptcy therefore in many cases the higher duties owed remain uncollected ita and cbp efforts the ita and cbp have both made significant policy changes in an effort to restrict abuses of the new shipper bonding privilege and other forms of duty circumvention in procedures implemented in october 2002 the ita began requiring additional certifications and qualifying paperwork from all exporters requesting new shipper reviews in order to 1 ensure that these exporters actually meet all regulatory requirements and 2 limit the application of the bonding privilege so that the new shipper under review could not become conduit for exports from producers not involved in the review16 12 us congress house committee on ways and means hearing united stateschina relations and chinas role in the

fr 62437 for further clarification see us department of commerce international trade administration import continued crs5 in july 2004 cbp required that continuous bond amounts for all importers of certain special categories of merchandise subject to ad or cv duty orders currently only frozen warmwater shrimp17 be increased to the ita rate established on the final ad or cv order new shippers are assessed at the all others rate multiplied by the value of the importers entries of the subject merchandise in the previous 12month period for example if an importer has imported subject merchandise with value of 1 million during the previous 12 months and the ita rate is 40 percent the importers continuous bond amount will be increased by 40000018 continuous bonds must be posted in addition to any regular duties singleentry bonds or cash deposits required to cover each entry of the merchandise bond amounts will also be periodically reviewed to monitor whether the bonds are sufficient and rates may be adjusted as circumstances warrant19 on april 24 2006 thailand requested dispute settlement consultations with the united states in the world trade organization wto relating to certain ad procedures including cbps continuous bond requirement on warmwater shrimp20 india japan brazil and china requested to join the consultations in early may 2006 in early june 2006 india also requested consultations on the continuous bond requirement21 february 2008 wto dispute settlement panel report found that application of the revised httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22290 policy with respect to products from india and thailand was inconsistent with us wto obligations22 in addition the us court of international trade has issued court injunction on implementation of the policy against some importers23 legislation the new shipper measure included in pl 109280 suspended the availability of bonds to importers from new shippers retroactively from april 1 2006 to june 30 2009 thus requiring them to submit cash deposit to cover the entire estimated adcv duties 16 continued administration policy bulletin 032 of march 4 2003 combination rates in new shipper reviews httpwwwitadocgov 17 gao

ibid 23 national fisheries institute inc v united states customs and border protection 465 fsupp 2d at 1337 the injunction applies to 27 members of the above trade association crs6 for entries of the targeted merchandise24 the measure was implemented by cbp on august 16 200625 the law further requires the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the secretary of commerce the us trade representative and the secretary of homeland security to report to congress on the effectiveness and traderelated impact of the suspension and to make recommendations on its extension later than december 31 2008 the same officials were also required to report on previous duty collection issues during the 4 most recent fiscal years for which data are available including any fraudulent activity intended to avoid payment of duties within 180 days of enactment26 conclusion suspension of the new shipper bonding privilege may partially improve the effectiveness of ad and cv duty collections because until july 2009 importers must post cash deposits roughly equivalent to the amount of duties assessed at the time of entry into the united states provided the final amount of duties assessed is equal to or lesser than the deposit rate supplemental duties that may be accrued due to possible rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22290 increases either during the final ita determination as result of annual reviews are not protected however27 furthermore congress faces the issue some time in 2009 of evaluating its effectiveness and determining whether to allow it to lapse extend the suspension or require cash deposits for new shippers permanently congress could also revise the level or number of shipments necessary for exporters to apply for new shipper status28 according to ita officials abusers of the privilege typically exported one shipment of the goods subject to ad or cv duties at relatively high price resulting in relatively low cash or deposit being required if subsequent shipments were found to be dumped or subsidized cbp had to issue retrospective bills for the duty amounts assessed which were likely to be uncollected29 therefore congress could choose to increase the dollar amount or number of shipments required prior to application for new shipper review or to provide ita with the discretion to do so on the other hand this approach could unfairly burden legitimate new shippers by requiring them to export much larger amount at relatively high rate of duty prior to receiving an individual presumably lower rate finally the requirement that cbp report all uncollected adcv duties was repealed along with the cdsoa congress may also want to consider reinstating the reporting requirement 24 the suspension does not apply to mexico or canada because the north american free trade agreement nafta specifies that any amendments to ad or cvd laws apply to nafta countries only to the extent specified in the amendment see 19 usc 3438 25 us customs and border protection suspension of new shipper review provision memorandum august 16 2006 26 pl 109280 sec 1632b and c 27 gao report p 25 28 gao report p 42 29 ibid
