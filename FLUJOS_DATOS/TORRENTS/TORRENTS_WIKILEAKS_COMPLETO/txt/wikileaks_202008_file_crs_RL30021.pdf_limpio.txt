several child carerelated initiat ives in the form of tax credit proposals increased child care subsidies and increased funding for head start and the 21st century community learning centers programs details of those proposals were included in the clinton administrations fy2001 budget proposal this was the third year in row that the clinton administration proposed major child care initiative as was the case in the 105th congress the 106th congress introduced considerable child carerelated legislation however little action was taken on the dozens of bills introduced child care policy debates typically focus on three elements availability affordability and quality of child care all three of these elements would be addressed by the administrations and other proposals in addition fourth element was raised during the 105th congress and was addressed again in some bills introduced in the 106th congress the extent to which child care policy treats families with and without stayathome parent equitably primary reason for the current focus on child care is welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996 which has called attention to the child care needs of welfare recipients and lowincome families who are attem pting to become and remain economically selfsufficient in addition for families with tax liability tax credit is available to offset part of the costs of child care but the terms of this credit have not been updated since 1981 regarding the quality of child care recent research on early brain development has heightened interest in the experiences of children in child care settings while the death of massachusetts infant in 1997 and subsequent murder conviction of his caregiver focused national concern on the basic question of child care safety finally afterschool child care also has become focus in the current debate the federal government operates several programs related to child care of which the largest is the child care and development block grant grant program that helps subsidize the child care expenses of lowincome and welfare families the clinton administration advocated for new spending for this block grant and the dependent care tax credit dctc in 2000 the administration proposed to not only expand the dctc but to make the credit refundable as well numerous child care bills were introduced in the 106th congress but few received full floor action like the administrations initiative some were omnibus packages of tax and grant provisions proposals would have increased the supply of child care through tax incentives or grants for employers and through expanded federal grants to states some bills would have made child care more affordable through the tax code and some including the administrations latest initiative had provisions for families with an athome parent legislation proposed to upgrade the quality of child care primarily through voluntary incentives several would have provided incentives for use of nationally accredited child care providers or credentialed caregivers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021contents most recent developments 1 introduction 2 federal programs and recent funding 3 clinton administration proposals

appropriations for department of health and human services programs including the child care and development block grant ccdbg the social services block grant ssbg and head start the law provides an additional 817 million in funding for the ccdbg which when added to the 1183 billion provided as an advanc appropriation in the fy2000 law amounts to 2 billion in fy2001 funding for the ccdbg in other child care related funding the fy2001 appropriations law provides 62 billion in fy2001 funding for head start 933 million increase over the fy2000 level an advance appropriation of 14 billion for head start in fy2002 is also included in the new law funding for the ssbg was decreased by 50 million from its fy2000 level being set at 1725 billion for fy2001 the law does include provision maintaining states ability to transfer up to 10 of their annual temporary assistance for needy families tanf allotments to the ssbg additional child care provisions relating specifically to federal child care drawn from the vetoed appropriations legis lation covering the legislative branch hr 4985 were also included in the consolidated appropriations act 2001 these provisions include continuing to permit executive branch agencies not including the general accounting office to use agency funds otherwise available for agency salaries and expenses to provide child care services in federal or leased facility or through contract for civilian employees of the agency these funds are to be used to improve the affordability of child care for lower income federal employees using or seeking to use the child care services offered by the agency facility or contractor also included in pl 106554 is new provision section 643 which requires that all current and newly hired workers in all child care centers located in federally owned or leased facilities undergo criminal background checks in complianc with the crime control act of 1990 see fy2001 appropriations legislation section for additional information on dece mber 6 2000 hhs released statereported data on child care and development fund ccdf subsidy receipt indicating that in fy1999 on an average monthly basis 18 million children in lowincome families received federal child care subsidies this is an increase of 300000 families from the 15 million served in fy1998 hhs estimates that only 12 percent of federally eligible children were served in fy1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs2 introduction for the third straight year the clinton administration proposed major child care initiative for 2000 the 2000 initiative outlined in president clintons state of the union address and detailed in his budget request for fy2001 included child care proposals that would increase spending and tax incentives by 33 billion over 2000 president clinton put forth proposals to both expand and make refundable the dependent care tax credit dctc to create tax credit for businesses that provide child care services for their employees to increase subsidies provided through the child care and development block grant ccdbg to provide an additional 1 billion for the head start program to increase funding for child care services for low income higher education students and to increase funding for after school programs through 21st century community learning centers this marked the third year in row that the presidents child care initiative has combined tax initiatives with increased program funding in 1999 the clinton administrations proposed child care package totaled approximat ely 20 billion over 5 years intended primarily to help parents pay for child care and also to expand the supply of quality care for preschoolers and activities for schoolaged children however little final action occurred in the 106th congress on any major child care proposal despite the introduction in congress of well over 50 bills similarly most of the many child carerelated bills proposed during the 105th congress also lacked legislative movement this report provides background information on child care programs funding and proposals and tracks the progress of child care legislation and appropriations during the 106th congress child care policy debates typically focus on three elements availability affordability and quality of child care all three of these elements would be addressed by the administrations and other proposals in addition fourth element emerged in the 105th congress ie the extent to which child care policy treats all families with children equitably including families in which parent stays home to care for the children in both his 1999 and 2000 initiatives the president clinton included proposal intended to address this concern for families with infants several bills introduced in the 106th congress also addressed this issue primary reason for the current focus on child care is welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996 which has called attention to the child care needs of welfare recipients and very lowincome families who are attempting to become and remain economically selfsufficient the 1996 welfare law consolidated several previously existing child care programs into one with substantially increased federal funding lawmakers are closely watching the implementation of welfare reform at the state level to assess its impact on child care demand and to determine whether the supply of affordable care is adequate for the need especially among lowincome families that are not receiving welfare for families with tax liability tax credit is available to offset part of the costs of child care this is known as the dependent care tax credit dctc however the terms of this credi t ie the credit rate the amount of expenses against which the credit can be claimed etc have not been updated since 1981 in the meantimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs3 changes in the tax code and new provisions benefitting families with children have raised questions about the conti nuing value of this tax credit motivating the administration and others to propose changes in the existing provision in his 2000 state of the union address president clinton not only proposed to expand the dctc as he also proposed to do in 1999 but also proposed to make the credit refundable regarding the quality of child care recent and highly publicized research on early brain development has heightened interest in the experiences of children in child care settings particularly babies and very young children quality issues include the training qualifications and compensation of caregivers group size and caregiverchild ratios and curriculum at the same time the death of massachusetts infant in 1997 and subsequent murder conviction of his caregiver focused national concern on the basic question of safety in child care finally afterschool child care and activities for schoolaged children also have become focus in the current debate and are promoted as preventive measure to keep children away from risky behavior and to protect them from victimization federal programs and recent funding several federal programs support child care primarily for lowincome working families the primary federal grant program is the child care and development block grant ccdbg which was created in 1990 and reauthorized and substantially expanded in 1996 as part of welfare reform the ccdbg is administered by the department of health and human services hhs and provides block grants to states according to formula which are used to subsidize the child care expenses of families with children under age 13 if the parents are working or in school and family income is less than 85 of the state median in practice many states establish income eligibility levels that are lower than this federal threshold child care services are provided on sliding fee scale basis and parents may choose to receive assistance through vouchers or certificates which can be used with provider of the parents choice including sectarian providers and relatives states receiving ccdbg funds must establish child care licensing standards although federal law does not dictate what these standards should be or what types of providers must be covered in addition states must have health and safety requirements applicable to all providers receiving ccdbg subsidies that address prevention and control of infectious diseases building and physical premises safety and health and safety training for caregivers however federal law does not dictate the specific contents of these requirements the ccdbg is funded through both discretionary and capped entitlement grants and state maintenanc eofeffort and matching requirements apply to part of the entitlement funds states must use at least 4 of their total funds to improve the quality and availability of child care and must target 70 of entitlement funds on welfare recipients working toward selfsufficiency or families at risk of welfare dependency remaining entitlement and discretionary funds may be used for low income nonwelfare working families more than 5 of state allotments may be used for state administrative costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs4 in fy2001 total of 457 billion was appropriated for the ccdbg see table 1 entitlement funds of 257 billion were appropriated in advance by the welfare reform law and 2 billion in discretionary funds were appro priated by the fy2001 consolidated appropriations act pl 106554 for fy2001 unlike prior years there is advance discretionary funding for ccdbg in fy2002 under welfare reform total ccdbg funding is scheduled to increase to 37 billion by fy2002 overall the welfare law authorized total of 20 billion for child care for 6 years fy1997fy2002 which is 4 billion more than the congressional budget office cbo had estimated would have been available under prior law the child and adult care food program cacfp provides federal funds in some cases commodities for meals and snacks served in licensed child care centers family and group day care homes and head start centers child care providers that are exempt from state licensing requirements must comply with alternative state or federal standards children under 12 migrant children under 15 and children with disabilities of any age may participate although most are preschoolers eligible providers are usually public and private nonprofit organizations the cacfp is an openended entitlement administered by the department of agriculture in fy2001 estimated obligations are 18 billion the dependent care tax credit dctc is nonrefundable tax credit for employmentrelated expenses incurred for the care of dependent child under 13 or disabled dependent or spouse under section 21 of the tax code the maximum credit is 30 of expenses up to 2400 for one child for credit of 720 and up to 4800 for two or more children for credit of 1440 the credit rate is gradually reduced as income goes up for taxpayers with incomes above 10000 until the credit rate reaches 20 for taxpayers with incomes above 28000 the current estimated revenue loss for fy2000 is 22 billion as determined by the joint committee on taxation under section 129 of the tax code payments made by taxpayers employer for depend ent care assistance may be excluded from the employees income and therefore not be subject to federal income tax or employment taxes the maximum exclusion is 5000 section 125 of the tax code allows employers to include dependent care assistance along with other fringe benefits in nontaxabl flexible benefit or cafeteria plans the estimated revenue loss associated with this income exclusion is currently 400 million in fy2000 as determined by the joint committee on taxation title xx of the social security act authorizes social services block grants ssbg which may be used for social services at the states discretion there are federal income eligibility requirements targeting provisions service mandates or matching requirements child care funded by ssbg must meet state or local standards an hhs analysis of state expenditures in fy1998 indicates that almost 10 of ssbg funds were used for child care in that year title xx is capped entitlement administered by hhs and state allocations are based on relative population size legislation enacted by the 105th congress pl 105178 reduced the entitlement ceiling for the ssbg from 238 billion to 17 billion in fy2001 however congress has appropriated 1725 billion for fy2001 despite the ceilinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs5 on may 17 2000 two bills hr 4481 and s 2585 were introduced which would have restored the authorized ceiling to the earlier 238 billion level but neither was acted upon in the 106th congress although not generally characterized as child care program head start provides comprehensive early childhood education and development services to low income preschool children typically but not always on parttime basis head start funds are provided directly by hhs to local grantees which must comply with detailed federal performance standards in fy2001 62 billion was appropriated for head start of which 48 billion is available in fy2001 and 14 billion is available in fy2002 the advance funding component of the appropriation was new for the head start program starting in fy2000 several education department ed programs also provide support for early childhood or afterschool activities even start provides grants for family literacy projects that include early childhood education for children through age 7 fy2001 appropriations were 250 million the individuals with disabilities education act idea authorizes an early intervention program for infants and toddlers with disabilities funded in fy2001 at 384 million and preschool grants for children with disabilities funded in fy2001 at 390 million in addition the elementary and secondary education act authorizes grants to rural and innercity public elementary or secondary schools for 21st century community learning centers which provide afterschool activities funded at 846 million in fy2001 fy1998 fy2001 funding for the programs identified above is summarized in the following table for

2000 president clinton described his administrations child care initiative for 2000 in his state of the union address details of the proposals were included in the fy2001 budget request the presidents proposals for fy2001 funding would have increased child care spending and tax incent ives by 33 billion over 2000 levels the major elements of the proposal included increased funding for the ccdbg head start and the 21st century community learning centers and both expansion and modification of the dctc most components of the 2000 child care initiative are similar to that of 1999 with one significant new addition proposal to make the dctc refundable thus providing benefit to families with tax liability the following is summary of the 2000 child care initiative noting the funding requested by president clinton for fy2001 and where applicable the appropriated amounts ultimately enacted into law ccdbg expansion the administration proposed to increase fy2001 funding for the ccdbg by 817 million over the fy2000 level which would bring it up to 2 billion according to administration documents the additional funding would enable the program to provide nearly 150000 additional lowincome children with child care subsidies in fy2001 when combined with the 26 billion in child care entitlement funding provided under the welfare reform law pl 104193 the child care and development fund would reach total of 46 billion for fy2001 congress met this appropriation reque st and 817 million in additional ccdbg funding for fy2001 was provided in pl 106554 dependent care tax credit expansion the clinton administration proposed to expand the dctc by increasing the credit amount for middleincome families and for the first time ever to make the dctc refundable thus assisting lower income families specifically the maximum credit rate would be increased from 30 to 50 and the credit would apply to families earning up to 60000 rather than 28000 as under current law also by making the dctc refundable beginning in 2003 lowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs7 income families with tax liability would be eligible for the dctc benefit up to 2400 in addition as in 1999 president clinton proposed again in 2000 to allow parents who stay at home with child under age one to claim annual child care expenses up to 500 the administration estimated that these dctc expansion proposals would provide tax credits worth an additional 75 billion over 5 years several bills that included these legislative proposals were introduced during the 106th congress but none were enacted into law tax credits for private employers the clinton administration proposed tax credit to encourage businesses to provide child care for employees eligible for the credit would be private employers that expand or operate child care facilities train child care workers contract with child care facility to provide child care services to employees or provide child care resource and referral services to employees like the 1999 proposal it would create tax credit covering 25 of costs up to 150000 per year per business the administration estimated that the proposal would provide tax credits worth over 500 million over 5 years legislation in this area received full floor action in the 106th congress afterschool child care the clinton administration has been successful in funding afterschool care through the 21st century comm unity learning centers program which was created in 1997 the president proposed for fy2001 to fund the program at level of 1 billion more than double the fy2000 funding of 454 million estimating that this additional funding would enable the program to reach over 10000 schools and 25 million students the administration also contended that this requested amount would provide sufficient funds for the program to make after andor summerschool programs universally available to all title i schools identified as lowperforming while also offering high quality afterschool opportunities to others congress did not fully meet president clintons requested level in the fy2001 appropriations legislation however pl 106554 did increase funding for fy2001 to 846 million early learning fund the clinton administration again in 2000 proposed to create the early learning fund new entitlement funding to help improve early childhood education for children under 5 years old as proposed the fund would require 600 million in fy2001 and 3 billion over 5 years funds would be used to provide grants to communities to improve school readiness by fostering the cognitive physical social and emotional development of children under 5 years old grants to the states would be contingent on reporting progress regarding child care quality goals and childrens educational goals federal evaluation would assess improvements in outcomes like the ccdbg the early learning fund would be administered by hhs the fy2001 consolidated appropriations act pl 106554 provides 20 million for this new initiative head start expansion the clinton administration followed up on fy1999s expanded head start funding with another proposed increase the fy2001 budget request included an additional 1 billion for head start the largest proposed single year increase in the programs history which would bring fy2001 head start funding to 63 billion with the fy2000 proposal the clinton administration aimed to add approximately 60000 head start preschool slots and 10000 early head start slots bringing the total number of children in head start according to dhhs tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs8 approximately 950000 the request was consistent with president clintons goal of enrolling million children in head start by 2002 including doubling the number of infants and toddlers in early head start clinton administration budget documents also highlighted the administrations intent to increase participation in head start by underrepresented groups in speci fically targeted areas with recent influxes of immigrants and children with limited proficiency in english congress met president clintons request for significant increase for head start providing in pl 106554 an fy2001 appropriation of 62 billion of which 14 billion will become available in fy2002 college campusbased child care the clinton administrations budget request included 15 million for the child care access means parents in school program this program funded at 5 million in fy2000 would establish and support child care services on college campuses administration documents note that states may also use share of the ccdf fund for this purpose the consolidated appropriations act 2001 pl 106554 provides more than president clintons requested amount funding the child care access means parents in school program at 25 million for fy2001 ccdbg quality activities in the advance appropriation for the ccdbg for fy2001 provided in the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act congress include d an additional 173 million for activities related to quality improvement in child care such as resource and referral services for parents scholarships and training for child care providers monitoring and inspection of providers networks for family day care providers and linkages with head start these amounts are in addition to the 4 setaside that states must use for quality activities the administration has requested that congress continue to provide these additional funds the administrations budget also requests 10 million in continued child development and child care research funding these funds are not shown in table 2 because the request would maintain but not increase amounts above the level provi ded in the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act the consolidated appropriations act 2001 pl 106554 provides that of the 817 million appropriated for the ccdbg 191 million shall be available for resource and referral of which 1 million shall be specifically for the child care aware toll free hotline also 273 million shall be reserved for quality activities 100 million for quality infant and toddler care specifically finally of the fy2001 funds 10 million shall be used for child care research demonstration

congre ss that provides grants to states for support systems to help families who have children with disabilities deal with such problems as inadequate child care the fy2001 request proposed to fund

regarding federal child care both house and senate bills included provision allowing executive branch federal agencies to use agency funds to provide child care services for employees of the agency in facility owned or leased by the agency provided these funds are used to improve the affordability of child care for lowincome federal employees in addition the senate bill would have required regulations establishing health and safety standards for federal agency child care programs and required that facilities meet state or local licensing standards and comply with standards set by state or nationally recognized accreditation entity1 child care provisions in the taxpayer refund act of 1999 vetoed on september 23 1999 president clinton vetoed the taxpayer refund act of 1999 the conference report hrept 106289 on the bill hr 2488 had passed both the house and senate on august 5 1999 the conference agreement did not include all of the child care provisions from the house bill and senate amendment the agreement did not adopt the senate provision to create tax credit for employer supported child care and also dropped the senates amendm ent proposing 10 billion increase in ccdbg funding over 10 years the conference agreement did include provisions regarding the dependent care tax credit dctc but modified the senate amendments proposal the conference agreement would have set the dctc maximum credit percentage at 35 for taxable years beginning in 2001 through 2005 and 40 thereafter the senate amendment would have set the maximum credit rate at 40 beginning in taxable year 2001 the house bill had dctc provisions the conference agreement also included the senate amendments provi sion which would have extended up to 960 of additional credit 1920 for two or more qualifying dependents to taxpayers with qualifying dependents under age one the conference agreement however would have made this provision effective for taxable years beginning after 2005 rather than the senate amendments effective date of taxable year 2001 action in the 105th congress although none of the major authorizing committees acted on comprehensive proposal in the 105th congress some action on child care did occur for example the head start program was reauthorized for 5 years pl 105285 the higher education act also was reauthorized pl 105244 with two child carerelated provisions grants for campusbased child care authorized at 45 million in fy1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs19 and such sums as necessary in subsequent years and loan forgiveness demonstration program for lowincome individuals who complete degree in early childhood education and work fulltime in child care facility authorized at 10 million in fy1999 and such sums as necessary in later years appropriations legislation subsequently provided 5 million for the campusbased child care grants in fy1999 but funding for the loan forgiveness demonstration pl 105277 also during the 105th congress both the house and senate passed resolutions recognizing parents who stay home with their children in the senate this provision was included in the fy1999 budget resolution which also assumed increased spending for the ccdbg and the dctc these assumptions required additional legislative action however which did not occur the 105th congress acted on several child carerelated bills that did not become law for example the house government reform and oversight committee approved legislation that would have mandated standards for child care provided to federal employee s similar legislation was approved by the senate as part of the fy1999 treasury postal service appropriations bill the house eventually passed bill allowing federal agenci to use funds for child care but not mandating standards for such care further action occurred on these proposals several bills would have earmarked tobacco revenues for child care the senate debated legislation that would have provided grants to states from national tobacco trust fund and approved an amendment that would have required states to use part of these trust fund grants for child care after defeati ng an effort to table this amendment by vote of 33 to 66 however the senate ultimately stopped consideration of this bill and returned it to the commerce committee where further action took place legislative approaches more than 50 child care bills were introduced in the 105th congress and several dozen many with similar provisions were introduced again in the 106th congress like the administrations 1999 initiative several were omnibus packages of tax and grant provisions in general these bills addressed one or more of the traditional elements in child care policy debates availability affordability and quality of care the following sections briefly describe the legislative approaches that have been proposed in each of these areas availability of child care proposals in the 105th congress would have increased the supply of child care in several ways including through tax incentives or grants for employers to provide child care for their employees and through expanded federal grants to increase the supply of child care for lowincome families other proposals would have increased the availability of specific types of child care such as afterschool carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs20 private sector incentives like the administrations initiative numerous proposals would have established new tax credit for businesses that support child care programs for their employees the bills differed somewhat regarding the size of the tax credit and the types of expenditures that could be covered for example the size of the credit varied from 20 of qualified expenditures to 50 some proposals would have placed dollar limit on the credit of 100 000 or 150000 in single year while others would have established upper limit one proposal would have limited the credit to 100000 for startup costs 25000 for facility operating costs and 50000 to reimburse employees for their child care expenses under some proposals the credit would have been available only for startup costs such as buying building rehabilitating or expanding properties while others would have also allowed the credit to apply to operating costs including the costs of training and scholarships for caregivers allowing higher pay for caregivers with higher levels of training and resource and referral services some bills would have allowed the credit to be used for the costs of accreditation or credentialing as an alternative to tax credits some proposals would have encouraged private employers especially small businesses to provide child care for their employees through federal grant s proposals varied in size from 25 million annually to 75 million in some cases grants would go directly to businesses or consortia of employers in others grants would go through states and then to private employers in general hhs would administer these grants which would help employers set up and operate child care programs several bills would have limited participating employers to those with fewer than 50 or 100 employees expansion of ccdbg numerous bills were introduced in the 105th congress to increase funding for the ccdbg either by increasing its discretionary authorization level or by directly appropriating additional funds for its entitlement component some of these proposals would have increased funding by as much as 15 billion per year in some cases these additional funds would have been specifically earmarke d for services to nonwelfare lowincome working families some bills also would have earmarked certain amount of funding for families with very young children new grant programs several bills would have created new freestanding grant programs independent of the ccdbg to provide quality child care and related services especial ly focusing on very young children in some cases children under age 6 in others children under age 3 authorization levels varied widely going as high as 4 billion annually in the outyears some proposals would have authorized formula grants to states while others would have awarded funds directly to local grantees under some proposals hhs would have been the federal administering agency other s would have established the program within the department of education and provided grants to local education agencies one proposal would have authorized grants to states for schoolbased child care programs for children under age 7 afterschool child care as proposed by the administration numerous bills sought to increase annual funding for the 21st century community learning centers from 40 million to 200 million as described earlier this proposal was successfulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs21 for fy1999 for fy2000 funding for the 21st century community learning centers was increased further to 454 million in addition several bills would have authorized or directly appropriated funding for afterschool programs either through grants to states or to local education agencies administered either by hhs or the department of education primarily as delinquency prevention measure afterschool programs also were proposed to be administered by the department of justice campusbased child care to enable lowincome parents to pursue higher education several bills proposed to authorize funds for the education department to make grants for campusbased child care this proposal was included in the reauthorization of the higher education act and 5 million was appropriated for fy1999 and again in fy2000 in addition bills were introduced that would have increased the dependent care allowance that is considered in determining pell grant awards welfaretowork exemption under the new temporary assistance for needy families tanf welfare program states may not withhold benefits to single custodial parents with children under age 6 for failure to work if they cannot find appropriate and affordable child care one proposal would have extended this exemption to parents with children under age 11 legal liability concern s one proposal would have required the general accounting office to study whether legal liability concerns are barrier to the establishment and operation of child care programs by businesses schools community centers or individuals in their own homes facilities construction to make it easier for child care programs to obtain financing to buy build or substantially rehabilitate facilities several bills would have authorized the department of housing and urban development to insure mortgages and would have established childrens development commission to certify facilities for such insurance another proposal would have authorized grants to states for construction or renovation of schoolbased child care programs and another would have authorized 100 million over 5 years under the ccdbg for capital financing program for child care affordability of child care numerous bills proposed to make child care more affordable for parents through the tax code and some of these proposals included provisions for families with an at home parent in addition most proposals to increase federal funds for child care were specifically intended to help provide affordable care for lowincome families dctc revisions the maximum credit available under the existing dependent care tax credit is 30 of expens up to 2400 for one child for maximum credit of 720 and 4800 for two or more children for maximum credit of 1440 the credit rate is gradually phased down for taxpayers with incomes above 10000 as their incomes go up until it reaches 20 for taxpayers with incomes above 28000 moreover the existing tax credit is nonrefundable which means that it can be used only by families with tax liabilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs22 several bills proposed to make the dctc refundable as did the president in his 2000 state of the union address so that families without tax liability could actually receive payment equal to the credit many bills would have done combination of the following increase the percentage of expenses that may be claimed for the credit ie the credit rate increase the amount of expenses that may be considered in calculating the credit and increase the income levels at which the credit rate phases down some bills would have denied the credit altogether for higher income taxpayers one proposal would have connected the credit rate to the status of the provider with higher credit rate available for taxpayers who use accredited or credentialed child care several proposals would allow the dctc to be used by families where parent is not employed and stays home to care for the children in general these proposals would have deemed such families to have child care expenses of certain amount and would have enabled the family to claim credit based on these deemed expenses most of these proposals would have limited such benefits to families with very young children one proposal would have eliminated the dctc altogether for families with children under age 5 and instead would have increased the perchild tax credit which is separate recently enacted tax provision available to all famil ies regardless of employment status from 500 to 1500 for children in this age group other measures would have amended the dependent care assistance program dcap to enable its use by families with an athome spouse and related proposal would have increased the number of years to 5 of little or earnings that are disregarded in calculating social security benefits for individuals who did not work in those years to care for dependent child under age 12 business tax credits some of the employer tax credit proposals described in the previous section on availability of child care also would have required that any tax credit claimed by an employer must be passed on to employees in the form of reduced child care costs expansion of ccdbg as described earlier numerous bills would have increased ccdbg funding which is designed to increase the supply of affordable child care for lowincome families moreover one proposal would have required states as condition of receiving ccdbg funds to base their child care payment rates on market rate surveys that are more than 2 years old this is currently requirement under the ccdbg regulations which took effect august 24 1998 new grant programs also as described in the previous section several new freestanding grant programs were proposed in the 105th congress largely focused on providing quality services for young children improving the affordability of care also was goal of many of these proposals quality of child care numerous bills would have attempted to upgrade child care quality primarily through voluntary incentives none would have mandated federal standards for child care which has led to contentious debates when proposed in the past howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30021crs23 several would have provided incentives for use of nationally accredited child care providers or credentialed child caregivers competitive incentive grants several bills proposed to award competitive or challenge grants to states that comply with certain conditions related to quality some of these proposals would have awarded as much as 1 billion per year and conditions for receiving such grants varied for example one proposal would have awarded incentive funds to states that had not reduced their child care standards or requirements since 1995 and had furnished sufficient matching funds to draw down 80 of their ccdbg matching funds the previous year another proposal would have rewarded or penalized states under the ccdbg program by increasing or reducing their block grant allotment by 10 depending on the states performance in maintaining health and safety standards other propo sals would have awarded grants to states that require criminal background checks for child care workers conduct frequent health and safety inspections require first aid training for workers maintain certain childstaff ratios and require minimum level of training for caregivers states that adopted quality components of the military child care system or other successful models would have received incentive funds under another measure in general these incentive grant proposals would have targeted the funds toward quality related activities such as subsidies for credentialed providers parent education scholarships for
