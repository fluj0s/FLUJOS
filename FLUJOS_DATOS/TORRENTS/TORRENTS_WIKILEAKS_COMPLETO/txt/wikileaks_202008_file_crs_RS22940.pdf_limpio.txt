doj2 and the fcc though both agencies analyze the potential effects on competition proposed merger may have their processes differ sometimes substantially this report will focus on the fccs authority to approve mergers and its process for reviewing these proposed transactions sources of commission merg er review authority the commission has authority under sections 7 and 11 of the clayton act to review the proposed mergers of common carriers3 specifically the commission may disapprove proposed mergers of common carriers engaged in wire or radio communication or radio transmission of energy where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lesse n competition or to tend to create monopoly4 the commission also finds authority to re view mergers through its power to approve or deny the transfer of the licenses it i ssues under the communications act sections 214a and 310d of the communications act require the commission to deny the transfer of licenses if the commission determines that the transfer is not in the present or future public convenience and necessity5 under 214a or is not in the public interest convenience and necessity6 under 310d this standa rd is widely referred to as the public in terest standard although the commission has explicit authority under the clayton act to review the proposed mergers of certain common carriers it does not seem to have ever utilized that authority7 the commission most often proceeds solely pursuant to the communications act because that authority necessarily subsumes and extends beyond the traditional parameters of review under the antitrust laws8 indeed courts have insisted that the agencies given licensing and

rcd 1535115354 30 1997 hereinafter mci bt order dictates of antitrust laws9 not only must the commission consider competitive effects in its public interest calculus but the thres hold required for trans action to be approved is higher under the public interest sta ndard than under traditional antitrust laws proposed mergers that are reviewed under the communications act are held to higher standard when examining their potential competitive effects than the same proposed transaction would be under the antitrust laws10 under the clayton act if the reviewing agency decides not to approve pr oposed merger the agency must either reach remedial agreement with the parties or file suit to block the merg er in federal court where the agency will bear the burden of pe rsuading the court that the proposed merger will have substantial anticompetitive effects11 not only must the government prove that the merger will decrease competition as compared to the current market12 but the government must prove that the proposed merger will substantially decrease competition13 this standard seems to indicate that proposed mergers that will be competitively neutral preserve the current level of competition would not violate the clayton act in contrast under the license transfer provisions of the communications act the parties proposing to merge as opposed to the reviewing agency bear the burden of persuading the commission14 that the merger would enhance rather than merely preserve competition15 this standard that suggests competitively neutral merger which likely would be approved under the clayton act could be denied by the commission when acting under its communica tions act authority the commission reasons therefore that review pursuant to the communications acts public interest standard renders the exercise of the co mmissions clayton act authority unnecessary16 commission license transfer review process and the public interest standard when attempting to receive

commission after receiving input from the public then reviews the proposed transfer to determine whether it will serve the public in terest convenience and necessity as required by the communications act the commission is not required to complete this review in any set period of time but has created an informal timeline of 180 days for consideration of license transfers18 the amount of time required to an alyze license transfers is dependent upon the complexity of the proposed transacti on and the intricacy of the public interest analysis it may require and the 180day goal is not always met the public interest standard of the communications act generally is considered to be an amorphous standard and as noted bove is broader in scope than traditional antitrust standards19 the supreme court has stated that the public interest standard doubt leaves wide discretion and calls for imaginative interpretation20 the commission therefore has found that the public interest standard nece ssarily encompasses the broad aims of the communications act21 factors considered to be in the public interest may include among other things deeply rooted preference for preserving and enhancing competition in relevant mark ets accelerating private sect or deployment of advanced services promoting diversity of license hol dings and generally managing the spectrum in the public interest22 the commission also may consider whether the proposed transaction will affect the quality of communications serv ices or will result in the provision of new or additional rvices to consumers relevant to this analysis are technological and market changes and the natu re complexity and speed of change of the communications industry for each proposed license transfer the commissions analysis of the

interest or after ll information is submitted substantial and material question of fact is presented the application must be formally designated for hearingthe doj and ftc merger guidelines23 the commission first defines the relevant product and geographic markets24 after defining the markets the participants must be defined25 the commission then analyzes the potential horizontal competitive effects within the markets as well as the effici encies that may be created by the proposed combination the agency does the same for the vertical competitive effects and efficiencies in this portion of the analysis the commission generally examines whether the merger will concentrate power in the hands of the merging parties in such way that consumers could be harmed by for example increased prices decreased services or the exit of competitors from the marketplace after evaluating potential competitive effects the commission examines claimed public interest be nefits of proposed transaction ch as the potential provision of new programming or services lower prices for services increased service coverage etc the public interest benefits must be transactionspecific meaning that the claimed benefit must be likely to be accomplished as result of the transaction but be unlikely to be realized by other means that entail fewer anticompetitive effects26 this standard does not mean that the claimed benefit must be nearly impossible absent merger rather the benefit must be unlikely to occur absent merger the claimed benefits must be supported by evidence and in order to be in th public interest the ffects of the claimed benefits must flow through to consumers and not inure solely to the merging entities the commission weighs these benefits against the potential harms to the public interest using sliding scale approach27 in this approach where potential harms seem likely to occur applicants must show that the claimed benefits are of higher degree of magnitude and likelihood than when potentia l harms appear less likely if the commissions analysis suggests that the partie s have shown that the merger on balance benefits the public interest the commission generally pproves the transfer without condition if the commission determines that the proposed merger will harm competition or the public interest the co mmission may either designate the proposed

2005transaction to alleviate those harmful effects in most instances the commission and the parties choose to negotiate negotiated conditions on telecommunications mergers the commission finds its authority to nego tiate and enforce voluntary conditions on license transfers under 303r of the communi cations act which grants the commission the authority to prescribe such restrictions and conditions not inc onsistent with the law as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the act29 and 214c which grants the commission the power to place such terms and c onditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necess ity may require on the certificates the agency issues pursuant to its license transfer review authority30 the parties and the commission may agree to any condition upon the proposed transfer that is tailored to mitigate the specific harms anticipated by the commissions re view for example the commission has approved license transfers to be in the public interest when conditioned upon such varied commitments as the divestiture of certain assets31 the creation of new programming and carte options32 maintenance of promised conditi ons to protect national security including the citizenship status of certain key employees where the merger involves foreign owned corporation33 temporary price freezes34 compliance with increased reporting requirements35 unbundling of certain services36 and compliance with the commissions net neutrality policy37 in each of these cases the commission made clear that absent these voluntary commitment s the proposed transactions would have resulted in significant public interest harms such as monopoly power or potential to increase prices for extended periods and th license transfer would not have been approved therefore negotia tion of acceptable conditions em erges as an important part of the license transfer process for many corporations seeking to combine
