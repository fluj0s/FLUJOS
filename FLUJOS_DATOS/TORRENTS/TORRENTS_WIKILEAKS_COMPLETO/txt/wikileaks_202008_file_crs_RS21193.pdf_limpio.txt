gary shorter specialist in business and government relations government and finance division summary traditionally the nasdaq stock market was forprofit but whollyowned subsidiary of the nonprofit nati onal association of securities dealers inc nasd the largest selfregulatory organization s ro for the securities industry in 2000 in strategic response to an increasingly comp etitive securities trading market the nasd membership approved spinning off the forp rofit nasdowned nasd aq and converting it into forprofit shareholderowned market that later planned to issue publicly traded stock for nasdaq this pro cess has involved three basic stages 1 issuing privately placed stock 2 converting to technical exchange status and 3 issuing publiclyheld stock stage one the private placement stage has been completed in march 2001 nasdaq submitted an application for exchange status to the securities and exchange commission sec an application that has been amended several times to address certain criticisms obtaining exchange stat us is necessary for nasdaq to proceed to stage three the issuance of publicly held stock realization of that stage became much closer on january 13 2006 when after more than half decade the sec approved nasdaqs application to become registered national securities exchange introduction established in 1971 at the request of th sec the nasdaq stock market is an allelectronic trading facility which unlik traditional exchanges like the new york stock exchange nyse and the american stock exchange amex has trading floors and facilitates the trad ing of overthecounter otc stocks through network of market makers connected by telephone and computer nasdaq stock market was originally whollyowned forprofit subsid iary of the nonprofit nasd which also served as its direct regulator or lfregulatory organization sro in the mid1990s nasds integrity as self regulator was called into question when nasdaq market makers were accused of ma nipulating stock prices after federal investigation the nasd regulation nasdr was established in 1996 as an independent subsidiary of the nasd the main purpose was to separate the regulationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21193crs2 1 in the spring 2005 in an acquisition that may foreshadow future acquisitions nasdaq announced an agreement to purchase instinet s electronic communication network and to consolidate their trading platformsof the brokerdealer profession from the operation of the nasdaq the nasdr became the primary regulator of brokerdealers and of the nasdaq all brokerdealers who are registered with the sec except those doing business exclusively on securities exchange are required to join the nasd the nasdrs regulatory budg et is derived solely from fees and fines imposed on nasd member firms when it began nasdaq was regarded as technological innovator because it did not rely on physical trading floor but over th last decade both nasdaq and traditional exchanges have faced growing competition fro m two principal sources first global stock markets that compete with us markets for multinational corporate listings have grown dramatically second continuous tec hnological change has led to automated computermatching trading platforms calle d electronic communication networks ecns indeed nasdaq has develope d its own ecn the supermont age and has acquired another one brut to help themselves remain competitive the worlds major stock markets are reexamining their governance and capital stru ctures with an eye toward changes that would enable them to react more deftly to the rapidly changing secur ities marketpl ace conversion from privatelyheld mutual st atus to shareholderowned status known as demutualization has become an increasingly attractive strategic response to the changing market dynamics many international and domes tic stock exchanges have demutualized over the last decade or so including the london tokyo philadelphia and the new york stock exchange in early 2006 after merging with archipelago the ectronic communication trading network key reasons for demutu lization have included that 1 it enables exchanges to more immediately raise capital and provide better re gular access to capital markets1 2 it makes exchanges better able to align their interests with those of their key participants and 3 it provides exchanges with greater flexibility and speed in adapting to changing market conditions sro concerns raised by demutualization in the summer of 1999 the nasdaq announced its intent to demutualize this change raised number of policy concerns that rgely involved demutualized stock markets ability to effectively discharge their sro duties among the key questions raised by the prospect of demutulization were 1 is th ere cause for concern when forprofit shareholderowned sro regulates entities like brokerdealers who in turn have ownership stakes in competitive rivals such as electronic communication networks and 2 would the altered economics of being forprofit shareholderowned exchange affect an exchanges ability to effectively regulate itself httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21193crs3 nasdaqs demutualization and approval as an exchange after announcing its interest in pursuin g demutualization th nyse cited other pressing concerns and put the proce ss on hold in april 2000 however the nasd membership approved spinning off the fo rprofit nasdaq from the nonprofit nasd and converting it into shareholderowned mark et the process was initially envisioned to have three broad stages 1 issuing privat ely placed stock 2 converting to technical exchange status and 3 issuing public stock the private placement took place in two sub stages in the initial substage the private placement which was completed in june 2000 the nasd sold shares and issued warrants on shares of nasdaq that it owned nd nasdaq also issued and sold additional shares the nasds ownership interest in nasdaq was reduced from 100 to 60 the second subphase of the private placem ent was completed on january 18 2001 with nasds ownership interest then falling to 40 or about 77 million nasdaq shares the nasd however retained 51 of the actual vo ting interest in nasdaq on february 21 2002 nasdaq acquired 135 million shares held by the nasd on march 8 2001 nasdaq acquired 203 million shares from th nasd leaving 432 million shares still owned by the nasd in the form of underlyi ng warrants that had been issued during nasdaqs private placements concurrently new series of preferred voting stock was issued to the nasd allowing it to continue to have majority voting interest in nasdaq the second stage conversion to exchange status was requirement for the third stage sale of nasdaq shares to the pub lic although from practical standpoint it has little significance nasdaq currently is exem pt from the definition of an exchange under rule 3a11 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 because it is operated by the nasd before the nasd could relinquish control of it nasd aq was required to register as national securities exchange with appr oval of nasdaqs exchange application the preferred shares that provide the nasd with its majority vote interest over nasdaq will expire and it will longer have effective control over nasdaq the exchanges ultimate goal has been to conduct an initial public offering ipo on march 15 2001 nasdaq submitted an initia l application for exchange status to the sec an application that the agency published for comment on june 14 2001 it later made several amendments to the application in late 2001 nd early 2002 after the initial application the foremost regulatory cern for the sec and number of securities market participants was that as written the application would have continued to allow nasdaq to operate without trade execution protocol known as intramarket price and time priority which is required of exchanges this protocol is described below nasdaq processes limit orders orders to buy or sell stock when it hits specified price the nyse centrally posts limit orders which permits betterpriced orders to receive priority execution there or on the va rious other interlinked market centers that trade nyselisted stocks this is known as price and time priority and all exchanges abide by it both the nasdaq and the nys are markets in which brokers are required to exercise their duty of best execution when they route their customers orders the concept is inexplicit but is ofte n interpreted to means that an order should be sent to the market center providing the best prevailing price httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21193crs4 2 the national market system nms is compos ed of the various systems that govern the communication links among domestic stock exchanges the nms plans are the various rules that govern the linkages the intermarket surveillance group was created in 1983 by the major us securities exchanges to provide consistent prot ocol for the exchange of information across the different securities trading jurisdictionsbut significant fraction of nasdaq market makers match buyer and seller orders from their own order books known as interna lization this can result in well priced limit orders outside of market ma kers book being ignored nasdaq officials have argued that their market permits competing dealers to add liquidity to the markets by interacting with their own order flow but sec officials have concerns about the formal absence of price priority this was major sticking point in the agencys delay in approving the exchange application concerns that na sdaq attempted to address through subs equent amendments to its exchange application on january 13 2006 the sec approved nasd aqs application to become registered national securities exchange as registered exchange nasdaq will become selfregulatory organization sro with ultimate responsibilty for its own and its members compliance with the federal securities laws several years ago nasdaq entered into regulatory services agreement with the nasd to perform certain key regulatory functions for it an arrangement that should continue nasdaq is now officially registered an exchange but the sec will not permit nasdaq to begin operations as an exchange and to fully relinquish its independence from ongoing control by the nasd until various c onditions including the following key ones are satisfied nasdaq must join the various nati onal market system plans and the intermarket surveillance group2 the nasd must determine that its control of nasdaq through its preferred class d share is longer necessary because nasd can fulfill through other means its obligations with respect to nonnasdaq exchangelisted securities under the exchange act the sec must declare certain regulatory plans to be filed by nasdaq to be effective and nasdaq must file and the commission must approve an agreement pursuant to section 17d2 of the s ecurities exchange act of 1934 that allocates to nasd regulatory res ponsibility with respect to certain activities of common members nasdaqs exchange application limits the exchange to transactions in the nasdaq market center previously known as supermont age and brut which will adhere to rules on intramarket priorities however orders that are internalized by nasd broker dealers that may not adhere to intramarket priori ty rules would be re ported through the new trade reporting facility trf which must go through separate regulatory reviewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21193crs5 process and which will be admin istered by the nasd nasd aq will receive revenues from trf trades contentious point for number of its rivals
