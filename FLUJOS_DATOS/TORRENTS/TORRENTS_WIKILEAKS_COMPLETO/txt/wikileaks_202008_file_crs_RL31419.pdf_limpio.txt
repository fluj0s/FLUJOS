recent reports suggest that physicians can obtain the majority of part b drugs for less than the medicare payment amount the startup date of the cap program was delayed from january 1 2006 to july 1

services issued report which stated that the method used by cms is incorrect because it did not use billing units consistently throughout the equation it stated that although cms uses billing units to standardize asps across ndcs for each hcpcs code it does not similarly sta ndardize sales volume across ndcs it further suggested that as result cms reimbursement for the first quarter of 2005 was higher than it should have been for 46 of hcpcs codes lower than it should have been for 13 of the codes and different for the remaining 4110 cms responded to the oig report by stating that it is continuing to look at refinements to the asp methodology but has immediate plans to make changes cms further states that prices appear to be stabilizing and be neficiaries access to care has been maintained during the transition to generally lower drug prices11 monitoring widely available market price the oig is required to conduct studies including surveys to determine the widely available market price of drugs paid for under the asp provision based on these studies and other data the ig is to compare the widely available market price with the asp reported by th manufacturer as part of its medicaid submission the ig is to report to the secretary if the asp exceeds the widely available market price or average manufacturer price amp by specified percentage mma set the percentage at 5 for 2005 and specified that the percentage was to be specified by the secretary in subsequent years the secretary set the percentage at 5 for 2006 in cases where the percentage is exceeded the secretary is to adjust the payment amount for the next calendar quarter the payment is to equal the lesser of the widely available market price or 103 of the amp the widely available market price is

further stat ed that comparisons between asps and amps yield different results depending on the method used to calculate volumeweighted asps and volumeweight ed amps specifically this has an impact on whether or not certain drugs meet the 5 threshold cms noted that the oig review was conducted during the in itial implementation phase of the asp methodology it contended that much of the estimated savings id entified in the report did not persist in subsequent quarters and payment limits for many codes have been revised again as it did in response to the february 2006 oig report cited above cms was not proposing to make any imme diate changes to its calculations the oig issued report in june 2006 comparing asps and widely available market prices it analyzed the purchase pr ices for nine procedure codes for oncology drugs13 for five of the nine codes the vol umeweighted asp calculated using the cms methodology exceeded the widely availabl market price by at least 5 for the fourth quarter of 2005 for these codes the difference ranged from 17 to 185 the oig estimated that medicare expenditures could be reduced by as much as 67 million in 2006 if the reimburse ment codes were lowered to the widely available market price for these codes it further noted that the estimates did not take into account price discounts which may be offere d the cms response stated that the report did not note the downward trend in drug prices occurring after the fourth quarter of 2005 however the oig stated th at widely available market prices for four out of the five procedure c odes still exceeded the 5 threshold other issues related to asp several additional issues ve been raised in connection with the asp payment methodology concerns of oncologists as noted earlier payments to physicians for oncology drugs have constituted large portion of medicare outpatient drug spending prior to passage of mma drug payments we re tied to the awp many oncologists recognized that medicare paym ents for drug products were in excess of their actual acquisition costs however they claimed that medicare paid too little for the practice costs associated with administering the oncology drugs they contended that they were forced to use the higher drug payments to offset inadequate reimbursement for practice expenses they also stated that they would object to any changes in the awp calculation unless changes were also made in the practice expense calculation as noted mma revi sed the payment methodology for drugs at the same time it increased the payments for physician practice

oncologis ts continue to voice concerns they have suggested that asp information is tilted toward what large purchasers are able to negotiate directly with manufactures not what individual phy sicians or physician practices can obtain from wholesalers further they note that wholesalers often include markup in their pricing as result they suggest that medicare payments may be insufficient to cover their costs several recent reports suggest that medicare payments are generally adequate the oig issued report in september 2005 which reviewed medicare payments to physician practices for the treatment of cancer patients during the first quarter of 2005 it found that physician practices in the specialties of hematology hematologyoncology and dical oncology could generally purchase drugs for the treatment of cancer patients at less than the mmaestablished reimbursement rates the oig based its conclusion on statistical estimate of average prices paid by physician practices for 39 payment codes that constituted more than 94 of total medicare allowed amounts for drugs associat ed for these specialties in 2004 it also based its conclusion on an estimate of the percentage of months that the practices were able to purchase drugs at less than the reimbursement amount the report noted that regardless of size physicians could ge nerally purchase most but not all drugs within the 39 payment codes at less than the reimbursement amount however large practices were able to purchase drugs at greater discounts for more payment codes than smaller practices15 subsequent june 2006 oig report discussed above found that for five of nine codes for oncology drugs the volumeweighted asp exceeded the widely available market price by at least 5 for the fourth quarter of 2005 medpac issued report in january 2006 based on site visits as well as an analysis of carrier claims for the first six months of 2005 it found that medicare paid less for chemotherapy drugs in 2005 than in

or selecting more profitable patients many oncologists also cited the 2005 quality of life demonstration project fo r ensuring their continued participation in medicare however payments under the demonstration made it difficult for medpac to evaluate the effects of the payment changes16 when cms issued its 2006 third quarter payment amounts in june 2006 it stated that it would continue to

the program was to enable physicians to acquire certain drugs from an approved cap vendor thereb enabling them to reduce the time they spend buying and billing for drugs at the same time it was expected that competition among vendors would re duce prices thereb reducing medicare costs program design under the program competitive acquisition areas would be established throughout the country for purposes of acquis ition and payment for covered drugs and biologicals each year each physician would be given the opportunity either to obtain drugs and biologicals through this program or
