revenue code irc was si lent as to the tax treatment of organizations whose primary purpose is influencing elections the internal revenue service irs treated contributions to political organizations as gifts which meant that the organizations did not have taxable income and were not required to file tax returns by the early 1970s it was apparent that these organizations had sources of income beside s contributions and the irs indicated it would require those with investment and other types of income to file tax returns and pay tax at the corporate rate pl 93635 enacted in 1975 added section 527 to the irc to address the tax treatment of political organizations the section grants taxexempt status to qualifying political organizations this treatment is the focus of this report but it should be noted that section 527 has two other purposes it imposes tax on 501c organizations that make political expenditures 1 and it clarifies that expenditures by political organizations on behalf of an individual are generally not income to the individual g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g347g344g349g561g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 political organizations that qualify under section 527 are taxed only on certain income political organization is any organization including party committee association or fund 2 that is organized and operated primarily to directly or indirectly accept contributions andor make expenditures for an exempt function an exempt function is the influencing or attempting to influence the selection nomination election or appointment of an individual to federal state or local public office to an office in political organization or as presidential or vicepresidential elector 3 an exempt function does not necessarily involve explicitly advocating for or against the individual for example when determining whether an issue advocacy communication is for an exempt function the irs looks at such things as whether it identifies candidate identifies his or her position on the issue and this has been raised to distinguish the candidate from others is timed to coincide with an election targets voters in particular election and is not part of an ongoing series of similar communications by the organization on the same issue4 527 organizations are subject to tax only on political organization taxable income this is the organizations gross income excluding exempt function income less 100 and any allowable deductions exempt function income is any amount received to the extent that it is segregated to use for an exempt function as 1 these organizations are not treated as 527 organizations for purposes of the reporting requirements discussed in this report 2 this includes qualifying newsletter funds irc 527g in order to qualify the fund must be established and maintained 1 by an individual who holds or is candidate for elective public office and 2 for the exclusive use of preparing and circulating the individuals newsletter 3 an exempt function includes making expenditures relating to these offices if the expenses would be allowed as business deduction if incurred by the individual 4 rev rul 20046 20041 cb 328

assessments proceeds which are not received in the ordinary course of business from political fundraising and entertainment events or from the sale of campaign materials and proceeds from conducting bingo game the tax rate is generally the highest corporate income tax rate however under irc 527h income of the principal campaign committee of c ongressional candidate is taxed using the graduated corporate tax rate schedule this is not true for campaign committees of candidates for state or local office 527 organizations include the entities regulated by the federal election campaign act feca as amended by the bipartisan campaign reform act bcra5 for example political parties and candidate committees are 527 organizations however because some 527 organizations are unrelated to federal elections not all 527 organizations are regulated by feca in recent years there has been considerable debate about the extent to which feca regulates certain types of 527 organizations and the constitutional limitations on such regulation for more information see crs report rl33888 section 527 political organizations background and issues for federal election and tax laws by r sam garrett

section 527 without reporting their existence to the fec or the irs this was because not all 527 organizations reported to the fec under feca and organizations only filed return to the irs if they had taxable income the fact that organizations could qualify under section 527 without reporting to the fec was largely unnoticed until 1996 when the irs began issuing guidance on the types of activities that qualify as exempt functions 6 this awareness helped lead to an increase in the number of 527 organizations called stealth pacs that were designed to avoid reporting to the fec in 2000 and 2002 congress amended section 527 to require that organizations report to the irs the fec or state7 g16g152g157g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561 an organization must notify the irs of its 527 status by electronically filing form 8871 within 24 hours of its formation8 the information provided on form 8871 includes the organizations name address and purpose names and addresses of certain employees and directors and name of and relationship to any related entities an organization that fails to timely file the form will not be treated as 527

amendment12 and the requirement to disclose expenditures violated the first and fifth amendments the basis of the district courts decision was that the requirements were part of regulatory campaign finance reform scheme that was subject to higher level of scrutiny than action under congress taxing powers would be the district court then closely examined the requirements and found some to be impermissible for example the district court held that the requirement to disclose expenditures was unconstitutional because congress had not sufficiently tailored the requirement to meet its informational and corruptionrelated goals or established compelling reason to treat political organizations differently than other taxexempt or ganizations the court of appeals held that the disclosure requirements fell within congress power to tax and that the antiinjunction act which requires taxpayers pay tax before disputing it barred the suit
