from ben santer santer1llnlgov to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re fwd re john christys latest ideas date thu 10 jan 2008 120645 0800 replyto santer1llnlgov xflowed dear phil if you get chance could you call up at work 1 925 4233364 to talk about the ijc publication option id really like to discuss that with you with best regards ben phil jones wrote ben almost said something about this in the main email about the diagrams other emails and couple of phone calls distracting have to make sure im sending the right email to the right listperson hes clearly biased but he gets an audience unfortunately there are enough people out there who think were wrong to cause to worry at times id like the world to warm up quicker but if it did i know that the sensitivity is much higher and humanity would be in real mess im getting people misinterpreting my comment that went along with chris follands press release about the 2008 forecast it says were warming at 02 degcdecade and that is exactly what we should be the individual years dont matter ca are now to send out foia requests for the review editor comments on the ar4 chapters for some reason they think they exist cheers phil at 1652 09012008 you wrote dear phil i cant believe john is now arguing that hes the only guy who can provide unbiased assessments of model performance after all the mistakes hes made with msu and after the douglass et fiasco he should have acquired little humility but i guess humility isnt in his dictionary with best regards ben phil jones wrote ben ill give up on trying to catch him on the road to damascus hes beyond redemption glad to see that someones rejected something hes written jim hacks good so im confident he wont be fooled cheers phil at 1728 07012008 you wrote dear phil more christy

preparing reply together with many others who were involved in the first ccsp report to put it bluntly the douglass paper is piece of worthless garbage it has serious statistical flaws christy should be ashamed that hes coauthor on this his letter to dr strayer is deplorable and offensive for over decade christy has portrayed himself as the only guy who is smart enough to develop climatequality data records from msu recently hes also portrayed himself as the only guy whos smart enough to develop climatequality data records from radiosonde data and now hes the only scientist who is capable of performing hardnosed independent assessments of climate model performance john christy has made scientific career out of being wrong hes not even thirdrate scientist id be happy to discuss christys unique ways of validating climate models with you with best regards ben hack james j wrote dear ben happy new year hope all is well i was wondering if youre familiar with the attached paper i thought that you had recently published something that concludes something quite different is that right if yes could you forward copy and any comments are also welcome hes coming to ornl next week to under the premise that he has some unique ways to validate climate models this time with regard to the lower thermodynamic structure id be happy to chat with you about this as well if you would like im appending what i know to the bottom of this note best regards jim james j hack director national center for computational sciences oak ridge national laboratory one bethel valley road po box 2008

october 23 2007 916 am to strayer michael cc salmon jeffrey subject climate model evaluation dr strayer jeff salmon is aware of project we at uahuntsville believe is vital and that you may provide way to see it accomplished as you know our nations energy and climate change policies are being driven by output from global climate models however there has never been true red team assessment of these model projections in the way other government programs are subjected to hardnosed independent evaluations to date most of the evaluation of these models has been left in the hands of the climate modelers themselves this has the potential of biasing the entire process it is often climate modelers claim and promoted in ipcc documents see attached that the models must be correct because the global surface temperature variations since 1850 are reproduced somewhat by the models when run in hindcast mode however this is not scientific experiment for the simple reason that every climate modeler saw the answer ahead of time it is terribly easy to get the right answer for the wrong reason especially if you already know the answer legitimate experiment is to test the models output against variables to which modelers did not have access true blind test of the models i have proposed and have had rejected model evaluation project to doe based on the utilization of global datasets we build here at uah we have published many of these datasets most are satellitebased which document the complexity of the climate system and which we think models should replicate in some way and to aid in model development where shortcomings are found these are datasets of quantities that modelers in general were not aware of when doing model testing we have performed few of these tests and have found models reveal serious shortcomings in some of the most fundamental aspects of energy distribution we believe rigorous test of climate models is in order as the congress starts considering energy reduction strategies which can have significant consequences on our economy below is an abstract of retooled proposal i am working on if you see possible avenue for research along these lines please let know too we have been considering some type of partnership with oakridge since the facility is nearby and this may be way to do that john c understanding the vertical energy distribution of the earths atmosphere and its expression in global climate model simulations john r christy pi university of alabama in huntsville abstract sets of independent observations indicate unexpectedly that the warming of the tropical atmosphere since 1978 is proceeding at rate much less than that anticipated from climate model simulations specifically while the surface has warmed the lower troposphere has experienced less warming in contrast all climate models we and others have examined indicate the lower tropical atmosphere should be warming at rate 12 to 15 times greater than the surface when forced with increasing greenhouse gases within the context of other observed forcings the socalled negative lapse rate feedback we propose to diagnose this curious phenomenon with several satellitebased datasets to document its relation to other climate variables we shall do the same for climate model output of the same simulated variables this will enable us to propose an integrated conceptual framework of the phenomenon for further testing tied in with this research are potential answers to fundamental questions such as the following 1 in response to increasing surface temperatures is the lower atmosphere reconfiguring the way heat energy is transported which allows for an increasing amount of heat to more freely escape to space 2 could there be natural thermostatic effect in the climate system which acts in different way than parameterized convectiveadjustment schemes dependent upon current assumptions of heat deposition and retention 3 if observed atmospheric heat retention is considerably less than model projections what impact will lower retention rates have on anticipated increases in surface temperatures in the 21st century benjamin d santer program for climate model
