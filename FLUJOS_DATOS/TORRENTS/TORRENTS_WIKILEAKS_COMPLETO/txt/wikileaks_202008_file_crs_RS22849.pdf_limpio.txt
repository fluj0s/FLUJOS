medicaid costs by making payments to service providers eg for beneficiaries doctor visits and performing administrative activities eg making eligibility determinations1 they then submit quarterly expense reports in order to receive federal reimbursement for share of these costs2 the federal share for medicaid administrative costs does not vary by state and is generally 503 the federal share for most medicaid service costs is determined by the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which is based on formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average and vice versa4 fmaps have statutory minimum of 50 and maximum of 83 some medicaid services receive higher federal match including those provided through an indian health service facility to certain women with breast or cervical cancer for family planning or under the qualifying individuals qi program that pays medicare part b premiums on behalf of certain medicaid beneficiaries5 exceptions to the fmap formula have been made for certain states and situations for example the district of columbias medicaid fmap is set in statute at 70 and the territories puerto rico american samoa the northern mariana islands guam and the virgin islands have fmaps set at 50 under the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 pl 10827 all states received temporary increase in medicaid fmaps for the last two quarters of fy2003 and the first three quarters of fy2004 as part of fiscal relief package in addition the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 allowed an increase in the federal share for certain medicaid and state childrens health insurance program schip costs in the wake of hurricane katrina one goal of the fmap formula is to narrow differences in states ability to fund medicaid services defined in some studies as states total taxable resources specific measure produced by the us department of treasury relative to its number of lowincome people although the government accountability office gao and others have found that it does not always do so 6 primary obstacle to altering the fmap formula is the potential creation of winners and losers among states that fare well under the current system and those that would do better under another in fy2006 medicaid spending on services and administrative activities in the 50 states and the district of columbia totaled 314 billion with federal share of 179 billion and state share of 135 billion 7 as with overall health care spending medicaid is expected to consume growing 1 in general medicaid pays for care only when all other thirdparty resources eg private health insurance medicare personal injury settlements have met their legal obligation to do so 2 these quarterly expense reports are also used to repay the federal share when state recovers some of its medicaid costs eg from health insurer in cases where medicaid beneficiary also has private coverage or from the estate of deceased beneficiary who received certain longterm care servic or discovers that it has overpaid service provider 3 crs report rs22101 state medicaid program administration brief overview by

for medicaid are largely determined by the states which generally receive openended funding as long as they operate their programs in compliance with federal law exceptions for which federal funding is capped include the territories disproportionate share hospital dsh payments made to hospitals serv ing large number of medicaid or lowincome patients the qi program mentioned earlier and wa ivers that allow states to operate outside of normal federal rules which are subject to aggregate budget caps or costperbeneficiary caps 9 the annual appropriations process also provides an opportunity for congress to place limitations on specified activities including the circumstances under which federal funds can be used to pay for abortions unlike medicare and social security federal funding for medicaid comes entirely from general revenues rather than dedicated account or trust fund within the us treasury it represents growing portion of the federal budget having increased from 2 of federal outlays in fy1975 to an estimated 7 in fy2008 10 g21g157g138g157g142g561g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 states generally control their own medicaid spending levels by altering eligibility covered services costsharing and premiums paid by beneficiaries provider reimbursement rates and other aspects of the program within broad federal guidelines 11 funding for the nonfederal ie state share of medicaid costs comes from variety of sources but at least 40 must be financed by the state and up to 60 may come from local governments in state fiscal year sfy 2006 states reported that about 80 of the nonfederal share of their medicaid costs was financed by state general funds most of which are raised from personal income sales and corporate income continued october 2007 excludes 2 billion in federal medicaid spending on the vaccines for children program which does not require state share and is not limited to children enrolled in medicaid 8 for example see congressional budget office the longterm outlook for health care spending november 2007 at httpwwwcbogovftpdocs8 7xxdoc87581113lthealthpdf 9 in addition some states have chosen to expand their medicaid programs using capped federal allotments for schip however this does not affect the openended nature of federal funding for medicaid once these states have exhausted their schip allotments they revert to using medicaid funds see

for this population was shifted from medicaid to medicare part d in 2006 states are still required to make clawback payments that are based on their historical medicaid prescription drug spending

local funds provider taxes fees donations and assessments and tobacco settlement funds12 although financing for the medicaid program is shared responsibility gao and others have reported on mechanisms used by states to inappropriately increase their federal share13 for example state with 50 fmap might make 10 million payment to hospital that returns 9 million to the state netting 1 million for the hospital and 4 million for the state at the expense of the federal government 14 limits have been placed on these financing mechanisms over the years primarily through changes to dsh and upper payment limit upl rules that allow states to make supplemental payments to certain providers as well as intergovernmental transfer igt and provider tax and donation rules that allow them to collect revenues from providers medicaid is the largest or secondlargest item in state budgets depending on how it is measured looking at sfy2006 expenditures from all revenue sources including federal funds medicaid made up the largest share 215 closely followed by elementary and secondary education 214 looking only at sfy2006 expenditures from state revenue sources general other state and bond funds elementary and secondary education made up the largest share 249 followed by medicaid 13015 statefunded medicaid spending as share of statefunded total spending has more than doubled since sfy1989 when it was 63 with major growth in the early 1990s fueled by an economic downturn high growth in medical costs and the use of financing mechanisms described earlier that can effectively recycle federal funds into state funds 16 g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 number of controversial regulations affecting medicaid financing and federal funding have been proposed or finalized recently including some that would 17 restrict the use of igts between state governments and public providers for purposes of medicaid as well as upl payments
