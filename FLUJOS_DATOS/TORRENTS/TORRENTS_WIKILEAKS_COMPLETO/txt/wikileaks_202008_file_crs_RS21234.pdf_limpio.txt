government corporation that finances federal farm price and income support programs and agricultural export and food aid programs the africa seeds of hope act allows the tr ust to hold funds as well as commodities but funds have ever been held uses the statute authorizes two uses for the trust first the secretary of agriculture has authority to release up to 500000 metric tons of ligible commodities for urgent humanitarian relief in the case of unan ticipated food needs in developing countries and to release an additional 500000 metric tons of eligible commodities that could have been but were not released in previous years second the secretary has authority to release commodities from the reserve when sh determines that us domestic supplies are so limited that commodities cannot be made available fo r regular programming in pl 480 foreign food aid programs2 exchange of commodities commodity in the trust may be exchanged for another us commodity of equal value in fy2002 wheat released from the trust was sold and the proceeds used to purchase corn vegetable oil and dry beans for distribution in southern africa reimbursement commodities in the emerson trust are held as assets of the commodity credit corporation ccc3 when commodities are released from the trust the ccc incurs loss the value of the assets it longer holds the trust is subsequently reimbursed for the commodities re leased with transfer of funds from pl 480 the 1998 act provides that the ccc be reimbursed by pl 480 for the commodity costs of release for unanticipated needs based on the lesser of 1 the actual costs incurred or 2 the export market price as dete rmined by the secretary at the time of the release reimbursement to the ccc for th cost of ocean freight and other non commodity costs occurs through the regula r usda appropriations process in which usda requests budget authority to cover th costs in annual budget submissions reimbursement for release of commodities for unanticipated needs can be made from past current or subsequent unobligated p l 480 funds commodities released for use in pl 480 programs when supplies are short are paid for from current fiscal year pl 480 funds replenishment current law does not require replenishment of commodities released from the trust but does provide for ways to do it the secretary of agriculture may acquire commodities through purchases from producers or in the market if the secretary determines that ch purchases will not unduly disrupt the market funds for such purchases must be authorized in an appropriation act the secretary may also replenish the trust by designation to the trust of commodities already owned by the ccc httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21234crs3 history 19802003 origins of the trust during the 1970s congress debated the creation of either permanent governmentheld stock of grain or fund to promote global food security advocates of grain reserve argued that it would provide buffer to the vagaries of agricultural production ensuring grain av ailability regardless of domestic supply conditions in case of urgent need they ar gued in addition that reserve would serve as surplus disposal mechanism in time s of excess production thereby strengthening farm prices supporters of fund on the other hand contended that dollar resources would provide more flexibility in meeting urgent needs and that factors other than food shortages such as transportation or high commodity costs were more likely to impede the delivery of food to needy people in emergency situations reserve of funds also would not have the potential pricedepressing effect that release of commodities could have events overtook this debate in 1979 when the soviet union invaded afghanistan prompting the carter administration to embargo all us grain shipments to the ussr to prevent loss of revenue to exporters and adverse impacts on domestic commodity prices which might have resulted from the embargo the ccc offered to purchase from us suppliers grain previously committed to th soviet union through this process the ccc acquired 4 million metric tons of wheat with which to establish grain reserve the food security wheat reserve act of 1980 title iii of pl 96 494 codified this move as means of guaranteeing s upply of wheat in times of tight supplies or unanticipated need the act allowed wheat fro m the reserve to be used in the pl 480 program if wheat were unavailable thr ough normal channels the 1980 act also authorized the release of up to 300000 metric tons to meet urgent humanitarian need in foreign countries without consideration of domestic supply cond itions or additional congressional ppropriations the 1996 farm bill pl 104127 transfor med the wheat reserve into the fscr which was still reserve of up to 4 million metric tons but included corn sorghum and rice in the reserve along with wheat the criteria which would trigger release of stocks from the fscr were the same as for the pr edecessor wheat reserveunanticipated urgent humanitarian need or short domestic supp lies the 1996 legislation increased from 300000 tons to 500000 tons the amount of commod ities that could be released through the pl 480 title ii donations program each fiscal year to meet unanticipated needs without regard to the domestic supply situati on further the 1996 act allowed the release of up to an additional 500000 tons of eligible commodities that could have been released but were not in previous years for use under title ii of pl 480 to provide urgent humanitarian relief reimbursement requirements remained the same as in the earlier statute while the 1980 act required that th reserve be replenished 18 months after stocks had been released the 1996 act omitte d deadline by which the reserve must be replenished the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 contains th current legislative authority for the emerson trust as established in the 1998 africa seeds of hope act pl 107171 extends the trust

african countries during the famine of the mid1980s in october 1988 15 million tons were authorized to meet pl 480 programming requirements because th us drought of 1988 had reduced commercial wheat

source us department of agriculture office of budget and program analysis the short supply determination section 401 of pl 480 provides that the secretary of agriculture make determination of the agricultural commodities and quantities available for use in food aid progra ms the section further provides that commodity shall be made ava ilable to pl 480 programs if so doing would reduce the domestic supply of the commodity below what is needed to meet domestic requirements and to provide ad equate carryover as an example usda in fy1996 estimate d that 18 million metric tons of wheat and wheat products would be available for pl 480 from domestic supplies however as the marketing year progressed usda re vised its initial dete rmination based on its assessment that the size of the wheat crop would be lower than expected and that commercial export demand would be strong in january of 1996 wheat prices rose to 483 per bushel stocks for the 1996 wheat marketing year were estimated at 452 million bushels with stockstouse ratio of just under 20 percent the usdas revised supply and demand ssessment concluded that onl 300000 metric tons of wheat would be available from domestic supplies and led the secretary to request presidential authority to release up to 15 million metric tons of wheat from the fswr during fy1996 for pl 480 programming use of the trust 2002 and 2003 the secretary of agriculture announced releases from the trust of 275000 tons of wheat on june 10 2002 and 300000 tons of wheat on august 28 2002 the wheat from the re serve was exchanged for an equal value of corn beans and vegetable oil for use in humanitarian relief in southern africa in fy2003 the secretary has announced releases of 200000 tons for emergency food needs in the horn of africa and 600000 tons for emergency needs in iraq of the 600000 tons released for iraq 200000 will be made imme diately available and 400000 tons will be made available as needed portion of the wheat released was to have been exchangedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21234crs6 for rice however concerns about the potential pricedepre ssing effect of selling wheat and provision of the wartime supplemental appropriations act prohibiting exchanges in fy2003 precluded such sales with these announced releases an estimated 11 million metric tons remain in the trust experience with reimbursement and replenishment the first release from the trust in fy1985 of 300000 metric tons of wheat to meet unanticipated need was reimbursed with 45 million of unobligated fy1987 pl 480 title i and t itle ii appropriations reimbursement was based on the export price of wheat at the time the commodities were released that is in fy 1985 in fy1991 the reserve was used again to meet urgent humanitarian need and was reimbursed from title i appropriations unobligated at the end of fy1991 the reserve was tapped again in fy1994 to meet unanticipated need the ccc was reimbursed 28 million consisting of 154 million in prior year unobligated balances in th title i credit account 23 million in unobligated fy1995 funds in the title i credit account and 103 million in prior year unobligated balances in the title i ocean freight di fferential account when commodities were released for reasons of short supply current year pl 480 appropriations were used to reimburse the ccc for the wheat released of the two ways to replenish the trust after commodities have been released ie purchase or designation of stocks already in ccc inventories only the latter has been used until now following the first rel ease of wheat from the reserve in fy1985 an equivalent quantity of wheat owned by the ccc was designated by the secretary as replenishment for the wheat sent to subsaharan africa in the preceding year policy at this time was essentia lly to replace any drawdown of the reserve immediately by available ccc inventory this was possible because ccc held large stocks of wheat and with such large inventory usda officials felt need to identify wheat in the reserve separately from other cccowned stocks in 1988 however ccc changed its policy regarding separate designation of wheat for the fswr and entered into longterm contracts with commerc ial warehousemen with the contracts specifically designating the wheat as part of the reserve the longterm contracts saved annual storage costs because ccc was able to nego tiate lower storage terms in 1990 usda announced that the ccc would designate all uncommitted ccc owned wheat to the food security wheat re serve at that time 60 million bushels of wheat remained in the reserve because of releases for short supply in 1988 and 1989 ccc designated enough wheat for the reserve to restore it to its full 147 million bushels or 4 million metric ton maximu m by march 1991 the reserv was not replenished for its drawdown in 1994 the 1996 release also was not replenished with respect to releases from the trust in fy2002 and fy2003 the emergency wartime supplemental appr opriations act of 2003 pl 10811 hr 1559 provides 69 million to acquire quantity of commodities fo r use in administering the trust this appropriation will enable the fi rst replenishment of the trust since 1990 and the first time that congress has appropriate d funds for that purpose because of large needs for humanitarian food aid in africa and iraq in fy2003 reimbursement of the trust is likely to be postponed to subsequent fiscal years
