preparation of us military forces for stability missions major subset of which is p eace operations november 28 2005 departme nt of defense dod directive that designates stability operations as core missions of the us military marks major shift in attitudes regarding peacekeeping nd related stability ope rations also known as stabilization and reconstruction opera tions since then dod has worked to define specific changes that must be made to better accomplish such missions some of which the us military could implement on its own while others would require congressional approval for well over decade some members of congress expressed reservations about us military involvement in peacekeeping operations the bush administration initially opposed such missions and took steps to reduce the commitment of us troops to internationa l peacekeeping this action reflected major concern of the 1990s that peacekeeping duties d overtaxed the shrinking us military force and were detrimental to military readiness ie the ability of us troops to defend the nation many pe rceived these tasks as an inefficient use of us forces better left to other nations while the us military concentrated on operations requiring highintensity combat skills others thought that the united states should adjust force size and structure to accommodate the missions the events of september 11 2001 brought new concerns to the fore and highlighted the value to us national security of ensuring stability around the world the 911 commission report which cited afgh anistan as sanctuary for terrorists pointed to the dangers of allowing actual and potential terrorist sanctuaries to exist in 2003 the usled occupation of iraq of ten referred to as stabilization and reconstruction operation which manifests some characteristics of peace operation reinforced the argument thousands of us military pers onnel currently serve in or support peacekeeping operations although the number of troops rving in operations has decreased dramatically since the mid1990s to some 26 in five operations under control in the balkans some 1700 us troops serve with the nato kosova force kfor about 35000 more serve in or support peacek eeping operations in south korea and roughly 700 serve in the sinai in iraq and afghanistan us troops are involved in variety of stability tasks including nationbuilding activities that have been undertaken in some peacekeeping operati ons as well as combat operations major issue congress continues to face is what if any adjustments should be made in order for the us military to perform peacekeeping and stability missions in afghanistan iraq or elsewhere with less strain on the force particularly the reserves of particular interest is whethe r the size and configuration of us forces especially the army should be further m odified additional issues are whether to augment civilian and international capabilities in order to take on more of the

involved in deploying us military pers onnel to conduct peacekeeping missions this broad generic term is most generally used to denote missions to maintain peace and establish the basis for representative g overnance and economic growth since the first us troops were deployed to post cold war peacekeeping missions in the early 1990s congressional debate has ranged from the broa d strategic question how and when do such operations serve us interests to myriad of practical questions that has evolved over time see table 1 at the end of this report for breakdown of the department of defense dod incremental cost of peacekeeping and security contingency operations fy1991 to fy2005 for the 110th congress the most salient practical issues focus on two central questions how are us forces to be best prepared to undertake such missions and what part of the responsibility should they bear for such missions the bush administration has launched several initiatives intended to equip the united states to conduct peacekeeping and related postc onflict operations such as the occupation of iraq in 2003 more efficiently and effectively most importantly for the us military on november 28 2005 the department of defense dod issued directive setting forth new dod policy regarding stability operations particularly peacekeeping nd related postconf lict operations dod is developing recommendations that are likely to beco the center of congressional debate shortly this report will provide background info rmation on the development of us military involvement in peacekeeping and re

directive as well as proposed reforms and legislation pertaining to it these issues involve practical questions such as how shoul d the us armed forces be resized reorganized educated traine d and

washington dc ndu press 1995 pp 1819 the evolution of us military involvement in peacekeeping operations2 the 1990s was the first decade in nearly half century in which the us military was deployed on missions that invol ved the reconstructi on of governments infrastructure and economies after quelling the chaos of internecine conflicts the postworld war ii occupations in germany japan italy and austria were the most prominent and successful midcentury pr ecedents before that us military troops were active in attempts to install more democratic governments in the phillippines central america and the caribbean in the last years of the 19th and early years of the 20th century the most recent round of such activity began soon after the end of the cold war in 1989 with rise in th number of intras tate conflicts such peacekeeping missions require limita tions on the use of force by combat forces as well as the assignment of num erous personnel to provi security and to carry out political and econo mic activities to construc t or reconstruct state institutions these requirements have been problematic for many policymakers and for the us armed forces which have prefe rred to confront an enemy with the degree of force necessary to quickly defeat arme d opponents often referred to as decisive or overwhelming force and to reserv its highlyskilled troops for combat missions nevertheless in the postcold war years of the 1990s peacekeeping and related limited force operations became staple of us military forces particularly the us army during the 1990s the united states took leading role in four large multinational operations with peacekeep ing phases under us or nato and auspices somalia haiti bosnia all unde r mandates and kosovo at the same time it provided va rying degrees of

unified task force or unitaf with 25800 us troops at peak and over 10000 from other countries was launc hed in december 1992 as humanitarian aid mission to provide protection for re lief workers and food convoys it was preceded by smaller us humanitarian relief mission from augustdecember 1992 nevertheless contin gents from other countries were active in community development projects such as rebuilding schools building roads and repairing irrigation canals and tube wells and the australians canadians and french worked hard to revive broad community l eadership encouraging the creation of local councils and somali police units3 informal political development at the local level and the repair and rebuilding of physical infrastructure including road and bridge building welldigging and the establis hment of schools and hospitals became facto unitaf tasks although the participa tion of us military personnel in such activities appears to have b een limited us military pers onnel were involved however in the development of somalia police force even though that was never officially unitaf function4 the usled somalia operation was rned over in may 1993 to the smaller unosom ii force with an author ized strength of 28000 military personnel but which operated for the most part with fewer unosom ii included some 2800 civilian staff and had broad mandate to build new local regional and national political and administrative institutions so 3000 us soldiers served in the mission primarily providing logistic s support another 17700 in separate operation under us command supported

soldiers some 2400 were assigned initially to the 6000man unmih force us military experiences in somalia and haiti stigmatized peacekeeping and nationbuilding for many members as an inefficient and inappropriate use of military resources leading to restrictions on us involvement in dealin g with deteriorating conditions in the balkans in the mid1990s us involvement in that region began in 1992 when the united states contributed relatively small number of troops about 1000 of the 38000soldier protection fo rce unprofor that was deployed in february to croatia and in june to bosniaherzegovina the united states took leading role however in nato ai r operations which supported the unprofor to quell the conflict that accompanied th 1991 breakup of yugoslavia as well as related air drops of humanitarian relie f the nato air operations provided unprofor with information collected by reconnaissance aircraft supervised established nofly zones and supporte d unprofor troops when they came

11 2006 new world order would provide the oppor tunity for the spread of freedom and democracy instead the number of intrastate conflicts rose as weakened autocrats faced challengers who perceived new po ssibilities to achieve power often with assistance from neighboring states and influe nces many argued that the prospects for global instability and humanitarian concerns demanded an international military response to such conflict with us par ticipation or leadersh ip to forestall the immeasurable but often noneth eless substantial human so cial and economic costs of instability and conflict6 they argued that the us should be willing to commit forces to prevent abuses of power and to support other peoples struggles for freedom others argued that instability in many other countries did not meet the test of threat to us vital interests which was the threshold for many policymakers for the use of us force7 the terrorist acts against the united st ates of september 11 2001 changed the debate it illustrated for many policymakers and analysts the dangers of allowing instability to fester and conflicts to go unchecked even in areas of minimal or strategic or economic intere st while there is not universal consensus around the argument that international terrorists will find safe haven in weak and failed states there are powerful examples the percep tion that they may do so has convinced many policymakers of the need to enhance the ability including the military capacity of the united states and other countries to deal with instability and conflict8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33557crs6 9 for some analysts there is virtually difference between peace enforcement operations and lowintensity conflict save the existence of peace plan or agreement that has degree of local consentevolving terminology and definitional problems over the past decade and half there has been an evolution in the vocabulary used to refer to activities that are undert aken to maintain enforce promote and enhance the possibilities for peace in unsta ble environments peacekeeping has been the traditional generic term for the operations undertaken for those purposes by the united nations and other international organizations and sometimes ad hoc coalitions of nations or indi vidual nations more recently in an attempt to capture the ambiguity and complexity of such ope rations and perhaps also to avoid the stigma of failure attached to peacekeeping they have become known as stabilization and reconstruction sr operations or more simply stability operations use of any term with the word peace creat ed semantic dile mma conveying the misleading impression that an operation is without risk when in fact peacekeeping operations can place soldiers in hostile s ituations resembling war as knowledge increased about the conditions needed to establish peace operations increasingly included extensive nationbuilding or statebuilding as some prefer to call it components to build or reform government structures the term peacekeeping gained curre ncy in the late 1950s when peacekeeping mostly fit narrow definition providing an interpositional force to supervise the keeping of ceasefire or peace accord that parties in conflict had signed but it continued to be used as th range of activities grew in 1992 the began to use broader terminology to describe the different types of activities in securing and keeping peace it created the term peace enforcement to describe operations in unstable situations where peacekeepers are allowed to use force to maintain peace because of greater possibility of conflict or threat to their safety9 peacebuilding was adopted as term for activities that are designed to prevent the resumption or spread of conflict including disarmament and demobilization of warring parties repatriati on of refugees reform and strengthening of government institutions including recreating police or civil defense forces electionmonitoring and promotion of political participation and human rights organizing and providing security for humanitarian relief efforts can be part of peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations the nato and ad hoc coalition missions that the united states participated in with signifi cant forces in the early 1990s bosnia haiti somalia were generally referred to by the generic term of peacekeeping by congress even though us executive bran ch agencies replaced peacekeeping with peace operations as the generic term recently such operations have been referred to by an army doctrinal term stability operations that also encompasses the diverse missions of operations in afghanistan and iraq this may be more precise term for such operations as many include not only peace operations ie peacekeeping and peace enforcement but also related missions such as humanitarian and civic assistan ce counterterrorism counterdrug and counterinsur gency ie foreign internal defense efforts all ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33557crs7 10 the other types of operations are security assistance support to insurgencies noncombatant evacuations arms control and show s of force for further information on the activities which fall under each of these types of operations see army field manual fm 307 stability operations and support operations february 2003which also are included under th term stability operations10 stability operations are sometimes referred to as phase iv or postconflict operations although reoccurrences of conflic t are often possible in the wake of us military action in iraq the question of continued us military involvement has been framed in terms of whether the us military should do nationbuilding and if it does how it should prepare for it like peacekeeping nationbuilding is not precise term but ra ther one that is used for both concept and variety of activities on one level nationbuilding is used to refer to the concept of creating or decision to create democratic state often in post conflict situation the term is also use d however to refer to any of the range of activities that militaries or ci vilians undertake to advance that goal 2003 rand report americas role in nationbuilding from germany to iraq uses the term to encompass the full range of activities undert aken by the united states including by its military forces in operations that have been variously known as an occupation peacekeeping peace enforcement and sr as most often used when referring to the us military nationbuilding refers to range of activities to assist civilians beyond providing security and humanitarian aid in emergency situations these can include projects such as the repair maintenance or constructi on of economic infrastructure including roads schools electric grids and heavy indus trial facilities and of health infrastructure such as clinics and hospitals and water and sewage facilities they can also include the provision of variety of services such as medical services to refugee and impoverished populations and training nd assistance to police the military the judiciary and prison officials as well as other civil administrators the november 2005 dod stability operations directive cites the specific tasks of rebuilding indigenous institutions incl uding various types of security forces correctional facilities and judicial systems necessary to stabilize situation reviving or building the private sector including bottomup economic activity and constructing necessary infrastructure nd developing representative government institutions as among those tasks that are performed in stability operations these tasks are also part of the continuum of ac tivities that fall under th term stabilization and reconstruction sr wh ich also has been used to describe these complex operations current us military participation in peacekeeping and related stability missions the level of us military participation in peacekeeping is much reduced from the 1990s if the occupation force in iraq is excluded still thousands of us military pers onnel participate fu lltime in variety of activities that fall under the rubric of peacekeeping operations most endorsed by the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33557crs8 11 while the reduction in us troops involved in peacekeeping especially peacekeeping from the early 1990s responded to perceptions that peacekeeping excessively strained us forces without si gnificantly serving us interest s some analysts continue to argue that greater participation of us fo rces in peacekeeping would be desirable in june 2005 the congressionallymandated task force on the chaired by former speaker of the house newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george mitchell called for greater us support of opera tions the task force report recommended that member states should substantially incr ease the number of trained and equipped forces for rapid deployment for peace operations nd that the department of defense should prepare options for additional means to support peace operations with logistics capacitybuilding assistance and other means and for us engagement in peace operations

provincial reconstruction teams prts in iraq such as it established in afghanistan dod directive 300005 mandates background and related legislation in the wake of the coalition invasion of iraq the debate over the appropriate role for the united states military in activities encompassed by the term peacekeeping has again moved to the forefront although th current military occupation of iraq falls in gray area that defies easy definition with level of instability that many define as lowintensity conflict ra ther than peace enforcement many of the activities that the us military s undertaken there also have been undertaken in past peacekeeping operations critics of the bush administration have charged that its disdain for peacekeeping has led it to ignore the lessons of past operations and to err in its judgment of the number and type of forces necessary in iraq putting the united states and its allies at risk of losing th peace there yet the situation in iraq appears to have prompted the two defense science board dsb studies20 that constitute the foundation fo r department of defe nse dod directive 300005 dod directive 300005 sets forth radi cally new policy regarding missions known as stability operations major subs et of which are peacekeeping and other peace operations the directive on milita ry support for stability security transition and reconstruction sstr operations designates stability operations as core us military mission by elevatin g stability missions to the same priority level as combat missions dod seems to acknowledge expectations that future operations will regularly include missions to stabilize areas during transitions from war to peace and to assist with reconstruc tion during those transitions for several years some military officers and defense analysts have argued that such efforts required the systematic devel opment of doctrine training education exercises and planning capabilities to enable the armed forces to perform those operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33557crs12 21 the increased frequency of operations optempo demanded by peacekeeping operations in the 1990s took time from necessary maintenance repairs and combat training the problem of frequent deployments of individuals perstempo was particularly severe for the army for several years the army was deploying the same units over and over to peacekeeping operations and the pace of ployment was viewed as too demanding affecting morale by keeping personnel away from families for too long nd some argue affecting recruitment in one of the first publiclyavailable studies of peacekeeping stresses in march 1995 the gao reported gaonsiad9551 that increased deployments due to peacekeeping together with reduced force stru cture

by deployments to iraqproficiently as well as the reconfigur ation and acquisition of organizations personnel facilities and materiél to support them the directive catalogues such needs and calls for the development of specific recommendations to fulfill them two more recent documents make men tion of any further steps to enhance dod capabilities for such operations the dod february 6 2006 quadrennial defense review report qdr the docum ent in which senior dod civilian and military leaders identify the capabilities and resources needed to carry out comprehensive defense strategy did not speci fically address the issue of postconflict operations dod officials stat privately however that proposals regarding these types of operations are being considered under the category of irregular warfare because of problems arriving at consensus on the appropriate terminology for categorizing them the march 2006 nationa l security strategy mentions the development of us civilian and international military capabilities to carry out post conflict operations but does not mention augmenting us military capabilities the us military particularly the army has made many adjustments over the past several years to enable troops to perform more effectively in p eacekeeping operations in places such as bosnia and kosovo21 nevertheless events in iraq since the united states invaded in 2003 have reinfo rced arguments that still greater efforts must be made to raise the possibilities for successful transitions the directive provides the basis for instituting significant changes and dedicating substantial resources to prepare troops to perform pr oficiently in such missions although the eventual effect on armed services is not known the directive calls for changes in wide variety of areas some of which could be implemented in short order others of which would take considerable time dod is beginning to develop specific propos als to implement directive 300005 there are still areas where the directive lays out policy but dod currently is unsure of the steps that it will take to implement it dod may brin g to congress during 2006 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33557crs13 22 critics were disturbed by declines in ratin gs which measured combat readiness in the 1990s there were variety of reasons for thes declines some of which were addressed by changes in military practices 1 military pers onnel could not practice all their combat skills while engaged in peacekeeping operations 2 in the 1990s the us military performed these operations at the same time the armed forces particularly the army were reduced substantially 3 funds for training and equipment were diverted in the past to fund peacekeeping operations and 4 units were disr upted by the deployment of an individual or small number of individuals if one look ed at the larger readiness problem of the 1990s and early 2000s that is the perception that us military personnel were overworked that military equipment was in poor shape that spare parts were in short s upply and that the military could not recruit and retain needed personnel the relationship of peacekeeping to readiness was less pronounced according to some analysts some have argued that the readiness problem was exaggerated or nonexistent given the successful combat performances of us troops in afghanistan in 2001 and in iraq in 20032007 several requests for changes in laws authorities and regu lations necessary to implement the directive and the qdr as well as for additional funding the house armed services committee hasc in its report accompanying the fy2007 dod authorization act hr 5122 hrept 109452 noted that it was pleased that dod had issued the direc tive and stated its belief that dod s hould integrate to the

the agency for international development or related orga nizations including nong overnmental organizations and any reorganization that will be required to implement the directive improving military capabilities the directive states that the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness should identify the personnel and training needed for stability operations and evaluate dod progress in developing those forces and training it does not provide specific recommendations regardin g the size and structure and specific capabilities needed for stability operations but does call for the incorporation of stability operations instruction at all levels of education and training force size and structure whether us military forces should be sized and organized specifically to facilitate peacek eeping and related st ability operations has been longstanding issue since the 1990s many members have questioned whether us military forces could maintain their readiness to perform their core war fighting mission if they engaged extensively in other activities22 the size of the force and the numbers of troops devoted to specific tasks have been recognized as two key factors in the militarys ability to perform peacekeeping and related stability operations while retaining its preparedness to fight wars also important are thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33557crs14 23 the september

peacekeeping and related stability operations ie civil affairs officers foreign area specialists military police engineers and psychological operations personnel as men tioned above but further changes in size or structure23 others have urged more extensive changes in the force to better accommodate such missions the army has long rejected proposals for dedicated p eacekeeping forces primarily on the grounds that they would divert resources from combat func tions for information on proposals for dedicating forces to peacekeeping and related operations see crs report rs22473 peacekeeping and related stability opera tions proposals for army force structure changes any recommendations regarding force size and structure for stability operations are likely to provoke intensiv debate proposals to add troops are controversial in large part because the basic cost of each added soldier is high and increases in troop strength involve either additional costs or tradeoffs with ot her military requirements particularly modernizing equi pment and weapons systems in the mid to late 1990s some policymakers and military expert s suggested that 520000 to 540000 troops would be more appropriate size for the army if it were to prevail in the scenario involving two major theater wars which was then the standard for sizing force structure and also to engage in peacekeeping missions for the 14 years after the end of the vietnam war in 1975 through the end of the cold war in 1989 the army had averaged some 778000 with fluctuations the extent to which additional military us forces are needed for such roles may depend heavily on what other capabilities are developed for such operations including civilians and foreign military forces httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33557crs15 24 the 911 commission report op cit p 367stability operations curricula and training the directive calls on dod to ensure that military schools and traini ng centers incorporate stability operations curricula in joint and individual service edu cation and training prog rams at all levels it particularly calls for veloping and incorporating in struction for foreign language capabilities and regional area expertise including longterm immersion in foreign societies it would also broaden the exposure of military pers onnel to us and international civilians with whom they would work in stability operations by providing them with tours of duty in other us agencies international organizations and nongovernmental organizations apportioning responsibilities establishing security in postconflict environment is indisputably military responsibility but assigning specific responsibility for the statebuilding tasks is problematic some policymakers and military officials have long believed that nationbuilding is an inefficient and inappropriate use of military force nevertheless some policymakers and analysts assert the need for military involvement in such tasks particularly when others are not available to undertake them in the immediate aftermath of major combat nationbuilding tasks are often viewed as essential elements in stabilizing post conflict situations because they provide the physical and organizational infrastructure populations need to help reestablish norma l lives such activities are also viewed as enhancing the legitimacy and extending the presence of weak central governments as they try to assert control in such situ ations and as reassuring local populations of the friendly intent of foreign military fo rces sometimes involvement in such activities may enable armed fo rces to make more info rmed judgments about the security situation in an area some analysts view us military nationbuilding as an essential element in the us toolkit to respond to the congre ssionallymandated 911 commissions recommendation to use all ements of national power to keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run 24 in immediate postconflict situations or extremely dangerous environments military forces may be the only personnel ava ilable to perform such tasks in hostile environments armed forces may be needed to provide security for relief workers providing such assistance in less problematic circumstances however some argue that the use of the military for such tasks can be detrimental to humanitarian and reconstruction tasks such critics feel that the use of troops for such purposes can detract from sense of returning normality and establishment of civilian control where military and civilians are delivering assistance in the same areas some civilians feel that the military presence confuses the civilian role and makes them targets of armed opponents because of that many humanitarian groups have objected to the concept of the provincial

to execute such plans26 the followup september 2005 dsb st udy expressed concern that scrs is not getting anywhere near the level of resources and authority needed if dod actions in critical areas
