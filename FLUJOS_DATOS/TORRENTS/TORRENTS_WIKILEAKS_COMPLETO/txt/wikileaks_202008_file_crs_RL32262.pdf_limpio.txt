development summary coalbed methane cbm has rapidly become significant source of natural gas in the united states with growing cons umer demand high natural gas prices and significant political support for velopment the cbm production industry has grown exponentially pending legislation such as the omnibus energy bills s 2095 and hr 6 would provide additional production incentives increased cbm interest has had significant consequences leading to frequent disputes over cbm ownership the adequacy of federal leasing proce ss and federal and local environmental regulation the federal government owns sign ificant amounts of the economically recoverable cbm mineral estate portions of this federally owned resource are however contained within split estates where nonfederal entity owns the rights to the surface estate additionally the fe deral land disposal st atutes that created these split ownership situations did not always retain all mineral rights thus determining if the federal government owns cbm can be complicated issue with significant ramifications even when ow nership is clear development rights may conflict several proposed federal laws including hr 3698 would address many of these issues when the federal government owns cbm it is generally available for leasing under the mineral leasing act of 1920 and th federal onshore oil and gas leasing reform act these laws establish complex decision making process that must be accommodated before drilling of federally owned cbm can take place these laws require several stage planning and decisi on making process which is also subject to the environmental review procedures required by the national environmental policy act recent lawsuits have challenged the adequacy of the blms compliance with federal leasing require ments although the few that have reached decision have found blms practices to be sound environmental impacts attendant to cbm production have received the most widespread attention cb m production results in extr action of large quantities of water by depleting unde rground aquifers cbm producti on could have significant impacts on regional water supplies and stat water rights law would not appear to currently require the safeguards some argu are necessary the disposal of produced water is also controversial it is typi cally of low quality and has recently been held to constitute pollutant that must be re gulated under the clean water act other activities associated with cb m production are equally conten tious in particular the extraction process known as hydraulic fractur ing has been claimed by some to pollute water supplies at least one federal court has held that the process must be regulated under the safe drinking water act alt hough proposed federal legislation would exempt the process from coverage this report will address th major legal issues outlined above as well as the recent cases and pending legislation that may impact cbm development it

is trapped within coal seams and held in place by the pressure of the ground water above it1 until the 1980s cbm was considered little more than haza rdous byproduct of coal mining and was purposefully extracted in order to preven t explosions since cbm development became economically feasible the num ber of producing wells has grown exponentially and most forecasts predict even greater increases the us geological survey estimates that there may be over 700 trillion cubic feet of cbm in the us with more than 100 trillion cubic feet economically recoverable2 natural gas provides 24 of the nations to tal energy supply current market conditions have led to high prices projections indicate that the us will require 50 more natural gas than it currently consumes to meet the increasing demand of the next two decades3 the bush administrations national energy policy and other policy statements emphasize expanding us sources of natural gas including number of recommendations applicable to cbm development and ve cited cbm as the most promising short term supply of natural gas4 to encourage cbm development the bureau of land management blm the ag ency in the department of the interior that supervises mineral leasing and manages many federal lands in the west has streamlined the permit process for new leases similarly pending energy legislation also addresses cbm development

rights to develop it can become complicated issue as various property rights often c onflict also the extraction process has caused concern among environmental protec tion advocates indian tribes and other groups cbm can be captured for use by drilling wells removing the ground water above the coal seam and allowing the meth ane to flow through coal seam fractures to the well this process involves the ex traction of unusually rge amounts of water whether this water should be treated disposed of reinject ed or extracted at all has become the subject of considerable debate this report will provide an overview of the major legal issues surrounding cbm development and will address ownership of cbm the federal leasing process the major environmental laws impacting developm ent and provisions of pending federal legislation relevant to cbm development it will be updated as necessary ownership and development rights cbm development on the federa l public lands is expected to grow in order to encourage more rapid development blm is reducing the processing time for applications for permits to drill certain public lands are generally closed to cbm development however review of land withdrawals is c ontinual and changes always remain possible generally significant tions of federal lands in cbm rich areas remain open to explor ation and development6 split estates where blm owns the surface estate as well as the underlying mineral estate federal leasing laws as well as additional environmental laws apply to leasing and development large tion of cbm developm ent however takes place on split estates where owners of rface rights do not own subsurface mineral rights in these situations those same leasing and environmental laws applicable to the federal government will also apply this ownership arrangement is most often the product of federal land dispos statutes designed to encourage settlement of the west most of these 19th and 20th century laws transferred only surface rights to settlers reserving some or all of the mineral estate to the united states7 ownership of cbm on these lands is controlled by th language of the applicable land

estate11 many other land disposal statutes however retained the entire mineral estate including cbm12 determining the type of min eral ownership can thus be as difficult as it is integral to determining applicable law the current version of the energy bill addresses splitestate issues and calls for report on the impact of split estates on federal oil and gas leases the bill also would require the secretary of the interi or to review current policies relating to management of the federal subsurface il and gas developmen t activities and their effects on the privately owned surface and report to congress any need for legislative or administrative action13 pooling ownership conflicts can also ar ise between different development interests congress has previously attempted to deal with conflicts over cbm ownership by enacting forced pooling legislation14 based on similar state law forced pooling provides mineral developers the option of obtaining pooling order which allows continued development in th face of unclear ownership the federal statute 1 allows any person claiming ownership to develop cbm 2 limits developers liability in the event that it is determined they do not own the cbm and 3 establishes an escrow fund to hold profits until ownershi p is conclusively determined15 the federal statute applies only in affect ed states which are those determined by the secretary of the interior to have limited cbm development due to ownership conflicts16 the list is currently comprised of only kentucky and tennessee andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32262crs4 17 removal

energy bill would reinforce this ability18 priority another frequently recurring conflict involves priority of development between coal and cbm leaseholders often the rights to extract these minerals are held by different parties each of whom wishes to proceed first there are few judicial decisions regarding prior ity of development ri ghts and most often these disputes have been settled by private agreement settling such issues as priority mitigation measures to prevent damage to the other partys mineral reserves and cost allocation for any such measures blm s attempted through lease restrictions to prevent these disputes from occurring typically blm embraces first in time first in right approach based on the applicable lease dates19 when conflicts do arise outside the contemplation of given lease agreement blm policy is to encourage private agreements blm policy also states that the agency should use its leasing authority to pressure uncoop erative parties although its authority in this respect appears to be limited blm ma take steps to encourage swift efficient production and assess certain pena lties such as lease suspension for taking actions harmful to other lessees however blm has stated that its authority and flexibility on these matters is limited by the specific terms and rights contained in applicable leases20 federal legislation to aid in conflict resolution has been introduced several times in previous congresses each with similar provisions21 the process contemplated in these bills would require negotiations between cbm and coal lessees unlike the current system if negotiations failed di strict court could suspend the lease that would produce the lower economic benef it and assess lost net income on the successful developer more often than not this would favor the coal industry over cbm development as coal resources are typi cally more valuable the current version of the pending energy bill also addresses coal and cbm development priority disputes requiring the secr etary of the interior to review conflict resolution authorities and report to congress on the need for legislative or administrative action22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32262crs5 23 peggy w illiams western coalbed methane oil and gas investor at 36 november 2001 states facing major cbm development each have oil and gas commissions these commissions regulate the location and number of drill sites in order to protect the rights of landowners avoid waste of the resource encour age efficient recovery protect the rights of multiple development right owners regulate waste disposal and prevent adverse environmental impacts these regulations appl to state private and federal lands until the supreme court decided california coastal commission v granite rock company in 1987 many believed state law was preempted by the extensive federal regulation of mineral development on the federal public lands in that case the supreme court held that federal regulation under the general mining act of 1872 did not preempt state regulation in all situations state regulation that does not ma ndate particular uses of lands but instead regulates environmental effects resulting from federal land uses is generally permissible 107 us 1428 1987 however federally authorized drilling projects cannot be frustrated by contrary provisions

of water56 an estimated 51000 wells in the powder ri ver basin are expected to produce over 14 trillion gallons57 the impact of dewatering on water supplies is of central concern especially in the more arid western states dewatering on such large scales may lead to surface subsidence and could limit future s upplies of drinking and irrigation water some estimate that aquifer recharge to current levels will take anywhere from one hundred to over one thousand years58 disposal of produced water is also cen tral issue the water can be and has been reinjected but is often disposed of by dumping it on the ground or in area ponds and rivers each area of cbm production has its unique characteristics associated with water issues in some areas water quality is relatively poor with contaminant

fro m epa permit writers utilize best professional judgment to determine specific discharge limitations to be included in permits for individual facilities for many cbm projects epa and state regulators have instead applied discharg standards applicable to runoff water from the coal mining industry which has s imilar pollutants and not the more stringent regulations applicable to onshore oil and gas category standards which were promulgated before the cbm industry existed66 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32262crs12 67 33 usc 1341a1 68 33 usc 1341a2 69 hr 3698 108th cong 101 2003 70 id at

discharge will comply with the cwa 67 section 401 also requires epa to notif states that may be affected by discharges contemplated in the permit application and provide these states with an

to reinjection of water produced from cbm extraction the sdwa requires permit before reinjection can take place the sdwa and its regulations set up five classes of injection we lls based on the type of fluid in jected and the area of injection cbm water is most often injected into class ii wells which are for fluids brought to the surface in connection with oil and ga s development or used to enhance the recovery of oil and gas73 while reinjection of produced water at the conclusion of cbm extraction has received some attention underground injecti on becomes particularly contentious with

hydraulic fracturing releases gas deposits this process has been alleged to pollute drinking water supplies epa is charged with protecting underground sources of drinking water although states administer underground injection control programs after receiving epa approval75 states therefore are most frequently the permitting authority for underground injections76 many states expecting large scale cbm development do not regulate hydraulic fracturin g under the sdwa however in legal environmental assistance foundation v epa the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit held that hydraulic

epa expects to issue final report in the first half of 2004 pending energy policy legislation would amend the sdwa to specifically exempt hydraulic fracturing from coverage79 state lawbased water rights separate from water quality issues cbm development also raises questions as to the water rights of those who may be impacted by cbms massive dewatering process most states facing major cbm development have adopted th prior appropriation appro ach to water rights law under this framework water rights are created when water is diverted and appropriated for beneficial purpose there is general limit on the amount of water that may be used so long as right holders can show it is not wasted the date of appropriation establishes pr iority of use junior right holders are entitled to water not used by senior rightholders although senior rightholders may not change the purpose of their use method of diversion or place of use if that change harms juniors typically water rights are certified by state authorities that water is put to beneficial use is the crux of this approach to water rights bene ficial use is broadly defined and includes domestic agricultural industrial stock

wyoming is major exception to this standard deeming the watering process itself beneficial use which is especially important c onsidering its vast cbm reserves81 cbm water in other states is genera lly defined as byproduct water and is therefore exempted from the beneficial use requirement82 thus disposal of produced water is allowed through th various methods each state authorizes typical disposal methods authorized are disposal in lined or unlined pits underground injection and discharge into surface waters subject to section 402 of the clean water act83 as indicated earlier wyoming also allows fo r disposal by dumping produced water onto the ground thus state water rights law currently may be of limited effect on the extraction and disposal of cbm produced water significant
