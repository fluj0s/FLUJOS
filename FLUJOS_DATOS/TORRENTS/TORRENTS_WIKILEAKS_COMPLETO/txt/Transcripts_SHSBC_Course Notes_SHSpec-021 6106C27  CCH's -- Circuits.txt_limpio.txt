6106c27 shspec21 cchs circuits the way to bust up machinery on cch1 is to vary the pace hell jump the command if machine is doing it one effect of the cchs is to help the pc find the auditor if he goes on automatic he doesnt have an auditor just running the cchs will run it out varying ones pace will prevent it from starting if you just use intention on the pc and verbal commands your intention may be good but the pcs command circuits may be goofed up and you may not get the response you expected he may not be hooked up the way he should you can have fun with meter talking to the entities in body you could start talking to the pcs circuit but it hooks in harder and harder it hooks in on drop of havingness and you are making comm line talk across to his circuit youre validating the circuit and lowering the pcs havingness if the pc has problem and you try to run think of solution repetitively the pc caves in you are running off the core of an area of motion leaving the motion on automatic the pc is not confronting the actuality of the thing hes not confronting whats going on at all hes confronting solution to it that is hes trying to notis what it is and the problem mass moves in on him if you get him to spot the mass connected with the problem then describe the problem then spot the mass it moves further away if you get him to think of solutions the mass will move in problems of comparable magnitude will also move the problem out this occurs because of confront if the pc avoids it it moves in you can also move the mass out with havingness solution is stable nomotion datum amidst confusion circuits can be used to get data to verify answers to calculations confirm if they are right or wrong or to give you tomorrows weather the latter takes the increment of time that is tomorrow and inspects it this is possible if you can look with equanimity at tomorrow at least its insignificant aspects you can predict to the degree that you can confront people who cant confront pt obsessively try to confront tomorrow or yesterday but its not real tomorrow and probably not real yesterday either the way you go nuts on circuits is to ask yourself who put that there or who else put that there and what does it mean this gives you mystery pcs who dont control their circuits and havent inspected them for many years or eons have things popping up all the time when you audit them some get auditing answers from their circuits the circuits were put up as substitute for confronting and are so old and forgotten that now nothing about them is confronted when the pc nears one of them it tells him what to do or say since circuit is just noconfront running havingness and confront improves circuits the pc may have originally put circuit there for convenience and then come to believe that it was unconfrontable because there was circuit there you could say to the pc were going to handle your primary aberration so make picture of it and look at it tell what you see youd get amazing answers the action of taking picture of it then looking is of course an alteris of confront in auditing you want people to look directly at things circuits encourage them not to because they think they cant confront something as you audit pc these things go live as havingness drops the pc gets anxious keys in circuits to predict or confront drops or as the pc improves and circuits can be activated as the pc comes up through them so everything goes on via auditing walks him up to less and less vias more and more confidence the reason confront isnt on the prehav scale is that it isnt doingness its an ability cf p 22 where confront is described as an action also cf p 40 where confront is defined as subjective havingness or or at least the process is defined as subjective havingness process that explains oddities you get running cchs youre activating and knocking out circuits because direct control and communication brings about continuous shift of circuitry in terms of havingness then since hes been gotten to pt confronting the auditor this brings his havingness up if you talked to those circuits they might well say anything which is also true of the pc on cchs so the less attention you day to what the pc is saying or thinking the better dope off and comm lag indicate things happening to the pcs confront and havingness circuits go haywire when they contain the postulate that the thetan is unable to confront apart from that they can be useful
