the usa patriot act sincerely 4vm ronald weich assistant attorney general enclosure top secreticomintnoforn top secrethcomhhnjofoiuj tshsitnf report on the national security agencys bulk collection programs for usa patriot act reauthorization u the information contained in this report describes some of the most sensitive foreign intelligence collection programs conducted by the united states government this information is highly classified and only limited number of executive branch officials have access to it publicly disclosing any of this information would be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to our nations intelligence capabilities and to national security therefore it is imperative that all who have access to this document abide by their obligation not to disclose this information to any person unauthorized to receive it key points u section 215 of the usa patriot act which expires at the end off ebruary 2011 allows the government upon approval of the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisa court to obtain access to certain business records for national security investigations u section 402 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa which is not subject to sunset allows the government upon approval of the fisa court to install and use pen register or trap and trace pentrap device for national security investigations fshsihnf these authorities support two sensitive and important intelligence collection programs these programs are authorized to collect in bulk certain dialing routing addressing and signaling information about telephone calls and electronic communications such as the telephone numbers or email addresses that were communicating and the times and dates but not the content of the calls or email messages themselves tstsihjf although the programs collect large amount of information the vast majority of that information is never reviewed by any person because the information is not responsive to the limited queries that are authorized for intelligence purposes tshsfhnf the programs are subject to an extensive regime of internal checks particularly for us persons and are monitored by the fisa court and congress tslstijli although there have been compliance problems in recent years the executive branch has worked to resolve them subject to oversight by the fisa court and tssfnf the national security agencys nsa bulk collection programs provide important tools in the fight against terrorism especially in identifying terrorist plots against the homeland these tools are also unique in that they can produce intelligence not otherwise available to nsa top secretncomhhjofor top secrethcomintnloforj background twslfrf since the tragedy of911 the intelligence community has developed an array of capabilities to detect identify and disrupt terrorist plots against the united states and its interests detecting threats by exploiting terrorist communications has been and continues to be one of the critical tools in that effort above all else it is imperative that we have capability to rapidly identify any terrorist threats emanating from within the united states nihsthnf prior to the attacks of 911 the nsa intercepted and transcribed seven calls from hijacker khalid almihdhar to facility associated with anal qaida safehouse in yemen however nsas access point overseas did not provide the technical data indicating the location from where almihdhar was calling lacking the originating phone number nsa analysts concluded that almihdhar was overseas in fact almihdhar was calling from san diego california according to the 911 commission report pages 269272 investigations or interrogation of them khalid almihdhar etc and investigation of their travel andfinancial activities could have yielded evidence of connections to other participants in the 9ji plot the simple fact of their detention could have derailed the plan in any case the opportunity did not arise fssihnf today under fisa court authorization pursuant to the business records authority of the fisa common ly referred to as section 215 the government has developed program to close the gap that allowed almihdhar to plot undetected within the united states while communicating with known terrorist overseas this and similar programs operated pursuant to fisa including exercise of pentrap authorities provide valuable intelligence information u absent legislation section 215 will expire on february 28 2011 along with the so called lone wolf provision and roving wiretaps which this documen t does not address the pentrap authority does not expire tshsinnf the section 215 and pentrap authorities are used by the us government in selected cases to acquire significant foreign intelligence information that cannot otherwise be acquired either at all or on timely basis any us person information that is acquired is subject to strict courtimposed restrictions on the retention use and dissemination of such information and is also subject to strict and frequent audit and reporting requirements tshsinnf the largest and most significant use of these authorities is to support two important and highly sensitive intelligence collection programs under which nsa collects and analyzes large amounts of transactiona l data obtained from certain telecommunications service providers in the united states programs 1c1ary it is important that other members of congress have access to information about these two programs when considering reauthorization of the expiring 2 top secrethcominthqoforn tof ecrefhcomrhhtofojui patriot act provisions the executive branch views it as essential that an appropriate statutory basis remains in place for nsa to conduct these two programs section 215 and pentrap collection thsfhnf under the program based on section 215 nsa is authorized to collect from certain telecommunications service providers certain business records that contain information about communications between two telephone numbers such as the date time and duration of call there is collection of the content of any telephone call under this program and under longstanding supreme court precedent the information collected is not protected by the fourth amendment in this program court orders generally lasting 90 days are served on telecommunications companies reqmre business records as described above relating to substantially all of the telephone calls handled by the companies including both calls made between the united states and foreign country and calls made entirely within the united states 11 s311n under the program based on the pentrap provision in fisa the government is authorized to collect similar kinds of information about electronic communications such as to and from lines in email certain routing information and the date and time an email is sentexcluding the content of the email and the subject line again this information is collected pursuant to court orders generally lasting 90 days and under relevant court decisions is not protected by the fourth amendment however as intelligence analysts checks and balances fisa court oversight tpiltf to conduct these bulk collection programs the government has obtained orders from several different fisa court judges based on legal standards set forth in section 215 and the fisa pentrap provision before obtaining any information from telecommunications service provider the government must establish and the fisa court must conclude that the information is relevant to an authorized investigation in addition the government must comply with detailed minimization procedures required by the fisa court that govern the retention and dissemination of the information obtained before nsa analysts may query bulk records they must have reasonable articulable suspicion referred to as ras that the number or mail address they submit is associated 3 top secreticomhinoforn top secrethcomhhnoforn ras requirement is designed to protect agamst querymg data so that only information pertaining to one of the foreign powers listed in the relevant court order is provided to nsa collected under each program can be retained for 5 years congressiona l oversight u these programs have been briefed to the intelligence and judiciary committees through hearings briefings and visits to nsa in addition the intelligence and judiciary committees have been fully briefed on the compliance issues discussed below compliance issues t8j8inpw in 2009 number of technical compliance problems and human implementation errors in these two bulk collection programs were discovered as result of department of justice doj reviews and internal nsa oversight however neither doj nsa nor the fisa court has found any intentional or badfaith violations accordance with the courts rules upon discovery these inconsistencies were reported as compliance incidents to the fisa court which ordered appropriate remedial action the fisa court placed several restrictions on aspects of the business records collection program until the compliance processes were improved to its satisfaction u the incidents and the courts responses were also reported to the intelligence and judiciary committees in great detail the committees the court and the executive branch have responded actively to the incidents the court has imposed safeguards that together with greater efforts by the executive branch have resulted in significant and effective changes in the compliance program u all parties will continue to report to the fisa court and to congress on compliance issues as they arise and to address them effectively 4 top secrethcomhhhnuforn top secretkcomjtiioforn intelligence value of the collection tssif4if as noted these two collection programs significantly strengthen the intelligence community s early warning system for the detection of terrorists and discovery of plots against the homeland they allow the intelligence community to detect phone numbers and email addresses within the united states that may be contacting targeted phone numbers and email addresses associated with suspected foreign terrorists abroad and viceversa and entirely domestic connections between entities within the united states tied to suspected foreign terrorist abroad nsa needs access to telephony and email transactional information in bulk so that it can quickly identify and assess the network of contacts that targeted number or address is connected whenever there is ras that the number or address is associated with importantly there are intelligence collection tools that independently or in combination provide an equivalent capability tsslfntf to maximize the operational utility of the data the data cannot be collected prospectively once lead is developed because important connections could be lost in data that was sent prior to the identification of the ras phone number or email address nsa identifies the network of contacts by applying sophisticated analysis to the massive volume of metadata but always based on links to number or email address which itself is associated with counterterrorism target again communications metadata is the dialing routing addressing or signaling information associated with an electronic communicatio n but not content the more metadata nsa has access to the more likely it is that nsa can identify discover and understand the network of contacts linked to targeted numbers or addresses information discovered through nsas analysis of the metadata is then provided to the appropriate federal national security agencies including the fbi which are responsible for further investigation or analysis of any potential terrorist threat to the united states tsksihjlh in conclusion the section 215 and pentrap bulk collection programs provide an important capability to the intelligence community the attacks of 911 taught us that applying lead information from foreign intelligence in comprehensive and systemic fashion is required to protect the homeland and the programs discussed in this paper cover critical seam in our defense against terrorism recognizing that the programs have implications for the privacy interests of us person data extensive policies safeguards and reviews have been enacted by the fisa court doj odni and nsa 5 top secrethcomllhhjlofoiui
