sive approach to financial intelligence that will allow us to better confront national security challenges by strengthening our understanding of the global financial network the global financial network encompasses four areas the financial underpinnings of national security threats our adversaries financial vulnerabilities the impact of targeted financial measures and threats to international financial stability assess financial underpinnings of national security threats1 terrorists wmd proliferators rogue states and other nefarious actors require financial resources to support their activities without ready access to such resources these actors are unable to indoctrinate recruit and train personnel buy weapons technology and equipment circulate propaganda bribe officials support the global networks of operatives essential to their existence or launch attacks the flow of funds to activities that threaten national security may not be shut off completely but impeding the activities of these networks makes operating costlier harder and riskier for these threats identify adversaries financial vulnerabilities 2 the us government is relying more heavily on targeted financial measures aimed at specific actors engaged in illicit conduct as opposed to broadbased economic sanctions targeted financial measures allow decision makers to apply financial pressure and isolate terrorists proliferators and others whose goal is to undermine us security they also allow us leaders to take punitive action against threats without resorting to military force applying targeted financial measures effectively however requires indepth knowledge of an adversarys economic or financial wellbeing its strengths weaknesses connectivity to global markets and key dependencies evaluate the impact of targeted financial measures3 as targeted financial measures become an increasingly important policy tool measuring their effectiveness is imperative this area of inquiry involves questions such as what impact have the measures had on the targets economy and financial system how is the target reacting are the measures having the desired effect on the targets behavior what steps is the target taking to evade or avoid the measures moreover have the measures had any unintended consequences or caused any collateral damage monitor threats to international financial

the impact of innovative information sharing iran in the fall of 2006 the treasury department launched an effort to inform foreign govern ments and private sector leaders about the risk that irans financial deception poses to the international financial system iran exploits the global financial ties of its stateowned banks to pursue nuclear capabilities and to develop ballistic missiles in violation of security council resolutions as well as to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars each year to fund and arm terrorists the result of treasurys global outreach is that iran has found itself increasingly isolated from the international financial system as banks around the world decide that maintaining their iranian clientele is not worth the risk of unwittingly facilitating proliferation or terrorism many of the worlds leading financial institutions have essentially stopped dealing with iran especially iranian banks in any currency financial isolation combined with the
