congress updated may 8 2006 larry parker specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division john blodgett specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress air quality multipollutant legislation in the 109th congress summary with the prospect of new layers of complexity being added to air pollution controls and with electricity restructuring putting premium on economic efficiency interest is being expressed in finding mechanisms to achieve health and environmental goals in simpler more costeffective ways the electric utility industry is major source of air pollution particularly sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury hg as well as suspected greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide co2 at issue is whether new approach to environmental protection could achieve the nations air quality goals more costeffectively than the current system one approach being proposed is multipollutant strategy framework based on consistent set of emissions caps implemented through emissions trading just how the proposed approach would fit with the current and proposed diverse regulatory regimes remains to be worked out they might be replaced to the greatest extent feasible or they might be overlaid by the framework of emissions caps in february 2002 the bush administration announced two air quality initiatives the first clear skies would amend the clean air act to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of so2 nox and hg implemented through tradeable allowance program the emissions caps would generally be imposed in two phases 2008 and 2018 the second initiative begins voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program this plan rather than capping co2 emissions focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy reducing current emissions of 183 metric tons per million dollars of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 in the 109th congress seven bills have been introduced that would impose multipollutant controls on utilities two of the bills hr 227 and s 131 are modified versions of the administrations threepollutant proposal the other five bills s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 and hr 1873 are fourpollutant proposals that include carbon dioxide s 150 is similar to bill reported by the senate environment and public works committee in the 107th congress likewise hr 1451 is similar to hr 1256 introduced in the 107th congress hr 1873 and s 2724 are revised versions of s 843 introduced in the 108th congress all of these bills involve some form of emission caps typically beginning in 2010 most include tradeable credit program to implement that cap the provisions concerning so2 nox and hg in s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 and hr 1873 are generally more stringent and take full effect earlier than the comparable provisions of s 131 s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 and hr 1873 would cap utility emissions of co2 it is difficult to compare those co2 caps with the administrations proposal concerning co2 both because the administrations proposal is voluntary rather than mandatory and because it is broader covering all greenhouse gas emissions rather than just utility co2 emissions however it appears that actual us greenhouse gas emissions would be higher under the administrations proposal than those allowed by s 150 s 730 and hr 1451 this report will be updated as warranted contents introduction 1 the bush administrations proposals 2 proposed legislation and legislative action in the 109th congress 3 so2 nox

major source of air pollution the combustion of fossil fuels petroleum natural gas and coal which accounts for about twothirds of us electricity generation results in the emission of stream of gases these gases include several pollutants that directly pose risks to human health and welfare including particulate matter pm1 sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury hg particulate matter so2 and nox are currently regulated under the clean air act caa and the environmental protection agency epa has promulgated rules to regulate mercury beginning in 2010 other gases may pose indirect risks notably carbon dioxide co2 which may contribute to global warming2 table 1 provides estimates of so2 nox and co2 emissions from electric generating facilities annual emissions of hg from utility facilities are more uncertain current estimates indicate about 48 tons utilities are subject to an array of environmental regulations which affect in different ways both the cost of operating existing generating facilities and the cost of constructing new ones table 1 emissions from us fossilfuel electric generating plants thousands of metric tons emissions 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 so2 12445

combinedheatandpower plants the evolution of air pollution controls over time and as result of growing scientific understanding of health and environmental impacts has led to multilayered and interlocking patchwork of controls moreover additional controls are in the process of development particularly with respect to nox as precursor to ozone to both nox and so2 as contributors to pm25 and to hg as toxic air pollutant also under the united nations framework convention on climate 1 particulate matter is regulated depending on the particle size current regulations address particles less than 10 microns in diameter pm10 epa has promulgated regulations for particles less than 25 microns in diameter pm25 that are in the process of being implemented so2 and nox emissions would be affected by regulations of pm25 2 steamelectric utilities produce minor amounts of volatile organic compounds vocs carbon monoxide co and lead on the order of 2 or less of all sources crs2 change unfccc the united states agreed to voluntary limits on co2 emissions the current bush administration has rejected the kyoto protocol which would impose mandatory limits in favor of voluntary reduction program in contrast to the administrations position in june 2005 the senate passed sense of the senate calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases while not imposing significant harm to the economy3 for many years the complexity of the air quality control regime has caused some observers to call for simplified approach now with the potential both for additional control programs on so2 and nox and for new controls directed at hg and co2 intersecting with the technological and policy changes affecting the electric utility industry such calls for simplification have become more numerous and insistent one focus of this effort is the multipollutant or fourpollutant approach this approach involves mix of regulatory and economic mechanisms that would apply to utility emissions of up to four pollutants in various proposals so2 nox hg and co2 the objective would be to balance the environmental goal of effective controls across the pollutants covered with the industry goal of stable regulatory regime for period of years4 the bush administrations proposals in february 2002 the bush administration announced two air quality proposals to address the control of emissions of so2 nox hg and co25 the first proposal called clear skies would amend the clean air act to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of so2 nox and hg implemented through tradeable allowance program the emissions caps would be imposed in two phases 2010 2008 in the case of nox and 2018 as part of complete rewrite of title iv of the clean air act the administrations proposal was introduced in the 108th congress as hr 999 and s 485 revised versions of clear skies legislation have been introduced in the 109th congress as hr 227 and s 1316 the second administration proposal initiates new voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program similar to ones introduced by the earlier george h w bush and clinton administrations7 developed in response to the us ratification of the 1992 unfccc these previous plans projected us compliance or near compliance with 3 samdt 866 to hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005 june 22 2005 4 crs report rl30878 electricity generation and air quality multipollutant strategies by larry parker and john blodgett 5 papers outlining the administrations proposals are available from the white house website httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200202clearskieshtml for the three pollutant proposal and httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200202climatechange html for the climate change initiative 6 while hr 227 adopts the so2 and nox emission caps of the administrations clear skies proposal it does not include many other provisions including regulatory changes 7 for discussion of those previous plans see crs report 94404 enr climate change action plans by larry parker and john blodgett may 9 1994 archived available from the authors crs3 the unfccc goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at their 1990 levels by the year 2000 through voluntary measures the bush administration proposal does not make that claim only projecting 100 million metric ton reduction in emissions from what would occur otherwise in the year 2012 instead the plan focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy reducing current emissions of 183 metric tons per million dollars of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 it proposes several voluntary initiatives along with increased spending and tax incentives to achieve this goal the administration notes that the new initiatives would achieve about onequarter of the objective while threequarters of the projected reduction would occur through already existing efforts proposed legislation and legislative action in the 109th congress in the 109th congress seven bills have been introduced that would impose multipollutant controls on utilities two of the bills hr 227 sweeney and s 131 inhofe are modified versions of the administrations threepollutant proposal the other five bills s 150 jeffords s 730 leahy s 2724 carper hr 1451 waxman and hr 1873 bass are fourpollutant proposals that include carbon dioxide s 150 is similar to bill reported by the senate environment and public works committee in the 107th congress likewise hr 1451 is similar to hr 1256 introduced in the 107th congress finally hr 1873 and s 2724 are revised versions of s 843 introduced in the 108th congress all of these bills involve some form of emission caps typically beginning in 2010 most include tradeable credit program to implement that cap the provisions concerning so2 nox and hg in s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 and hr 1873 are generally more stringent and take full effect earlier than the comparable provisions of s 131 s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 and hr 1873 would cap utility emissions of co2 it is difficult to compare those co2 caps to the administrations proposal concerning co2 both because the administrations proposal is voluntary rather than mandatory and because it is broader covering all greenhouse gas emissions rather than just utility co2 emissions however it appears that actual us greenhouse gas emissions would be higher under the administrations proposal than those allowed by s 150 s 730 and hr 1451 the seven bills are summarized in the appendix each of these bills except s 730 generally builds on the so2 allowance trading scheme contained in title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments caaa8 under this program utilities are given specific allocation of permitted emissions called allowances and may choose to use those allowances at their own facilities or if they do not use their full quota to bank them for future use or to sell them to other utilities needing additional allowances in contrast s 730 permits emissions averaging within single facility but not across sites so2 nox and hg controls as indicated in the appendix the caps for so2 and nox in s 131 are less stringent for 2010 than in s 150 s 730 and hr 1451 and remain less stringent even through the second phase beginning in 2018 8 pl 101549 crs4 hr 227 would require full compliance with its so2 and nox provisions by 2014 in effect accelerating s 131s proposed phase 2 emission caps by four years however s 131s phase 1 nox reduction would begin two years earlier 2008 than s 150 s 730 hr 227 or hr 1451 and one year sooner than hr 1873 allowance allocation schemes for the bills also differ with s 150 containing detailed provisions for allocating so2 nox and co2 allowances to various economic sectors and interests in most cases these interests or their trustees in the case of households and dislocated workers and communities would auction off or otherwise sell their allowances to the affected utilities and use the collected funds for their own purposes in contrast s 131 would base its allowance formulas on fuel usage adjusted by factors specified in the bill while hr 227 and hr 1451 would leave the allocation issue to epa s 730 provides specifics on allocating and implementing its so2 nox and co2 caps on electric utilities whereas hr 1873 and s 2724 specify co2 and nox limitations based on electricity output and so2 limitations based on the current title iv program on mercury s 131s emissions goal would allow about three times more emissions and eight more years for compliance than s 150 s 730 and hr 1451 which also would mandate plantbyplant controls hr 227 would require epa to promulgate hg regulations by march 15 2005 and hr 1873 and s 2724 provide for limitations in between those of s 150 and s 131 but includes unitbyunit emissions limitations it is difficult to compare the hg controls of s 131 s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 or hr 1873 to hr 227 which does not specify an hg emissions goal leaving regulation up to epa s 730 is the most comprehensive bill with respect to hg control including not only stringent cap on electric utility emissions but also substantial reduction requirements for six other categories of hg emitters related regulatory provisions in addition to the emissions caps s 131 would substantially modify or eliminate several provisions in the clean air act with respect to electric generating facilities the bill would eliminate new source performance standards nsps section 111 and replace them with statutory standards for so2 nox particulate matter and hg for new sources modified sources could also opt to comply with these new statutory standards and be exempted from the applicable best available control technology bact determinations under prevention of significant deterioration psd provisions caa part c or lowest achievable emissions rate laer determinations under nonattainment provisions caa part d compliance with these provisions exempts such facilities from new source review nsr psdbact requirements visibility best available retrofit technology bart requirements maximum achievable control technology mact requirements for hg and nonattainment laer and offset requirements the exemption does not apply to psdbact requirements if facilities are within 50 km of psd class 1 area existing sources can also receive these exemptions if they agree to meet particulate matter standard specified in the bill along with good combustion practices to minimize carbon monoxide emissions within three years of enactment in addition s 131 would provide these exemptions for industrial sources that choose to opt into the clear skies program hr 1873 also contains significant regulatory provisions the bill would revise the nsr program to require pre1971 electric generating units to meet specific so2 crs5 and nox performance standards provision also contained in s 2724 but with more stringent standards in addition hr 1873 would require laer and bact definitions be revised on biannual basis and place cost cap on any laer definition in conjunction with these changes the bill would eliminate the current caa offset requirement in nonattainment areas beginning in 2010 hr 1873 would also provide affected units 20year exemption from bart requirements under the caa visibility provisions other changes to the visibility provision include the codification of the western regional air partnership wrap agreement with respect to sulfur dioxide emissions s 150 would require all powerplants 40 years or older to meet emission limitations based on current best available control technology for new source in similar vein hr 1451 would require all powerplants 30 years or older to meet current new source performance standards nsps requirements s 131 also would include an exemption for steam electric generating facilities from hg regulation under section 112 of the caa including the residual risk provisions and relief from enforcement of any section 126 petition with respect to reducing interstate transportation of pollution before december 31 2014 in addition to its nsr provision s 2724 would eliminate the annual nox cap established under epas recently promulgated clean air interstate rule cair upon promulgations of s 2724s new nox program or january 1 2009 whichever occurs last it would retain cairs seasonal nox cap for ozone neither hr 227 s 150 s 730 nor hr 1451 would provide such regulatory relief provisions co2 of the seven bills s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 and hr 1873 would specify co2 reductions in contrast the administrations co2 proposal relies on various voluntary programs and incentives to encourage reductions in greenhouse gases from diverse sources including co2 emissions from electric generation based on the estimate provided by the administrations climate change proposal and using the 2002 climate action report9 car for projections to 2010 table 2 presents estimates of us greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 assuming the administrations voluntary program reaches proportional percentage of its 2012 goals10 this should not be taken as given as neither the george h w bush administrations program nor the clinton administrations program achieved their stated goals thus in one sense comparing mandatory reduction program such as that proposed by s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 or hr 1873 with the administrations voluntary program is comparing apples to oranges the first is legally binding the second is an exhortation 9 climate action report 2002 at httpwwwepagovglobalwarmingpublicationscar indexhtml this is the us report to the unfccc secretariat on us emissions and measures taken to reduce them 10 for discussion of emission projections and trends see crs report 98235 enr global climate change us greenhouse gas emissions status trends and projections by john blodgett and larry parker crs6 while s 150 s 730 and hr 1451 focus on electric utility emissions the mandated reductions would result in lower total greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 than those projected to occur under the administrations initiative that includes all sources of all greenhouse gases both hr 1873 and s 2724 require fewer reductions than the administration hopes to achieve from its economywide initiative however neither the proposed legislation nor the administrations initiative would be sufficient to bring us emissions near the 19901995 baseline used under the 1997 kyoto protocol much less the 7 reduction in emissions from that baseline that would have been assigned to the united states under the protocol discussion in the car observes that the pace of economic growth would affect emissions high economic growth scenario would increase energy use and related carbon emissions compared to the reference case of business as usual likewise lower economic growth would decrease emissions for example under high economic growth scenario greenhouse emissions in 2010 would increase 377 above those in 1990 based on energy growth alone this increase would represent an additional 53 million metric tons of emissions over the reference case11 however s 150 and s 730 would cap emissions from increased electricity generation at 1990 levels which would reduce the 53 million metric tons by 16 million metric tons or 30 of the high growth increase the administrations initiative is voluntary and addresses carbon intensity not absolute emission levels it does not cap emissions growth table 2 comparison of administrations voluntary program with proposed legislation percentage change v
