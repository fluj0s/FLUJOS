that intended for human consumption drugs and products fall under the jurisdictions of other federal regulatory agencies order code rs22821 updated june 17 2008 consumer product safety commission current issues bruce mulock specialist in government and business government and finance division summary the consumer product safety commission cpsc one of the agencys two current commissioners stated recently is at crossroads according to cpsc httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22821 commissioner thomas moore either congress will reverse the agencys steady decline or the cpsc will become so weakened as to be irrelevant created in the early 1970s the cpsc is small agency by washington standards slightly more than 400 employees and 625 million fy2007 appropriation charged with seemingly overwhelming responsibility to protect american consumers against death or injury from unsafe products including imported products series of high profile product recalls most notably of childrens toys imported from china has focused attention on the cpscs resources including its legal authority for the task at hand legislation hr 4040 and s 2663 to strengthen the commission is being considered the cpsc is but one part of growing congressional concern about the protection being afforded american consumers from unsafe imports food pet food as well as that intended for human consumption drugs and products fall under the jurisdictions of other federal regulatory agencies this report will be updated as events warrant about the agency the consumer product safety commission is perhaps best understood in the context of the surge of the consumer protection movement of the 1960s beginning with ralph naders efforts to dramatize the problems of auto safety general interest in product safety was stimulated the congress responded by passing series of laws dealing with auto safety toy safety radiation safety fabric flammability and child resistant packaging for hazardous household substances these laws as well as several dating from the 1950s were in the opinion of some observers neither comprehensive in scope with respect to the wide range of consumer products nor adequate in protection while industry was originally opposed to federal regulatory approach by the early 1970s the national association of manufacturers agreed there was need for congress crs2 to pass product safety law1 key reason was because manufacturers were increasingly having to contend with complex and confusing assortment of state laws and the prospect of having to deal with unified regulatory approach appeared attractive although there are other historical factors the cpsc owes its existence primarily to the work of the national commission on product safety ncps legislation was introduced in 1966 and the following year pl 90146 authorizing the ncps was approved in march 1968 president lyndon johnson appointed the sevenmember bipartisan commission to conduct comprehensive study and investigation of the scope and adequacy of measures now employed to protect consumers against unreasonable risk of injuries which may be caused by hazardous household products2 the agencys statutory purposes are to 1 protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products 2 assist consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products 3 develop uniform safety standards for consumer products and minimize conflicting state and local regulations and 4 promote research and investigation into the causes and prevention of productrelated deaths illnesses and injuries httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22821 in addition to the authority assigned to the cpsc by its enabling legislation major consumer programs were transferred to the new agency from the food and drug administration the health education and welfare department now known as health and human services and the commerce department included were the federal hazardous substances act of 1960 as amended by the toy safety acts of 1969 and 1984 and the child protection amendments of 1966 the poison prevention packaging act of 1970 the flammable fabrics act of 1953 and the refrigerator safety act of 1956 the cpsc was designed to be relatively small rather than relying on thousands of inspectors the agency relies on the onus placed on firms by its enabling statute section 15b for example requires manufacturers to report unsafe products to the commission this general approach appears to have worked reasonably well for domestically produced consumer products because of the nations regulatory regime when it comes to imported products however the absence of key factors may make safety oversight more problematic in china for example inspections cannot with anything approaching confidence be left to chinese factory owners china reportedly suffers from the absence of rigorous regulatory system endemic problems of corruption and lack of free press3 recent recalls beginning in spring 2007 newspaper stories began appearing with increasing regularity about dangerous and sometimes deadly defects in imported products 1 product safety stricter law in congressional mill congressional quarterly dec 18 1971 p 2629 2 pl 90146 section 2a nov 20 1967 3 edwin s steinfeld the rogue that plays by the rules the washington post sept 2 2007 p b3 crs3 principally products produced in china4 first came reports about toothpaste manufactured in china containing chemicals unsafe for human consumption then awareness of unsafe products was brought home to millions of pet owners when it was discovered that some pet food manufactured in china contained melamine contamination which was blamed for causing kidney failure in hundreds of animals subsequently health and safety concerns were raised about seafood tires and chemical and pharmaceutical products5 throughout the summer of 2007 additional recalls of toys appeared some involved danger because of loose magnets some because of beads containing toxic chemical if ingested and toy ovens with the potential for finger entrapment and burn hazards large number of recalls involved jewelry and painted toys containing unsafe levels of lead thus it is not surprising that there is concern among many american consumers if all these problems have been detected or uncovered in spite of various underfunded and understaffed inspection systems have we been seeing just the tip of the iceberg cpsc funding reflects increasing congressional concern httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22821 throughout the summer and fall of 2007 appropriators took note of the growing concerns about the adequacy of the agencys funding at oversight and appropriations hearings in both the house and senate witnesses from consumer organizations industry and the agency were among those who advocated providing cpsc with more money to get the job done the cpscs fy2007 budget was 6227 million the house following the recommendation of the appropriations committee proposed increasing the agencys appropriation to 6683 million for fy2008 for its part the senate proposed 70 million in the end under the omnibus funding measure hr 2764 cpsc received 80 million for fy2008 an increase of 177 million for fy2008 or 28 the appropriators directed cpsc to use its additional funding to increase staff workspace and information technology resources in particular appropriators instructed the agency to hire in the areas of hazard identification and reduction as well as compliance and field operations consumer groups and others have repeatedly expressed concerns over the cpscs staffing level in 1977 three years after the commission opened its doors it had staff of 900 the staffing level has declined sharply over the past three decades from high of 978 in 1980 the budget for fy2007 culminated twoyear reduction of fulltime positions ftes from 471 to 420 the commissions request for fy2008 anticipated decrease of an additional 19 ftes all indications are that the cpsc will substantially increase its staffing level over the next few years in the house hr 4040 the consumer product safety commission modernization act passed unanimously 4070 in december 2007 that bill would authorize 80 million for fy2009 90 million for 4 for more information see crs report rs22713 health and safety concerns over us imports of

crs4 fy2010 and 100 million for fy2011 s 2045 currently pending in the senate discussed below also calls for substantially increased authorizations import safety working group as noted earlier the cpsc is but one agency involved in the problem of unsafe imports food pet food as well as that intended for human consumption drugs and products eg tires and goods associated with business and commercial application fall under the jurisdictions of other federal regulatory agencies on july 18 2007 president bush issued an executive order eo 13439 establishing the interagency working group on import safety6 the working group comprises senior administration officials it includes the secretaries of agriculture commerce health and human services transportation and homeland security the administrator of the environmental protection agency and the chairman of the cpsc hhs secretary michael leavitt who chairs the working group presented an import safety action plan to president bush on november 6 2007 noting the sheer magnitude httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22821 of the importexport enterprise the plan concludes that the united states cannot inspect its way to safety rather the plan presented number of short and longterm recommendations designed to improve the safety of imports entering the country the recommendations include creating stronger certification process encouraging various best practices increasing transparency exchanging import data increasing us presence overseas enhancing standards and strengthening penalties the working group presented president bush with strategic framework to increase import safety that called for several immediate steps one of these steps was directive to federal agencies to accelerate their participation in an automated single window system for reporting imports electronically the aim is to achieve better coordination and efficiency thus facilitating information exchange among government agencies and between the government and the importing community in real time legislative proposals to strengthen the cpsc although major consumer groups such as the consumer federation of america consumers union and us public interest research group had been voicing concern about the cpscs declining budgets in real terms and staffing for decades and had tried for years to persuade congress to amend and strengthen the agencys powers until the recent uproar over dangerous imported products they had made little headway7 last years spate of recalls of products that poisoned pets endangered infants and children from leadpainted toys and small magnets and posed potential health threats to 6 for information on the efforts of the working group including fact sheets and its action plan for import safety see httpwwwimportsafetygov 7 the pattern of legislation being driven by sudden increase in public awareness is well established more than century ago for example upton sinclairs book the jungle 1906 which dealt with conditions in the us meat packing industry and caused public uproar contributed to the passage of the pure food and drug act and the meat inspection act of 1906 crs5 millions who consumed imported fish and other foods has led to major cpsc reform bills in both houses of congress in the house hr 4040 the consumer product safety modernization act of 2007 was favorably reported by the house energy and commerce committee on december 18 2007 and passed in the house the following day by vote of 4070 among the bills major provisions are the following would require mandatory thirdparty testing of childrens products and requires premarket testing of many childrens products for lead and other hazards by certified laboratories would prohibit the cpsc from using agency rulemaking actions to preempt state common law claims and increase the cap on civil penalties to 10 million current level 18 million would authorize state attorneys general to enforce cpsc standards would create new lead standards for childrens products when fully phased in the bill would lower the standard for lead from 600 parts per million to 100 parts per million or trace amounts it would mandate that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22821 the agency periodically review and revise this standard to require the lowest amount of lead science and technology make feasible to achieve would require mandatory safety standards for nursery products eg cribs and high chairs calls for cpsc to examine the current voluntary safety standards for toys starting with dangerous magnets and if found to be inadequate mandatory standards must be adopted would require manufacturers to place distinguishing marks on products and packaging of childrens products to aid in recalls it would prohibit the sale and export of recalled products prohibit the export of products that violate us consumer product safety rules and would provide cpsc with 80 million for 2009 90 million for fy2010 and 100 million for fy2011 it would also restore the agency to full panel of five commissioners and include 20 million to modernize the agencys testing lab in the senate commerce science and transportation committee chairman daniel inouye and the committees ranking member ted stevens announced on february 15 2008 they had joined with senator mark pryor sponsor of s 2045 the cpsc reform act of 2007 to announce new compromise bill8 the new bill s 2663 does not include several of s 2045s more controversial provisions including giving whistleblowers financial incentives for reporting defects and hazards in products made by companies with whom they were employed and giving state attorneys general power to enforce product safety standards those two provisions had represented key differences from hr 4040 and had been opposed by the bush administration nevertheless important differences remain between the house and senate bills s 2663 provides larger authorizations for the agency for longer time period further the senate bill contains higher civil penalties for violations and unlike hr 4040 the senate bill contains number of provisions aimed at single product issues these include specific provisions 8 daily report for executives work continues on cpsc legislation pryor hopes for strong bipartisan measure feb 1 2008 p a16 crs6 focusing on garage door opener standard an allterrain vehicle safety standard completion of the agencys cigarette lighter rulemaking and rule aimed at child resistant portable gasoline containers key provisions contained in the compromise senate bill include the following would authorize giving state attorneys general the right to seek injunctive relief for unsafe products such as the ability to ask court to remove product from store shelves authority not included in hr 4040 s 2663 however does not allow states to sue for damages as s 2045 would have would grant whistleblowers various protections unlike s 2045 however s 2663 does not include providing financial rewards for disclosing information about dangerous products would restore the cpsc to five members as with hr 4040 quorum requirements for the agency have complicated efforts to conduct business it has been functioning with only two of the three commissioners since july 2006 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22821 would provide cpsc with 885 million in fy2009 and increase funding 10 each year through 2015 ie 968 million for fy2010 1065 million for fy2011 1171 million for fy2012 1288 million for fy1013 1417 million for fy2014 and 1559 million for fy2015 would ban lead in all childrens products would require thirdparty safety certification of childrens products would streamline the product safety rulemaking process to be more timely by eliminating mandatory advanced notice of proposed rulemaking step and would allow cpsc to expedite the disclosure of industryprovided information in the interest of public health and safety senate and house conferees were appointed on april 29 and may 14 respectively and having missed an earlier target date of the week following the memorial day recess now hope to reach compromise before the july 4 holiday even as the conferees work to reconcile important differences between the two cpsc reform bills another highvisibility issue has moved to the front burner for several regulatory agencies including the cpsc the safety of phthalates and bisphenol bpa in childrens products at house energy and commerce committee hearings on june 10 2008 scientists presented evidence on the toxicity of class of industrial chemicals known as phthalates used to make plastic toys and childcare products the testimony which was not conclusive with regard to possible harm may help conferees decide whether to include ban of these chemicals in the final version of the cpsc reform legislation9 while spokesmen for both cpsc and the food and drug administration said the evidence of danger from bpa was insufficient to corroborate concerns canadas health agency announced in april that it planned to put bpa on its list of toxic substances and would ban plastic baby bottles made with the chemical 9 for an overview and analysis of this issue see crs report rs22869 bisphenol bpa in plastics and possible human health effects by lindajo schierow and sarah lister
