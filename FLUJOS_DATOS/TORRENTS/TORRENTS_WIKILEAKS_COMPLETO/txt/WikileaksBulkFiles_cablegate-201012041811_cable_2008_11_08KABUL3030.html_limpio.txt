situation in helmand spanta and spenzada views classified by ambassador william b wood for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c president karzai is willing to consider combined isafana with key roles for the us and uk security plan to improve stability in helmand but is convinced reinstating sher mohammad akhunzada sma as governor is the best way to achieve stability and bring out votes in next years election there is known decision or timeline for replacing governor mangal with sma spenzada welcomed international collaboration with mangal to increase aid projects in alizai areas to bolster mangals tenuous position 2 sbu the subject of helmand security sher mohammad akhunzada and the role of prts came up in two recent meetings an 1118 meeting between fm spanta and the ambassador and an 1117 meeting between deputy nsa ibrahim spenzada and polcouns london visit karzai challenges uk for helmand security plan 3 c fm spanta confirmed that helmand security was the top issue of karzais london discussions the exchange centered on the best means to bring talibancontrolled areas under government control according to the nds five of helmands 13 districts are undr taliban control the uk and afghanistan discussed combined isafana approach with implicit understanding of lead roles for the us and uk and an afghanled solution 4 c deputy nsa spenzada put it in starker terms karzai told the british that he wanted to see their helmand security plan if the uk didnt have one he would take tribal solution8 spenzada confirmed tribal solution8 meant reinstating sher mohammad akhunzada sma as helmand governor 5 c uk general richards told spanta the uk was prepared to offer to send 2000 additional soldiers to helmand once karzai requested it officially spanta said the london visit helped reduce misunderstandings but he expressed disappointment in the british contending they were not ready to fight as actively as american soldiers karzais view on sma and the alizai 6 c spenzada said there was decision or timeline for reinstating sma as helmand governor he explained that karzai sees control of the alizai as key to improving stability in the province and he was convinced only sma could bring control t the alizai the alizai are the majority and hold control in the troubled districts of kajaki musa qala and sangin karzai believes the alizai dominate the barakzai poplazai ishakzai and other helmand tribes in karzais calculation control of the alizai translates into control over all the weaker tribes too 7 c at 1031 meeting with the ambassador governor mangal disputed smas monolithic control of the alizai mangal pointed to his recentsuccess in installing an alizai ally as chiefof kajaki district despite smas continuingefforts to undermine him mangal appeared upbeat about winning more alizais to his side 8 c spenzada agreed the alizai were split ontheir support for sma and that the nonaliza tribes strongly opposed smas return spenzada described sma as of the problem8 and recognized that unrestcould return if karzai reinstated him spenzda said he and other karzai advisors have failed to change karzais mind on reinstating sma 9 c although unsaid by spenzada

spenzada characterized governor mangal as good official and good person he encouraged the united states to continue to work through mangal to increase aid projects kabul 00003030 002 of 002 in alizai

assistance to the alizai karzai comments on prts undermining local governance 12 sbu on november 16 karzai stated at press conference that prts were weakening the government by controlling resources

on those decisions spenzada promised to pass along this information to karzai wood
