modern security checking lecture given on 4 october 1962 well this is the what audience the 4th october 4th four oct audience yes you fall into my bad habits four oct ad 12 saint hill special briefing course lecture number one footnote im talk to you about it more than footnote for long long time weve had dissensions and upsets and casualties and so forth over the past twelve years dianetics and scientology looked like battlefield you know its coming out of it things are much more even things are much more easily handled things are smoother but we still have occasional upsets here and there i gave you an hco bulletin the other day that had to do with new security checks id better talk to you about the use of that bulletin the bulletin of course is valuable in two directions one it points the way to resolved case and thats the most valuable and on the other fork of the road points the way to peace and quiet while we get the cases cleared and these two directions are highly desirable but one complements the other now for very long time we have tried to find out very often in vain what obsessed or ailed somebody or somethingwhat was making them nervous and why theyd suddenly revolt and do things and cut their own throats and that sort of thing and there are quite few dead men on the backtrack quite few dead men on the backtrackthere really are and howd they get that way what had happened was there any international group that was closely and devotedly opposed to the advance of dianetics or scientology and the answer is there are few psychotic activities around on the planet that would be as antipathetic to the grocers goodwill as to ours there would be as many people affected adversely across the planet as ourselves if some of these happy philosophies were put into terrific use political philosophies theres another one which says anything you have should beif you are working hardanything you have should be shared with somebody who wont help you thats socialism thats nutty philosophy if you work real hard then somebody else wont have to work and of course this is represented as everybody will have leisure except those of course who are keeping the society going and keeping the leisure possible well this of course is dead in the teeth of even pavlov its the nonreward philosophy you see if you work you are fined and if you loaf you are rewarded well what will that turn mankind into but bunch of loafers you see i mean if youif you know pavlovs philosophy of the reward theories and so forthhow to make the dog slaver at the right times if man is an animal and if that works why this would be death in the teeth of it there are political philosophies about of course which are the extreme of this and that is to say that one man should own everything and everybody else should be in total poverty now that philosophy is highly antipathetic to the greater good of the people too capitalistic system where you have group of fifteen or twenty people in country well mexico theyre very rich in mexico theyre extremely rich but south american countries just love this philosophy theres the ricos and the pobresand boy the ricos are really rico and the pobres are mmmmmm really pobre and the gap is so tremendous theres middle class theres anything and youre either slave or king with gradient scale between them and of course thats highly false philosophy too and there are others theres philosophy of democracy so that the mean opinion is valid oh i dont know you take whole bunch of uninformed people and take the mean of their opinion and then say that that mean is valid and therefore disregard it and then do things and tell them its their fault thats democracy in actual practice see its the perfect mechanism to prevent revolt better one has ever been invented its selfperpetuating machine that is pure idiocyan american presidentthey put up two goons which you wouldnt let clean out your chicken coopand youre told youre free because you can vote for one or the other of them and then if everything goes wrong its your fault see its great philosophy well frankly all government of course is merely substitute for the disability of people government is substitute for the disability of the individuals in the population in the absence of an understanding of the human mind government becomes inevitable if you dont understand what makes man tick you inevitably have government and you have as much government as there is crime till the whole government is crime you see the logical arguments they say well well you need government should have police force should have this should have that should have the other things what are you going to need police force for well you need police force because you got crooks what you got crooks for its inevitable that if you have police force youll have crooks thats been proved out time and time again little town down in texas proved this not too long ago they had jail and they had deputy sheriff or two and they had crime little two bit townspit across the city limits from one to the other by george economics got so bad in that community or politics got so rampant or the town was so small it was so unimportant that they removed the police force well they removed it on gradient scale i think they took off one cop and left one and they had half as much crime then they removed the other cop and they had crime there hasnt been any crime down there since this is an interesting lookbecause the game of cops and robbers well look what they do they arrest fellow put him in with association with bunch of criminals that really teach him how in prison and then after few years release him and on to the public again you see now hes educated see now hes got motivator now hes really good criminal this is the way it goes and this is aim not just being bitter about itits true police forces have nothing in common with public safety now if youre going to have crime you will eventually get some people together and they will say we will hire somebody to protect us against this crime and then you say well theres some enemies on the border so bunch of people will get together and say well lets have an army now theyve got police force now theyve got an army and somebodys house burns down and they say well lets have fire department and they go on like this very interestingly funny part of it is that police forces armies fire departments and so forth haveall of them at one time or another run on completely private basis theres nothing the government does that has not been done privately at one time or another well of course the more government you get the less liberty youre going to have inevitably because ittheyre not producing the government is nonproducer and you get more and more government youre going to get less and less liberty because the laws they pass against crime apply to you who in theoryhonesthired them you see the next thing you know you havent even got yourself anymore and youve gone the whole cycle of idiocy but there is international group that faces dianetics or scientology except to the degree that aberration faces sanity and you get an auditor in there and hes doing mediumly good job of auditing hell still have bit of trouble with psycho hell still get clawed up now he will eventually also come out on top even if hes just mediumly good an excellent auditor of course never does get clawed up and of course as group we are moving forward now toward higher and higher level of excellence in technical application we know more and more about it we know more and more about the application of these things you would be amazed how the principles of auditing work when used in life and so forthif you yourself havent had recognition of that already well whats all this leading to the only enemy of man is the aberration of man theres international group which faces dianetics and scientology and means to plow us under any more than any other international group would tend to rave at the auditor its like psycho pc probably one of their biggest objections is the fact that we arent auditing them something like that normally by the way you figure that with pc and itll be right some fellow at dinner party and hes clawing you up because youre one of them scientologists and he had psychiatrist once who he dearly loved or something and therefore youre dog and so forth oh the only thing this person is asking for is auditing i always assumewell he wants to be audited you know chews up one way or the otherwell he wants auditing all right wants auditing voilá ill give him auditing yeah they always quiet right down too the only thing they want is relief from their own misery and agony now once youve embarked upon course of doingness sort of thing youre for it unless you do it and in times past when we have not executed our commitments we have been in trouble now theres somebody right in this room right now that was awful mad at us very short time ago before some auditing was given but the reason of the anger is the auditing wasnt given although this was never stated by the person you see that i mean the person was upset reallythey had whole lot of representationsbut was upset really because you didnt understand the person and werent auditing the person werent relieving them from this misery and agony because theyre miserable there is getting around that theyre in misery man oh youve been there sometime in the middle of session you felt like you were stark staring mad how would you like to feel like that all of the timetwentyfour hours day and not be able to sleep much on top of it well anybody that could take you out of that you would have kissed on both cheeks but you would have shot maimed and stamped on somebody who could have but didnt see that is the thing that is never forgiven so once youre committed along the line of service you must execute it it doesnt do any good to tell some pc who is clamoring around trying to get some auditing that you havent got time that you dont want to it doesnt do any good at all youll have to go ahead and make some kind of an arrangement whereby it gets done not necessarily that you do it see you have to make some kind of solution where auditing can occur and in handling any of these situations and any condition which i speak of tonight in this lecture are governed by that principle if you do thatif you do that youll come out all right youve got to make some kind of arrangements whereby auditing can occur its very funny but you would be amazed what pc well lets take it right close to home very very close to homeright in where youre operating right now youre aware of the fact that the pc is screaming oh my god youre the worst person that ever lived and youre the auditor you see and this pc is just screaming throwing down the cans and now thats ittheyre finished you know now your automatic technical response is you got to pick up their missed withholds and that is very very true dont think im saying its not true yes you got to pick up their missed withholds but here is something that you may not have noticed that if you just start auditing them well the arc break evaporates now have you noticed that what theyre protesting against is auditing now if you sit there playing it safe as an auditor and decide that youre going to prepcheck even case as advanced and as rather stable as having found his goalif you sit there as an auditor and go into some long involved prepcheck that does listing and you insist on this sort of thing and the goal is tickingpc feels all right everythings finebut you insist on going through this long prepcheck which is going to take the next twentyfive hours oh man i dont know how youre going to keep that pc in the chair i dont know how you would do it man i dont know you might get away from itaway with it for two hours you might get away with it for three might get away with it for session and half then the pcs going to start nattering then the pcs going to start to get restive and the needle is going to start to act up even though the pc is keeping himself well in trim things are starting to go wrong along about the third session arc breaks are awfully easy to come byvery very easy to come by all you have to do is put your pencil down gently on the pad you see and the pc will scream like mad because you have slammed your pencil down on the bare table see this pcs going to make an arc break or die trying the next thing you know you got the throwndown cans the rage the yap and so forth and if still nothing happens you are going to get just silent pc but you dont recognize that at any time all you had to do was start auditing the pc because of course you were doing auditing you were doing an unnecessary unneeded action see its noauditing situation if you want to know what makes arc breaks its auditing it isnt bad auditing its auditing you see auditing can be conducted in such way as to be auditingas to amount to auditing of any kind itll give you an idea the pcs got his item see you can do this in dynamic assessbut i dont advise you to do thisbut i can show you how to get into trouble fast pa got his item knows that youre going to go ahead and get his goal tells you inadvertently that he has pain in his hip and you start running from where could you communicate to hip see what im talking about pc would get pretty upset now look supposing you did that for three sessions oh man thered just be living with this pc dont you see and that will happen inevitably you must recognize whatever other factors seem to present themselves whatever happens to be present that there is something even more powerful than the missed withhold see you can put pc back into session with the missed withhold you can pull the missed withholds and its necessary action and so forth but theres something more powerful than that and that is making auditing occur or making auditing possible see that is more powerful that is stronger action than pulling missed withholds im not downgrading pulling missed withholds im trying to show you how powerful this action is oh ive had pc just say awwr awrr awrr rum ruung rarwr uruawr and that goes down and its just terrible and so on ouwrouwrouwr and you pompous ass what the hell are you doing sitting there and so forth and just say to the pc all right now if you calm down now were going to go ahead now and were going to run this process here and lets get the direction of your goal not another word out of the pc and nothing showing on the meter i just want to show you you have in your hands pure magic audit see it is pure magic you also have something in your hands which is pure poison which is pretense of auditing without auditing its actually quite dangerous to be almost an auditor it would be better to be out there sweeping the streets any day youd live much happier life the person who is almost an auditor but who isnt and really doesnt audit goes through the motions of auditing see asks questions that sound like auditing see get meter in front of them and do things with it just as though theyre auditing now ifthe pc will just go mad remember this funny part of it is the pc will put up with relatively poor auditor who is auditing but wont put up with an auditor who is going through the motions of auditing without auditing so anything im saying is real auditing personreal auditing you would be amazed what pc will sit through ive skipped all rudiments on pc that obviously had to have them run and gone straight into dynamic assessment quite recently justzip bap zoom smooth needle pc answering up everything fineboom you see auditing probably across the top of missed withholds present time problemssee everything the liability was if i werent see if my auditing in that particular case hadnt been right straight down the groove and hadnt been completely effective i would have come cropper see the absence of the rudiments would have tripped up if i for moment had looked like i wasnt auditing these things would have all flown back in my face see funny part of it is is as long as an auditor is trying pc will put up with itjust trying but supposing you did something like this you made pretense of trying and the pc has gone wog wog row row row and theres been bad arc break the pcs havingness is way down pc feels completely in apathy and this pretended auditor the auditor whos pretending to audit but not auditing says to the pc ah look around here and find something you can have and the pc does and look around here and find something you can have and the pc does you notice the pcs doing the command and then look around here and find something you can have and then walk out of the room my god you see its like taking man in the middle of the desert you seewaterless wastes in all directionsand offer him sip of water and he takes sip of water and then you just pour the rest of it out on the sand see hell hath fury like pc not audited you practically could dish human being that way see if youre going to audit you audit now all of these things then that im talking about and frankly all of the things you think youre having trouble with are all resolvable by the delivery of auditing whether these things are political matter what dynamic theyre ondoesnt mattertheyre resolvable by auditing if there is great supreme being sitting someplace i imagine hed be awful happy if you came up some day and put the cans in his hands just think of what hes been going along with now therefore you mustnt fall short of being an auditor of course the more technically perfect you are the less mistakes you make why the better off you are you saw pc last nightreally got thrown curve i was really thrown curve i stepped on the edge of the emeter and the emeter was springing like it was about to leap off the stand and it was shaking on the screen did you see the emeter shake at the early part it wasnt secured it was secured so as to be sprung you see well now maybe you werent aware of it but it was the pc who made it that way hed set up an auditing room that couldnt be audited in dont you see now stop and think about that for minute think of what this was here was the pc who had done it had fussed up the auditor till the auditor gummed up the front of the session see and starts asking for goals before he starts the session because this was quite surprising to have an meter suddenly start jumping at you see but look the pc had an overt now there was the liability in the session not what happened to you see see the liability was the pc was starting the session with an overt well did you see clean that up straightaway before we did anything else and it cleaned up didnt it well whats the difference there the difference is simply this that pc has confidence in the auditor and also the auditor straightened it up dont you see so there is actually great liability to technical flub if the fundamental underlying all of this is correct which is the auditor means to audit and is auditing do you see this i dont know i think there are two or three here that if theyd been caught in that exact position with bouncing emeterthe pc had placed it there the pc now had an overt on the sessioni think they would have wound up at the end of session with that needle still rough rock slamming everything gone to hell unable to get in any of the end rudiments or anything else dont you see how that was see but auditing demanded that it be straightened up before we did anything else and of course that was what occurred i was rather by the way afterwards glad it happened youll do the same thing some day just remember though dont so you got flustered so things went to hell so you more than sat down in the auditing room and the plateglass window of the room shattered itself in the windstorm and seven flying pieces hit the pc you see this isnt good enough reason to have bum auditing session see the auditing comes above all that and beyond all that and matter what happens you straighten it out and continue and it all comes out all right so long as youre auditing so long as you really mean to audit that intention by the way is something that apparently cant be counterfeited pc can read it wrong sometimes youll sometimes see in some institution or another some poor devil cowering back against the edge of the padded cell screaming screaming you know saying dont come near dont touch youre leper and that sort of thing and you say good god what do i do now well maybe perhaps these words will come back to you you audit thats all thats wrong with him you dont say i am not leper hell the fellows got some reality even if its corny one dont q anda with the noauditing situation hes setting up put in your rfactor and your hfactor put them in you know im here to try to get you out of this and i think i can do so if you give little hand here and help out now touch the wall hes already touching the wall thank you touch the floor hes already touching the floor thank you touch the wall thank you touch the floor thank you touch the wall all of sudden he says what the hell im touching the wall hey im touching the floor where am i hell come out of it little bit and look at you and say who are you you just tell him youre his auditor simple dont go into any vast explanation about it if you dont ever intend to see him again dont tell him so but if you intend to see him again why say pc be around sometime tomorrow well do the same thing well get you out of this if we can and the attendants of the place would be treated to some fantastic scene such as nobodys ever been able to come near this person or talk to this person or do anything with this personnobody ever has picks up the stool and tries to brain him and next time you go why youre liable to see something like he opens the door little bit wider and dusts the stool off for you never offers you the tiniest bit of violence thats as long as auditing occurs see thats the magic thats the magic that underlies all other magic now what interrupts this magic and what basically causes the apparent revolt against dianetics scientology auditing and auditors what does it what mechanism of the mind is it is it missed withholds yes but its the biggest missed withhold of all and it has to be very special kind of missed withhold called dynamic or an item or goal thats the missed withhold now the funny part of it is that it doesnt matter what the persons goal is or his item or his dynamic it doesnt matter what it isremember that person is thetan and down underneath all of this never lose sight of the fact you can say that well rons wrong people are not basically good because look at that guy see just look at him see remember that word basically and an appeal to that person directly past all this wreckage that hes got strewn about reaches and gets that thetans cooperation and when you can get that thetans cooperation to his own salvation youre in but you can only get it so long as you sincerely are going to proceed along and actually audit that person thats necessary part of it therefore it really doesnt matter what persons goal is or the persons item or the persons dynamic you have there an individual and the heartbreaking thing about all the crime wars and upsets of the world is that they were not caused by that individual they were caused by the misapprehensions of that individual and the most misapprehension of all misapprehensions is his considerations of the dynamic and item as result of his carelessly postulated goal and that is the most there is now were dealing here with human behavior i could lecture to you for weeks and actually say it better than if an individual exists and can be reached then anything he is doing wrong or does wrong thereafter is the result of his not being reached and not being audited in other words it doesnt matter what his goal is it doesnt matter what his item is it doesnt matter what his dynamic is and so forth this person will cooperate this person will cooperate but the thing which makes it tough to reach him is of course his goal and the item which has grown up as his pet antipathy and then the dynamic in which hes included all the badness of existence hes fighting against shadows but these shadows are quite real to him so youre going to get into trouble occasionally with somebody basically through noauditing situation because of his goal he has goal which is antipathetic to dianetics and scientology in his opinion and the great oddity is is you might sit around for some time and look at this goal that he consideredthat committed us to being oppterms and try to figure out how in the name of common sense it could include us you could see at once how scientology would not make it impossible for him to attain this goal you can see this at once but he has never been able to through the various aberrations and difficulties and situations he has been in in existence it is borne home to him that you match up to his oppterms his goal is maybe to audit people so youre standing in his road see now some other fellow has goal to damn all practitioners and he doesnt consider us oppterms so its actually on the pcs interpretation and his experience on the track which has determined the oppterm more even than the goal so you cannot predict from having found the goal whether or not you are an oppterm or not see thats not predictable given known goal all right lets take this goal to be happy this person cant be audited apparently you practically have to sit on their chest and feed the cans into their hands and tape them down because theyre just all arc breaky and nattery and the meter doesnt operate well and that sort of thing any time auditing falls short of very effective auditing one day you come into session and youre little bit tired and youre little bit cranky yourself youve been sent lot of telexes or cables from lot of madmen why you flub you know you dont feel like going in today and doing too much along this line you just dont feel like it so you say well well take it easy today and i think thati think wed better run little prepcheck on the goal make sure that its right and so on you feel this would be pretty easy to do my god you got this pc at your throat see its just that much of letdown of auditing and the pcs at your throat see you may even have done something that you couldnt even interpret as an action but it wasif youll go back and look at itit was something that didnt add up to auditingnot in the pcs estimationin your estimation too now you did something that wasnt auditing or that wasnt effective auditing you did something wrong you werentit wasnt that you made technical flub its that you werent trying in some direction or another you want to see pc really get upset with you get halfway through to finding their goal consider its too hard and sort of knock it off sort of try to patch the pc up so you can turn him loose oh my god dont let that ever happen to you youd be surprised there was somebody here on staff finding some of the staffs goals he actually made some progress he was doing all right what he did wrong was take on too many pcs he should have taken one and carried through dont you see and he dropped people with only dynamic found or detested person found or something like that and he ended off their auditing and they all got mad at him he actually wasnt very smart doing this but theres what happened see and they were all kind of cross with this fellow rock slamming case is one who would get rock slam this is piece of slanguage that we have been using lately rock slammers whats rock slammer well rock slammer isnt somebody you can get rock slam on it would be wrong if you assumed that this piece of slanguage means that somebody who gets rock slam when you ask them consider overts against scientology and that broadens out of course against ron against the organization or against an auditor and you ask those four things ron scientology organization scientology an auditor and you get rock slam doesnt mean the persons unauditable youd be amazed and yet they such person would consider you part of their most mortal enemies you are an enemy and their meter behaves weirdly when you try to audit them you get suppressed meter you get slamming meter youll probably misinterpret this because you think that because you can turn slams on to everybody this makes every case one of these cases it does not this case would actually directly have to rock slam when you ask them one of those four items you just pick them uplll show you how you do ityou just pick them up put them on the meter turn your meter up and you dont open session or anything you just say consider committing overts against scientology consider committing overts against ron consider committing overts against the hasi consider committing overts against an auditor then on any one of those four if this pc develops and picks up rock slam you got security risk it is that phenomenon which has made things unpeaceful for the last twelve years it was not any vast international organization it wasnt even the poor old suckchiatrist or the psychoanalist or the psychologists wasnt any one of these boysnone of these boyswasnt any government nobody was after you its just this phenomenon amongst our midst that has given us bad time because this other phenomenon matches up with it thisthese people by the wayi dont know i cant give you percentage figure but certainly is never any more than 20usually in an organization would be around 10 or around 5 percent its some tiny figure its very small figure and youll be running group someday youll want clearing co audit all right let show you how this works out clearing coaudit you get everybody everybody goes out and they find you people to be part of your clearing coaudit and youre enrolling people youre going to teach them to coaudit and youre going to find all their goals and terminals everythings fine you know youre auditing and everythings going along dandy but in clearing coaudit theres ample opportunity for noauditing to occurample because you yourself are not auditing the cases all the time so therefore it sets up little bit of nerviness on the part of the members of that coaudit youre not doing 100 percent auditing on them personally weve just had central organization go this way i wondered what the trouble was in that area all auditing was being reserved for few members on staff and wasnt being given to the public well the place was caving in man the second i tried to salvage it in the last twentyfour hours to keep it from going bankruptand i do mean to keep it from going bankruptthe most piercing screams you ever wanted to listen to and the darnedest lot of lies and balderdash you ever heard of blew off and do you know all it breaks down to youre stopping our auditing schedule got that thats all they had it all stacked up you see you get people figuring it out this way they can figure it out so logically they could say lets see theres only couple of people here who can find goals so therefore the smart thing to do is to have totally cleared central organization and then we can be an example to the whole public and the poor lesser staff member he isnt getting any of this the doors are closed see on any of it coming into the hgc see technology is going to pieces left and right im afraid society has to survive ive had people in the past put up to this well why dont you ron take one person and clear that person and teach him how to do so and then have that person clear another person and teach him how to do so and so forth inevitably that person has been rock slammer that surprised you didnt it ive unwittingly used this principle many times in the past unwittingly i would occasionally put out projected action and if certain people that i knew to be hostile to us immediately embraced the idea i didnt do it but if they fought the idea i put it into effect at once it was beautiful method of screening promotional and release ideas there were about dozen of them in england and there are about dozen of them in the us and if you heard from those people that your action was bad then you heard from all twelve see then you knew youd done right i didnt know why this was well now get little further on this the american psychological association is only furious with us for one reason i found this out i found it out from governmentemployed psychologist in washington dc two or three or four years ago you realize we wont release our materials do you realize that they would hold on to them too if they had all our answers thats the kind of remarks that were being made to auditing would have solved the situation now we have several staunch enemies by the way what is auditing well in this case it was just some information all the information was available but they evidently couldnt pick up pieces of paper they were too heavy or something all they wanted to do actually was publish some of our ease histories in their national magazine in america thats all we really had to do i didnt care to make peace so in actual fact it was i who kept the game going just by being so disgusted with them in the past they would have taken these things maybe they would have written snapping snarping comments about them who cares but they would have taken them and published them with the full graphs and everything else in their periodicals they just looked idiotic to and i was busy but that was auditing now those people would undoubtedly rock slam on you or us because those people are violently antipathetic to the principles in scientology do you know whats basically wrong with them well you get somebody out here trying to pass bulletin and youve got them on the meteryouve been doing thata lot of that lately if you cared to follow back what their basic disagreement on this line of approach was you would discover it was something terribly fundamental and you very often do this and they pull up something fundamental some basic disagreement they have with this line of reasoningand the moment that that is pulled up why zzipp and all of sudden they can learn the bulletin and its all all right have you seen this all right now lets take this on broader level the psychologist has agreed 100 percent that man is an animal thats inherent in the practice of psychology thats professor wundt 1879 leipzig germany its not one of my gags man is an animal there is nothingtheres not even nothingnothing in his head see hes collection of gray matter and the gray matter squiggles this way and it makes him see and it squaggles that way and he hears see hes meatrobot and theres nothing else present this is very interesting because theres an earlier fundamental earlier than this which makes liar out of them its psycheology study of the human psyche and all of their textbooks start out by having to tell you they dont know anything about this and dont have anything to do with their definition of their own word you read their textbooks we have nothing to do with the psyche and nobody knows anything about it anyhow and so we take offman is an animal quicklike you know and get in there you got an earlier agreement that makes scientology acceptable to them argue with them about the derivation of the word psychology dont ever argue with them about whether or not man is an animal youll blow off their disagreement with us theyll say man is an animal he is not spirit when they say man is an animal they mean man has spirit so they have an awful time trying to study what were doing but that would be acceptable to them because it would be auditing it would be clearing up something which was definitely antipathetic and antisurvival to themselves the individual existed before the goal just as the word psychology existed before man is an animal see the goal is later than the individual the goal is less fundamental than the individual now it is only the antipathetic goal and maybe you wont be able to see why but the person will have interpreted it this way which gives you trouble inorganizationally and in groups as i started to tell you moment ago there youll be in this co audit everythings going along fine everything is very smooth youve got everybody auditing and all of sudden theres complete mutiny everything goes bzztaauugh and people are going to quit and theyre chopping each other up over in the corner and you cant where the hell did this come from and you say well its that grace and agnes over there theyre having and mabel becky and so forth im just have to get ahold of them and pull their missed withholds well look you can pull their missed withholds until youre black in the face because the biggest missed withhold is the goal and one of the mad things you do is pull that persons goal first because that rewards the rebel and you mustnt reward the rebel the thing you do is put them on meter and when you start enrolling coaudit you put those people on the meter and you ask those magic four questions and if you get somebody who slams on any one of those four questions dont enroll them in the coaudit i dont care how scarce you are in numbers dont enroll them and also dont throw them away now you could convene subcoaudit if you wanted to supposing you collected four such people out of unit of fifty well youve got subcoaudit in other words hang the rock slam around their necks and theyre not going to cause any trouble because youve asised it it isnt even that they wont stay with you as matter of fact theyre much more likely to stay with you than some people that dont rock slam against you of course all the time theyre with you theyre trying to slit the tendon in the back of your ankle and so forth and slip the ground glass into the cornflakes theysomehow or other theyll get this emergency call on the telephonethey happen to be the only one present telephone rings they get the emergency call and its call that youd better come down to the hospital at once because of and then somehow or anothertheyre intentions always seem to be so good see they actually cant be detected because thetan is clever beast and theyll write you note and theyll put it on the edge of the table closest to the sideboard and then as they walk out and put on their coat it will brush off and fall down and then they can show you that they did write you note but that it fell off you never can quite spot it youre left with this odd feeling of it isnt quite all right and honest to pete you can go around getting ready to blow your brains out as matter of fact youll start shooting down good people after while if this keeps on and thats just what they want now theyve accomplished ittheyve started dissent the rock slam the rock slam will be dramatized by this person lf you slip up and arent auditing this person very directly then that rock slam is going to catch up with some part of your activity youll find out that all of the silly things you say youre going to do they will agree with and make sure you do and all of the smart things you were going to do that really should have been done theyll somehow or another dissuade you from doing them but youll never quite be able to trace exactly how you were dissuaded or influenced youll probably think its your own idea these people are pretty weird lets take husband and wife the wife has always been good she has always been perfectly good and she has gone along she has done her job she has done this and done that and on the surface of the thing appears to be little hero and the husband hes gotten so he drinks quite bit and he stays out late at night and he isnt working you get the two of them on an emeter and you say to the wife consider committing youroverts against husband or john or bill or whatever his name is see and see if she rock slams and get hold of the husband and put the husband on an emeter and say consider committing overts against wife mabelwhatever her name is i dont think anybody was ever as unlucky as to rock slam against his wife while his wife was also rock slamming against him that would be catastrophe man the marriage isnt likely to break up theyre stuckbut it would be pretty grim but one of those will rock slam against the other and the one who is rock slamming is the one who is doing the other one in matter how innocent it all looks matter how many motivators this person seems to have that is the person theres question about it that is the person you watch that youll be ablewhen youre called on for marriage consultation things like thatyoull be able to use the principle there to great advantage so shes insisting that he get audited she probably rock slams against scientology too see thatll mess you both up now you can stay out of an awful lot of trouble if you know these principles you can handle tremendous number of situations having to do with groups if you know these principles and you can understand human behavior knowing these principles better than you ever have before if you havent got your hands on the persons dynamic item and goal seeif you havent got your hands on ityou can at least say okay that person has got goal which is antipathetic to this other activity well it doesnt mean that all activities are good and it doesnt mean that all the goals are bad because goals are assistive in life as well as detrimental theyve given one an experiential track theyve done all kinds of wild things maybe person cant operate very well these days in the sphere of his goal maybe he has an awful lot of hard luck but delete that goal and youve given him back all the effectiveness in that zone youve given him back his whole experiential track and thats not nothing youve given him now the ability to carry it out therefore in an organization in clearing coaudit in marital situation or in any other group you have surefire way of testing the person who has to be straightened out or the person who is messing it up its the person who rock slams when that group is mentioned thats the rock slammer consider committing overts against the magic words you never saw this before because we didnt have the magic words consider committing overts against we just said the group you see we just said the dynamic we just said the item we never saw the rock slam and didnt realize that the rock slam was concatenation of accumulated overts now it isnt just one bad act that makes rock slammer its trillions of years of bad acts that make rock slam so dont treat rock slam as something that is light rock slam is very meaningful it takes long time to make rock slams so the person has had long time to do suppressions so somehow sometimes you have to tiger drill the thing that you were testing before itll test yeah you just give it an ordinary tiger drill polish the thing up and say consider committing overts against it see lets say were trying to test for an aircraft company so we say aircraft company you know then tiger drill aircraft company on this company has there beenhas anything been suppressed you see just tiger drill clean it up and see if the person rock slams but the action im trying to bring to your attention is is we are without enemieswe are without enemies basically if we lose everybody loses and if we win everybody wins were in that weird situation situation that nobody has ever been in before therefore its little bit hard to understand this situation lf someone were to cave us in and knock us out they would lose well isnt that weird if someone is actually able to paralyze you as an auditor then the person would lose so let give you the last onetwo of the security check its an overt act of an auditor not to pick up and pay attention to the rock slammer because hes letting the person lose and making it possible then for everybody to lose dont you see im not trying to hang you with an overt in that direction but look at it that way rather than this poor fellow is being victimized by us because he rock slams sir hell only win if you do something about it hell never win otherwise because hes rock slamming as far as were concerned in the wrong direction and thats what we have been facing and thats what weve been fighting for the last twelve years the few isolated rock slammers that misguidedly wish to knock us off because they confuse us with their items dynamics and so forth and dont think that any amount of argument will make them go straight nothing will make them go straight but finding the goal wherever you see trouble in scientology you are looking at the action of rock slammer wherever you see an organization creaking wherever you see pcs being dispersed or coaudit being knocked to piecessomewhere mixed up in that there was rock slammer the way to straighten it up is to isolate the rock slammers dont refuse them auditing put them over in little group over to the side say now were going to take care of you going to fix you up give them some hope because theyre alive too but dont let them mess up the rest of it because then they never will get clear now theres sensible program for handling it sensible pattern as i think you will agree thats whats been giving us our trouble thats the only thing thats going to give you trouble there you are of course the greatest enemy of man is not man the greatest enemy of man of course are goals which tend to condemn man and everybodywhen straightened out wont thats very interesting view and vista isnt it so matter how troublesome situation looks you look into it youll find the rock slammer you solve the situation by removing them talk to the rest of it bring in peace to the area that is the formula and theres something more powerful than any aberration and thats auditing and youve always got that as weapon thank you modern security checking shsbc page 1 of 1 ttžêïøþìñýpic 99ãðëàìà áá
