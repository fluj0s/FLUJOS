anatomy of the spirit of man date something can be done about it now the hideous thing is that people at large are not aware of very interesting thingthat anything at all can be done about anybody they are not aware that anything can be done about anybody the cop who gives you ticket takes it in his normal stride that this is just the way it is the hospital attendants who have picked the remains out of the drunkendriving wreck the very best thought in various professions that should have to do with this are all agreed that theres nothing you can do about it and that is the principal agreement you are running into when you try to tell somebody about scientology now thats how far south you have to go something can be done about it and if you were able to tell somebody not about scientology past lives or dianetic prenatals but just this something can be done about maladjustment poor behavior poor control and human relations that leave something to be desired now if you could just drive that message homesomething can be done about thisyou would have accomplished more in getting that person into twoway communication than almost anything else you could do this excerpt was taken from anatomy of the spirit of man congress willingness to play the game an article by l ron hubbard excerpted from the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures did it ever strike you that life at large could be as much fun on its broadest scale in the fullest definition of nice football game there could be as much enthusiasm to even the small mundane ordinary things as there might possibly be to playing very exhilarating game its almost farfetched isnt it to think that talking to ones fellow man and engaging in cashing check and doing this and doing that could be continuous exhilarating experience even though it wasnt big and huge and dramatic it isnt the amount of motion or action it isnt the stake it isnt the grandeur of the trappings that make game its the willingness of those about us to play game which makes game and when we lose sight of that we lose the game and life becomes serious onerous arduous dogeatdog endeavor and the degree that people are unwilling to play the game in this society is measured by the number of handcuffs the number of jails the number of hospitals and institutions and the number of laws now it takes few laws to make game youll always have to have some barriers and restrictions to make game but when you get too many you get game except this game the game of making more laws that will make more laws necessary and thats game for attorneys but not for citizens now wherever we look then and find people miserable or unhappy or believing that they could not possibly survive or have good time all were looking at is community which is composed in the majority of people who cannot play game and will not let other people play one now thatsthats an interesting thing if we want to classify and qualify the last stages of psychosis it would be game anywhere with nobody and thats thatperiod now the last stages of exit is simply game and when we get duress and punishment all out of proportion to the communication necessary to continue game we get game well now some people may believe that there is game in going around and shooting arresting fighting drawing people up in battalions and firing by volley or playing catch with atom bombs between one agency in washington and another agency in russia but there arent very many participants to this game are there theres slightest chance for the average citizen to participate in game called atomic warfareno slightest chance they havent even got good civil defense outfit that you could join you know but here we have the common denominator of what we could call civilization civilization would be of course gradient term but we could say good civilization would be that civilization in which the individuals of which it was composed could play game and knew they could play game and were playing game called culture and if that attitude could exist you would immediately of course have human rights respect for ones fellowsall these things would fall into line these are symptoms of how well the game is going l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture the game called man this lecture is available in the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures available in the
