prepared seru ms toxins and viruses3 the 1913 senate report for the vsta stated that the legislation would prevent the introduction into the united states of da ngerous and worthless viruses serums and analogous products for use in the treatment of domestic animals some of which products may be the means of introducing disease not now known in the united states and also for the purpose of contro lling the use by preventing the interstate shipment of similar dangerous and wort hless products that may be manufactured within the united states4 revisions in 1985 99th congress after seven decades the original provisions in the vsta faced challenges from modernized agricultural sector and more co mplicated regulatory environment congress amended the vsta in the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 title xvii sec1768 to 1 authorize usda regulate intrastate as well as interstate movement of biological products 2 broaden the secretarys aut hority to issue regulations 3 enhance enforcement powers and 4 recognize congressional view that regulation is necessary to prevent and eliminate burdens on commerce and to effectively regulate commerce5 senate report cited the need for national uniform standards in the preparation and sale of biological products6 the same report refers to jurisdictional issues between usda and the food and drug administration f da regarding the need to update the law and preserve usda authorities two recent federal court decisions have created confusion and concern among the producers of animal biologi cal products and those who utilize them the thrust of these decisions is that usda has primary re gulatory authority over finished products physically moving in interstate commerce but all other products such as those made and sold within single state are s ubject only to food and drug administration jurisdiction these intrastate products ar not subject to usda licensure and fda has so far not asserted its authority over them in comprehensive manner in the meantime interstate products remain firmly under the jurisdiction of usda the narrow intrastate versus interstat distinction found in the vsta longer exists for any class of comparable products federal laws make such distinctions for humanuse pharmaceuticals animal drugs food additives color additives medical devices processed food meat and poultry pr oducts or pesticides all are subject to uniform federal regulatory standards whether they cross state lines or not7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22014crs3 8 drawn primarily from crs report rl32414 the private

transferred most major border inspecti on functions immigration customs and agriculture to the department of homeland security dhs the vsta was one of seven agricultural laws affected by this tr ansfer the law did not change provisions in vsta but only moved certain functions from one department to nother the purpose was to unify all major border inspection ac tivities under the jurisdic tion of one department after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 although dhs now conducts the physical inspection of imports usda continues to have jurisdiction over vsta regulations and policies including setting such policies for imports the secretaries of usda and dhs are to consult each other and coordinate their regulatory and inspection practices for more on border inspections and the tran sfer of inspection f unctions to dhs see crs report rl32399 border security inspections practices policies and issues analysis of provisions and regulatory action8 except as permitted in the act the vsta makes it unlawful for any person to prepare sell barter or exchange anywhere in the united states or to ship or deliver in or from the united states any dangerous or harmful virus serum toxin or analogous product intended for use in the treatment of domestic animals9 the vsta further requires that person w ho prepares sells barters exchanges or ships any virus serum toxin or analogous product do so in compliance with usda regulations through an establishment holding an unsuspended and unrevoked usda license10 the vsta authorizes th secretary to issue susp end and revoke licenses for the maintenance of establishments that pr epare viruses serums toxins or analogous products for use in the treatment of domestic animals in 21 usc 152 the vsta also prohibits the importation of any virus rum toxin or analogous product except under permit from the secretary of agriculture the secretary of agriculture is also aut horized to make and promulgate rules and regulations as may be necessary to preven t the preparation sale barter exchange or shipment of dangerous virus serum toxi n or analogous product for use in the treatment of domestic animals or otherwise to carry out the vsta consequently the animal and plant health protection service has issued comprehensive set of regulations governing the licensing of viruses serums toxins or analogous products 9 cfr 101124
