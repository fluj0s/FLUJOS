the bilderberg group by dr j h retinger august 1956 the bilderberg group bydr j h retinger few years ago large number of people began to feel anxious about growing distrust of america which was making itself manifest in western europe and which was paralleled by similar distrust of western europe in america this feeling caused cons iderable apprehension on both sides of the atlantic and in 1952 i felt that it was of the first importance to try to remove this suspicion distrust and lack of confidence which threatened to jeopardize th postwar work of the western allies i therefore approached hrh prince bernhard dr paul rykens and m paul van zeeland with the suggestion that we should organize some unofficial and private meetings to discuss the difficulties and dangers which were causing us so much anxiety to these meetings we would invite influential and reliable people who carried the respect of those working in the field of national and international affairs and whose personal contact with men at the summit of public activity could help to smooth over these difficulties acting on the advice of my three friends i approached about dozen other people viz mr hugh gaitskell majorgeneral sir colin gubbins mr ole bjorn kraft m guy mollet dr rudolf mueller m antoine pinay m p pipinelis m max brauer marshal of the raf lord portal of hungerford ambassador quaroni and signor gasperi in our view the improvement of relations between america and europe ought not to be undertaken through any special publicity or prop aganda since it was of far greater consequence to us to have mutual understanding and goodwill among men occupying the highest positions in the life of each country than to try to influence the man in the street directly we had to consider how it would be possible to hold frank and full discussions on the problems in official international meetings which are attended by representatives accompanied by retinue of experts and civil servants there are few opportunities for discussion for three reason s 1 through fear of indiscretion representatives discuss only the problems not their mutual reactions or the reactions those problems would provoke among the western countries 1 they are swamped by details and practical considera tions instead of being able to go to the core of the subject under discussion 3 if they are not able to reach agreement on certain point they shelve it in order to avoid giving the impression of disunity consequently incidents occur which could have been fore seen and which are almost unavoidab in such circumstances on the other hand when international meetings take place between representatives of only few countries not all interrelat ed problems can be discussed because there is adequate representation to emphasize the points of all individual countries finally the leaders of public life are not only po liticians other big interestsreligious financial industrial tradeunionist intellect ualare also responsible for the relationship among countries the second point we had to consider consisted in ensuri ng that frank conversations could take place without running the risk of being misinterpr eted by the press and that there should be interminable speeches for the sake of publicity it was cl ear therefore that such conversatio ns had to be conducted privately unofficially and confidentially and for this reason we decided not to admit the press to our meetings restricting publicity in general to one or two very short communiques which do not go into any detail s nor mention any individual speakers in order to ensure that neither the subject of our discussions nor the names of the participants should be given any publicity experience has proved this course to be the right one since our debates take place in spirit of comp lete frankness and discretion and participants are never afraid that anything they say will be used against them everybody who attends our meetings does so in his private capacity even if he is the leader of government party or an association and thus he is not responsible to his supporters for any thing he may say in order not to be accused of starting an unofficial political mafia we decided from the outset not to consider ourselves policymaking body but to have as our principal aim the smoothing over of difficulties and tendencies among countries and the finding of common approach in the various fieldspolitical cultural economic and social moreover we do not contemplate taking any direct action we draw the attention of existing organizations to the points in question what those organizations do remains their own responsibility for this side of our work however we have always had the tacit approval of the governments of the countries to which the participants belong we have tried to attract to our gr oup and our attempt has been successf ul people of various tendencies although we have not considered it necessary to have representative of every tendency of every national group we think there is necessity for instance to have every catholic country represented by catholic and every protestant country represented by protestant we believe that we should invite to our group certain number of cat holics wherever they may come fro m as long as they have full authority within their sphere of influence and of cour this applies equally to protestants in the same way with tradeunionists it has not proved necessary to have representative of tradeunionists from all the western european countries for this reason also it has been our custom to invite representatives in the proportion of onethird politicians and onefifth business men and tradeunionists the remainder being intellectuals professional men and other aders of public opinion the first essential is undoubtedly to have me1n of absolute personal and political integrity the second to have men of real international standing or whose position in their own countries is such as to give them considerable influence in at least an important section of the population men who in their own field hold position of authority and enjoy the confidence of their fellowmen the third to have men with obvious nationalistic bias and who are broadminded when it comes to other peoples problems which ma conflict with their own last but not least men who in addition to the qualifications just mentioned can be considered as animated by the highest public spirit it was further decided that to ensure all these conditions official organization or association would be set up and party tendency or interest asked to nominate their representatives instead we would choose the people to be invited to take part in our meetings mostly guided by the nature of t he subjects to be discussed and using great care to preserve st rict balance this decisi on has proved wise one we hold roundtable conferences with people whom we believe represent the general opinion of the leaders of their country at our meetings however we draw conclusions but there is voting on resolutions our chairman is hrh prince bernhard at our first meeting however m van zeeland presided while at our first international gathering at bilderberg the chairmanship was held in rotation as follows prince bernhard belgian an american for various reasons it was later decided that it woul d be better to have one chairman and to the satisfaction and pleasure of all co ncerned hrh prince bernhard accepted this position he is the convenor of our international meetings over which he also presides i am myself responsible for all the spadework for the group as whole as well as for the members for western europe while mr joseph johnson undertak similar work in the american group mr paul rykens is the superintendent of our treasury steering committee has now been set up which is composed of the original members on the european si except that the late signor gasperi has been replaced by signor amintore fanfani in addition the following persons have become members sir terence airey mr jens christian hauge mr d healey mr n van kleffens mr reginald maudling mr alfred robens professor carlo schmid and mr otto wolff von amerongen on the american side there are five members in addition to mr johnson viz mr george ball mr john h ferguson mr h j heinz mr george nebolsine and mr dean rusk so far as participants in the international conferen ces are concerned the main core remains the same but since there are always different problems to be studied different people must be invited to each conference it is our desire to keep this group as loosely knit association with rules of procedu re except those acquired by experience for th is reason and because of the f act that there are properly established offices the central office having been set up in my own flat the running expenses are very small moreover i myself as honorary secretary invo lve the group in financial obligations only my immediate collaborators consisting of not more th an four people receive any remuneration apart from the cost of running the office the expenses consist mainly in covering the cost of meetings f the steering committee and of international conferences it must be added however that the hospitality at these conferences is always offered by the host countr while the cost of the work of the secretariat simultaneous interpretation translation printing etc is borne by the international secretariat the total expenditure therefore is small and has so far been covered completely by private subscriptions th us the money received or spent has strings political or otherwise attached to it most of the year 1952 was spent in private consultations between two or thr ee people first meeting was held in paris on 25 september 1952 and was attended by all the original members of the group prince bernhard of the netherlands mr hugh gaitskell sir colin gubbins m guy mollet dr how and when the noneuropean personalitie s especially the american joined our group will be explained later rudolf mueller m antoine pinay m p pipinelis dr j h retinger mr paul rykens and m pa ul van zeeland the only two who could not attend were lord portal and signor gasperi at this m eeting we discussed what could be done to improve americaneuropean relations and on the initiative of m van zeeland we decided to set up corresp onding group in the united states in november 1952 i went to the united states so on afterwards came hrh prince bernhard and finally m van zeeland we approached certain mbers of the democratic administration which was still in office mr averell harriman was especially interested in this work but of course the new administration had to be consulted and on the advice of members of the truman administration we approached republican leaders h rh prince bernhard m van zeel and and myself contacted large number of americans of both parties and their reaction was always very good owing to the change of administration and for other practical reasons it took some time to form an american group finally however through the good offices of mr c d jackson and mr john coleman an american group was constituted and it was decided to call conference which actually took place in bilderberg from 29 to 31 may 1954 later on mr coleman was obliged on account of illness to retire from the chairmanship of the american team and was succeeded by mr dean rusk it was thought useful to appoint an american honorary secretary who was and s till is mr joseph johnson duri ng the four years which followed other countries were invited to join in our work an d participants from the following european countries have been present at our meetings austria belgium denmark france germany greece italy the netherlands norway portugal sweden and switzerland from outside europe apart from mericans we have had at our conferences personalities from ca australia new zealand and pakistan so far four plenary conferences have been held 1 bilderberg oosterbeek holland 2931 may 1954 2 barbizon france 1820 march 1955 3 garmischpartenkirchen germany 2325 september 1955 4

ideological aspects b economic aspectsarticle 2 of the north atlan tic treaty the political and strategic aspects of atomic energy the reunifica tion of germany european unity the industrial aspects of atomic energy economic problems eastwest trade b the political aspects of convertibility c expansion of international trade the causes of the growth of antiwestern blocs in particular in the united nations the role played by anticolonialism in the relations between asians and westerners common approach by the western world towards china and the emergent nations of south and east asia the communist campaign for political subversion or control of the newly emancipated countries of asia how best the west can meet asian requirements in the technical and economic fields steering committee was formed from the original founders of the group in which the americans mentioned above now participate subjects which do not need long preparation as far as papers to be presented are concerned and for which an attendance of fifteen to twenty people seems sufficient are discussed from time to time in this smaller group since the group is not policymaking body its principal object being to smooth over difficulties between western europe and the united states with view to improving their mutual relations toget her with difficulties among european countries or even certain extraeuropean countries it would be impossible to define what the group has achieved we certainly provide meetingplace for various distinguished personalities having authority in their ow n particular fields of action we have found that an exchange of views is very helpful and may sometimes produce new ideas and that in way the group may be factory of initiative we decided however that none of the new ideas and initiatives would be developed by the group but that they should be passed on to some persons or organization who could further develop them
