released to staff at the september briefings to assess the potential impact on states claims to representatives if these figures were to be used to apportion seats in the house instead of the official apportionment figures rel eased by the census bureau on december 28 2000 although seats would shift among st ates based on these numbers the already narrow margin between north caro lina and utah for the last 435th seat in the house is narrowed by factor of 10 this re port will be updated when the census bureau releases final numbers from the cqr program background one of the fundamental issues before th framers at the constitutional convention in 1787 was how power was to be allocated in the congress among the smaller and larger states the solution ultimately adopte d known as the great or connecticut compromise resolved the controversy by creating bicameral congress with states represented equally in the nate but in proportion to population in the house the constitution provided the first apportionment of house seats 65 representatives were allocated to the states based on the framers estimates of how seat s might be apportioned after census house apportionments thereafte r were to be based on article 1 section 2 as modified by the fourteenth amendment amendment xiv section 2 representatives sha ll be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers article 1 section 2 the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand but each state sha ll have at least one representativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21638crs2 2 the actual language in article 1 section 2 pert aining to this minimum size reads as follows the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand but each state shall have at least one representative this cl ause is sometime misread to be requirement that districts can be larger than 30000 persons it should be read as minimumsize population requirement ie districts cannot have fewer than 30000 persons 3 55 stat 761 1941 sec 22 codified in 2 usc 2a in other words after the 2000 census this report was due in january 2001 4 ibid sec 22 b 5 us dept of commerce bur eau of the census

apportionment formula was adopt ed in 1941 in addition to specifying the apportionment method th 1941 act ts the house size at 435 and mandates administrative procedures for apportionment the president is required to transmit to congress statement showing the whole number of persons in each state and the resulting seat allocation within one week after the opening of the first regular session of congress following the census3 the census bureau has been assigned the responsibility of computing the apportionment as matter of practice the dir ector of the bureau reports the results of the apportionment by d ecember 31st of the census year once the results are received by congress the clerk of the house is charged with the duty of sending to the governor of each state certificate of the number of representatives to which such state is entitled within 15 days of receiving notice from the president4 there are provisions for altering the pportionment because of errors that may later be found in census counts the census bureaus federal register program notice pertaining to the count question resoluti on program states that while corrections made to the population and housing unit

to congress showing the current tally of change s to the official counts identified as of september 30 2003 but not all challenges to census counts had yet been processed the most significant changes affect north carolina whose 13th representative was the last 435th seat assigned in the official reappor tionment of house seats following the 2000 census as of september 30 2003 north carolina w ould have its official 2000 census count reduced by 2673 persons because according to the raleigh news observer the census bureau counted 2696 students living in uncc h university of north carolina chapel hill dormitories twice7 students in dormitories are supposed to be enumerated by the group quarters procedure where form s are sent to the institution instead of individuals in the group quarters in the case of uncchapel hill forms were sent to some students as well as to the university the discrepancy between the 2673 and 2696 figures is accounted for by other cqr activities in north carolina as of this writing the census bureau has not completed evaluating all challenges to the north carolina figures so these figures may change but the numbe r of persons north carolina would need to lose for its 13th district to drop to the 436th position in the apportionment rankings would be reduced from 3084 to 309 persons if these new numbers were used to reapportion the house if congress were to choose to do so on nationwide basis 7183 persons are eith er added to or subtracted from state populations resulting in net change of 1427 persons from the september 30 2003 cqr program data seats

explanation of formula for allocating house seats could the cqr changes shift house seat as noted previously the preliminary cqr corrections released on september 30 2003 would not alter the apportionment of hous seats when compar ed to the official results and the census bureau does not plan to alter the official apportionment figures if further corrections would chan ge the apportionment there are 19thcentury precedents for the congress to change apportionments af ter the initial results have been released in 1852 congress increased californias legation by one representative because it appeared that the returns of the population of californi are incomplete8 section 2 of the act provided that if at any future d ecennial enumeration of the inhabitants of the united states the census of any district or subdivision in the united states shall have been improperly taken or if the returns of an district or subdivisi on shall be accidentally lost or destroyed the secretary of the in terior shall have pow er to order new enumeration of such di strict or subdivision9 additional representatives were added to the totals initially provided by the reapportionment acts following the 1860 and 1870 censuses eight states received one additional seat by supplemental pportionment act approved in march 186210 another supplemental apportionment act enacted in may 1872 assigned one additional representative each to nine states11 when congress accepted challenges to census results the 19thcentury precedent was to increase the size of the house not to take seats from states there are examples similar to the 19thcentury precedents noted above in the 20th century but the last time new states were admitted between censuses the house size was temporarily increased to 437 until the next reapportionment when it became 435 again12 if further refinement of the 2000 census data reveals that the apportionment would be changed if the corrected numbers were to be used instead of those used in december 2000 congress could alter the appor tionment by legislation
