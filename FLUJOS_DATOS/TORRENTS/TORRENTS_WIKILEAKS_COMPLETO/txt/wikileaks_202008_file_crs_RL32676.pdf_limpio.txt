nasas funding is part of the vahudia appropriations bill which is division i of the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 the 16070 billion is 45 increase over the agen cys fy2004 appropriation of 15378 billion importantly congress granted nasa unrestrai ned transfer authority to shift money between its budget accounts except for certa in activities specified in the conference report hrept 108792 nasa must notify congress of its plans for spending the money until that notification is submitted it is not possible to specify how much the agency will spend on any particular program other than the few specified in the conference report separately nasa receive d 126 million in fy2005 emergency supplemental pl 108324 for hurricane relief th senate commerce committee reported fy2005fy2009 nasa authorization bill s 2541 but there was floor action authorization bill was introduced in the house debate over nasas fy2005 budget took place as nasa responds to the announcement of new goals for the us sp ace program by president bush in january 2004 and recovers from the february 2003 space shuttle columbia tragedy nasa hopes the space shuttle will return to flight in 2005 at which time assembly of the international space station iss can resume returning the shuttle to flight and completing construction of iss are the first steps in president bushs vision for space exploration in which nasa will fo cus its activities on returning humans to the moon by 2020 and someday sending them to mars and worlds beyond the vision involves human spaceflights as well as using robotic sp acecraft as trailblazers for human missions and to investigate whether life may exist elsewhere in the universe president bush emphasized that achieving these goals is journey not race white house and nasa fficials stress that the vision will take many years to accomplish spanning multiple congresses and presidential administrations thus the fy2005 request is the opening of debate expected to span many budget cycles the bush administration does not plan to add much funding for nasa to fulfill the vision instead funding w ill be redirected from nasa activities not directly related to the vision and by terminating the space shuttle and the space station programs earlier than many had ex pected that approach to funding the vision may mitigate concerns about rising deficits or negl ecting other national priorities in order to fund the vision but it s ubjects the plan to criticism that the total agency projected funding level is insuffici ent and that the plan will preclude other important nasa activities in space science ear th science and aeronautics this is the final edition of this report an abbr eviated version is av ailable in crs report rs21744

material provided by nasa in that or previous budget estimates and previous crs reports in this series nasas fy2005 budget was subject to 080 acrossthe board rescission congress gave nasa in the words of the conference report hr 4818 hrept 108782 unrestrained transfer authority to shift money between its two major budget accounts exceptions were made for few programs specifically mentioned in the conference report on which nasa is directed to spe nd the specified level of funding until nasa notifies congress of its plans to spe nd the funding it is not possible to state how much is allocated to nasas other activities or how the rescission will be applied thus this report does not adjust nasas funding for the rescission other than at the total agency level where fy2005 funding levels are stated they are taken directly from the text of the conf erence report ie prior to the rescission nasa has been restructuring both its budg et and its headquarters organization over the past several years the structure of this report and its budget tables follow the format and content of what is presented in nasas fy2005 budget request documentation this may not match what appears in

of the worl ds first satellite s putnik on october 4 1957 in the 47 years that have elapse d nasa has conducted far reaching programs in human and robotic spaceflight technology development and sc

andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs3 budget omb mr okeefe is the 10th nasa administrator his predecessor was mr daniel goldin who held the position for almost 10 years nasas changing organizational structure nasas organizational structure has changed periodically throughout the agencys history beginning in the 1990s following initiatives by the clinton white house and congress to emphasize stronger strategic planning for and better management of government agencies nasa organized its activities as set of strategic enterprises that roughly paralleled its program offices initially there were four human exploration and development of space heds which encompassed activities within nasas offi ce of space flight primarily the space shuttle and the internationa l space station and the offi ce of life and microgravity sciences primarily concerned with the health of the astronauts and research that could be conducted on the s huttle and iss space sc ience including robotic exploration of the solar system space telescopes etc earth science spacecraft that study earth and its climate and aerospace technolog primarily aeronautics research and efforts to develop new reusab launch vehicles to replace the shuttle in 2000 thenadministrator goldin rename d the office of life and microgravity sciences as the office of biological and physical research obpr and elevated it to enterprise status thus when mr okeefe became adminis trator at the end of 2001 there were five enterprises aerospace technology biological and physical research earth science human exploration and development of space and space science in 2003 he created sixth education and with it an office of education to consolidate educational activities that had been managed in different parts of the agency they were labeled acade mic programs in the budget in january 2004 following president bushs vision speech see major nasa budget issues below he created seventh terprise by dividing aerospace technology into aeronautics research and exploration sy stems the exploration systems enterprise and its office of exploration systems is charged with implementing many aspects of the vision the fy2005 budget request therefore is based on those seven enterprises and their associated offices aeronautics biological and physical research earth science education exploration systems space flight and space science for decades within the space community nasas program offices have been known by and referred to by their mail codes the ffice of aeronautics as code r the office of biological and physical research as code u the office of earth science as code the office of exploration systems as code z the office of space flight as code m the office of space science as code s and the office of

aeronautics and education enterprises comprise the expl oration science nd aeronautics account the exploration systems and space flight enterprises comprise the exploration capabilities accounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs8 nasa has been changing its budget structure over the past several years as well as its organizational structure discussed earlier some of the changes reflect the organizational modifications but others ar the result of nasas decision to shift to full cost accounting which is explained in last years version of this report crs report rl31821 briefly it means that all program costs including civil service salaries and facilities eg are c ounted in programs budget instead of separately as was done in the past the shift to full cost accounting began in fy2002 making budget comparisons with pr ior years virtually impossible at the program level ge nerally budgets can be compared on yeartoyear basis at the program office level space science earth science etc but there are exceptions because projects some times are moved from one program office to another for example project prometheus to velop space nuclear power and propulsion originally was in the office of space science because its first application was for robotic probe to jovian moons in fy 2005 however it was shifted to the office exploration systems because it may have wider

act hrept 108792 do not include the level of detail needed to definitively determine totals for the subcategories in this table also congress gave nasa unrestrained transfer authority to shift funding between its two major accounts thus the figures shown as the conf numbers for those two accounts may change as they are adjusted for the rescission or nasa makes other changes the totals shown for nasa do not include 126 million for hurricane relief provided in an emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 108324 the supplemental funding was not subject to the rescission nasa requested that this account be renamed exploration science and aeronautics to emphasize the vision for space exploration so that is the name used in this table however congress declined to rename it retaining last years name science aeronautics and exploration nasas fy2005 request assumes cancellation of the space launch initiative reallocation of its remaining funding and restructuring of crosscutting technologies of which sli was part not including funds for research aboard the space station which is in the biological and physical research line for fy2004 that is 578 million for fy2005 it is 549 million summary of congressional action the following is summary of actions taken on the fy2005 budget request as noted in the preface the amounts discussed in the remainder of this report are as provided in the conference version on h r 4818 and are not adjusted for the 080 acrosstheboard rescission many of the programs mentioned in this summary are discussed in more detail ter in the report sepa rately nasa received 126 million in an emergency supplemental that was attached to the fy2005 military construction appropriations act pl 108 324 for hurricane relief in brief nasa requested 16244 b illion and congress appropriated 16200 billion those figures by themselves may not sufficiently convey the controversy that surrounded nasas budget and may be somewhat misleading because more than 1 billion of the funding must go for activ ities that were not included in the budget request first as noted the 16200 billion is subject to the 080 acrosstheboard rescission making the actual tota l 130 million less 16070 billion second during the time congress was considerin g the fy2005 request nasa concluded that it needed an additional 762 million in fy2005 to return the shuttle to flight status also congress directed nasa to spend 291 million on hubble servicing mission and added at least 200 million in ot her congressionallydirected spending consequently the amount of money ava ilable to cover the content of the fy2005 request is approximate ly 148 billion 1607 billion minus those amounts therefore even though it might appear that nasa got what it requested for fy2005 difficult choices will have to be made about what progra ms to fund as discussedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs10 4 the senate vahudia subcommittee did not hold formal markup on the bill instead the bill was polled out the report srept 108353 was drafted following subcommittee markup and many of the figures in the nasa section do not reflect the 800 million added during full committee markup the 800 million addition is reflected in the bill language where it can be discerned that the 300 m illion for hubble was split as indicated here which is not clear from the report language also some of the figures in the report appear to be incorrect for example it says on p 3 that the committee provided 15579200000 for nasa the same as the fy2004 level in fact the committee provided 16379200000 and the fy2004 level was 15378 billion thus the report should be used cautiouslybelow congress gave nasa unprecedented authority to transfer money between its two major accounts allowing th agency to make those choices fy2005 appropriations the house appropriations committee version of the fy2005 vahudia bill hr 5041 hrept 108674 cut 11 billion from the request much of the reduced funding wa s from new initiatives associated with the vision the committee stated that it s upports the vision but does not have sufficient resources to meet the full budg et request for nasa in fy2005 however the committee is hopeful that if additional re sources are identified as the legislative process moves forward it may be possible to augment nasa funding the committee declined to rename the science aeronautics and exploration budget account as the exploration science and ae ronautics account as requested stating that it is supportive of the explorati on aspects of nasas vision but does not believe it warrants top billing over science and aeronautics the committee fully funded the space shuttle program and the ma rs exploration program which includes the two robotic rovers spir it and opportunity now expl oring the martian surface the senate appropriations committee s 2825 srept 108353 recommended 164 billion 135 million over the request that includes 800 million designated as emergency spending 500 million for the space shuttle in addition to fully funding the 43 billion request and 300 million for mission to repair the hubble space telescope the funding for hubble was split as follows 100 million in the exploration ca pabilities account and 200 million in exploration science nd aeronautics account the 800 million in emergency spending was added during full committee markup of the bill on september 21 2004 the vahudia subcommittee had recommended 1558 billion for nasa reduction of 665 million from the request4 neither chamber brought the vahudia ppropriations bill to the floor for vote instead compromise version essentially conference report was incorporated into hr 4818 the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 that act gave nasa unrestraine d transfer authority except for programs specifically identified in the conference report hrept 108792 thus it is not possible at this time to definitively stat how much funding most individual nasa programs received according to media reports conferees had agreed to fund nasa at level of 159 billion in hr 4818 but house majority leader delay insisted that nasahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs11 5 gugliotta guy delays push helps deliv er nasa funds washi ngton post december 6 2004 a1receive 162 billion or he would not bring the bill to the floor for

that were specifically identified in the committee reports and by conferees on hr 4818 the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 these tabl represent best effort to identify those cuts and additions but should not be considered definitive report language is not always clear for example as to whet her money is being added for an activity or nasa is being directed nasa on how to sp end money within the requested amount also the sums of the specified additions and reductions in the house and senate committee reports do not result in the totals shown for the budget accounts so other

identified in this table in other cases the funding is for specific project in home state or district with specific performer identified such as university in still other cases congressional report language may be unclear about who the performer is giving only the name of an activity such as hydrogen research initiative that could be reference to the doe led program to develop hydrogenfueled

various definitions of earmark some define it broadly to mean any funding added by congress others define it more narrowly to mean funding added by congress for specific project conducted by specific

just dreams we need an agreed vision and then nasa can execute that8 on january 14 2004 president bush announced new vision for nasa the presidents vision for space exploration is likely to form the basis for congressional and public debate about nasa and its budg et for many years to come prior to columbia the white house displayed little interest in the space program other than improving financial management at nasa particularly with regard to the international space stati on iss program space program supporters pointed out that as governor of texas president bush never visited johnson space center jsc in houston9 which is home to nasas astronaut corps and major nasa center involved in the human spaceflight program his appointment of nasa administrator sean okeefe w ith background in public administration rather than aerospace was viewed by space program s upporters as signal that nasa was not high priority for the bu sh administration mr okeefe had been deputy director of the office of manageme nt and budget omb where he was best known to the space community as the architect of the plan to truncate construction of the iss in light of substantial cost growth announced days after president bush took office see crs issue brief ib93017 space stations by marcia smith at nasa mr okeefes early actions seemed designed to emphasize that robotic space exploration rather than human space flight was his priority he created new vision statement and mission statement for the agency and declared that nasas mission was sciencedriven appa rently indicating that new programs would be chosen based prima rily on their scientific value whereas human space flight traditionally had top billing in nasa budget documents he renamed nasas budget accounts and reversed the order of their appearance apparently to emphasize that scientific missions were the raison detre for the agency and space flight capabilities such as iss and the shuttle existed to support those goals between his hardline position on iss cost growth and symbolically demoting iss and the shuttle to place behind science aeronautics and robotic space exploration many human space flight supporters worried about the future meanwhile president bush was silent about the space program the situation changed after the columbia tragedy however president bushs first public statement about the space prog ram was informing the nation of the loss of columbia and her crew three days later he vi sited jsc to pay tribute to the crew on that first and to date only journey there his speech raised hopes

clearing house via factiva 12 as discussed later in this report although congress funded nasa at level very close to its request for fy2005 which would indica support for the vision conferees explicitly noted that congress has not yet endorsed the initiative and called on the appropriate authorizing committee to provide guidance thus the extent to which congress embraces the vision remains unclearof the human space flight program saying the cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we choose it is desire written in the human heart10 year later on january 14 2004 speaking from the auditorium at nasa headquarters he made major space polic address in which he directed nasa to focus its activities on returning humans to the moon by 2020 and someday sending them to mars and worlds beyond this vision for space exploration is discussed below in contrast to hi s april 2002 announcement that nasa would be sciencedriven mr okeefe made clear in press conference immediately after the presidents announcement that nasa now would be driven by exploration goals it will be informed by the science to be sure and there are science objectives youll see but theyre specifically driven by exploration goals11 the presidents directive set in motion by columbia dramatically altered nasas plans whether or not it proceeds as outlined by the president its announcement already is changing the agency by challenging longstanding expectations for example many had ssumed that the space shuttle would operate at least until replacement for it was ava ilable the presidents plan calls for terminating the shuttle in 2010 and terminating the pr ogram that was developing technologies for successor the space launch initiative instead crew exploration vehicle will be built to take astronauts to the moon but its earth orbital version would not be available until 2014 meaning that the united states will give up its own capabilities to place astronaut s in space for four years nasa will have to rely on russia for transporting astronauts to iss if such an agreement can be negotiated nasas us of iss itself would change from broadlybased scientific research program to one focused only on what is needed to accomplish the vision importantly nasa would end its use of iss six or seven years after construction is completed instead of 10 years or more as planned it is not clear that congress will approve those decisions12 but the proposal alone is substantial paradigm shift if the vision is implemented as outlined by the president the columbia accident will be remembered as lead ing to the termination of the shu ttle program but it would also have served as the catalyst for the united states to embark upon bold new directi on in human space exploration if the vision is not embraced by congre ss and the public it is not clear in what direction nasa will travel return to the pre columbia expectations of the space shuttle and space station operating to 2020 or beyond seems unlikely nasa identified 116 billion in fy2005fy2009 that could be redirected to fund thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs18 13 mr melville is often referred to in the media as the first commercial astronaut but there have been several individuals who have flown into space as representatives of their companies rather than space agencies what is different about mr melville is that he is the continuedvision see table 5 if congress and the public are not persuaded to embark upon the vision or not to proceed at the pace called for in the presidents speech is it reasonable to assume that the proposed 116 billion in cuts can be made in any case how long should us participation in th iss program continue if the vision is delayed or rejected under the president s plan the only apparent reasons for us involvement in iss are fulfilling its co mmitments to the other partners in iss canada europe japan and russia and pe rforming research associated with the vision if the latter rationale is liminated ar the international commitments sufficient to warrant spending 67 billi on 24 billion for the space station and 43 billion for the shuttle in fy2005 alone are they worth the risk to astronaut lives inherent in human space flight or are there other reasons that us taxpayers may wish to continue the human space flight program such as its oftcited value in demonstrating us technological leadersh ip stimulating children to study math and science or satisfying the intangible desire written in the human heart noted by president bush in his tribute to the columbia crew in short if the vision is adopted by congress and the public nasa will shift from sciencedriven agency to an expl orationdriven agency with the focus on human exploration beyond low ea rth orbit if it is not adopted many believe the shuttle program and us use of the iss may be terminated earlier than had been expected anyway with clear direction for the future whatever the outcome events spurred by the columbia accident represent major turning point for nasa and the us space program the potential impact of spaceshipone on quite different note another factor that could shape nasas future is growing role for commercial space activitie s the topic of commercial space activities generally is outsi the scope of this report but the success of spaceshipone the first privatelydeveloped spacecraft capable of taking people to space could have important impacts on nasas future direction built by aircraft designer burt rutan and his company scaled composites spaceshipone is small spacecraft that is delivered to an altit ude of approximately 50000 feet by an airplane called white kn ight the spacecraft then separates from the airplane and fires rocket engine to reach an altitude of at least 100 kilometers 625 miles that altitude is designated by an international aeronautical record keeping organization the federation aerona utique internationale fai as the boundary between air and space there is legal definition of that boundary spaceshipone does not go into orbit th flights are suborbital and once exceeding the 625 mile mark the spacecraft return s to earth and

was to win the 10 million ansari xprize httpwwwxprizecom mr allen was widely reported to have spent about 20 million on the project to win the compan had to launch spacecraft capable of carrying three

he founded company virgin galactic to offer commercial suborbital flights and someday orbital flights on new generation of spaceships he reportedly expects to invest about 100 milli on in the new spaceships and associated ground infrastructure and char ge 190000 per person per flight14 thus spaceshipone is seen by many as the first step in ushering in an era of affordable space tourism the first sp ace tourist was american dennis tito who flew to iss on russian soyuz spacecraft for oneweek visit in 2001 he was followed by south african mark shuttlewo rth in 2002 according to press reports they each paid approximately 20 million mr branson and others believe that the comparative affordability of spaceshipone flights will make space tourism more realistic possibly for many people

and the universe including new space telescope the president invited other countries to join in the initiative cost and budget includi ng the sand chart one of the first questions raised by the vision is whether or not the nation can afford it at time when the federal budget is under considerable stress due to the war in iraq and rising budget deficits initially the president and nasa did not

stressed that it should not be too little as in the house version or too much as in the senate version19 the paucity of public statements in support of the vision by the president therefore was not necessarily signal of lack of white house support as discussed next congre ss ultimately appr opriated total for nasa that is quite close to its requested amount 16200 billion compared with the 16244 billion request house majority leader delay is widely credited with winning that funding level for nasa20 while the total is close to the request it does not reflect an acrosstheboard rescission of

space shuttle to flight discussed elsewhere in this report conferees explicitly stated that congress has not yet taken s ubstantive action endorsing th project they called on the appropriate house and senate author izing committees to provide guidance and authorization for the effort thus the extent to which the fy2005 appropriations act can be viewed as sign of congressi onal support for the vision remains unclear congress gave nasa significant latitude in how it spends its fy2005 funding the conference report refers to it as unrestrained transfer authority between nasas two major accounts nasa must tify congress of how it plans to spend the money until it does it is not possible to definitively determine how much funding will be allocated to visionrelate d programs other than the two specifically identified in the conference report r obotic lunar probes and the centennial challenges program fy2005 budget request nasa chart identifies 45 billion of the agencys fy2005 162

in the appropriations proce ss the house and senate appropriations committees expre ssed support for the presidents goals but cited the constrained budgetary climate as factor in their decisions to cut some of the vision related programs the house appropriations committee made the following cuts 230 million from prometheus 438 million from cev the request was 428 million but the house report said 438 million would be saved by delaying cev 100 million from sli to accelerate termination and 30 million from technology maturation related cuts in other parts of nasa ch as all 70 million from the robotic lunar probes are shown in table 3 the senate appropriations committee made the following cuts 8 million from prometheus 160 million from cev using 438 million as the requested level as cited in the house report all 115 million from technology maturation and 10 million from centennial challenges related cuts in other parts of nasa ch as 50 of the 70 million for robotic lunar probes are shown in table 3 conferees largely left the issue of how to allocate the fy2005 budget to nasa itself of the visionrelated projects th two for which funding level is specified are robotic lunar probes and the centennial challenges program the first in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs26 robotic lunar probe series is the lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro for which nasa requested 70 million the confer ees provided 10 million instead and directed that less than 25 of the instru ments be designed to answer basic science questions about the moon rather than on applied engineering assessments of potential human and robotic l unar landing sites in support of the vision they argued that since the lro is funded from nasas space science budget some of the instruments should support science goals the conferees provided 10 million of the 20 million for centennial challe nges program that will offer prizes for those who develop innovative technologies for th vision subject to the passage of authorizing legislation that would permit nasa to awar d prizes larger than 250000 which they can do based on existing law the conferees also provided 3 million for modeling and simulation related to systems development for the vision confer ence report language is not clear as to whether that is an additional 3 million or if nasa is to use that amount of otherwise appropriated funds for that purpose report language provided further inform ation on the conferees concerns about the vision their comments included the following they directed nasa to include in ll future budget justifications the phaseout schedules for programs that will be terminated in order to fund the vision they directed the national academy of sciences to conduct thorough review of the science that nasa plans to undertake as part of the vision and develop strategy by which all of nasas science disciplines earth science space science life and microgravity science and scie nce conducted aboard iss can make adequate progre ss towards their goals and provide balanced scientific research in addition to supporting the vision the review is due by march 15 2005 they noted that although they we re appropriating substantial funds for the vision to date there has been substantive congressional action endorsing the initiative the conferees note that the initiative is very longterm endeavor nd will require tens of billions of dollars over the next two decades as such the initiative deserves and requires the delibera tive benefit of the congress to this end the conferees call upon the appropr iate committees of jurisdiction of the house and senate for ac tion to specifically endorse the initiative and provide authorization and guidance they directed nasa to forward comprehensive package of authorization legislation for consideration by the 109th congress they were concerned that nasa wa s not giving adequate attention to the heavy lift launch requirement s of the vision they directed nasa to report to the appropriations committees within six months of the bills enactment regarding those needs and how to meet themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs27 they were concerned that initial planning for the cev is insufficient and directed nas to provide the appropriations committees with report detailing the criteria and developmental goals the cev must meet and other information within 60 days of the bills enactment they cautioned nasa not to repeat the mistakes of the space station progra m where poor management and lack of independent oversight resulted in major cost overruns they directed nasa to identify an independent oversight committee capable of examining the design technology readiness and most importantly the cost estimates for the cev that committee is to report to the nasa administrator and the appropriations committees on their findings and recommendations return to flight of the space shuttle as already discussed the space shuttle columbia broke apart as it

shuttle challenger tragedy which killed seven astronauts the programs we re suspended for 21 months and 32 months respectively the primary purpose of the shuttle system today is support of the iss most of the remaining segments of the iss awaiting launch were designed to be launched only on the shuttle the shuttle also is used to take crews back and forth construction of iss has been suspended since the columbia accident nasa and its international partners in the iss prog ram canada europe japan and russia have been keeping twoman crews aboard iss using russian spacecraft in the interim nasa and its contractors are working to resume shuttle launches as soon as possible consistent with ensuring the shuttle is as safe as possible in order to continue iss construction nd servicing one issue is whether schedule pressure could influence shuttle program managers to take shortcuts and if the vision adds to that pressure president bush has called for iss construction to be completed by 2010 at which point the shuttle system would be retired in order to free funds for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs28 22 at the time of the fy2005 budget request nasa anticipated rtf costs of 238 million in fy2005 which it thought it could cover using reserves in the shuttle account by november 2004 nasa estimated 1 billion in rtf costs in fy2005 after applying the 238 million in reserves the balance needed is 762 millionvision nasa estimates that 28 shuttle launches are required to complete construction nasas fy2005 request include s outyear projections that reduce the shuttle budget by total of 15 billi on in fy2008 and fy2009 to help pay for the vision see table 5 the caib cited schedule pr essure as one factor in the columbia tragedy it also noted that fundi ng was taken from the shuttle budget over several years to pay for other nasa programs particularly iss nasas willingness to slip rtf repeatedly suggests to some that nasa is proceeding cautiously but the agencys plan to launch 28 flights in less than six years makes others worry that an environment similar to that prior to columbia is being recreated although the budget projec tion for the vision assumes reductions from the shuttle program in fy2008 and fy2009 in the near term shuttle costs instead are increasing nasa revises its implementation plan for rtf periodically usually issuing new estimate of rtf costs and emphasizing that the actual costs are not known in july 2004 the total estima for fy2003fy2009 was 22 billion twice the previous estimate of 11 billion nas reported in november 2004 that it will need 762 million more in fy2005 expected for the shuttle program22 as discussed later in this report there is much debate about the shuttles future fy2005 budget request for fy2005 nasa requested 43 billion for the space shuttle program compared with 4 billion in fy2004 nasa informed congress in november 2004 that it needs 762 million more in fy2005 for the shuttle program but budget amendment was not submitted congressional action congress appropriated 43 billion the house and senate appropriati ons committees both had recomme nded full funding and the senate committee also adde d 500 million designated as emergency spending the conference version however provided the requested level and noted that the administration could request supplemental funding or transfer funds from other nasa programs if necessary hubble space telescope the hubble space telescope launched in 1990 was designed to be serviced regularly by astronauts servicing missions via the space shuttle in 1993 1997 1999 and 2002 installed corrective optics repa ired and replaced aging components and added new more advanced scientific instruments at the time of the columbia tragedy another servicing mission was pla nned for 2004 shuttle flight and shuttle mission in 2010 was planned to retrieve the telesc ope and return it to earth these plans changed in january 2004 when administr ator okeefe citing safety concerns announced that the space shuttle will longer be used for flights to hubble eitherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs29 23 the announcement was made two days after president bushs vision speech leading some to conclude that the decision not to rvice hubble was linked to the need to redirect nasa spending to fund the vision nasa fficials insist the hubble decision was independent of the vision and was based on shu ttle safety considerations and the need to use the shuttle to complete iss the decision is controversial and is discussed in crs report rs21767 24 national research council assessment of options for exte nding the life of the hubble space telescope national academies press 2005 httpbooksnapeducatalog11169htmlfor servicing or for retrieval23 nasa estimates that without servicing mission hubble would cease scientific operations in about 2008 and if left unattended make an uncontrolled reentry in about 2012 nas is now considering various options including the possibility of robotic serv icing and deorbiting throughout most of 2004 robotic options dominated the public discussion of hubbles future on december 8 2004 however report by the national academy of sciences found it unlikely that nasa will be able to ex tend the science life of hubble through robotic servicing recommended servic ing mission by astronauts in the space shuttle and recommended r obotic mission only for deorb iting the telescope after the period of extended science operations enabled by shuttle servicing24 in past years there have been concerns in the scientific community about the relationship between the end of hubble ope rations and the beginning of operations of its planned successor the james webb space telescope jwst these issues mainly revolved around nasas plans to fund jwst from the wedge created by reduction in funding requirements for hubbl related concern was the possible impact on scientists if there is ga p in operations between hubble and jwst although these issues remain they have b een overshadowed this year by the question of the future of hubble itself fy2005 budget request for fy2005 nasa requested 1301 million for hubble including 297 million for development 69 million for operations and 935 million for data analysis at the time the fy2005 budget was released shortly after mr okeefes announcement that the shuttle would not fly to hubble nasa intended to cancel the 2004 servicing missi on entirely and was only in the earliest stages of studying the possibility of robotic retrieval for this reason the potential costs of robotic servicing and retrieval were not incl uded in the fy2005 request press reports indicated that nasa might submit an amended request to reflect current plans but budget amendmen t was submitted mr okeefe has been quoted as estimating the cost of robotic servicing at between 1 billion and 16 billion and nasa estimates the cost of r obotic retrieval at about 300 million these estimates are bound to be imprecise however since possible designs are still under investigation and final decision has not yet been made about which options to select congressional action because of the uncertainty about the future of hubble the house appropriations committee stated that it took ac tion at this time with regard to funding for the hubble program but w ill reevaluate the programs needs as they become more defined the nate appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs30 committee provided an increase of 300 million for hubble 200 million in the exploration science and aeronau tics account and 100 million in exploration capabilities the senate increase was designated as emergency spending the conference agreement provided 291 milli on for hubble servicing mission describing successful servicing mission as one of nasas highest priorities the conference report directed nasa to repor t to the appropriations committees within 90 days of enactment regarding the status of its plans detailed budget issues this section follows the format of th nasa budget as shown in the agencys fy2005 budget estimate the names of th two major budget accounts are different from fy2004 and as discussed above nasa s management structure changed in august 2004 so some of the program offices described below longer exist these changes and nasas shift to full cost accounting discussed earlier make it difficult to compare nasas budget across year s other than at the total agency level exploration science aeronautics this budget account was entitled scien ce aeronautics exploration in fy2004 budget documents the shift in the order of the words reflects nasas new emphasis on exploration in accordance with the vision the house appropriations committee declined to rename this category stating that while the committee is supportive of the exploration aspect of nasas vision the committee does not believe it warrants top billin g over science and aeronautic s p 128 the senate appropriations committee agreed to nasas proposed change but conferees adopted the house position thus the account was not renamed in the fy2005 budget request the account includes the offices of space science earth science biological and physical research aeronautics and education the offices of space scien ce and earth science focus on increasing human understanding of space and earth nd make use of sa tellites space probes and robotic spacecraft to gather and trans mit data the office of biological and physical research funds research conducte d in microgravity environments to study

planet finder mission space telescope nasa plans to build key issue impact of the vision the key issues in the space science area in the fy2005 budget are the future of the hubble space telescope discussed above and the possible impact of the decision to redirect nasas activities to support primarily space science activities directly related to the vision rather than other space science projects tensions have arisen between the scientific communities associated with the themesin the office of space science that are included in the vision and those that are not the themes that are include d are solar system exploration mars exploration lunar explorati on and astronomical search for origins the other two themes structure of evolution of the universe seu and sunearth connections sec are not included and in the fy 2005 request some of those projects were delayed or indefinitely defe rred in the sand chart discussed earlier see figure 3 seu and sec are relegated to the other science activities category that is flat funded through fy2020 supporters of those disciplines worry that budgets for their programs will suffer because of the emphasis on the vision the national academies26 released report in october 2004 focused on demonstrating the importance of solar and space physics to the vision one of the missions that is indefinitely deferred in the fy2005 budget request for example is the joint dark energy mission part of the beyond einstein program jdem was to be joint mission with the department of energy to study dark energy in the universe which is not well understood27 this project was one of the top priorities of the national academies list of interdisciplinary research28 the american physical societyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs33 29 american

however only one bid was received and nasa rejected it nasa is now considering adding landsattype sensors to npoess fy2005 budget request nd congressional action nasa requested 1485 billion for earth science in fy2005 compared with fy2004 appropriation of 1613 billion the 1485 billion request wa s allocated as follows earth system science 1409 billion and earth science applications 77 million the house appropriations committee cut 20 million of the 54 million for the glory mission nd 15 million of the 45 million for the orbiting carbon observatory which is to provide global co2 measurements the senate appropria tions committee added 15 million to the 77 million requested for earth science applications conferees did not specify total for ea rth science they added 15 million to the 77 million for earth science applicati ons they also provided 15 million for the eosdis core system ecs synergy program that assists nasa and university researchers in using eos data key issue impact of the vision plans for earth science may change again in response to the vision the fundi ng projections for earth science submitted with the fy2005 budget request show cons trained budget for these activities and as discussed earlier the office of earth science was combined with the office of space science in the august 2004 reorgani zation these two actions are seen by earth science advocates as signs of diminished status for this scientific discipline at nasa and they expect intense comp etition for funds with in the new sciencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs35 mission directorate others point out that space science and earth science were part of the same office until nasa reorga nization in the early 1990s it was called the office of space science and applications at that time and does not necessarily indicate reduced stature biological and physical research the office of biological and physical research obpr is responsible for nas as biological and physical research enterprise it has responsibility for thr ee themes biological sciences research physical sciences research and research partnerships flight support obprs goals include determining ways to make human habitation of space safe and to use space as laboratory to test fundamental principles of chemistry biology and physics obpr supports number of programs that investigate the biomedical effects of space flight and the effects of gravity on biological processes develop technologies to support humans living in sp ace and enhance space crew health and safety research activities sponsored by obpr are carri ed out on the space shuttle on the iss as well as on aircraft and suborbital vehicles and in groundbased laboratories fy2005 b udget request and congressional action f r b p r nasa requested 1049 billion fo r fy2005 compared with 985 million in fy2004 the 1049 billion request was allocated to th three themes as follows biological sciences research 492 million physical sciences research 300 million and research partnerships flight support 257 million the house appropriations committee cut 103 million from the 309 million requested for bioast ronautics research the senate appropriations committee cut 1235 million from the request for biological sciences research of whic h bioastronautics research is part conferees did not specify total for obpr or the activities it conducts in commenting on the vision they did request the national academy of sciences to conduct thorough review of the science that nasa plans to undertake as part of the vision and develop strategy by wh ich all of nasas sc ience disciplines including science conducted board iss can make adequa progress towards their goals and provide balanced scientific research in ddition to supporting the vision key issue impact of columbia and the vision obprs budgeting and planning were affected first by the space shuttle columbia tragedy and then by the vision columbia s 16day scientific resear ch mission sts107 hosted experiments sponsored in large part by obpr other obpr research is conducted on the iss whose schedule and utilization is affected by the accident as well especially by the reduction in crew size to two people and the inability to take new experiments to iss they are designed to go on the shuttle perhaps most significantly however was the decision to refocus iss research only on life sciences research needed to support the vision instead of the broadlybased research program that was originally planned the elimination of obpr in the august 2004 reorganization also is seen as indicative of the changed status of this field of research in the agency it is not yet clear what will remain of the obpr issbased researchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs36 program and how it will fare in competing with other priorities in the new exploration systems mission directorate aeronautics research the office of aeronautics was created when the office of aerospace technology was divided into the office of exploration systems and the office of aeronautics after the pr esidents vision speech aeronautics rd has long history of government involvement starting in 1915 with the creation of the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca nasa was established in 1958 using naca as its nucle us and nacas research centers were transferred to the new agency alt hough nasa is better known for its space programs supporters note that aeronautic s is the first in nasa the aeronautics technology theme consists of programs in vehicl systems airspace systems and aviation safety and secu rity in fy2003 nasa called this theme revolutionize aviation in fy2001 and fy2002 aeronautics rd was integrated with space transportation activities in co mbined technology base and focused aerospace programs fy2005 budget and congressional action the fy2005 request for aeronautics was 919 million reduction of 11 from fy2004 most of the reduction comes from eliminatin g funds for items added at congressional direction in fy2004 other changes include 7 million in crease for aircraft noise reduction and 15 million to fund rotorcraft resear ch the house appropriations committee directed nasa to develop prioritized set of aeronau tics goals through 2020 along with associated annual funding requirements it also directed nasa to provide 25 million for intelligent propulsion system foundation technologies propulsion 21 for advancements in jet engines the senate appropriations committee provided 25 million to continue research on hypersonic engine technologies the conference agreement contained the house langua ge and provided 25 million for continued design work on the hypersonic x43c aircraft it is not clear if that the report language saying that the committee or conf erees have provided the funding means that it is an addition to requested funding or direction that nasa on how to spend appropriated funds it also expressed concern about the impact of fullcost accounting on the operation of nasas wind tunnels key issue funding congress has expressed c oncern about constraints in nasas funding for aeronautics rd for severa l years the need to reprioritize nasa spending in light of the vision may exacerbate those concerns aeronautics advocates decry multiyear slide in funding although this trend has been difficult to track recently because of changes in how nasa presents its annual budget aeronautics rd at nasa was cut by about onethird in the late 1990s with the termination of programs in highspeed research and advanced subsonic technology nasas aeronautics activities have been restructured several times including the august 2004 reorganization noted above cr itics have argued for several years that nasa lacks clear vision of

space flight support such as purchasing launches on expendable launch vehicles for fy2005 the request for explor ation capabilities was 8456 billion compared with 7521 billion in fy2004 part of the increase can be attributed to the shift of project prometheus into this account from the office of space science conferees appropriated 8426 billion for th is account but allowed nasa to shift funds between this acc ount and the account thus the total that nasa will allocate for this account w ill not be known until the agency notifies congress of its spending plans exploration systems this budget category replaces what was called crosscutting technologies in the fy2004 budget it has two themes human robotic technology and transportation systems crosscutting technologies was focused on the space launch initiative see belo w which has been terminated last years subcategories of mission and science measurement support msm and innovative technology transfer partnerships were absorbed

from the moon and rmination funds for the space launch initiative sli congressional action on the vision is discu ssed earlier in this report to recap the house appropriations committee eliminated all funds for the cev 438 million cut 230 million from the 438 million for project prometheus cut 100 million from the 261 million to terminate the sli progra m to accelerate termination and cut 30 million of the 115 million for technology maturation the sena appropriations committee cut 160 million from cev cut all 115 million from technology maturation cut 10 million of the 20 million for centennial challenges and cut project prometheus by 8 million confer ees did not specify funding am ounts for these activities the house also added 30 million to the 161 million for the ittp program for the express purpose of continuing the commercial programs including the activities of associated nasa personnel as they existed in fy2003 and prior fiscal years conferees adopted that action key issue crew exploration vehicle cev the cev is one of the centerpieces of the vision it is spacecraft that will be used to take astronauts to and from the moon although it could also be used to take them to and from iss it is the latest iteration of nasas concept for what new spacecraft it wants to build to replace the shuttle as vehicle capable of taking astronauts to space it would not replace the shuttles cargocarrying capabilities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs40 31 for more on spiral development see crs report rs21195 evolutionary acquisition and spiral development in dod programs policy issue for congress by gary j pagliano and ronald orourkenasa is using the spiral development philosophy for cev which is used for some dod rd programs31 this can be considered build little test little build little test little approach to rd where one accepts that the early versions of spacecraft or other product may not have the full capability envisioned the presidents speech directs nasa to deve lop and test new spacecraft by 2008 and that the first flight carrying crew to earth orbit take place by 2014 nasa is proceeding quickly with getting contractors to submit proposals for the cev in order to meet those dates skeptics wonder whet her it will be possible to have any version of the vehicle ready by 2008 especially wh basic decisions ch as the number of astronauts it needs to carry are yet to be made as discussed earlier conferees did not specify level of funding for the cev they expressed concern that initial planning for the cev is insufficient and directed nasa to provide the appropriations committees with report detailing the criteria and developmental goals the cev must m eet and other information within 60 days of the bills enactment they cautioned nasa not to repeat the mistakes of the space station program where poor management and lack of i ndependent overs ight resulted in major cost overruns they directed nasa to identify an independent oversight committee capable of examining the desi gn technology readiness and most importantly the cost estimates for the cev that independent oversight committee is to report to the nasa administrator and the appropriations committees on their findings and recommendations another major issue involving cev is the potential fouryear gap between when the space shuttle would be terminated 2010 and the cev would be ready for earth orbital missions 2014 that issue is discussed below see space shuttle space flight the office of space flight s upports the space flight enterprise formerly the human exploration and development of space enterprise space flight has three themes international space station space shuttle and space flight support nasa requested 6674 billion for this category allocated as follows 1863 billion for the iss 4319 billion for the space shuttle and 492 million for space flight support international space station the international space station iss has undergone many changes since it was first proposed by president reagan in 1984 for the last several years its primary purpose was described as serving as scientific research facility for conducting range of re search activities in biology physics and materials science nasa expected that re search performed in the nearzero gravity environment of the space station would result in new discoveries in life sciences biomedicine and materials sciences under the vision however the research program on iss is being redirected to focus only on the life sciences research needed to accomplish the vision not the broadly base d scientific research program that was planned httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs41 32 the texts of these agreements are ava ilable at httpwwwhqnasagovofficecodei by scrolling down to the heading related intern et resources and looking at the second and fourth bullets other nasa linksas noted earlier iss is being built as partnership among the united states russia japan canada and europe an intergovernmental agreement iga among the various governments and memoranda of understanding mous between nasa and its counterpart agencies govern the program32 the iss is being assembled in orbit assembly of iss began in 1998 and is now suspended pending the space shuttles return to flight new category in the iss budget in fy2005 is called iss crewcargo services it would fund co mmercial or foreign alternatives to the shuttle for taking crews and cargo to iss nasa officials have indicated that they would use this line item to fund for example the purchase of soyuz spacecraft or services from russia for transporting us crews however under the 2000 iran nonproliferation act ina nasa is prohibited from paying m oney to russia for issrelated purchases unless the president certifies that russia is not transferring certain nuclear and missile technologies to iran the funding in th is category also may be used to fund commercial companies to develop launch vehicles and spacecraft capable of taking cargo to and possibly from iss once the shuttle system is retired fy2005 budget request and congressional action the fy2005 budget request for the iss program was 1863 billion compared with 1498 billion in fy2004 the funding requested in this i nternational space station budget line is for construction and operation of the iss and the new iss crewcargo services line described above of the 1863 milli on requested 140 million was for iss crewcargo services customarily nasa agrees that the costs for research aboard the station currently carried in the obpr budget also are part of the space station request over time these costs variously ve been placed in obpr or in the iss account since fy2003 they have been in the obpr budget in fy2005 that request was 549 million if the two amounts are adde d the total request for iss in fy2005 was 2412 billion the house appropriations committee cut 190 million from iss 120 million from the traditional line item that include s construction and operations plus 70 million from the new iss crewcargo services line the senate committee cut the same 120 million plus all 140 million from iss crewcargo services for total cut of 260 milli on both committees also made cuts to the science accounts associated with research on iss see ob pr above conferees did not specify funding amounts for iss key issue long term future of iss twenty years after the space station program began the purpose of the space stati on continues to be questioned the bush administrations visionrelated decisions necessitate reassessment of the rationale for iss the vision calls for nasa to 1 end its use of iss by fy2017 six years after construction is expected to be completed 2 terminate shuttle missions after construction is completed meaning that there is guaranteed access to iss by ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs42 astronauts after 2010 and 3 limit its research only to that which is needed for the vision instead of the broad res earch program that was planned various rationales for building space station have been put forward by nasa over the years but the one that has remained relatively constant is the utility of space station as microgravity research laborat ory nasa was planning wideranging research program covering disciplines in the physical and biolog ical sciences using three laboratory modules nasas destin module already in orbit europes columbus module construction is complete d and it is awaiting launch and japans kibo module construction on the pressurize d portion of the module is completed under the agreements that govern the iss program nasa can use 467 of the research capacity of columbus and kibo in exchange for the electrical power and other iss services provided to europe and japan by nasa the extent to which the research capabilities of iss can be fully utilized depends in part on how many crew members are ava ilable to conduct resear ch considerable amount of crew time must be spent on maintenance tasks prior to the columbia accident when iss had threeperson crew s nasa stated that it took 2Â½ crew members to operate iss leaving the equivalent of onehalf of one crew members time for research since columbia while crews have been reduced to two to reduce resupply requirements nasa has been less cl ear about how much crew time is spent on maintenance versus research whatever the case may be today the plans were for crew size to grow to seven by the time full operations began after assembly is completed three of those crew slots would go to russia and the other four to the united states europe canada and japan the crews would be transported by russias threeperson soyuz spacecraft and nasas shuttle which typically carries seven emergency crew return lifeboat services were to be provided by russia for three people and nasa for at least four people us decisions have placed in doubt however the extent to which the crew size can grow beyond three the number that can be returned to earth in an emergency by single soyuz spacecraft the us decided not to build its own emergency crew return vehicle and passed law the ir an nonproliferation act ina pl 106178 under which nasa cannot pay russia for sp ace stationrelated activities such as providing additional soyuz spacecraft unless the president certifies to congress that russia is not proliferating nuc lear or missile technology to iran having two soyuzes always docked at iss would provide the re quisite lifeboat services for six person crew but the international partners have not been able to reach agreement on how to pay for the additional soyuzes russia has warned the iss partners for many years that it does not have sufficient funding to build that many once soyuz is in orbit it must be replaced in six months so four per year would be needed so unless the president certifies that russia is in compliance with the act one of the other partners pays for more soyuzes or russia decides to provide more soyuzes without further cash payments from nasa crew size will be limited to more than three see crs issue brief ib93017 space stations by marcia smith for more on the iss program and the

print off 1991 p 21 this report was done in conn ection with president george hw bushs proposal to send astronauts back to the moon nd on to mars the senior president bushs proposal is discussed in crs report rs21720 34 visionrelated documentation such as the sa nd chart and briefing s by nasa officials indicate that nasa will complete its use of i ss by fy2017 in order to free funding for the vision however mr okeefe said at february 12 2004 house science committee hearing that there are plans to turn out the lights at that time because the other partners might continue to use iss and we may too president bushs directive to limit nasas research on iss to only that which is required to achieve the vision is another change the two major life sciences research areas related to the vision are studying human adaptation to weightlessness and radiation protection the type of radiation to whic h astronauts would be exposed away from earths protective atmosphere how ever is different from the type in low earth orbit so the radiation research is conducted largely using groundbased facilities not the iss that leaves only research on adaptation to weightlessness for issbased studies that research is most relevant to human missions to mars the moon is sufficiently close that the crew spends only short time about three days oneway in weightlessness but journeys to mars are much longer mars trip durations would vary depending on the re lative orbital positions of the earth and mars the length of time the crew would stay on the martian surface and whether chemical propulsion or nuclear thermal propulsion is used 1991 study by the white house national space c ouncil concluded that typical mission to mars using chemical propulsion would take 224 days to reach mars and 237 days to return to earth with 458 days on mars using nuc lear thermal propulsion it stated that typical mission would be 160 days to mars and 160 days to return with 550 days on the surface33 the nearzero gravity g conditions on iss provide an environment for studying adaptation to the conditions astr onauts would encounter between earth and mars mars has 13 g and the moon has 16 g so it is not clear that the zerog research would be applicable to stays on the martian or lunar surface nasa officials have indicated that they need approximately 200 human research subjects to spend less than four months at time on iss in order to conduct the research on adaptation to weightlessness how to accomplish that in the short period of time during which nasa now plans to use the iss with crew size that may be limited to more than three people is an open question34 it is not clear how many us astronauts will be able to remain on iss for missions that last at least four months once russia fulfills an existing obligation to provide crew return lifeboat services for us astronauts in spring 2006 nasa and russia are discussing how to proceed after that time but absent new ag reement us astronauts may only be able to be aboard iss when the shuttle is docked the shuttle missions typically remain for about two weeks well short of the fourm onth requirement if the shuttle is retired in 2010 as directed by the president nas will not be able to launch astronauts to iss at all until the cev is available thus any weightlessness research could be dependent on foreign crews if they agree to be research subjects even if all agreed to do so it is questionable as to whether th requisite number of people would cyclehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs44 35 taxpayers in canada europe and japan have spent more than 10 billion on their contributions to iss reliable figure for russian expenditures is not available canada built the remote manipulator system part of which is already in orbit the arm and another part spdm or the hand is awaiting launch europe and japan have built laboratory modules and other space station ements which are awaiting launch russia built at its own expense the module that serv as crew quarters and docking module and provides routine flights of its soyuz spacecra ft to transport crews to and from iss and progress spacecraft to take cargo to iss russia plans to build other modules and an electricitygenerating array today the space station is completely dependent on russia for crew and cargo transport while the shuttle is groundedthrough iss by the time nasa completes its use of the facility especially since the soyuzbased missions last six months reducing opportunities for crewrotations since fy1985 us taxpayers have spent more than 30 billion on iss35 and it is expected that the program will continue to need approximately 2 billion per year for the next several years by deciding to limit research to only that which is needed to send astronauts to mars nasa appears to have conceded what some scientists have argued since the beginning of the pr ogram that the only research for which space station is needed is that relate d to future human space exploration not to earthbased benefits such as curing dis eases or developing new materials or purer pharmaceuticals as claimed by nasa for these many years thus the debate over further spending on i ss may be reignited barring catastrophe on the iss soyuz or on the shu ttle once it returns to flight it nonetheless appears that nasa and its partners are determined to continue construction of iss how much of it will be built and how long it will be used remain unanswered questions space shuttle the space shuttle is partia lly reusable launch vehicle capable of taking crews and cargo to and from space it is the only us launch vehicle currently capable of placing humans in space the shuttle system consists of the airplanelike orbiter two solid rocket boos ters srbs on eith er side and large cylindrical external tank that holds the fu for the orbiters engine the orbiters are reusable and were built for 100 flights each the srbs provide additional thrust for the first 2 Â½ minutes of flight then detach from the vehicle and fall into the ocean where they are recovered and refurbished for reuse the external tank et is not reusable it contains liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to fuel the orbiters engines the fuel is depleted by the time the orb iter reaches orbital ltitude approximately 8 minutes after launch at which time the et is jettisoned it breaks apart as it descends from orbit and the pieces fall into the indian ocean three space shu ttle orbiters remain in the fleet discovery atlantis and endeavour three others were built enterprise was built for atmospheric

operations contract sfoc with us on september 26 1996 with the goal of reducing shuttle operational costs while ensuring safety nasa has exercised two contract options extending the contract to 2006 nasa has not yet incorporated contracts for the external tank solid rocket boosters and space shuttle main engines into sfoc nasa manages those contracts with lockheed martin atk thiokol and boeing rocketdyne respectively fy2005 budget request and congressional action the fy2005 shuttle budget is discussed earlier in this report see key nasa budget issues return to flight of the space shuttle essentially nasa requested 43 billion in its february 2004 budget request and in nove mber 2004 informed congress that it will need an additional 762 million for fy2005 to support the shu ttle program the house and senate ppropriations committees fully funde d the february request the senate committee recommended an additional 500 million in emergency spending conferees provided the 43 billion request ed and noted that nasa could request supplemental funding or transfer funds from other nasa activities if needed key issue how long the shuttle should operate apart from the issues related to return to flight discussed earlier in this report there remains the question of how long to fly the shuttle after rtf is achieved and what if anything should replace it another part of the debate is wh ether the shuttle should be used to service the hubble space telescope that issue is addressed earlier in this report nasa sometimes jointly with the department of defense dod has been trying to build replacement for the shuttle since the early 1980s those attempts have failed however ov erly optimistic expectations about the availab ility of new technologies and about the market for such 2nd generation reusab launch vehicle rlv are often cited as reasons for the failures of the national aerospace plane x33 x34 and space launch in itiative sli programs the shuttle is the 1st generation rlv and was expected to si gnificantly reduce the cost of launching people and cargo into space because of its reusability those cost reductions have not materialized however until the announcement of the vision the ex pectation was that the shuttle would operate until some type of replacement was availabl in november 2002 nasa shifted its strategy from building new rlv to building an orbital space plane that would be launched on an expendable launch vehicle elv36 similar to the mercury gemini and apollo programs but the vision terminated the orbital space plane program as well instead the focu s now is on crew exploration vehicle cev discussed earlier but its purpose is to take crews to the moon not to the iss nasa allows that it may be used for space station missions but that is not its primary purpose there is fouryear gap between when the president plans to terminatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32676crs46 37 currently crews are rotated on sixmonth sc hedules but russia wants to increase that to oneyear nasa responded that it is not yet ready to move to oneyear missions for its astronauts 38 us senate committee on commerce science and transportation future space flight

when the cev will be availabl for earthorbital flights 2014 thus if the vision is adopt ed the united states will have chosen to eliminate its ability to place humans into space and rely on russia to provide those services for at least four years the price and other terms such as how often americans could fly and how long they would have to stay on the space station37 russia would require for those services have not been ne gotiated although there was sixyear period from 19751981 when the unite d states also did not have the ability to place humans in space this decision is di fferent in that an inability to place us astronauts on the iss could impact achievement of the vision because there would be fewer research subjects for weightlessness studies discussed earlier therefore one part of the vision ending assured us acce ss to the space station could negatively impact another part of the visi on sending astronauts to mars some members of congress want more dramatic changes to the shuttle program senator brownback chairman of the sena commerce science and technology subcommittee that oversees nasa for example has suggested that the shuttle be discontinued as soon as possible so the fundi ng resources can be used to accelerate the schedule for the vision and asked nasa to study alternatives to the shu ttle for completing the iss program38 representative barton member of the house science committee and chairman of the house energy and commerce committee insisted that the shuttle is not safe enough for crew s and should only be used in an automated mode with crews aboard in septem ber 2003 he said i am going to do everything i can within the rules of this committee and the house to prevent more americans going up in the existing orbiters i just think its inherently unsafe39 according to press reports nasa itself is reassessing how many shuttle flights should be flown after rtf nasas early estimate was that 2530 flights over six years 20052010 are needed both to deliver the remaining segments of iss to orbit and to preposition replacement parts and supplie s that were planned to be taken to the iss on an asneeded basis during the operati onal phase of the program according to space news nasas current estimate is 28 flights but the agency is reviewing how many of those are absolutely essential40 conversely others expect th at completing iss assembly will take longer than six years and expect the shuttle to continue flying beyond 2010 the president of atk thiokol which makes the shuttles srbs was quoted as saying that all

september 8 2004 108th congress 2nd sess transcript provided by federal document clearing house via factivaexperts believe the existing program has to fly through 201441 if true this could become an issue for congress because the caib stated that if the shuttle is to continue in service beyond 2010 it sh ould be r ecertified it is not clear what that process would involve or how much it would cost nasa shuttle offici has stated that the current return to flight effort will pr oduce shuttle system that is certified for whatever period of time it is needed whether all stakeholders agree with that assessment or not is unknown still others want to keep the shuttle flying until the united states has another method of taking astronauts to orbit senator kay baile hutchison and senator bill nelson have both expressed c oncern about plan in which the shuttle is terminated and the cev is not yet available particul arly since developmen t programs often take longer than planned so the gap ma be even more than four years42 thus there are several potential futures for the shuttle immediate termination termination after minimal number of iss f lights termination after 2530 iss flights or termination only after the united states s another vehicle capable of taking crews into space it is not clear today which of these paths the shuttle program will follow although considering the effort being put into rtf activities it appears unlikely that immediate termination will be chosen how much longer the shuttle will fly after that will depend on many factors including whether nasa can demonstrate that the risks inherent in the shuttle pr ogram are manageable anothe r catastrophic accident would very likely bring an end to the program how much it costs and how much nasa has to spend on it and the extent to which policy makers want the united states to have its own ability to place astronauts in space instead of relying on russia considering that the space shuttle prog ram consumes 25 or more of nasas budget the answer could be key to what other activities nasa can support space and flight s upport this budget category includes space communications space shuttle payload
