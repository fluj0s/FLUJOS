appointments 5 intersession recess appointments 7 average time to confirm nomination the average time the senate took to confirm nomination to regulatory or other collegial board or commission as well as the average time the president took to submit nomination may not be as meaningful when considering boards or commissions as it is when considering executive departments and singlehead independent agencies nearly all positions on boards and commissions are for fixed term of office and when term expires the incumbent usually may remain in office until he or she is replaced by successor moreover nomination is frequently submitted before an incumbents term expires consequently the time taken to confirm nomination generally is not as crucial for independent regulatory boards and commissions as it is for executive departments and singlehead independent agencies where nomination is generally made to position that is vacant the length of time given nomination may be pending in the senate varies widely some nominations are confirmed within few days others may not be confirmed for several months and some are never confirmed this report provides for each board or commission nomination that was confirmed in the 107th congress the number of days between nomination and confirmation days to confirm some senate recess days are not included in this sum because senators are unable to take up nominations on these days for practical reasons only days from the longer recesses around august and between congressional sessions are excluded these recesses are often longer than 30 days this cutoff point is suggested by the senate rules which provide that if the senate shall adjourn or take recess for more than thirty days all nominations pending and not finally acted upon shall be returned to the president although this rule is often waived3 the 32 days during the august 2002 recess and the 33 days between the first and second sessions of the 107th 3 us congress senate committee on rules and administration senate manual 106th cong 1st sess sdoc 1061 washington gpo 1999 p 55 rule xxxi paragraph 6 of the standing rules of the senate crs3 congress were subtracted from the days to confirm for those nominations that spanned one or both recesses days were subtracted for the august 2001 recess because as discussed below all pending nominations were returned prior to that recess an accurate calculation of the average time the senate took to confirm nomination in the 107th congress is made more challenging by an unusual characteristic of the session as just noted the senate rules provide that all pending nominations are to be returned to the president at the beginning of recesses of thirty days or more usually the senate agrees by unanimous consent to waive this rule and retain pending nominations over their recesses prior to the 31day august 2001 recess however the senate did not reach such an agreement and 162 pending nominations 13 of which were to the organizations discussed in this report were returned to the president4 the president sent forward nominations for some of these individuals again after the recess those nominations were considered to be new nominations rather than continuations of the prerecess nominations as result when such nominations are confirmed the length of the confirmation process shown in the tables of this report as days to confirm does not include any prerecess time during which the nominee was under consideration in the senate consequently the average is smaller than it would be if the pre and postrecess nomination times were added together for example the mean number of days to confirm for all boards and commissions is 70 days but if the prerecess days during which nominee was under consideration in the senate were included for all confirmed nominees this mean would be 72 days likewise the median days to confirm for all board and commission nominations is 51 but it would be 52 if prerecess days were included5 table notes provide figures that take such prerecess time into account in general however comparisons between average confirmation times from this report and those from previous reports should be made cautiously since most of these boards and commissions require political balance among their members ie more than simple majority may be from the same political 4 see sen harry reid and sen trent lott unanimous consent request executive calendar colloquy congressional record daily edition vol 147 aug 3 2001 p s8888 such unanimous consent agreement was reached however for the recess between the 1st and 2nd sessions of the 107th congress sen harry reid nominations to remain in status quo notwithstanding the adjournment of the senate congressional record daily edition vol 147 dec

aug 1 2002 p s8020 5 in this report the tables for individual boards and commissions show the mean for that organization and the table of all nominations in appendix shows both the mean and the median the mean is the average as it is commonly calculated in order to calculate the mean days to confirm for example for each organization the days to confirm data for all the confirmed nominations in the organization were added together and then divided by the number of confirmed nominations the median is the middle number when the days to confirm data for all the confirmed nominations are arranged in numerical order although the mean is the more familiar kind of average the median is included on the larger table because it diminishes the influence of few extreme entries it is not included on the smaller tables where the influence of such entries is more directly visible crs4 party the president negotiates over nominations with leaders of the opposition party in congress these negotiations involve questions not only of patronage but also of policy especially when the board or commission is involved in areas that at the time may be particularly sensitive this often results in packaging process in which the president submits several nominations together for positions in particular agency and the senate then confirms them as group sometimes however only one or two nominations are submitted when three or four positions may be available when this occurs nomination may remain before the senate for many months until one or two additional nominations are submitted generally all are then quickly confirmed the federal communications commission provides an example of cluster action the appointment process the president and the senate share the power to appoint the principal officers of the united states6 the constitution article ii section 2 empowers the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint the principal officers of the united states three distinct stages mark the appointment process selection and nomination confirmation and appointment selection and nomination in this stage the president selects the nominee and sends the nomination to the senate there are number of steps in the presidents selection of candidates for most senateconfirmed positions first with the assistance of the white house office of presidential personnel the president selects candidate for the position the candidate then prepares and submits several forms the public financial disclosure report standard form sf 278 the questionnaire for national security positions sf 86 and the white house personal data statement questionnaire the office of the counsel to the president oversees the clearance process with background investigations conducted by the federal bureau of investigation fbi internal revenue service irs office of government ethics oge and ethics official for the agency to which the candidate is to be appointed if conflicts are found during the background check oge and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflicts once the counsel has cleared the candidate the nomination is ready to be submitted to the senate the selection and vetting stage is often the longest part of the appointment process there can be lengthy delays particularly if many candidates are being processed as they are at the beginning of an administration or if conflicts need to be resolved candidates for higherlevel positions are often accorded priority in this process for positions located within state us attorney us marshal and us district judge the president by custom normally nominates an individual recommended by the senator or senators if they are from the same party as the president from that state if neither senator is from the presidents party he usually defers to the recommendations of party leaders from the state occasionally the president solicits recommendations from senators of the opposition party because of 6 succinct historical and contemporary overview of the appointment power is found in louis fisher appointment powers in his constitutional conflicts between congress and the president 4th ed lawrence ks university press of kansas 1997 pp 2248 crs5 their positions in the senate before making nomination to federal position at the state or national level the president must consider how it will fare in the confirmation process nominee has legal authority to assume the duties and responsibilities of the position the authority comes with senate confirmation and presidential appointment nominee who is hired as consultant while awaiting confirmation may serve only in an advisory capacity if circumstances permit and conditions are met the president may give the nominee recess appointment to the position see below recess appointments may have political consequences however particularly if senators perceive that an appointment is an effort to circumvent their constitutional role some senateconfirmed positions such as many of those in the executive departments may also be temporarily filled under the vacancies act7 positions on most boards and commissions however are not covered by this act8 confirmation in the confirmation or second stage the senate alone determines whether to approve or disapprove nomination the way the senate acts on nomination depends largely on the importance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy implications generally the senate shows particular interest in the nominees views and how they are likely to affect public policy9 two other factors may also affect the scrutiny with which nominees personal and professional qualities are examined whether or not the presidents party controls the senate and the degree to which the president becomes involved in supporting the nomination although the senate confirms most nominations president can safely assume that his nominees will be approved routinely rarely however does rejection occur on the senate floor nearly all rejections occur in committee either by committee vote or by committee inaction rejections in committee occur for variety of reasons including opposition to the nomination inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination or factors that may have nothing to do with the merits of the nomination the most recent study of senate confirmation action which looked at the period between 1981 and 1992 found that the senate failed to confirm 22 of all nominations to fulltime positions on boards and commissions during the same period 11 of nominations to independent agencies and 9 of nominations to executive departments also failed10 7 pl 105277 div c title i sec 151 5 usc 33453349d

archived contact henry hogue for more information the study did not include nominations submitted by presidents carter and reagan in the last months of their administrations or nominations submitted within month of the senates adjournment at the end of session it also excluded nominations to the continued crs6 appointment in the final stage the confirmed nominee is given commission signed by the president with the seal of the united states affixed thereto and is sworn into office the president may sign the commission at any time after confirmation under unusual circumstances he may not sign it at all thus preventing the appointment once the appointee is given the commission and sworn in he or she has full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the office recess appointments the appointment process also enables the president to make appointments without senate confirmation when the senate is in recess either during session intrasession recess appointment or between sessions intersession recess appointment recess appointments expire at the end of the next session of congress11 recess appointments made by president clinton during the intersession prior to the beginning of the 107th congress expired at the end of the first session of the 107th congress recess appointments made by president bush during recess within the first session or between the first and second sessions of the 107th congress expired at the end of the second session of the 107th congress recess appointments made by president bush during recess within the second session of the 107th congress or between the end of the 107th congress and the beginning of the 108th congress expire at the end of the first session of the 108th congress appendix c provides table showing the dates of the senate recesses immediately before during and immediately after the 107th congress presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment power to circumvent the confirmation process in response congress has placed restrictions on the presidents authority to make recess appointment under 5 usc 5503a if the position to which the president makes recess appointment falls vacant while the senate is in session the recess appointee may not be paid from the treasury until he or she is confirmed by the senate the salary prohibition does not apply 1 if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session 2 if nomination for the office other than the nomination of someone given recess appointment during the preceding recess was pending when the senate recessed or 3 if nomination was rejected within 30 days before the end of the session and another individual was given the recess appointment recess appointment falling under any one of these three exceptions must be followed by nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the senate for this reason when recess appointment is made the president generally submits new nomination for the nominee even when an old nomination is pending12 in addition although recess 10 continued judiciary military services foreign service national oceanic and atmospheric administration officer

provision of the annual treasury and general government appropriations act may prevent them from being paid after their rejection13 characterization of regulatory and other collegial bodies federal executive branch boards and commissions share the following characteristics 1 they are independent executive branch bodies located with four exceptions outside executive departments14 2 several members head each entity 3 the members are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate and 4 the members serve fixed terms of office and except in few bodies cannot be removed by the president except for cause the time between confirmation and the termexpiration date is often less than the fixed term of office new member may be nominated and confirmed for position from which someone has resigned or died with an unexpired term or for position with new term that is already underway occasionally if the unexpired term is for very short period two nominations of the same person are submitted simultaneously the first to complete the unexpired term and the second to complete regular term of office on some commissions the chair is subject to senate confirmation and must be appointed from among the incumbent commissioners if the president wishes to appoint as chair someone who is not on the commission two nominations are submitted simultaneously for the nominee one for member and the other for chair as independent entities with staggered membership executive branch boards and commissions have more political independence from the president than do executive departments nonetheless the president can sometimes exercise significant influence over the composition of the membership when he designates the 12 continued crs report 87832 recess appointments legal

at once for example president george w bush had the opportunity to shape the securities and exchange commission during the first two years of his presidency because of existing vacancies resignations and the death of member likewise during the same time period president bush was able to submit nominations for all of the positions on the national labor relations board because of existing vacancies expiring recess appointments and resignations simultaneous turnover of board or commission membership may sometimes result from coincidence it may also sometimes be the result of buildup of vacancies after extended periods during which the president fails to nominate or the senate fails to confirm members there are two other notable characteristics of some of the boards and commissions first on 24 of the regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions more than simple majority of the appointed members eg two of three or three of five may belong to the same political party second six organizations have confirmation requirements for either their inspector general or their general counsel organization of the report board and commission profiles each of the 33 board or commission profiles following the narrative portion of this report is organized into three sections organizational structure current membership and nominations and appointments the organizational section discusses the statutory requirements for the appointed positions including the number of members on each board or commission their terms of office whether or not they may continue in their positions after their terms expire whether or not political balance is required and the method for selection of the chair data15 on appointment actions during the 107th congress appear under both the current membership section and the appointment action section and are current as of january 3 2003 the current membership section identifies the agencys positions requiring senate confirmation and the incumbents in those positions incumbents whose terms have expired are italicized most of the incumbents serve fixed terms of office and are removable only for specified causes they generally remain in

executive schedule which ranges from level i for cabinet level offices to level v for the lowestranked positions most of the chair positions are at level iii 142500 and most of the other positions are at level iv 13400016 the appointment action section identifies the nominees in chronological order the positions to which they were nominated the dates of nomination the dates of confirmation and the number of days taken for confirmation actions other than confirmation ie nominations rejected by the senate nominations returned to or withdrawn by the president and recess appointments are also noted occasionally when position is vacant and the unexpired term of office ends within number of weeks or months two nominations for the same nominee are submitted the first to complete the unexpired term and the second for full term following completion of the expired term also when nominee is awaiting senate action and he or she is given recess appointment second followup nomination is usually submitted to comply with the requirements of 5 usc 5503b in tables that show more than one confirmed nomination the mean number of days to confirm nomination is provided this figure is determined by calculating the number of days between the nomination and confirmation dates adding these numbers for all confirmed nominations and dividing the result by the number of nominations confirmed this mean should be used cautiously as discussed earlier the senate took the unusual step of returning all nominations to the president prior to the august 2001 recess many of those whose nominations were returned were re nominated after the recess consequently these individuals were nominated twice and the time their first nominations were pending in the senate is not included in the calculation of the mean days to confirm nomination as result this mean time is shorter than it would be otherwise additional appointment information appendix presents table of all appointees alphabetically organized and following similar format to that of the appointment action sections just discussed it identifies the agency involved and the dates of nomination and confirmation the table also indicates if nomination was withdrawn returned or rejected or if recess appointment was made the mean number of days taken to confirm nomination is calculated as described above and the same caution is advised the
