6809c24 class viii tape 1 welcome to the class viii course an introduction to standard tech thank you sit down thank you very much thank you i wish to announce the opening of the class viii course now youre the lucky ones actually and im very happy to see you well turned out im sorry the stage isnt high enough bit higher so that i could see all of your faces i like to look through an audience and see the misunderstoods this is verythis is very stellar day actually in scientology and all of these years have piled up and have made the thing called standard tech now to celebrate this we have certain congratulations here here is one from theall the staff at ww ron class viii students dear ron sir our congratulations and best wishes for the universes first class viii course your gift of tech and now most wonderful of all standard tech cannot be measured in terms of mans freedom and sanity the students you are training will bring back priceless commodity our thanks to all who made it possible and to the students but most of all thank you ron from roger and all staff of your office of lrh ww and this next one heres our very best wishes and congratulations on the first level viii course youve done it again much love from lrh comm london executive council london and all staff from london our love good wishes and abundances of class viii auditors for the world the commanding officer of the pubs org and all staff and heres one from relayed from cape town dear ron congratulations on first class viii course all the best love c cape town and lrh comm cape town now what is class viii why class viii well i wish to welcome you all here to series of revelations series of very very interesting revelations known as standard tech you are about to get wins and about to guide through wins that you have never heard of before technology was actually not summated until 1966 individuals follow what is called the hidden data line mostly umdidnt get laugh you dont even know what it is but student on the saint sill briefing course is given all the research materials now of eighteen years so that hell have good background and good rounding out on which he can operate and then he goes into power and his lessons in simplicity begin to occur only an expert can be simple oneace trained individual uh ah ah where wheres the tone arm much less wheres the pc i i it looks awfully blank and uh i think that blanknessand see i think blankness i dont remember calling anythingid better develop some technology lets see ive got new process now whos blank yeah that ought to crack his case yeah whos blank they dont even know theres any technology there boy in other words it takes total expert to be totally simple and you just gonna be surprised studying this class viii course to find out how totally expert you have to be to be totally simple it is fantastic revolution its revolution its revelation and then theres this other thing called hidden data line this thing called hidden data line is one of the most fascinating things i ever heard of now captain joe von stodden captain of the flag ship has given some thought to this as an old old old time auditor as well as very good captain he sort of racked this around for while and he finally found out how hidden data line occurs or how hidden command line occurs and ill just read his dispatch in full here as i received it this morning its very very good regarding the subject of hidden data line i have observed the basis of the hidden data line and it is simply this the hidden command line this is the only way command intentions can get alterised apart from outright noncompliance which i feel if looked at closely is also due to hidden command line for example level 3 auditor does green form without an emeter level 6 asks him what the hell are you doing and the level 3 auditor says i have just come back from the ao and they do it like that and the level 3 auditor gives big explanation of why it goes that way and the level 6 auditor pursues the issue and finds other auditors from ao doing green form this way and therefore it must be ok so the level 6 auditor starts doing green form in this way this is an extreme example but the point is the level 6 started backing off when the ao was mentioned the higher up the command line the level 6 wouldnt have just taken it from the level 3 but the 3 being justhaving just had close contact with body higher on command line than the 6 starts off the level 6s doubt and the higher on command line the power is drawn from the wider area the alteris covers like it seems someone figured this out and just put god there you know somebody just heard from god so thats the right thing to do religion is pretty good example of hidden command line there is policy on if its not written its not true and the only standard tech is found in hcobs tapes and books yet tech gets alterised in orgs and the form of the org is difficult at times to keep i conclude from this that command lines are misused and not understood always the class viii course is handling the tech line and i really feel will get the data line in from source and kept in by sea org class viiis doing patrol of tech to handle the design wont it be good idea to run the org exec course based on some principles the same principles as the class viii auditors course here to put in the command lines with thud then we will be able to turn out cracker jack auditors and cracker jack org to back them up would be great help so it undoubtedly occurs organizationally as well as technically and those are very very important considerations the laws of listing they were all on tape they were in bulletins and somebody has removed both tapes and bulletins from the training line of the class vi course now do you realize that the morale of an organization is proportional to the accuracy of the technology if they havent got accurate technology that works works works i will tell you what their morale goes to pieces because they havent got anything left to work for now i dont mean to appear violent but when you have talked your lungs out hour after hour day after day to drive one point home and it doesnt drive and it evaporates it demonstrates that the subject can be wrecked by deleting from the subject line piece of key data as well as somebody who just came in saying the advanced org thats the way theyre doing it at the advanced org they run the pc standing on his head and the emeter plugged into the light socket do you realize that scientology very remarkably well stays together in spite of the absence of standard tech its remarkable its the only hope mans got but when its done wrongly when that is done wrong man is being betrayed and hes being very very badly betrayed now there isnt in actual fact much of trick to auditing there isnt much of trick im not saying how bad it all is every place im just saying my gods if it hangs together on the crappy jobs of god just auditing you see around what would it do if it went up to 100 and guess what its running on this ship right now at one zero zero per cent three provisional class viiis some of them are little resistive some of them more resistive than others but theyre all the same case and theyre just rolling along and the morale went up and everything went up and bongety bongety bongety bong but if tech was even slightly out on the flagship what do you think it is in the outer orgs pretty grim pretty grim now i dont want to give you the idea that im angry at anybody im not im not even arc broken about having talked so long and often on certain points and find them violated in fact im very calm about the whole thing and it will be completely dispassionately that we hang from the yard arm any auditor who does other than standard tech well pat him on the back as we send him into the sky cause everything were fighting for is attainable on standard technical basis which doesnt alter hair line there is not one case in this whole stinking mest universe who is one millionth of millimeter sideways from standard tech and thats the first thing you have to know about standard tech there are variable cases none but let show you what people think is variable case pc comes into session his ta is high and the auditors trying to run the right thing theyve been trying to run some things on him lately and the ta is high and they havent gone anyplace and so they try to dream up something like what principles of psychoanalysis would apply to your case you know they go rushing in to the case supervisor or the d of t and say i cant get him on there uhuhuh hes stillahahah god damn him here get process your class supervisor goes through and he thinks of something and gives it to this fellow doesnt even look at the folder and the guy goes tearing back to session and runs some bunk and the ta goes little bit higher now this is actually this is actual fact i get hold of such folder and this case is so so standard that its pathetic except for the last three months anybody who did gf or rudiments on him got an rs on missed withholds as connected to suppressive person laughing they rs they dont read they rs and auditor has resorted it to ethics has done anything about it has tried to pull the missed withhold or anything so of course we have very peculiar case so case that isnt run by standard tech becomes very peculiar case and thats just about the first law of standard tech all peculiar cases were cases that werent run by standard tech and guess what still can be so that doesnt make peculiar cases at all now the degree of precision which i have talked about on the saint hill course is so many miles wide of what we now call standard tech as to be completely fantastic therere literally miles of widths in 1965 which dont exist now the width of tolerance on standard tech probably couldnt be measured with an engineering micrometer it is absolutely exactly hair line now what do you have to do what do you have to be in order to run tech that close you have to be the god damnedest most screaming expert youve ever heard of you have to know all of the width and body of the saint hill course the research line all the books because that enough was pathway that was roadway and then knowing all that you know the total boundaries you know the total boundaries the tech can reach now in through that data there is an absolutely hair line little tiny knife edge pass and you have to know all of that to have grip on where the path is and exactly what you do honest to pete standard tech is so standard that its practically drop nickel in the auditor and he runs off the session but what does it take to make that kind of an auditor look at the grip hes got to have on it smokey joe sits down and he sits down in the auditing session and hes in really bad shape and he was audited out in keokuk and didnt do any good and his ta is at 9 and the needle is terribly stuck and what do we do we do ruds or green form to fn and next grade laughs and then theres this fellow comes in and hes been in new york and hes been down on harley street in new york he says and hes member of the british government so hes pretty confused and most of their wives are in psychiatrists beds i mean care i didnt mean to malign them or anything anyway so he sits down and says his psychiatrist has just told him something or other and hes just had umpteen electric shocks and he actually has been boozlebozzled and etcetera and hes been given an implant that scientology doesnt work and uh its its its all pretty pretty grim and what do you do with this guy what what do you do with this guy oh christ that is hell of god damned thing to figure out what will we do with this fellow oh dear lets run in to see the case supervisor without even showing him the folder and get the solution you know thats the way it is well in standard tech you dont even know whether or not hes resistive type case so you do the ruds or green form to fn and the next grade now youll have to be pretty pretty good you have to be pretty good because look at the bait thats thrown to you all the time now all you do is consider these wildly different cases as just bait on hook trying to get you to bite everybody is so different and boy theyre just about as different as the same spot of ink sitting on the same spot of ink now by george it is pretty pretty doggone interesting the session control and the self control which an auditor requires to actually go down that highway all invitations refused yet arc isnt broken and so forth and yet he just runs him now there theres the way it is now if the case proves to be very resistive case and we dont seem to be able to do anything with him you will find out that we cant do anything with him only if he has already been subjected to the unusual so standard tech has to include cases which have been run very nonstandardly you know been audited in dc i wont malign dc all orgs are just as sour as all orgs and by the time this course is being taught they will all be snapped up to battery again and they will be running fine i am embittered by the folder i just got in from that quarter thats all its pretty god damn grim the earliest folder the earliest session has about three page list in it as the first list made followed by second list which is about three page list and the first list hasnt been nulled and item was given the pc and the second one has several reading items on it what the hell were they trying to do but the last one the last auditing report is the real panic in that one folder it is real panic i mean its something to sit down and cry about or laugh uproariously about the ta is high so she was probably overrun on ot1 after doing two unnecessary s and ds which had each of them at least three items on the list reading ta was higher at the end of session see how the see how the rules are avoided now theres only one item reading on the list its just about the damnedest thing anybody ever heard of do you know do you know in actual sober sober sober sober fact that this can be interpreted that you have three items which read on the first nulling and then you nulled it again in such way to submerge two of them and leave only one reading and then that fulfills the requirement of one item reading on the list now whatever jackass figured that one out and whoever copied him ought to be sad because its completely bonkers its completely bonkers now thereve been people on the line who have put out rewritten bulletins and things like that and there is rewritten bulletin which shows just that happening but that is bonkers so we can assume that people who are bit inclined to malign knock apart and shoot the human race and have that as their only goal can get into scientology and can remove things from the technical line or pervert or alter things in the technical line which then makes scientology unworkable therefore we have entered in upon program and this program simply is that you called in from your various orgs are being taught rapidfire as hard and as clear and as bold as we can teach you standard tech the auditing of it and the case supervision of it and we will send you back as class viii provisionals do you know that absolutely standard tech complete proper hair line standard tech used in organizations throughout the world will at least triple the stats of each within 90 days couldnt help it and if it was really applied in business like fashion and nobody messed it up in any way shape or form one of our division 5 people said we might even be able to take the planet within year it is hot scientology is so much hotter than anybody thinks it is that it is fantastic you dont have to take my say so youll find it out as you go along the line youll find it out youre about to have as an auditor some very exciting adventures cases start falling apart in your hands without any unusual solutions at all its only when you goof it up that you have trouble now there are two actual spheres of instruction in this one is auditing of it and two case supervision of it and the case supervision of auditors is more difficult subject because the auditors theyre not going to follow the case supervisors instruction i know on some folders in which we were teaching this i have seen one student auditor fail to follow for three consecutive sessions the case supervisors instructions winding the case around seven assorted telegraph poles and driving the case supervisor straight up the wall so that the case supervisor then started to offer very unusual solutions trying to rescue this pc before it was too late and the pc came out right i think by just going back and doing the case supervisors instructions in the first place there are various sins on this line but if you think the auditor has to have if you think the auditor has to have it grip on tech what does the case supervisor have to have hes the crystal ball boy hes got his job to pick em up after theyve fallen on their heads now of course all cases are case supervised there arent any cases that go through any org there must not be any cases going through any org there must not be any cases audited any place that are not case supervised by class viii the next session may not be given until case supervision now the auditor if he is very well trained auditor can refuse to do the case supervisors instructions because its the auditor who is going to be hanged but he can only refuse to do them and not audit at all be may not ever vary or alter case supervisors instructions he opens up the folder and he sees case supervisors instructions and he himself perhaps trained to class viii disagrees with these completely now he must take it up with the case supervisor he has right not to audit them but he has right whatsoever to audit anything else you see how its sewn up you say yes but this pc could sit there for month without any auditing its god damn well better he did if therere two people who have entirely different opinions on what ought to be done with this case then either one or the other of those two different people do not know standard tech because if they knew standard tech they would not have any divergence of opinion now there are certain things that get wrong with cases there are certain cases more resistive than other cases there are certain cases that do not appear to be standard theyre standard enough theres little 7 line assesment which is longer if you want to ask more particulars on each one but theres only about 7 things that prevent case from running easily these are the resistive cases and theyre something theyre something on the order of being audited with ruds out different cases with different items theres cases that have had experiences of release quote unquote on biochemical preparations of one kind or another and these cases have comparison level they also have one hell of screaming awful ridge one such case at the aouk i heard of he wrote petition he said hed been 800 hours on class 3 and he never could get back of an lsd release that he had in 1966 oh i dont know how he was managing it man but for sure nobody had ever rehabbed that lsd release now you get invariables you are dealing basically in invariable things highly invariable such as high tone arm is an overrun see its not rump and dump and probably an overrun it is an overrun of some kind or type low ta is an unflat 3 the state of this character one item is reading on list if 2 items are reading then the list is incomplete and must be completed by adding items to it id better be more specific you know simple simon idiocy this its this kind of stuff see its rat tat tat tat tat see it is the point it is the point it always will be the point and so forth and anybody can count on an ao saying they now run green forms without emeter at the ao and anybody trained on this line can pick up this little violin and play little tune it may be so we do not know you story sounds so clear we hate to doubt your word but doesnt go here laughter standardization now the whole body of technology as far as lower grades are concerned and power was not completed until 1966 and it was completed on hairline precision by 1966 at the lower levels it has now moved up to complete now it is absolutely complete straight through to ot section vi complete and released and that is it iv new i has been released and iv has become review action of highly precise of highly precise nature uhh that puts it all together and gives the guy back all of his gains after hes goofed it up as solo auditor anyhow and then what they do they do they goof it up i guess the latest method of running iii is putting the empty chair across from your auditing table and asking the chair if it if it has any engrams and then the chair doesnt speak so one then attests iii i dont approve of that thats not standard tech laughs and having body thetan give you his name rank serial number and so forth auditing him with dianetic audible commands go to the beginning mumbling the commands of r3r mmemblemm mm and are you there and so on wmm dmmtm thmmm wmmmbl yeah for chrissakes didnt you ever hear of telepathy we do it all telepathically jzzztl bump toot zee zzzzmmmmnl phew laughs and as far as 7 is concerned and 8 all the materials of 7 and 8 are sitting there i havent written them up theres reason to write up 7 and 8 without standard tech in up to 6 and the other thing is im so far into 8 that 7 has gotten awfully dim im just being lazy and besides this people havent been nice to lately they havent been nice to they here and there here and there why there have been noncompliances with standard technology and although people say yes were doing just as you said and so forth the review folders dont follow so i i think i wont release 7 until auditing is standard through the world actually 7 is one of these little jolly old gocarts 3 goes zig and 7 goes zag and if guy cant audit at 7 he may as well quit and you can talk all you want to about uh the guys start getting into trouble do you understand they start getting into plenty plenty plenty of trouble if they cant audit well at 3 well if they cant audit well at 3 boy theyre going to go down for the third count if they cant audit well at 7 cause 7 is much tougher to audit than 3 merely because its just more or less straight auditing job but its got zig zags in it you have to know your business and as far as 8 is concerned well 8 is very airyfairy and uh well ill give you some kind of notion of it the lower grades are dominant c communication theyre dominant c somewhere in the vicinity of power one passes into the band of r and r runs on up to pretty close i suppose i havent made graph of it but somewhere around 3 and then from 3 on up it is pure that is the dominant its affinity that runs on up from there and when you get up into 8 why the three start to harmonic one after the other you get r and you get and so on your dominant stress it is only because person is out of dominant communication or c that you can have solo auditing at r6ew he doesnt any longer need communication cycle but he needs r man and what he does is get heavy increases in r and these increases in r move up and if he has done all of his grades like good boy he will arrive at 3 with sufficient r to be able to flip over into and its uh at 3 where it starts going into heavy affinity affinity is the dominant you get into all sorts of conditions you when you get 3 you start finding yourself loving everybody and so forth so these these are just some of the considerations as they go up along the line now its actually just interesting it doesnt change anything its where the person is progressing but if person has neglected his grades lower grades and neglected c and hasnt picked his c up as he comes up through the grades why when he gets into solo his reality is inadequate and it is not possible for him to in actual fact have any r on 3 reality on 3 well that means hes out somewhere along the line dont you see he hasnt made it in that way and then if you find him hating everybody when he gets to when he gets to 5 or something like this well you know very well that he actually hasnt made it there either thesed just be tests of whether or not the guy has gone up you will find out oddly enough that the trouble with cases is failure to make the grade laughs not to make horrible pun out of it but if you were to hand clearing course materials to joe blow of hoboken if you were to hand the clearing course materials to joe blow of hoboken you would find out that he would be in completely unreal state he doesnt even restimulate most remarkable thing you ever heard in your life he doesnt even restimulate what wall now the emeter reads just above the level of the individual r pardon it reads just tiny bit deeper than his extant r so fellow could be there sick as pup his leg broke and everything else maybe he didnt have any reality on anything that was wrong with him at all and he doesnt think anything is wrong with him so you ask him is anything wrong with you and hell feel fine baffling youll say he has subjective reality well i dont know why youre using the word subjective he just doesnt have any reality period thats all laughs so anyway the emeter will read just little bit deeper than the guys r now that it happens to be basic law that happens to be basic law so you ask this bird for an arc break and hes just been knocked in the head some way or another and anybody would have an arc break anybody he doesnt have any arc break he doesnt know what happened so you as an auditor know what is wrong with the person usually far better than the person does and as result you know far better than the person what is wrong with the person but this little law gets in your road the emeter reads just tiny bit deeper than the guys r level and the meter didnt read on it so it is either suppressed or it is below his r so if you try to do anything more about it at that moment than that youve had it so class viii takes what it sees on the meter and class viii auditor knows the meter has read or knows that it hasnt read he really doesnt even know what it has read on he can suppose that it read on the question he asked but it also might have read on fly that just bit the guy in the ankle so if he gets an unusual reaction in response to his question along with the read then he always checks for false read did it read or didnt it read see he doesnt go on the slavish academy level action that the meter read and therefore it was now he not only cleans up the false read he got but he feels that if this thing is falsely reading it must have falsely read for somebody else too so he cleans up the false reads on this subject ill give you little kind of of total loss of gain an individual had gotten off terrible second dynamic withhold and he had gotten this off in london to an auditor in the london hgc and he felt great he felt wonderful he got someplace else and some auditor was auditing him and got read on withhold and he immediately assumed that it hadnt blown so he went on for the next two or three years giving up this withhold to every auditor because it always read and he knew he couldnt blow it so therefore scientology had failed i myself was the review auditor in this particular instance so i of course immediately checked for false reads when he came up ah he says you know i could read it you know he said that again well its just like this and i said wait minute uh youve gotten this some withhold off before yeah he told all about how hed gotten it off before i just checked it for false reads traced it back to the first false read we could get cleaned it up the needle flew like bomb he had his gains back all in batch pongo about two minute operation so theres something to this now if auditing is working as it is as has been done prior to 24 september 1968 ad 18 if auditing is working prior to this date when we are launching standard tech it is terrific testimony to the subject because the subject has been being applied in very sloppy knockely wackely fashion so its great testimony to the fact its great testimony to auditors now from this point on we have very narrow track and having an extremely narrow track that we can follow we have to have one confidence that it will give us the gain and that confidence is borne out of experience and it will give you the gains and we have to have an application of it in uniformity and we have to be able to patch up every nonstandard run case there is and that sounds like tall order but standard tech patches them up very easily its only certain laws certain rules and so forth in this subject you can only repair so many repairs and then youd better take the guy who has been fixing it up so that repairing repairs had to be done and youd better get him grooved up so that when he is put to repairing something with perfectly valid cs case supervision he actually does it and doesnt produce something else that has to be repaired do you follow so it is very bad thing to begin to repair repairs because you can start repairing the repairs of repairs and then repair the repairs of those repairs which fail to repair and the folder gets thicker and thicker and thicker right now quals through the world prior to this date of 24 september 68 are mainly engaged in making up errors to be repaired and the folders are very fat indeed now quals stat used to be volume of money paid but if person cant get out of qual if hes held prisoner until he does pay which i understand is being done here and there that if that is the case then then then the statistic itself doesnt tell anything you could actually just fix case up so that it had to be repaired and qual would make fortune you see now your good case supervisor thats runnin em along in the hgc and over in qual and hes runnin em along then qual folders are very thin and then hgc folders are damn thin too now the thing that is most neglected is just this is cases are set up to fly standard tech goes this way you take case take the bugs out of the case you know the missed withholds and the rudiments that have been out and the guy has been on gasoline for several years but you get this guy set up and you just take the bugs out of the case and then you set him up and you point and fire him and you dont give standard tech session unless your pc is flying thats who you see those huge letters flunk exclamation point exclamation point in my cs folders it is real flunk to run any major action without the case already flying he says but what the hell what are you talking about the guys pts the guys pts his wifes in review his wifes in review that is why hes having review because hes all caved in hes all caved in and hesand heshes pts and hes all caved in and thats why hes having reviewuh and what do you mean hes got to be set up and flying before you do major action and then you say an s ds major action oh what the hell what whats this well the s ds supposed to set him up and you say boy down dog down rover major listing action you set him up to run it well how do you set him up to run you get the ruds in yeah what if it ah ah you get the ruds in oh i see you just make sure they are uh yahyou just pull an arc break and so on you get the ruds in to fn get the ruds in to fn yeah well of course course uh and then what happens if he doesnt well you do green form till you get an fn yeah but wait minute wait minute if youre doing green form and so forth you cant do this s and d you wont do it he wont do an s and d unless hes it says he needs it on green form anyhow oh i see what if the guy didnt need it oh yeah yeah undoubtedly the guy needed it but you might have gotten an fn on the green form before you got to pts and then you wouldnt do it well whats this you consider it major action you say major action is an s and d thats right remedy b is major action s and d is major action you set up the case to fn now what what if we dont what are you what are you talking about you mean were not going to run any more s and ds were not going towere going to run s and ds when the guy needs some s and d why you get him an fn before you run it oh well golly if we didnt have s and ds we just couldnt keep qual solvent at all hed say and youd say good go broke for all i care i like broke quals id just be as happy as clam with an org that never ever had anybody ever walk through the door of qual and spider webs and cobwebs accumulating around the desk thatd be just great because right now qual is being used for case gain but that isnt where you get case gain you dont get case gain in repair youve just got it backward you get case gain with grades and major actions you put the case up to fly you never audit the case unless hes flying so you always fly case before you audit it now you begin to understand what its all about you dont try to heal the case with grades you try to give him advances and gains big major gains with these grades and they get em boy they get em theyll fly standard tech isnt what i say it is its what works and what works has already been established so it isnt for to say its different and it isnt for anybody else to say its different either because we fought for it and we won it the hard way now lets consolidate it now lets get it practiced the history of standard tech is very long history it is very hard fought for history there is tremendous quantity of technology in scientology and dianetics it is one of the largest broadest bodies of information on the subject of human behavior that has ever appeared in the universe and now i can say without fear of challenge because i know whats appeared on the back track and it is so god damned stupidly feeble that it consists of more than crass superstition now the triumph is that out of this large body of material which embraces everything known to man or beast theres hardly anything unexplored in that whole subject out of that whole mad wide ocean of material theres this hair line that goes right straight through the middle of the material so you have to know where the ocean is in order to get on the hair line now thats quite an achievement now ill tell you how the hair line was chosen and why it became that terribly narrow path which we now call standard tech it is composed of those things which if they are out inhibit and prohibit all case gain its negative assessment if the points of standard tech are present unresolved the case will not gain so obviously the resolution of these points in their proper sequence is standard tech if fellow has an arc break he cannot be audited if he is audited without the arc break being handled he will go immediately into sad effect and months later will be found just sadder and sadder and sadder well its fact nothing you argue with its fact so obviously theres the arc break if the fellow has present time problem you try to audit the individual with present time problem youll get case change of any kind whatsoever it just parks itself right there it doesnt become sadder but the case doesnt change if you try to audit person over missed withhold an individual will just plow in and plow in and plow in and hell natter and get mad and get mad at himself and on the various dynamics and so forth hell have hell of time if you try to audit case that has committed some tremendous overt that he considers tremendous overt without ever touching on or letting him discuss or handle the overt hell just go into degradation now if the overt happens to be on dianetics and scientology i actually guarantee itll go straight into degradation theres horrible trick you can play on to somebody who has just been cutting scientology to ribbons if you were to audit one of these one of these nuts one of these screaming painted blue monkeytailed idiots that have been howling around about scientology and so forth standard tech would actually give him gain but every time he hits the overt line he would try to do himself in so because you improve his reality and the improvement of reality would bring him to recognition of the wickedness of his own acts and youve actually audited him successfully into degradation the more successful you were with your auditing the more he would become degraded do you follow he would degrade himself you arent degrading him he has been now he realizes since man is basically good man he realizes that he had been attacking something he shouldnt have attacked and therefore he is just filthy pig and the more it works on him the more he gets to be filthy pig you could actually handle it by handling overts if you found the actual overts but youd probably have to couple it with motivators and overts and youd have to handle it very slippery indeed its buttons of this type buttons of this type now there are more esoteric lines of action thats various actions of power and those are all points on the ladder of course you dont have to go that far you get to this thing called service facsimile every one of these guys is using some kind of combination to make people wrong and himself right and you walk up into the various strata of power and you walk up into power plus which is reorientation step you go up to r6ew which blows whatever hes got hanging around from gpms you move into the ccs youve gone down to death and you move into what is now ot 1 you put him back in the human race and then you get some more bank off the line and ot 2 and you get rid of the body thetans at 3 and you review him all out straight and make him in beautiful shape put him in his own valence and fix him up so he can confront things at 4 and then you turn him into an extrovert at 5 and 6 and then in 7 you let him examine what horrible dog he has always been laughter he usually eventually comes to this conclusion normally starts out on the basis that he is the only thetan in the universe who has never committed an overt laughter anyway if we go on up the line we get to the old one know thyself the first dynamic versus the physical universe the individual and life versus this universe 7 is actually life vis vis with life and 8 is of course life vis vis with the physical universe and the first three great philosophers that greece produced took as their opening saga the relationship of life to the physical universe they were starting in to the empire state building on the top floor you get to know yourself on 7 and 8 mostly on 8 and then begin to find your relationship your real relationship with the physical universe and the ancient greek philosopher didnt get any place because he didnt have any highway to get there highway at all so standard tech is the highway and it is built out of those points which if they are present advance can occur and there arent any more points awful adventurous statement but its true there arent any more points theres another trick or two perhaps something like that blaaaah couple of ways to do one or two of these things but the variability even on those is weighted in favor of just one thing to do so as you come curving down the line with standard tech it goes right straight where were supposed to go and you can hold case in to that groove and it is groove boy it is very terrible now i can see you now trying to get an academy auditor to see the light and youve just case supervised this case and archibald swangolen is the auditor and at the moment he goes in he finds the case supervision cannot work because the pc actually as it says make sure that you get the arc break because the pc is very sad he goes in there and hes just sure its because the pc just sure its because the pc has missed withhold so that is why he ran grade 4 before he ran and you say wait minute boy what are you doing oh well you see its just and somebody came from the ao the other day and they said it was always best to get off the service facsimile as soon as possible because then you could get the overts you will be in the optimum position to be able to say we do not care who came from the ao the other day there is only one standard tech and there is only one way to do standard tech and there is only one way it is done and there is only one pc and that is standard pc and you aint got standard pc now lets go into this quietly and back into this folder and where the hell did you miss the arc break to begin with and do it the right way shall we you in case supervision must first know that standard tech will solve the case and that your direction of standard tech to be done will solve the case if the auditor will follow your cs and if he will keep his trs in and finish the cycle of action on the case as it rolls along and your confidence must be such that aloicious q squashbottom himself in person can emerge as the worlds most unstandard piece of balderdash he spends hours bragging to everybody how hes very different and you still go in against this case and you order and your enforce the running of standard tech and mr squashbottoms case will fall apart see the the attitude of an auditor handling standard tech is that of total confidence and that confidence is something that is gained that is won if by doing these actions you obtain an exactly predictable result confidence is borne and its very funny thing at this stage of the game to be talking about anything as positive as scientology as something in which you have to have confidence the funny part of it is people have run into many cases that have been misaudited that the cases appear different until you look back and find out that the guy has been talking to his first six auditors tried to tell him the ptp to those first six auditors and none of them ever handled it and then you realize that youd better handle the ptp so therefore its rather simple simple world that youre dealing with but you cannot adventure into this world of standard tech without total total grip on the technology itself you have to know technology so that well you just dont avoid these major points like the twelve laws of listing well hmf that you dont have to thinkety about these things they just are you see the pc sitting in front of you you know the auditors code to point where you see that pc sitting in front of you and he appears just little bit dirty as he sits down to session and youve got sense enough to ask have you had any sleep and his skin tone doesnt look good have you had any sleep have you had something to eat very good alright well have session you dont ask the classic i saw in folder yesterday i dont know i havent had any sleep for six nights the pc says and the auditor said shame shame the auditor said tell an earlier time when youve had sleep that will become classic because its violation of the auditors code so you know the auditors code to point where you dont have to think about it and so the standardness of standard tech is knowing standard tech so well that you dont have to think about standard tech in order to do standard tech it simply is now one of the parts of standard tech is the tremendous wealth we have here of folders and information and the wealth consists of the fact that i have done five hundred separate supervisions on cases in the last five weeks now thats quite few i do them in my part time while im attending to other things and of these lines the only cases that arent flying are the cases that havent had their auditing finished yet we had one very very famous case this case was made unstandard by being very unstandardly approached the case staggered aboard terrible condition the case was audited oddly enough actually did achieve arc straightwire and then the person who was on that line at that time said its dead thetan needle so run him more and ran him two days as an overrun of arc straightwire and then i said to the next auditor rehab the arc straightwire and run secondaries the next auditor went into session the pc was running secondary just like that the pc was running the secondary the very next step to come up it was happening and the auditor was trying to rehab during that whole session sad day time marched on and then we finally found out that his ta was so high and his case was so unapproachable that nobody could do anything with it and he got to be known sort of as the black dog of carnak the black dog of carnak was somebody who got on peoples back and never got off because it was sure assignment of doubt to even touch this case because he sort of got it fixed so that you did something wrong in other words he blew the auditors cool laughter in doing such an action the case was bad luck so this case then became very nonstandard it was an unsolvable case and he was unsuperviseable and he was unauditable and nobody was willing to audit him and uh i looked back along the lines and i found out that the case had rsed on missed withholds and connected to suppressive groups and later on had blowdowns on missed withholds and wronging scientologist and in all cases the auditor hadnt paid any attention to this so i just sent it back into session we pulled the missed withholds we got what he was really connected to and well all we did was rehab his former release on the track on drugs and the case flew straightened out marvelous bingo bango nothing to it i dont know how long really it took to straighten the case out i dont know how long the session was i dont imagine it was more than about 50 minutes all i had to find was where standard tech had been violated and where it had been violated it went to hell but anyway it doesnt mean that you wont run into totally unauditable cases there are totally unauditable cases theres callahans robinsons and by the time these tapes are released and heard they probably have been buried long since in infamy uh but uh they become unauditable simply because they never come near an organization or present themselves to be audited and that is the only unauditable case there is so youre here to learn this magic road and you think at the moment its very easy to grasp this thats all there is to it why did i come here you havent heard anything yet it took five weeks to make three class viii auditors five weeks they are cracker jacks they are marvelous youve got to do it in three weeks and the way your going to do it in 3 weeks is youre going to study the materials and then youre going to study the folders then youre going to study the materials and study the folders and study the materials and study the folders and your going to read all the well done sessions as well as the cs in the folders and study them until you see how this thing looks and then youre going to study the bulletins some more until you see what technique is necessary in order to do it that way and that is how its done and its done by hard study and it is done by hard practice at the end of the course just to make sure you know your business we have 202 question examination and we expect you to whip this totally precise there is only one answer to the thing and the passing grade is 85 so we mean business we havent got any time at all youve got to learn this youve got to get back to your orgs youve got to get this stuff in in order to save the bacon and save the day because it is needed far worse than its ever been needed before so thats what class 8 is all about i hope my information will be useful to you in the next few coming days thank you very much
