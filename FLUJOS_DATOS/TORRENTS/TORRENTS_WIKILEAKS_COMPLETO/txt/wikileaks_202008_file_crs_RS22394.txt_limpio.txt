made landfall in the united states causing yet to be determined amount of federal flood losses these three storms occurred exactly three years after hurricane katrina struck the us hurricane katrina emerged as pivotal event in the history of federal flood control policy the storm damage and subsequent massive flooding in the gulf coast and new orleans from hurricane katrina estimated to have caused over 200 billion in damages and over 1700 deaths was the most costly disaster in recent us history hurricane katrina exposed the fact that the cost of floods has continued to rise as has the number of major flood disasters floodrelated property losses have risen to 6 billion year from approximately 33 billion in the mid1980s1 katrina also demonstrated the effectiveness of the national flood insurance program nfip in managing the nations flood risk as well as its limitations in handling catastrophic flood event congress created the nfip with the passage of the national flood insurance act of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22394 19682 to provide insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance for individuals living in floodprone areas the nfip has dual missions of promoting positive land use decision making and of reducing the overall cost to government of recovery costs due to flooding the nfip provides incentives for communities to establish flood plain management programs to control development in flood plain and promote floodresistant construction under the nfip the federal government is required to take certain actions identify and map areas subject to flooding indemnify property owners against flood losses by making flood insurance widely available at actuarially sound rates or with legally mandated subsidies and reduce future floodrelated losses through community floodplain management measures since 1973 homeowners have had to buy flood insurance if they have federally backed mortgages in flood zones today the nfip provides flood insurance to about 54 million homeowners renters and business owners in over 20218 participating communities and generates 23 billion in premiums the nfip has undergone major changes in response to significant flood events for example the program was created after hurricane betsy devastated the gulf coast in 1965 hurricane agnes in 1972 led to the mandatory flood insurance requirements in 1973 that were designed to increase participation in the program the midwest flood of 1 alex frangos us launching massive effort to redraw nations flood maps wall street journal september 19 2003 p 1 2 pl 90448 82 stat 573 crs3 1993 provided the impetus for strengthening lender compliance requirements in the context of the mandatory purchase provisions in the 1994 national insurance reform act3 recognition of the impact of properties prone to repetitive flooding on the financial condition of the program led to the passage of the flood insurance reform act of 20044 in the wake of hurricane katrina question has been raised as to whether the current model for financing the nfip through premiums fees and treasury borrowing in high claim years remains the best alternative the devastation in the gulf coast caused by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma krw and predictions for more intense storms in the future have raised broad public policy concerns about the future viability of the nfip particularly in the event of another catastrophic flood episode key policy issue for the 110th congress is finding way to balance the financial and regulatory need to strengthen the program and ensure its future viability and commitment to reduce the nations flood risks without undermining the original intent of the program to keep rates affordable members of the 110th congress will likely be called upon to assess the nfips current operations and accomplishments and consider various alternatives to reform the program the options for nfip reforms include eliminating the program broadening its coverage from the 100year flood plain httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22394 to the 500year flood plain and enhancing both the programs actuarial soundness and the accuracy of flood maps economists note that these flood insurance reforms could affect the us economy and have unintended impacts on home ownership including property values and the cost of mortgage credit katrinas impact on the national flood insurance program the massive flood losses from the 2005 hurricane season especially katrina and rita have financially overwhelmed the nfip the program had been selfsupporting from 1986 until 2005 covering all expenses and claim payments out of income from premiums and fees operating losses occurred annually between 1972 and 1980 and in the years 1983 1984 1989 1990 1992 1993 1995 1996 2004 and 2005 the federal emergency management agency fema the agency that administers the program expects to pay approximately 207 billion in claims from krw this figure is almost double the total amount paid out over the nfips 39year existence according to fema between 1978 when the program was transferred from the department of housing and urban development to fema and 2004 the nfip earned 197 billion in premiums and paid out 142 billion some 184495 nfip claims have been filed in response to krw to place this number in context prior to katrina the largest numbers of flood related claims from previous floods were from the louisiana flood of may 1995 31264 hurricane allison in june 2001 30296 and hurricane ivan in 2004 281375 3 pl 103325 108 stat

result of the catastrophic nature of flood losses from krw is that fema had to stop payments to nfip policyholders for the first time since the flood insurance program began although the nfip has been able to cover losses through the premiums charged to all policyholders total income generated from insurance premiums and investments has at times been insufficient to pay claims in heavier loss years in such cases the program has borrowed from the us treasury to cover losses and other expenses in the short term total flood insurance losses from krw estimated at 23 billion significantly exceeded the programs 15 billion borrowing authority from the us treasury consequently in september 2005 the congress passed and the president signed into law legislation to increase nfip borrowing authority to 35 billion6 subsequent legislation that further raised borrowing authority to 185 billion was enacted in november 20057 on march 23 2006 the us congress approved s 2275 to increase the borrowing authority to 20775 billion8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22394 table 1 shows the history of treasury borrowing and repayments under the nfip from 1981 to 2007 fema projects having to pay 20697 in ultimate losses from krw an amount that includes 126 billion in interest as of july 31 2008 fema had borrowed 17835 billion and repaid 225 million leaving current balance of 17360 given that the nfip insures 75 billion in property values in the three identified coastal counties in texas and the houston metropolitan area impacted by ike it is likely that the program will incur significant losses from this storm which will necessitate additional treasury borrowing federal response to uninsured flood losses katrinas devastation has required an unprecedented response from federal state and local governments as well as the private sector federal spending for postdisaster assistance now totals 109 billion plus more than 8 billion in tax relief9 this 109 billion amount includes 896 billion in postdisaster assistance and 193 billion in insurance claim payments under the nfip as of december 31 2006 the nfip had borrowed 1675 billion from the us treasury an amount that far exceeds the aggregate amount of claims paid in the history of the program10 the 896 billion appropriated by congress includes 115 billion in us department of housing and 6 pl 10965 119 stat 1998 7 pl 109106 119

150000 whichever is less grants are now available to thousands of homeowners outside of special flood hazard areas commonly known as the flood plain or the flood zone who were not required by federal law to purchase flood insurance in addition to stimulating calls to reform the nfip hurricane katrina has rekindled national debate as to whether the federal government should pay for catastrophe losses that are not covered by insurance either because the damage was caused by excluded perils or because the insurance has become insolvent or because the persons or entities suffering the losses were not insured because future megacatastrophic event could cripple the insurance industrys financial base and disrupt recovery after the next major disaster there are renewed calls for federal disaster insurance there is lack of consensus however among state officials and insurance stakeholder groups about the viability of federal catastrophe fund some segments of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22394 the insurance industry maintain federal catastrophe fund is not needed because either the private sector remains capable of covering such risks or they are not willing to help with financial assistance to residents of coastal areas12 supporters of this view argue that government solution would amount to coverage subsidy for coastal residents at the expense of those living further inland and increase the risk of taxpayers being forced to cover losses on the other hand other insurers and their trade groups say there is not enough capital in the catastrophe insurance market to handle megacatastrophe and federalstate catastrophe funding approach would be the most effective way to mobilize resources needed for disaster recovery and federal deficit reduction insurers and regulators are also exploring ways to allow for insurers to accumulate taxdeferred catastrophe reserves concluding remarks the nfip is so deeply in debt from the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons that most insurance analysts would agree it will be challenging for fema to repay the money borrowed from the treasury the interest payments alone on nfips treasury borrowing could reach 1 billion per year which is half the programs annual premiums suggesting the unlikelihood that fema will be able to repay the borrowed funds most disaster experts and policymakers would agree that the program needs to be reformed and some have suggested the program should be restructured to operate more like private insurer the 110th congress is expected to act first to address solvency
