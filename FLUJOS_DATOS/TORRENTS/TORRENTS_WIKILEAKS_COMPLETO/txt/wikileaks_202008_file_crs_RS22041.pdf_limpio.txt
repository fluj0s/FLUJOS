hazardous materials indicates th at proposals by state andor cal officials to regulate the transportation of hazardous ma terials may be preempted by federal law the hazardous materials transportation aut horization act of 1994 hmta provides the secretary of transportation with general re gulatory authority over both the designation of hazardous materials and their transportation in interstate commerce5 the hmta contains express preemption provisions which state that absent waiver by the department of transportation dot the re quirements of state political subdivision of state or indian tribe are preempted if 1 complying with requirement of the state political subdivisi on or tribe and requirement of this chapter regulation pr escribed under this chapter or hazardous materials

materials transportation security regulation or dire ctive issued by the secretary of homeland security 7 these provisions establish what the dot refers to as the dual compliance obstacle and covered subject tests8 second given that both the incidents nd proposed legislati on relate to rail transportation the preemption provisions in th federal railroad safe ty act frsa also appear to be relevant9 the frsa specifically requires th at laws regulations and orders related to railroad safety and security shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable10 pursuant to the frsa state and local officials are permitted to legislate railroad safety and security until such time as the secretary of transportation or secretary of homeland security prescribe regulations covering the same subject matter state and local officials may also enforce more stringent law and regulation when such law is 1 necessary to eliminate or reduce an essential local safety or security hazard 2 is not incompatible with law regulation or order of the united states government and 3 does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce11 it would appear that any legislative or regulatory proposal to regulate the transportation of hazar dous materials such as enacted by the district of columbia would likely be considered routing regulati on routing regulations generally includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22041crs4 12 see 49 cfr 36765 2003 defining routing desi gnations in the context of motor carrier regulations 13 see supra note 7 14 52 fed reg 13000 13003 apr 20 1987

see eg 49 cfr 174 2003directions with respect to specific tr avel routes or portion of routes12 arg uably regulations regarding routing do not in and of themselves make it impossible to comply with federal regulations and therefore are not necessarily obstacles to carrying out the requirements of the hmta in addition routing is not include d within any of the covered subjects listed in the statute13 while there do not appear to be any federa l court decisions with respect to state or local regulations attempting to route the trans portation of hazardous ma terials via rail the dot has issued several administrative inconsistency rulings and preemption decisions regarding routing regulations pursuant to hmta that affect the transportation of radioactive materials via motor carriers review of these decisions indicates that the dot has consistently held that the depa rtment through promulgation of 49 cfr 397101 has established near total occ upation of the fiel d of rou ting 14 t h i s occupation means that routing requirements other than 1 those relating to federal requirements or 2 state designated alte rnate routes under 49 cfr 177825 are very likely to be inconsistent and thus preempted under 112a of the hmta15 if anything because of the more readily available alternat routes for motor carriers it can be argued that the hmta gives state and local officials more flexibility with respect to motor carrier regulations16 therefore if the federal government has occupied the field of routing with respect to motor carriers it may be that the same result would be reached with respect to rail transportation moreover such locally enacted legislation could arguably be characterized as not merely routing requirement but in effect as prohi bition on specific form of hazardous material transporta tion which would apparently be preempted the dot has previously held with respect to state and local attempts to prevent the transportation of hazardous materials that unilateral local ban is negation rather than an exercise of local responsibility since it isolates the cal jurisdiction from the risks associated with the commercial life of the nation17 turning to the frsa given the existence of federal regulations with respect to hazardous materials tr ansportation by rail18 should the district or any other state or local government attempt to regulate in this area they would be required to show that the restriction satisfies the stat utes specific requirements as indicated above the frsahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22041crs5 19 49 usc 2010613 2004 20 see kassel v consolidated freightways corp 450 us 662 671 1981 21 while the decision in kassel was 63 in favor of striking dow n the iowa statute the case did not have majority opinion rather it produced plurality decision that included justices powell white blackmun and stevens justi ces brennan and marshall authored separate concurring opinion agreeing with the resu lt but offering different rationale permits states and localities enact more stringent regulations provided that the regulations are necessary to eliminate or reduce an essen tial local safety or security hazard are not incompatible with federal law and do not unreasonably burden interstate commerce19 while arguably regulation narrowly tailored to address specific local safety or securityconcern would satisfy the first prong of the test local restriction on the transportation of hazardous materials by rail could be found by court to be in conflict with the hmta in addition such restriction could place an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce by requiring rail carriers to take potentially longer and more costly routes to deliver their cargo given these possibilities it would appear that any state or local restriction on the transportation of hazar dous material by rail could be f ound to be preempted by the fsra dormant or negat ivecommerce clause in addition to possible preemption issues the constitutions commerce clause which has been interpreted to contain dormant or negative component may also preclude state and local officials from imposin g regulations preventing or hindering the transportation of haza rdous materials in in terstate commerce in this case it is likely that state or local restriction on the transportation of hazardous materials by rail would fall into the undue burden category of dormant commerce clause cases as safety and secu rity rather than ec onomic protectionism appears to be the state or local governments primary interest when state or locality asserts safety or security rationale the court has generally balanced the states interest in safety and security with the regulations impact on interstate commerce here the interest in safety is likely to be very strong as chemical spill in densely populated area such as washington dc could potentially ve disastrous consequences couple that with the post911 terrorist threat and the fact that washington dc is the nations capital and there may be case that the districts legitimate interest in safety outweighs the potential impact on interstate commerce nevertheless supreme court precedent appears to require the opposite result in kassel v consolidated freightways corp the court invalidated an iowa regulation that prohibited the use of 65foot double tractor trailers on its highways because the regulation substantially burdened interstate commerce20 the rule established from the courts multiple opinions in kassel appears to be that state may not enact regulations that effectively shift the burden of interstate commerce away from its citizens for the purpose of protecting their safety21 in other words the problem with the iowa regulations was that they appeared to protect iowans from the dangers of 65foot tractor trailers by diverting them into other states the result was an effective shift of th burdens and costs of inters tate commerce from iowa onto its neighboring states similarly by diverting the rail cars carrying zardous materials from the district of columbia to other regions the district is arguably shifting the burden hazards and costs of inte rstate commerce onto neighborin g regions because lowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22041crs6 22 see csx transp inc v williams 2005 wl 902130 2425 ddc apr 18 2 005 civa 05338egs 23 csx transp inc v williams 406

would be strong argument fo r striking down the local statute on dormant commerce clause grounds the courts decision in kassel however was handed down in 1981 long before september 11 2001 and its implications on both na tional and local security in light of these changed circumstances it may be possible given the more stringent regional safety and security concerns for lower court to find kassel distinguishable arguably because the district of columbia unlike iowa has to be concerned about the heightened risks from terrorists and other threats to nati onal security court could decide that while the districts restriction adversely impacts interstate commerce that effect is substantially outweighed by the security benefits to the district and the national capital region should lower federal court reach such decision it is unclear what if anything the supreme court would decide should it hear the case litigation activity on february 22 2005 csx transportation c sx the major rail carrier directly affected by the statute sought before the federal district court for the district of columbia preliminary injunction preventing forcement of the dc act on april 18 2005 the district court denied the preliminar injunction determining that on the record before it csx was not likely to succeed on the merits of its claims22 csx immediately sought reversal of the dist rict courts decision from the court of appeals for the district of columbia circu it dc circuit upon review the dc circuit determined th at unless the district could demonstrate that its act fell under one of the conditions tablished by the frsa for the enactment of more stringent regulation the ac t was preempted by federal law23 analyzing the dc act in light of the frsa conditions the court first concluded that the dc act likely does not address an essen tially local safety or security zard as none of the parties had suggested that the national standards were inadequate to address the vulnerability of hazardous materials passing through the district24 second the court concluded that because the acts routing restri ction does not permit the carrier s to exercise the discretion expressly conferred by the existing federal regulations the act was incompatible with the existing federal scheme25 finally the court concluded that the act unreasonably burdens interstate commerce because practically speaking should multiple states enact similar bans they would in effect wreak havoc with the national system of hazardous materials shipment26 having decided the case in csxs favor on frsa grounds the court did not address challenges to the dc act under either the hmta or the dormant commerce clause
