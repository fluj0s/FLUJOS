widely viewed as symbolizing the power and authority of the house the speakers most promin ent role is that of presiding officer of the house in this capacity the speaker is empower ed by house rules to administer proceedings on the house floor including the power to recognize members on the floor to speak or make motions and the power to appoint members to conference committees the speaker also oversees much of the nonlegislative business of the house such as general control over the hall of the house and the house side of the capitol and service as chair of the house office building commission the speakers role as elect of the elect in the house also places him or her in highly visible position with the public the speaker also serves not only as titular leader of the house but also as leader of the majority party conference the speaker is often responsible for airing and defending the majority partys legislative agenda in the house the speakers third distinct role is that of an elected member of the house although elected as an officer of the house the speaker continues to be member as well as such the speaker enjoys the same rights responsibilities and privileges of all representatives however the speaker has traditionally refrained from debating or voting in most circumstances and does not sit on any standing committee of the house

speaker combines several roles the institutional role of presiding officer and administrative head of the house the partisan role of leader of the majority party in the house and the representative role of an elected member of the house as the elect of the elect the speaker has perhaps th most visible job in congress by statute the speaker is also second in line behind the vice president to succeed to the presidency2 the constitution does not describe the office of the speaker or its duties nor was there any significant discussion of the office during the constitutional convention the use of the title speaker probably has its origins in the britis h house of commons where the presiding officer acted as the chambers spokesman to the crown but any assumptions the authors of the constitution had for the office undoubtedly also drew upon their own experiences in colonial legislatures and the continental congress there does not seem to have been any grand plan or specific expectation as to how the founding fathers envisioned the speakership rather the speakership has been largely shaped by the va rious individuals who have held the post the circumstances in which they have operated formal obligations that have been assigned to the office by house rules and by statute the character of the house as political and constitutional institution and traditions and customs that have evolved over time g21g142g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g21g153g142g138g148g142g155g345g561 when the house of representatives convenes at the beginning of new congress its first order of business is to elect speaker because the house dissolves at the end of congress and must start anew at the beginning of each new congress the clerk of the house presides over the house under general parliamentary law until speaker is elected for its first 50 years the house elected the speaker by ballot in 1839 this method was changed to election by vive voce meaning that each member names aloud whom he or she favors for speaker tellers then record the result in modern practice each party places the name of single member in nomination for the position but otherwise virtually the same vive voce method is used to elect the speaker because the election of the speaker typically takes place before the house adopts its rules of procedure the election process is defined by precedent and practice rather than by any formal rule 1 the other officers of the house are not specified in the constitution currently under house rule ii the clerk sergeantatarms chief administrative officer and chaplain are identified as officers to be elected by the house although the rule also states that the clerk sergeantatarms and chief administrative officer may be removed either by the house or the speaker rule ii also iden tifies additional officers the historian of the house the general counsel and the inspector general to be appointed by the speaker 2 the presidential succession act of 1947 pl 80199 61 stat 380 provides that if there is neither president nor vice president to discharge the powers and duties of the office of the president then the speaker of the house of representatives shall upon his resignation as speaker and as representative in congress act as president to succeed to the presidency speaker would also need to qualify under the terms of article ii section 5 of the constitution which requires that the president be naturalborn citizen at least 35 years of age and resident within the united states for 14 years 3 for more on

of the votes cast which may be less than majority of the full membership of the house because of vacancies absentees or members voting present4 although the major parties nominate candidates for the position of speaker there is limitation on whom members may vote for5 in fact there is requirement that the speaker be member of the house6 none of the other officers of the house is member if candidate receives the requisite majority the roll call is repeated until speaker is elected again members may continue to vote for any individual and restrictions such as eliminating minority candidates or prohibiting new candidates from being named are imposed for example at the beginning of the 34th congress in 1855 133 ballots over period of two months were necessary to elect nathaniel banks of massachusetts as speaker7 the last occasion on which multiple ballots were required to elect speaker was in 1923 at the beginning of the 68th congress the nominees from both major parties initially failed to receive majority of the votes because of votes cast for other candidates by members from the progressive party and from the progressive wing of the re publican party after the republican leadership agreed to accept number of procedural reforms the progressives agreed to vote for the republican candidate on the ninth ballot making frederick gillett of massachusetts the speaker8 if speaker dies or resigns during congress the house immediately elects new speaker although it was an earlier practice of the house to elect new speaker under these conditions by adopting resolution to that effect the modern practice is to use the same practice as employed at the beginning of congress the most recent example of this occurred during the 101 st congress when thomas foley of washington was elected speaker following the resignation of jim wright of texas9 in the 19th century longevity of house service was not as important criterion in selecting the speaker as it is today it was not unusual for member to be elected speaker with only few years service from 1789 to 1899 the average length of house service before member was elected speaker was 71 years in fact henr clay of kentucky in 1811 and william pennington of new jersey in 1860 were each elected speaker as freshmen the first speaker frederick muhlenberg of pennsylvania was obviously third albeit special case the 19 speakers elected between 1899 david b henderson and 2007 nancy pelosi served an average of 229 years in the house prior to their first election as speaker the longest pre speakership tenure in this period belonged to jim wright who served for 17 terms before being 4 the controlling precedent dates to mar 18 1879 when in response to an inquiry the clerk while presiding over the house stated it requires majority of those voting to elect speaker as it does to pass bill asher hinds hinds precedents of the house of representatives of the united states washington gpo 1907 vol 1 sec 216 hereafter cited as hinds precedents 5 however provision was added currently house rule i clause 9 at the start of the 104th congress limiting speaker to service for four consecutive congresses 6 for example in the election of the speaker at the beginning of the 105th congress two former members of the house robert h michel and robert walker each received one vote congressional record vol 143 jan 7 1997 p 117 7 on the 133rd ballot nathaniel banks received 103 votes while his four opponents r eceived total of 111 since this was not majority the house subsequently adopted resolution by

king to avoid the speakers espionage commons met in secret electing chairman in whom it had confidence even after any need for secrecy in its proceedings had passed commons continued to require that the speaker withdraw whenever the committee of the whole convened dealva stanwood alexander history and procedure of the house of representatives new york houghton mifflin 19 16 pp 257258 the american

leader of their parties speakers role as leader of the majority party is manifested in two ways within the party conference or caucus and on the house floor under the rules of the house democratic caucus the speaker recommends to the caucus nominees for officers of the house the speakers prominence within the caucus is reinforced because she chairs the steering and policy committee and appoints two cochairs two vice chairs and up to 15 of its members in addition the speaker is empowered to appoint one member to the house budget committee as well as make appointments to joint and select committees and various boards and commissions giving due consideration to spreading the workload among qualified and interested democrats she nominates the democratic membership on the committees on rules and house administration and recommends to the caucus nominee for chair of these committees if nominee is rejected the speaker may make another nomination until the position is filled

democratic congressional campaign committee dccc and also nominates the dccc chair previously within the republican party conference the speaker acted as the chairman of the partys steering committee and thus plays major part in the committee assignment process because members are nominated to serve on or chair committee by the steering committee these nominations are subject to approval by the full party conference and subsequently by the house in the 104 th congress it appears that the speaker exerted further influence in the process of nominating members to chair committees by naming slate of candidates before the steering committee had been formed although the speakers choices required the approval of the steering committee before they were placed before the full conference his influence was reported to have exceeded that of recent previous speakers13 in addition the speaker was empowered to make nominations directly for the republican conferences consideration for membership including chairs on the rules committee and the house administration committee as well as the chair and one member to serve as the second ranking republican on the budget committee house republican conference rules also provided for the speaker to serve on the national republican congressional committee because the speakers role as leader of the majority party in the house is sometimes at odds with his role as presiding officer of the chamber house republican conference rules stated that member of the elected or designated republi can leadership has an obligation to the best of hisher ability to support positions adopted by the conference and the resources of the leadership shall be utilized to support that position the success of every person to hold the speakers office since the late 20th century has been judged at least in part on the basis of their ability to use personal prestige and the powers of persuasion and bargaining to enunciate and advance their partys vision and legislative agenda as well as work to ensure majority control of the house to accomplish these objectives modern speakers have used varying personal styles and engaged in variety of activities not just in congress or their party conference but outside as well 14 for example they publicize their partys policies and achievements by giving speeches appearing on radio and television holding press conferences etc assist party members who are seeking reelection consult with presidents about both administration and congressional agendas and goals and when the majority in the house

individualistic legislative body requires speaker to use the entire range of tangible and intangible rewards that can be bestowed or withheld in an interview speaker oneill once described how he wielded these various minor powers by saying you know you ask what are my powers and my authorities around here the power to recognize on the floor little odds and endslike men get pride out of the prestige of handling the committee of the whole being named speaker for the day there is certain aura and respect that goes with the speakers office he does have the power to pick up the telephone and call people and members oftentimes like to bring their local political leaders or couple of mayors and oftentimes they have problems from their area and they need aid and assistance were happy to try to open the door for them having been in the town for so many years and knowing so many people we do know where lot of bodies are and we do know how to advise people 16 the power to schedule legislation for floor consideration can be used in ways that reflect both institutional and partisan considerations the speaker is charged with ensuring that the house processes its fundamental annual workload but determining what when and in which order measure reaches the floor can help determine its fate weeks delay in scheduling controversial bill may work to enhance or mini mize its chances for passage according to speaker oneill it was one of his most important powers because if speaker doesnt want certain bill to come up it usually doesnt17 similarly the speakers authority to appoint conferees can be powerful tool for influencing the final provisions of bill the members appointed represent complex balance of support for house committee and party positions as determined by the speaker and are not subject to challenge modern speakers have also frequently had to act as mediators of conflicts within their parties as one leader put it this involves trying to mollify members who are angry with other members trying to keep dangerous rifts from developing within the party sometimes getting people together of opposite viewpoints and letting them talk their problems out in way that lets each understand that the other has problem sometimes you can come to compromise 18 balancing parliamentary and partisan roles is not always easily accomplished at the start of the 20th century historian mary follett assessed this conundrum by writing the speaker is not only allowed but ex pected to use his pos ition to advance party interests it must not be supposed however that this implies gross partisanship on the part of our speakers they neither attempt to use every inch of power to be conjured out of the rules nor guide the house entirely from party motives their office has on the whole been administered with justness and fairness 19 16 michael j malbin house democrats are playing with strong leadership lineup national journal vol 9 june 18 1977 p 942 17 thomas p

that the speaker apply the rules of the house consistently yet in the twilight zone large area exists where he may exercise great discrimination and where he has many opportunities to apply the rules to his partys advantage 20 g22g145g142g561g21g153g142g138g148g142g155g561g138g156g561g138g561g15g142g150g139g142g155g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g10g152g158g156g142g561 although elected as an officer of the house the speaker continues to be member of the house as well accordingly the speaker continues to have the same rights responsibilities and privileges as all members however because of the speakers position as leader it may be notable or even controversial when he or she exercises the powers granted to other members such as debating voting and sitting as member of standing committee of the house under the principles articulated in jefferson s manual 21 the speaker is typically only heard on matters of order and it is highly irregular to speak on any other matter while presiding the speaker however may speak from the floor as woul d any other member and the precedents of the house include examples of the speaker leaving the chair to speak from the well make motions22 or debate point of order23 however in most periods in the history of the house these privileges were infrequently exercised jonathan dayton of new jersey was the first speaker to speak out on matter in committee of the whole during the fourth congress and it was not until henry clay of kentucky became speaker that this practice became generally accepted as late as 1850 chauncy cleveland of connecticut then member of the house questioned whether it would be right or just by the power of party to place man in the speakers chair and then compel him to use the influence of the chair when he had defined his position it was utterly impossible that the speaker after having taken his side upon the floor could go back to the chair and award the floor with the same impartiality as if he had never spoken 24 even today it is not commonplace for the speaker to participate in debate on the floor although the speaker may do so when he or she feels it necessary to highlight or rally support for the majority partys agenda25 20 floyd m riddick the united states congress organization and procedure washington national capitol publishers 1949 p 67 21 prepared by thomas jefferson while serving as vice president and president of the senate the manual was adopted as part of house rules beginning in 1837 to the extent that it is applicable and not inconsistent with the standing rules of the house rule xxviii 22 on apr 4 1864 speaker schuyler colfax of indiana came down from the chair to move resolution to expel representative alexander long of ohio he justified his action on the basis of henry clays frequent speeches from the floor while speaker but according to asher hinds colfax evidently confused clays actions in committee of the whole with participation during sessions of the

first rules of the house provided in all cases of ballot by the house the speaker shall vote in other cases he shall not vote unless the house be equally divided or unless his vote if given to the minority will make the division equal and in case of such equal division the question shall be lost 26 the speaker was thus prevented from voting on legislative matters although the precedents of the house record several examples of speakers voting contrary to this rule27 the speaker was allowed to vote in committee of the whole but most early speakers apparently refrained from this practice as well at least twice in 1833 and 1837 the house debated proposals to compel the speaker to vote on all questions but these proposals were defeated28 it was not until 1850 that the rule was amended to allow the speaker to vote at his discretion and the modern form of the rule was not adopted until 1880 rule i clause 7 currently reads the speaker is not required to vote in ordinary legislative proceedings except when his vote would be decisive or when the house is engaged in voting by ballot unlike other representatives the speaker does not sit on any standing committees of the house29 this was not always the case the rules committee was for many years select committee authorized to report system of rules at the beginning of congress and later also to report from time to time beginning in 1858 and continuing after the rules committee was made standing committee of the house in 1880 the speaker served as chairman this practice continued through 1910 when the house adopted rule prohibiting the speaker from sitting on the rules committee 30 the formal prohibition was removed from house rules by the legislative reorganization act of 194631 but the tradition has continued today the speaker does not sit on the rules committee but does nominate the majority members in the party conference effectively making the rules committee an integral part of the leadership structure 26 annals of congress vol 1 1st cong 1st sess apr 7 1789 p 99 the house customarily uses balloting only for the election of its officers not for resolving legislative questions 27 hinds precedents vol 5
