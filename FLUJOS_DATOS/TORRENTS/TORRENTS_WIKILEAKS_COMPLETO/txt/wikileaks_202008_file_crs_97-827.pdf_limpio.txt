committee on standards legal expense fund regulations adopted by the house committee on standards of official conduct on june 10 1996 require member or employee of the house to receive prior written permission from the committee on standards to establish legal expense fund the gist of the regulations is that legal expense fund may not be established to pay for merely personal legal expenses of member or employee eg expenses for matter primarily personal in nature eg matrimonial action but that member officer or employee of the house may establish such fund for legal expenses which arise in connection with ones official duties and status eg members candidacy for or electionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97827crs2 1house committee on standards of official conduct legal expense fund regulations memorandum to all members officers and employees june 10 1996 at 1 2 2legal expense fund regulations supra at 4 since these regulations expressly provide that member officer or employee may accept pro bono legal assistance for challenging the validity of federal law or regulation as opposed to providing that legal expense fund may accept such services as in other paragraphs of the regulations the inference established is that members may accept such pro bono legal assistance in civil actions challenging federal regulations even absent legal expense fund and that the acceptance of such services by member is not subject to the regulations requirements and restrictions the regulations note however that pro bono legal assistance for other purposes such as for example legal defense of member or employee shall be deemed contribution subject to these restrictions id 32 usc 59ed1 see house ethics manual 102 congress 2d session at 274275 april 1992to federal office the individuals official

purposes4 as noted by the house committee on standards of official conduct there is express or exhaustive definition of an official expense nor of what is permitted political use of campaign funds and that member has wide discretion in designating particular expenditure as political or official5 the house committee on standards of official conduct has stated that members may use campaign funds to defend legal actions arising out of their campaigns elections or the performance of their official duties6 and may use campaign funds for such matters connected to ones official representational duties as town meetings as long as official and politicalcampaign funds are not mixed in an event7 under the house committee on standards of official conduct regulations it is also expressly set out that campaign funds from political committee subject of course to campaign laws may be contributed to legal expense fund as the house regulations expressly provide that such fund could accept donations from any organization including specifically political action committee8 under such regulations and use guidelines it appears that the uses of political campaign contributions for those matters permitted within the legal expense fund guideline s are not to be considered prohibited personal or prohibited official uses9 campaign contributions federal law and federal elect ion commission regulations as to the campaign laws cited to by the house committee on standards of official conduct the federal campaign laws prohibit the use of campaign funds for personal purposes but allow members of congress to use campaign funds to pay an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of holder of federal office 2 usc 439a emphasis added the federal election commission under its statutory authority has issued regulations concerning impermissible personal uses of campaign funds the federal election commission has noted in regulations that prohibited personal use of campaign funds under 2 usc 439a is use for an expense or obligation that would exist irrespective of the candidates campaign or duties as federal officeho lder such as for example household food items or supplies funeral expenses tuition payments mortgages or rent on personal residences or clothing other than for campaign slogan tshirts or caps or the like10 however

may use campaign funds to pay an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of holder of federal office11 concerning legal expenses specifically the fec has noted that it would determine on case by case basis whether the use of campaign funds for legal expenses is personal or is related to the campaign or is in connection with ones official duties12 in an earlier explanation the fec noted that personal legal expenses would be expenses such as those for divorce or charges of driving under the influence of alcohol13 the use of campaign funds for legal matters arising out of circumstances which are not ones of similarly personal nature as the examples given by the fec but rather are connected with and related specifically to or have arisen by virtue of ones position as federal officeholder thus appear to be permissible both under house rules and the federal election commission regulations the fec has noted that although it has independent statutory authority to rule whether an expenditure from campaign accounts is an improper personal use as opposed to proper campaign or officeholder related use under 2 usc 439a the commission anticipates that in most circumstances officially connected expenses will be considered ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the duties of federal officeholder as that term is used under the feca and that therefore the commission does not expect significant conflicts in interpreting permissible political or officially connected expenses from the interpretations of permitted expenditures from campaig n accounts by the house and senate ethics committees14 all expenditures and dispositions of campaign funds over minimum amount must be accounted for and publicly reported under federal campaign law 2 usc 434 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97827crs5 appendix memorandum to all members officers and employees from committee on standards of official conduct nancy l johnson chairman jim mcdermott
