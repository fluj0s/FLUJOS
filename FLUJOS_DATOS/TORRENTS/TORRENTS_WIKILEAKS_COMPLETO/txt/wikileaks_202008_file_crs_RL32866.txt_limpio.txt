foreign affairs defense and trade division us assistance to the former soviet union summary since 1992 the united states has provided more than 28 billion in assistance to the 12 states of the former soviet union fsu it continues to provide nearly 2 billion annually this report describes the broad framework of us assistance programs and policies in the region and then focuses on the freedom support act fsa account under the foreign operations budget which encompassing all us objectives in the region has often been the means by which congress has expressed its views and sought to influence policy three objectives have been most prominent in the us assistance program to the region facilitating the transition from authoritarianism to democracy promoting the introduction and growth of free market economies and fostering security by controlling the proliferation of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and expertise more recently fourth objective very much encompassing the other three has emerged supporting the war on terror fifth objective of us assistance humanitarian relief was mostly applied in the early 1990s in response to countries experiencing food shortages under the state departments coordinator of us assistance to europe and eurasia and encompassing all us policy objectives the fsa account has been special interest of congress since its creation in 1992 about 11 billion of the 28 billion in total us aid provided between 1992 and 2005 has come from the fsa account under the terms of continuing resolution hr 5631pl 109289 as amended by hjres 20 on february 15 2007 the fsa account receives 452 million in fy2007 appropriations country allocations have not yet been determined the administration has requested 3516 million for the fsa account in fy2008 about 100 million less than the previous year perhaps the most notable feature of the fy2008 administration foreign operations request is the proposed 22 cut in aid with democracy challenged in russia and making headway in georgia ukraine and kyrgyzstan as well as important us interests in central asia cuts might appear to indicate low us priority for the region the recent rise of democracy in ukraine and georgia and its evident decline in russia have highlighted the role and possible need for us democratization assistance however absolute levels of democracy aid to russia in the fsa account have not increased since 1999 when it reached level of 64 million it is roughly 43 million in fy2006 and under the fy2008 request would fall to about 26 million aid to the fsu has always come with conditions the majority of specific restrictions have been aimed at russia as result in most years as much as 60 of planned us assistance to the federal russian government has been withheld

to provide nearly 2 billion annually over the years various aspects of the program have drawn strong congressional interest and sponsorship some country programs have been the subject of controversy and debate the 110th congress is likely to scrutinize these assistance programs as it seeks to address the range of us foreign policy strategic and economic interests in the region this report describes the broad framework of us assistance programs and policies in the former soviet union and then focuses on the foreign operations freedom support act fsa account which encompassing all us objectives in the region has often been the means by which congress has expressed its views and sought to influence policy background objectives and programs with the demise of the soviet union and emergence of dozen new independent states at the end of 1991 the united states launched assistance programs aimed at accomplishing varied foreign policy objectives three objectives have been most prominent facilitating the transition from authoritarianism to democracy promoting the introduction and growth of free market economies and fostering security by controlling the proliferation of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and expertise fourth objective of us assistance humanitarian relief was especially significant at discrete points in the 1990s when several countries experienced critical food shortages more recently fifth objective very much encompassing the other four has emerged supporting the war on terror democracy and economic reform efforts to boost the objectives of democratization and economic growth have been supported chiefly through assistance programs authorized by the freedom support act fsa of 1992 pl 102511 the assistance usually in the form of expert advice and associated materiel support or grants to indigenous organizations has sought to affect range of sectors among the democratic initiatives are technical assistance to political parties parliaments and independent media and grants to encourage the development of civil society nongovernmental organizations ngos exchanges most now funded under state department appropriations

and materials the department of energys material protection control and accounting mpca program sponsors numerous efforts to protect nuclear sites and thwart smuggling of material both the state department and doe have managed programs controlling the spread of weapons expertise by encouraging scientists to remain in the fsu state also supports export control and border security assistance

total us assistance to the fsu since 1992 has focused on security almost two thirds of these funds were directed at russia in recent years the proportion of aid directed at security concerns has risen substantially in fy2005 it represented nearly 67 of total aid compared to 237 in fy1995 antiterrorism while there are discrete antiterror programs aimed at the region such as border security and antiterrorism training all other assistance objectives can be viewed as supporting this one the securing of nuclear and other weapons has always been as much to keep them out of the hands of stateless terrorist groups as other nations the achievement of economic growth and democracy are seen as helpful conditions to discourage the sale of weapons and technology and the eruption of discontent and instability that might offer havens to terrorist operations the emergency supplemental that followed september 11 2001 targeted for special funding central asian countries which provided bases for us

its creation in 1992 about 11 billion of the 28 billion in total us aid provided between 1992 and 2005 has come from the foreign operationsfunded fsa account unlike doe or dod security programs funding for which has trended upward in the past dozen years the fsa account has fluctuated considerably since 2002 however it has been falling and at 452 million in fy2007 is at its lowest level since 1993 the decline may in part be explained by the view that some countries have progressed sufficiently in their economic and political development that they longer require us assistance see issues below the composition of the account has also changed significantly over 15 years in the early 1990s economic and social reform was the largest component as much as two thirds of the account in some years in 2005 it was down to only 40 of the account but still the largest component at 251 million hovering near the crs5 15 mark during the early and mid1990s democratization efforts rose to make up 25 by late in the decade in 2005 at nearly 200 million it represented about one third of the account security aid was only 5 of the account in the first part of the program but rose to high of 25 in 2000 as result of the socalled expanded threat reduction initiative that increased the state department role in non proliferation as the state department has moved nonproliferation program funding to the nadr and other accounts security as component of the fsa account has declined somewhat it was 19 in 2004 at 120 million millennium challenge account mca when the mca was established in

program was not established with any firm deadline in mind most observers assumed that the program was transitional and would not run as long as programs in developing countries state department strategy in 1994 suggested the russia program would end around 1998 in 1997 the partnership for freedom initiative which chiefly sought to reverse sharp decline in russia aid made explicit plan to wind down largescale technical assistance to the whole fsu in 2002 but with smaller grassroots cooperation programs continuing beyond then to about 2006 in 2003 the bush administration decided to phase out russia programs over several years beginning with economic sector programs by 2006 the questions these or any proposed cuts raise is whether they are desirable or justified in terms of what has been accomplished or remains to be achieved in each country in the case of russia the administration argued that economic reform programs were not required now that russia has achieved strong economic growth the administration claim that democracy activities would be maintained however appears not to hold up to scrutiny in fy2002 and fy2003 russia fsafunded democracy programs amounted to 63 and 61 million respectively however in subsequent years funding declined to 33 million in fy2004 43 million in fy2005 and 43 million in fy2006 the administration request for fy2008 contains 26 million for democracy programs in russia support for democratization although from the beginning declared major us policy objective in the region democracy has never risen above 15 of total allspigots spending in any year it is however now significant part of fsa account spending rising from 15 18 in most of the 1990s to 24 by 1998 34 in 2003 and 30 in 2006 however as overall account levels have fallen democracy funding actually declined significantly between 2003 and 2006 in the fsa account from 254 million to crs8 152 million the fy2008 request would provide about 128 million for democratization 36 of the total account the recent rise of democracy in ukraine and georgia and its evident decline in russia have highlighted the role and possible need for us democratization assistance the latter case in particular has elicited repeated calls for increased aid by expert observers during the last six years as putin has chipped away at democratic institutions and practices congress indicated its concern by passing the russian democracy act of 2002 pl 107246 which called for increased aid and emphasized the role of ngos and independent media in democratization one aspect in the creeping diminution of democratic practices in russia is the attacks on aid recipients in civil society and especially ngos that promote democracy in mid2005 ussupported human rights organization found itself accused of evading taxes even though its us foreign aid income is supposed to be tax free similar problems occurred in the early 1990s until they were resolved diplomatically by formal agreement with the us embassy this time however they are combined with attacks from the head of the federal security service on other ngos as well as the peace corps which left russia several years ago amid similar attacks and statement by president putin that foreign funding of political activities would not be permitted legislation to control russian ngos and severely restricting the ability of foreign organizations to assist them was approved by the duma in december 2005 and signed into law by president putin it took effect on april 13 2006 analysts suggest that russian authorities fear ukrainelike situation which has been blamed on us and other donorfunded ngos2 it is not possible to say to what degree us assistance is responsible for the positive developments in georgia ukraine and kyrgyzstan3 although the united states had previously pumped 807 million in fsa account aid to georgia 21 billion to ukraine and 408 million to kyrgyzstan including 138 million 453 million and 94 million respectively in democracy aid these countries remained corrupt economically stagnant and authoritarian up to the time of their democratic revolutions us programs however may have planted seeds of change especially in support for civil society and political party training both of which emphasize ways in which advocacy groups can make their voices heard all us democratization support carries the danger of charges of us interference in countrys internal affairs implementors have been careful especially in providing aid to political parties to be evenhanded and open to all comers but if the government is authoritarian then democracy aid may be viewed 2 putin says foreigners use private groups to meddle in russia new york times january 26 2006 secretary

accordingly ngos throughout central asia are reportedly being harassed some us officials believe at the instigation of russia4 conditionality aid to the fsu has always come with conditions both the freedom support act and annual foreign operations bills contain general and specific conditions that all the states of the fsu are expected to meet in order to receive assistance conditions left to the broad discretion of the president include whether these countries are undertaking economic and political reform are following international standards of human rights are adhering to international treaties and are denying support to terrorists other conditions established by congress have been more firm and specific among these is section 907 of the fsa which for decade prevented with some exceptions policy reform and other direct assistance to the government of azerbaijan unless it took steps to cease blockades and other uses of forces against armenia and nagornokarabakh beginning in 2002 and in each year following the president has waived this prohibition the majority of specific restrictions have been aimed at russia these include directions that aid be cut or withheld if russia implemented law discriminating against religious minorities if its troops remained in the baltics if it did not provide ngo access to chechnya or if it did not cooperate with war crime investigations in chechnya since fy1996 direct assistance to the government of russia has hinged on its continuing sale of nuclear reactor technology to iran as result in most years as much as 60 of planned us assistance to the federal russian government has been cut the new millennium challenge account compacts also come with their own conditionality to become eligible for the program countries must meet certain standards of behavior related to governance social development and economic freedom while armenia for example appears to have met those standards sufficient to warrant compact agreement it also has been warned that it must maintain them or risk losing aid even as its 236 million award was announced in december 2005 letter from the mcc to armenias president kocharian suggested that steps be taken to correct problems particularly with regard to charges of electoral fraud and media restrictions in the november 2005 constitutional referendum5 currently the most difficult conditionality issue arises with respect to human rights in central asia the authoritarian governments of the socalled stans were not seen as fertile territory for us assistance in the 1990s consequently most received minimal aid however after 911 these states became potential targets for muslim radicalism as well as front lines in the war on terrorism in fy2002 they received an additional 174 million in fsa account funds from antiterrorism 4 prodemocracy groups are harassed in central asia new york times december 4 2005 5 us approves grant to armenia but urges greater political rights new york times december 20 2005 crs10 supplemental appropriations although their strategic value has increased their poor record in supporting human rights has raised concerns reflected in succeeding appropriations bills in the fy2006 foreign operations appropriations for example aid to the central government of uzbekistan was conditioned on its making substantial and continuing progress in human rights and democratization aid to the government of kazakhstan similarly depended on its improvements in protection of human rights although the condition could be waived on national security grounds secretary of state rice most recently employed the waiver in may 2006 although the house version of the fy2007 foreign operations bill hr 5522 did not contain the uzbekistan or kazakhstan language foreign assistance appropriators reportedly expect the administration to respect fy2006 terms and conditions under the fy2007 continuing resolution in 2004 the secretary of state was unable to make determination allowing uzbek government aid to go forward and 18 million planned for the central government was withheld at the same time dod waived human rights requirement under the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction legislation to allow nonproliferation aid to uzbekistan6 following violent uzbek government response to unarmed demonstrators in midmay 2005 and critical comments by the united states relations between the united states and uzbekistan have been strained although the united states had been negotiating for longterm use of the base there the administration was forced to consider whether military relationship was viable in situation of authoritarian rule and civil unrest the decision appears to have been made for it when on july 31 2005 the uzbek government formally evicted us forces from the base effective within six months and reportedly has stopped cooperating with the united states on counterterrorism activities in 2005 and 2006 the secretary of state was again unable to make the determination that would allow some kinds of aid to the government of uzbekistan to go forward7 increasingly nondemocratic countries in the region have placed constraints on civil society and other nongovernmental organizations that us assistance targets in june 2005 the peace corps suspended the program in uzbekistan because the uzbek government did not renew the visas of volunteers in september 2005 the fsa accountfunded organization irex which had been working in the country since 1994 was ordered by uzbek court to stop its programs exchanges internet access and community development for six months and in march 2006 the us human rights group freedom house was ordered to end operations expecting similar action the eurasia foundation announced it would close its office8 6 although it is not unusual for different types and objectives of aid to be subject to different legislative conditions and to be treated differently the washington post reports the
