status of coop planning in the federa l courts and the implications of that planning for overall judiciary emergency preparedness some of the issues regarding judicial coop planning include the following role of the courts in an emergency the constitution mandates the supreme court of the united states and prescribes the statutory establishment of inferior federal courts it is however silent regardin g the continued functioning of the federal judiciary during or after an incapacitating operational interruption if localized interruption occurs courts in the affected area could m ove judges and other court personnel to judicial f acilities in unaffected areas or reassign cases to other districts or circuits26 in more wideranging situati ons where federal courts could not function due to an extended interruption the president could temporarily declare martial law and vest tria l court authority in milita ry tribunals convened by commanding officers in the field dispatched to enforce federal law27 congress might explore through oversight what legislative and administrative mechanisms might be available in situations of extended interr uption to provide for the administration of civilian judiciaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31978crs10 issue immediacy as the memory of dramatic interruptions such as the september 11 attacks and anthrax incidents fades attention to administrative operations like coop planning may receive lower priority attention in the federal judiciary emergency preparedness observe rs note that the success of contingency planning is dependent on current

the capacity for gsa to support the establishment and deployment of oep plans in court facilities what plans do courts have in place to ensure that they can continue to carry out their constitutional and statutory duties in the event of an incident that could potentia lly disrupt those operations for undetermined periods of time which circuits or districts have established effective c oop programs to what extent have those plans been implemented or exercised and practiced how have various plans been upgraded in the aftermath of the autumn 2001 attacks have those plans been evaluated and by what
