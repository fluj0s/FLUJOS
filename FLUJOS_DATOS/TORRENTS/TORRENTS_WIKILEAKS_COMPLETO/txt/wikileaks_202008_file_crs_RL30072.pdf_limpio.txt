position at firm which offers benefits contingent workers may include temporary workers parttime workers oncall workers lease d employees day laborers t he selfemployed independent contractors and employees of contract services firms some observers dispute the inclusion of all these groups because they think not all nontradition employment relationships are insecure the lack of consensus on an operational definition for contingent work arrangement s means that agreement also is absent on the size and growth of the phenomenon without knowing these things it is difficult to gauge whether legislative response is warranted and if one were what would be the appropriate remedies temporary workers employed by staffing companies for placement i n assignments of varying duration at client firms are widely considered part of th contingent labor force agency temporaries are disp roportionately young female and minorities and in clerical as well as lowskilled bluecollar occupations they more often give economic eg only kin d of job they could get than personal eg family obligations reasons for being in nontraditional job most would prefer to hav traditional jobs they are more likely to be unemployed than permanent workers some analysts believe the rapid growth of the temporary help supply ths industry has been fueled by changes in the economy that put premium on staffing flexibility and labor cost savings agency temporaries afford type of flexibilit which it is suggested has become increasin gly important to client firms trying out workers before making permanent job offers the temptohire route enables firms to avoid poor hiring decisions which could become costly firing decisions man agency temporaries are not utilized in this way however others argue that ths jobs have increased because they allow user firms to avoid costly legal obligation s associated with the direct employment of worker s ie health benefits pension plans social security and unemployment insurance policies to address the contingent worker issue most often are justified on th basis of workplace equity that is similarly endowed individ uals who perform like jobs should receive equivalent hou rly wages and benefits as well as equal treatment under labor regulations regardless of their employeeemployer relationship becaus contingent workers at firms that fail to provide discretionary benefits would not b helped by certain proposals eg shorter vesting periods and portability for pensions some have suggested requiring all employers to offer minimum benefit package rather than transforming discretionary into mandated benefits others hav recommended loosening the connection between work and b enefits eg encouraging people to selfinsure through taxfavored treatment of health care expenses an d retirement savings still others question the appropriateness of acrosstheboar d measures being applied to the several different kinds of contingent wor k arrange

of longterm relationship with single employer and because persons in the abovedescribe d1 employment relationships may be scheduled to work less than 35 hours week the considera tion of parttimers as

alternative work arrangements the proportions f these individuals who said they did not expect their employment to last long that is who said they held contingent jobs ranged from 35 for independen t contractors to 57 for agency temporaries3 many analysts nonetheless consider alternative and contingent work to b synonymous they believe the distinction complicates the popular understanding of who

because data were first collected for 1995rather than using sense of impermanence about ones job as the sol e5 defining attribute of contingent labor so researchers rely on multiple criteria one set

benefits that firms pro vide to their employees and lack of attachment to particular company another example of multipar t6 definition is the following nonstandard arrangements differ from standard jobs in at least one of th following ways 1 the absence of an employer as in selfemployment and independent contracting 2 distinction between the organization that employs the worker and the one for

post october 20 12 1993 bls occupational compensation survey 13what are the appropriate remedies the very heterogeneity of the contingent labo r force also could complicate the crafting of public policy the connection to public policy concern has arisen in some quarters that the publicprivate soc ial welfare system which evolved with the traditional employeeemployer relationship in mind is t adequately serving an expanding share of the labor force it is argued that whil business has reaped benefits from its use of nontraditional employment arrangements eg staffing flex ibility and labor cost savings the members of the contingent labor force have borne variety of costs eg limited opportunity for productivity enhancing tra ining and for union representation and small paychecks that result in low standard of living both in work and retirement years more specifically temporary and parttime workers may be unable to meet the eligibility requirements of certain mandated benefits among them the unemployment insurance ui programs quarterly earnings and hours threshold or the family and medical leave acts annual hours threshold when firms offe r discretionary benefits temporary

supply industry received paid holidays an d vacations or participated in health plans11 others have countered that flexible work arra ngements actually help those in the labor force and in the population generally by strengthening the competitiveness f us firms and thereby promoting economi c and job growth they assert that further extending labor protections would inhibit expansion of the economy and promp t companies to cut or slow job growth in response to higher employment costs because som workers want flexibility in their schedules in order to engage in other pursuits young

high school or college in 1997 it19 appears then that the overrepresentation of youth empl oyed as temps is not primarily motivated by desire to combine school attendance and labor force participation similarly mothers do not seem to rely heavily on staffing companies to provide them with flexible means of combining paid work and family responsibilities fewe r women employed as temps were raising

increased use of agency temporaries is unlikely to have had muc h impact on aggregate job stability ie number of workers switching jobs and number unemploy ed because this nonstandard work arrangement

responses in the industry than in the total nonfarm economy as shown in table 2 ths employment contracted slightl y35 more 15 during the 19901991 recession than employment across all nonfarm

help agencies for workers on an as needed basis allows firms to minimize the number of workers on their payrolls who become surplus and subject to termination when output demand subsequently slackens

have been credited with business desire to stay lean and mean in order to avoid such largescale layoffs in the future the rapid increase in temporary employment immediately after the 19901991

temporary and staffing services showed that 29 of ths workers obtained permanent positions based on their assignments at client firms48 although survey of employers sponsored by the upjohn institute for employment research found that 21 of businesses using agency temporaries did so to scree n them for permanent jobs other reasons were much more frequently offered b respondents for their use of temps however ove r onehalf of those companies that49 increased their use of ths workers in the 1990s were motivated by desire to fil l permanent positions 24 did so to screen candidates for permanent jobs and 37 did so because they found it difficult to find qualified workers on their own others claim that the temporary help agencies themselves actually discourage the transition of their employees into permanent jobs with user firms some agencie s charge client firms fee if they hire the temporary worker within x days of n assignment to deter firms from using temporary instead of permanent employmen t agencies or they may contractually prohibit user firms from offering and temps from accepting permanent jobs for some period after completion of an assignment50 it also is contended that

viewpoint these observer s believe that marketmediat ed arrangements have flourished because they relieve user firms of expensive legal obligations associated with traditional employment particularly those costs linked to the hiringfiring decision eg mandated benefit s including ui and social security as well as voluntarily provided benefits includin g pensions it is suggested that firms in recent years have chosen human resources51 strategy which uses ths workers on regular yearround instead of occasiona l basis52 the phenomenon of permanent temps is offered in support of this perspective while 35 of agency temp oraries in 1997 were on their current assignments for less than 3 months according to bls data nearly 29 st ayed on the same assignment for one year or longer based on transitions over the 19831993 period over onehalf of ths workers got permanent positions while over onefifth were still in temporary jobs one year later and among users of agency temporaries 56 of firm s53 indicated that they seldom or never m oved temps into permanent positions compared to 43 who said they did so often occasionally or sometimes these finding s54 suggest that sizeable minority of individuals who work for temporary help agencies may be characterized as permatemps either in the sense of having longter m attachment to particular client nonemployer firm or to th temporary labor market in general proponents of the permatemp viewpoint urge changes in emplo yment regulations to better protect contingent workers whom they regard as being trapped in secondary labor market characterized by high job turnover low compensation as well as limited training and advancement opportunities these changes typically include requiring pay and benefit equity for contingent and traditional workers in comparable positions revising eligibility rules for ui and vesting requirements under th employee retirement income security act erisa and reforming the nationa l labor relations act advocates argue that those temporary work ers and independent contracto rs who are in longlasting relationships with client firms should b considered their employees and thus entitled to

contrast recommend that barriers to the creation f permanent positions be removed by reasserting the employmentatwill doctrine or by rolling back regulations thought to impede the free functioning of the labo r market at the least they urge the preservation of staffing companies legal status58 as the employer of temporary workers temptohire proponents argue that actions to dissuad firms from using agency temporaries by raising their cost visavi s tradition workers could hamper the development of superior job matches whic h benefit firms through improved productivity and lower labor costs and workers through greater job satisfaction and longer job tenure twotier compensation systems another explanation put forth for the increase in contingent jobs is that the make it easy for firms to create twotier compensation structures which provid otherwise identical workers performing the same jobs different wage and benefi t packages company may want to have different compensation systems for different classes of workers because 1 some jobs involve incenti ve and management problems that can be addressed through particular pay structure eg paying abovemarket wages only to those workers in whom the firm invested greatly in recruitment an d training in orde r to curtail turnover 2 some workers have varying preferences for and therefore assign different values to the componen ts of compensation eg young workers may prefer higher wages to receiving health benefits and 3 som incumbent workers eg unio nized employees within firms workforce have more bargaining power than others however firms that provide health or pension benefits to only some employees risk losin g the income tax exemption associated with benefit provision and firms that differently compensate similar employees performing th same jobs risk morale and productivity problems there are two reasons to think that ths workers have been more frequentl utilized over time to establish twotier compensation systems the cost to employers of providing benefits generally and healt h insurance particularly has increased relative to wages in recent decades thus the value to firms of reining in benefit expenditures would have risen in ddition the appearance of morale problems at companies that had instituted twotier compensation system s for their own employees coincided with the timing of rapid growth in bluecollar temps this suggests that firms that found it difficult to pay new regular employees lower wages than their established employees beg an to experiment with using lowerpaid temporaries to fill the new openings the relatively large gap between temporary and regular wages in the blu ecollar occupations is also consistent with the notion of bluecollar temporaries filling the bottom of twotier pay structure59 wages regardless of the different survey data examined temporary workers would seem to be attractive to firms based on their relatively low pay levels in 1997

bls survey of individuals in alternative work arr angements with full time temps earning nearly twothirds as much per week as fulltime workers i n traditional jobs median weekly earnings of 329 versus

temps and employees of client firms that result i n productivity differentials ths workers also may be concentrated in differen t occupations and industries than permanent workers moreover the gross wage gap may not be evidence of employer discrimination against temporary workers one analysis estimated the hourly pay differential between temporary an d permanent workers after adjustment for variety of wagerelated characteristics on an unadjusted basis the researchers calculated the wage rate of agency temporaries to be 22 less than that of permanent workers in 1996 after taking into accoun t differences between the two groups in terms of age race sex education an d geographic location the pay gap shrank to 14 by controlling for certain jo b characteris tics ie union and parttime status as well as broad occupational group in addition to the aforementioned personal characteristics the wage disparit narrowed further to 8 upon correcting for unobserved differences between th two groups of workers eg years of experience the researchers estimated tha t temporary status alone might reduce persons hourly wage by 561 in another study the researchers sepa rately analyzed women and men employed fulltime in various work arrangements they found that in 1995 for women with similar personal and job characteristics the hourly wage of fulltime temps was not significantly different from that of fulltime workers in traditional jobs in contrast among otherwise equivalent men those employe d fulltime by staffing companies still earned about 8 less than men employed fulltime in traditional jobs62 in addition gross wage comparisons may overstate the c ostsavings to firms that use temps because the reported pay levels do not reflect the premium that agencies charge client firms in 1995 for example firms paid temporary help agencies 40 more on average than temps received in wages when client firms were asked t o63 compare the billed hourly rate for ths workers with the

the minimum wage and expanding the earned income tax credi t other proposals eg sick leave vacation or health insurance eligibility on pro rata basis shorter vesting periods and portability for

transforming discretionary into man dated workplace benefits the idea of loosening the historical connec tion between employment and benefit provision has been embraced by diverse members of the
