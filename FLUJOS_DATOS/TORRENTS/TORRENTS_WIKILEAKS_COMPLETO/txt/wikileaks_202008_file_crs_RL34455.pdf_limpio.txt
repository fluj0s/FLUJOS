aimed to provide comprehensive program for the future security of the united states including the establishment of integrated policies and procedures for the departments agencies and functions of the government relating to the national security the legislation laid the foundation of new national security regime including the creation of the national security council the central intelligence agency the department of defense an independent department of the air force and permanent joint chiefs of staff national security act of 1947 pl 80235 as amended in 1949 pl 216 and subsequently section 401 2 secretary of defense robert gates has used the phrase in number of contexts including at the april 15 2008 house armed services committee hearing building part nership capacity and development of the interagency process 3 in broad terms the debates could follow the model of the goldwaternichols process of the 1980s which led to the goldwaternichols department of defense reorganization act of 1986 october 1 1986 pl 99433 that landmark legislation ushered in fundamental defense reorganization aimed at diminishing interservice rivalries and promoting greater jointness through streamlining the chain of command enhancing the military advisory role of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and adjusting personnel policies and the budgeting process for an account of that process by key participant see james r locher iii victory on the potomac the goldwaternichols act unifies the pentagon college station tx texas am university press 2002 in the current debates calls for

security roles and responsibilities among executive branch key players the capacity of individual agencies on the basis of their current structure organization policies mandates and institutional culture to fulfill their national security responsibilities coordination and integration among agencies with national security responsibilities for both planning and execution in the field national security decisionmaking national security strategymaking the distribution of resources to support national security activities and congressional oversight the debates are somewhat unfocused because there is still clear consensus about the proper boundaries of national security concerns in the 21st century global security context5 some 4 in recent years students at continuing education programs for government officials such as dods senior service schools have made substantial contributions to the debates often drawing on their personal operational experiences see for example martin j gorman

vulnerability of us territory to terrorist attacks argue that homeland security should be considered an integral part of national security other observers stressing that international partnerships are key to security include the full array of foreign affairs activities under the national security rubric some observers emphasize that energy security and economic prosperity are essential to the nations security and should therefore be considered national security concerns still others use the term national security in more narrow sense another point of confusion is that critics of the current system use different starting points for their analysis some take topdown approach focused on optimizing the national security regime at the systemic level while others begin with specific issuesuch as foreign assistance stabilization and reconstruction or counterterrorismand discuss systemiclevel reform as it relates to that topic6 arguments vary concerning how sweeping national security reform ought to be it seems reasonable to suppose the existence of constituency for the status quothat is observers and practitioners who prefer the current regime to proposed reformsbut those voices have not yet joined the debates g13g142g162g561g18g155g152g153g152g151g142g151g157g156g561g152g143g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g561 several major players and organizations are spearheading

comm ittee staffer in the 1980s directed the development of the goldwaternichols legislation 13 pnsr selfconsciously modeled on goldwaternichols in the scope of its ambition aims at improving the us governments ability to effectively provide for the nations security in the 21st century and more explicitly at helping craft new national security act14 pnsr brought together on its guiding coalition and on its working groups many of the key institutional and individual thought leaders on national security reform in the washington policy community as well as representation across the political spectrum pnsr issued its final report entitled forging new shield in late 200815 the center for strategic and international studies csis has provided platform for series of major projects on national security reformrelated issues incorporating senior practitioners and outside thought leaders as well as its own experts these efforts have included the fourphase beyond goldwaternichols project which presents an integrated set of practical and actionable recommendations for organizing the us defense and national security apparatus to meet 21st century challenges the task force on nontraditional security assistance cochaired by representative robert andrews and representative mark kirk and the commission on smart power cochaired by richard l armitage and joseph s nye jr other illustrative

structures and proces ses in practice key elements include executive branch agencies formal and informal mechanisms for coordinating and integrating national security planning and execution among those agencies the process for supporting presidential decisionmaking guidance from national security strategy resource distribution within the executive branch and congressional oversight different debate participants reviewing these elements describe the problemand thus the rationale for changein different ways in some cases this is because they disagree about the diagnosis in others it is because they focus on different elements of the system and in still others it is because they use different arguments to point to the same underlying concerns an unfortunate tendency throughout the debates is to identify whats wrong primarily in terms of proposed fix rather than explaining why given arrangement is nonoptimal this section reviews major problems identified with each of the key

specific issue in question the global context and presidential direction key players include for example those agencies represented on the national security council and homeland security council under the george w bush administration the national security council included the secretaries of state defense and energy as statutory members the secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the director of national intelligence in advisory capacities 18 the homeland security council included the secretaries of homeland security treasury defense health and human services and transportation as well as the directors of national intelligence and the federal bureau of investigation19 some activities of many other agencies such as the us agency for international development usaid20 and the departments of commerce justice and agriculture also have bearing on national security key players also include agencies representatives serving around the world such as

sufficient capacity or the necessary capabilities to support their national security roles and responsibilities this is due in part to an overall growth in requirements for civilian engagementfor the flexible use of soft powerin the post911 globalized world civilian agencies it is argued are underresourced understaffed nonoptimally organized and trained andor lack the necessary expeditionary institutional culture for example civilian agencies were not prepared to quickly depl oy large numbers of personnel to carry out reconstruction work in the immediate aftermath of major combat in iraq and afghanistan debate participants focus primarily on the department of state and usaid but also refer to other agencies such as justice and treasury that might play roles in complex contingencies limited civilian capacity is problem primarily it is argued because it may leave unmet important requirements that support us national security goals alternatively missions for which civilian agencies would be best qualified are passed to other entities that are available but less qualified such as dod or to contractors some debate participants particularly in the defense community argue that using dod as the default solution places additional stress on already stretched forces and reduces their ability to train and prepare for other requirements 21 some of the sharpest critiques have come from deployed us commanders who have wondered where is the state department22 g7g161g142g140g158g157g146g159g142g561g4g155g138g151g140g145g561g13g142g162g561g18g149g138g162g142g155g156g497g561g515g6g17g6g561g20g152g149g142g561g146g156g561g22g152g152g561g14g138g155g144g142g516g561 other critics of the current balance of roles and responsibilities among executive branch key players identify the same problem from different angle arguing that dod has assumed too large role in various foreign affairs activities such as economic reconstruction the training of foreign police forces and humanitarian assistance some of the sharpest critiques in this category suggest that dod is encroaching on the purview of civilian agencies in terms of both the role it is playing in the field and the share of resources it is receiving to execute those missions some of these observers argue that an expanded dod role is problem primarily because dod personnel do not have the expertise for many foreign assistance missions and that therefore their efforts in such areas may do more harm than good others stress that us military lead role on the ground may send the wrong messages to international partner states and organizations still others stress that even when dods stopgap efforts successfully meet shortterm needs this problemsolving reduces the impetus in washington for more adequately resourcing and preparing civilian agencies to do the job 21 for an institutional view see general richard cody statement for the record house armed services committee april 10 2008 which notes todays army is out of balance the current demand for our forces in iraq and afghanistan exceeds the sustainable supply and limits our ability to provide ready forces for other contingencies how broadly to define the range of missions for which us should prepare and whether to dedicate forces to nontraditional missions are current topics of debate within the office of the secretary of defense and the services 22 information from us commanders multinational forceiraq january 2008

informal practices factors that may affect the effectiveness of any of these methods include the authorities of the coordinating bodies or individuals the resources they control and the access they enjoy to top decisionmakers in some cases responsibility for coordination or oversight of implementation is assigned to the white house staff one example from the george w bush administration is the role of the assistant to the president and deputy national security advisor for iraq and afghanistan responsible for coordinating executive branch efforts in these two major complex operations another bush administration example is the usa freedom corps whose leadership council like the nsc included cabinet members the director of the freedom corps served as deputy administrator to the president and was responsible from that white house office for coordinating input from all participating agencies and overseeing implementation of freedom corps initiatives 23 in other cases responsibility is assigned to lead agency flexible concept that refers to giving single department or agency the responsibility in given issue area for coordinating efforts by multiple agencies lead agency may be permanent or temporary and it may or may not be authorized to give direction to other agencies during operation iraqi freedom for example the department of defense served temporarily as the assigned lead agency at the department of state the office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization scrs has been assigned permanent lead agency role in coordinating planning and execution for complex contingencies 24 in other cases to provide coordination among agencies an extraagency body is created whose personnel are drawn from all key concerned agencies the national counterterrorism center follows this model by bringing together experts from various departments and agencies to integrate and analyze counterterrorismrelated intelligence and to conduct joint planning25 in practice interagency coordination mechanisms often develop more quickly in the field driven by operational exigencies country teams at us embassies around the world under the authority of the chief of mission

working at cross purposes it can send conflicting messages to partner states it can inadvertently demonstrate lack of national unity and most of all it can lead to failures in execution

national security council system established by the national security act of 1947 was designed in part to support presidential decisionmaking on national security issues 28 it is the system by which designated leaders of executive branch agencies and presidential advisors review clarify and prepare specific issues for presidential decisions as rule how that decision support function works in practice depends on the discretion of each president29 for example president eisenhower perhaps drawing on his military background established relatively formal nsc system including planni ng board composed of senior officials to thoroughly review each issue prior to considerat ion by the national security council itself and an operations coordinating board to oversee implementation30 his immediate successor president kennedy responding in part to critique s that the eisenhower system had been too rigid began his administration by abolishing the operations board and adopting less formal approach31 under the administration of president george w bush the decisionmaking system was based on national security presidential directive1 which established system of policy coordination

other elements of national power and discussion of the adequacy of available capabilities 35 each strategy is thus intended to provide guidance for carrying out national security activities in practice strategies have been submitted periodically but not always annually36 some critics point out that as rule national security strategies crafted under this mandate describe but do not

oversight role includes reviewing monitoring and supervising the implementation of public policy40 that role includes for example conducting the budget authorization and appropriations processes ensuring that execution by the executive branch matches legislative intent evaluating program performance and specifying the organization functions and authorities of federal agencies most oversight is carried out through congress s committee structure including appropriations subcommittee review of fiscal matters and standing and select committee review of activities in their areas of jurisdiction these portfolios roughly correspond to those of key national security departments some debate participants argue that these congressional oversight mechanisms are poorly designed for holistic consideration of issues ch as national security that involve multiple agencies budget requests are considered by agency rather than functional area although full appropriations committees arguably take systemic view when they divide the budget among their subcommittees they do not have the time or ability it is argued for detailed consideration of possible areas of overlap or of tradespace among the elements of national power in turn ongoing oversight mechanisms by standi ng committees do not provide it is argued any regular forum for systemiclevel consideration of

may provide some limited crossfertilization this arrangement is problem it is argued because it gives agencies an incentive to demonstrate fulfillment of their individual mandates but it does not

executive branch agencies this group of observers includes those concerned that dod is doing too much and those worried that the department of state dos is doing too little it is frequently noted for example that for foreign affairs activities dos has most of the authorities while dod has most of the resources including personnel adjustments could target either of those categories

branch agencies as means to improve coordination in planning and execution this emphasis is distinct from but theoretically mutually compatible with calls to adjust the division of labor among agencies some proposals follow the goldwaternichols emphasis on human capital these include calls for greater opportunities for interagency shared training exercising and education as well as enhanced exchange programs supporting tours of duty in other agencies41 41 for detailed analysis of these issues and of the national security professional development program launched by the george w bush

approaches usually note that they would likely require personnel policy adjustments ensuring for example that such interagency service figures positively in promotion criteria and creating sufficient personnel float in civilian agencies to backfill posts42 other proposals seek to adjust and synchronize us government agency representation in the field these include for example giving greater authority to chiefs of mission to coordinate or direct representatives of other agencies serving in their country teams aligning the definitions of geographical regions of the world used by various us government agencies creating and empowering regional ambassadors with areas of responsibility corresponding to those of military combatant commands or strengthening the representation of civilian agencies at regional combatant commands

to foster stronger coordination of national security efforts number of debate participants have proposed creating new position based at the white house for example an nsc senior director or more senior assistant to the president one version of this school of thought suggests very senior new post with responsibility for overseeing the conduct of strategic reviews and the issuance of guidance

although many observers note that the national security decisionmaking process is imperfect most add that its dynamics depend greatly on presidential discretion and the personalities of key

some observers emphasizing that national security guidance is key to effective national security efforts call for the preparation of more focused national security strategies including clear priorities and timelines some suggest that national security strategy would benefit from more rigorousand possibly congressionally mandatedreview process modeled on the quadrennial defense review process at the department of defense 43 in turn some observers have called for 42 the study foreign affairs budget for the future went step further arguing that the creation of civilian float is prerequisite for developing interagency coordination and integration mechanisms to that end the study recommended enhancing department of state civilian capacity by total of 4735 new billets between

national security reform the following areas may merit further exploration as rule reform proposals are based usually explicitly on some assumptions about the global security context including for how long those identified conditions are likely to persist in theory there might be some advantages in orienting national security system toward the major challenges of its day just as the national security act of 1947 was designed for the postwwii cold war world on the other hand there might be different advantages in building some flexibility into the system to allow for both unexpected events and change over time most national security reform proposals to date list specific initiatives but do not bring them together in single plan of action for example most proposals do not prioritize their recommendations and most do not propose sequence for the introduction of changes most do continued strategic and international studies july 2005 p 28 in december 2008 the project on national
