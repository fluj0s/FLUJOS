january 2002 the presence of the executive secretary and other senior mem bers of eca gave the right signal that it was regarded as an im portant issue within eca however the f ollowing weaknesses in

clear set of operating guidelines which would im pair the efficiency and effectiveness of its operati on the first m eeting of uig was organized on 18 june 2004 however the m eeting was largely unattended by the it focal points in substantive divisions due to inadequate arrangem ents further the chief of iss was not present for the m ost of session due to other urgent m atters as result oios did not consider that uig has been form ally established yet recommendation to ensure that the it user in terest group can operate as an effective it user group the chief of iss eca should form ulate

close the recom mendation upon receipt of approved 3 rules of procedures c ad hoc task forces under ictc 13 at its m eeting in may 2003 ictc established two task forces for em ail and internet usage in the absence of an effectively operating ictc oios noted that neither of these task forces had approved terms of reference and operating guidelines this ham pered the efficiency and effectivene ss of the task forces for exam ple there was evidence that the em ail task force had undertaken adequate consultation or discussions am ong the task force m embers and w ith others parts of eca furtherm ore the draft policy from em ail task force di d not consider the proposed stsgb on ict resources that ictb had recently subm itted to ohrm for action recommendation the executive secretary eca should

dated 20 novem ber 2002 represented in developing strategic fram ework to further guide the developm ent of ict within the and requested that the it requirem ents for the various duty stations be fully integrated into the strategy 16 in the opinion of oios the above m eant that eca needed to create an eca it strategy docum ent which included those elem ents of the ict strategy applicable to eca and included any eca specific ict i ssues not covered by the ict strategy at the tim of the audit eca did not ve corporate it strategy docum ent although the executive secretary of eca had request ed the ictc in may 2003 to provide him with vision and an overall strategy paper on it at eca 17 eca has substantive program under the developm ent inform ation services division that helps m ember states to velop national inform ation and com munication infrastructure plans and strategies oios was of the opinion that the process and the principles of this initiative were of great re levance to eca in its own ef fort to develop it strategy and plan 4 recommendation to ensure com pliance with a57620 and to assist eca in optim ising its it resources the executive secretary eca should establish and oversee task force to develop an eca it strategy which should draw upon the experience of the work done by eca to develop national inform ation and com munication infrastructure plans and strategies rec04 18 eca stated that based on the ict stra tegy document draft outline of the it strategy document has been prepared and the tor of the ict strategy task force would be developed in

strategy paper b long and shortterm it plans 19 at the tim of audit iss had list of initiatives which it planned to carry out in specific year there were however long and short term it plans detailing all the it tasks which were required to m eet th ict strategy and satisfy eca needs oios considers such plans as im portant becau they provide basis for allocating and monitoring use of resources com municating to interested parties how the it strategy will be delivered and dem onstrating how it activities have been prioritised to m eet and eca needs recommendation to dem onstrate how it resources are being utilised the chief of iss eca should put in place m echanism for the creation and approval of it short and long term planning based on the it strategy rec 05 20 eca stated that based on the draft it strategy and with the view to develop mechanism to create and im plement it short and long term plans iss has started soliciting input from administrative management and substantive divisions of eca including sros the csu head was requested to include these tasks in the 20042005 epas work plan oios appreciates eca initiatives oios will close the recom mendation upon receipt of the approve d short and long term it planning docum ent c organiz ation and function of iss roles and responsibilities of iss 21 in accordance with industry standards such as the control objectives for inform ation technology cobit used by the bo ard of auditors in their recent review of it an it function with in an organization would norm ally have range of it managem ent responsibilities including policy st andards strategy planning analysis of organisational requirem ents and m onitoring as well as m aintenance and support in this respect it would be reporting to chief info rmation officer who would have sim ilar role f or it to the one the heads of finance or hum an resources have for their 5 respective functions 22 for these reasons oios expected that the chief of iss would be the chief inform ation officer and that the roles nd responsibilities of iss would be along the lines of those described above however oios noted that the current roles and responsibilities of iss were lim ited to those of service delivery and support as result it appeared that one in eca had res ponsibility for coordinating docum enting and reporting on all it m atters taking place within eca further the ictc and the had one whom they could hold accountable fo r ensuring that eca it decisions were implem ented and eca had an effective it infrastructure to support delivery of its mandate recommendation to im prove accountability for ensuring that eca has an effective it infrastructure to support delivery of its m andate the executive secretary eca should consider strengthening and expanding the roles and responsibilities of iss in line with industry standards such as cobit this should include m aking the chief of iss the chief inform ation officer for eca rec 06 23 eca commented that for the sake of harmonization and coordination this recommendation needs to be viewed as part of the framework of isps implementation strategy of the project strengtheni ng information and technology governance in eca oios appreciates ecas com ment and will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of the results of project dealing with strengthening inform ation and technology governance in eca b telecom munication unit 24 memo from the chief of facilitie s managem ent section dated 21 may 2003 addressed to the director of conference nd general services division indicated that the transfer of the telecom munication unit into iss effective from 1 january 2004 had been agreed however specific plan was yet to be prepared as of march 2004 oios supports this integration as being in lin the ict strategy and the organizational arrangem ents at headquarters unhq united nations office at geneva and united nations office at nairobi recommendation the director of cgsd eca should transfer the telecom munication unit to iss with im mediate effect rec 07 25 eca stated that pending avail ability of human resources the telecommunications unit can be moved to i ss plan of the transfer including profile of manpower requirement will be prepared and submitted to the for approval by january 2005 oios thanks eca f or the im plem entation plan and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the transfer of the telecom munication unit c imis com petence centre 6 26 the imis coordinator established an imis com petency centre to enable knowledge sharing and enhancing the imis operation oios support this initiative which at the tim of the audit did not yet have form term s of reference and operating guidelines clarifying its role and linkages with iss and ictc recommendation to enhance the effectiveness of the imis com petence centre the chief of iss in consultation with the eca imis coordinator should develop term s of referen ce and operating guidelines for the imis com petency centre which should be approved by the ictc rec 08 27 eca stated that chief of iss will discuss the tor of the imis competence center with the imis coordinator during the discussion on epas work plan for 2004 2005 oios will close the recom mendation upon receipt of the approved tor and operating guidelines for the imis com petency centre d provision of services and monitoring delivery need for service standardservice level agreem ent 28 whilst recognising the client oriented pproach of iss directors and chiefs interviewed by oios expressed concern that iss lacked an effective m echanism to translate the results of this approach into effective action plans nd feedback that would have dem onstrated that iss was truly res ponsive to their needs to rem edy this situation those interviewed wished to s ee current arrangem ents strengthened through the introduction of service level ag reem ents between iss and divisions2 an initiative which oios supports once the roles and res ponsibilities of iss have been clarified as described in previous sections recommendation to ensure that the it services which iss delivers are based on divisional needs and the adequacy of the service delivered can be measured the chief of iss eca should supplem ent his existing client approach by service level agr eements with user divisions rec 09 29 eca commented that given the small size of the user community in eca it does not look feasible to involve in service level agreement with divisions instead iss believes that the user interest group uig functioning under the framework of ictc coupled with customer support unit csu of iss could be used as mechanisms to verify whether the needs of divisionssro s are met including the quality of service rendered with the view to seek feedback of the user community iss will regularly conduct surveys in order to monitor th degree of satisfaction and collecting information on new and emerging ict requirements w hile appreciating the inform ation on the proposed service delivery m odel for client divisions oios is of the opinion that this m odel will not achieve its desired objectives without som form of agreem ent on what services will be delivered this is considered critical f or ensuring 2 the interviewees used different term s such as service standard or service contract 7 that divisions and iss are clear on what is to be delivered and how success will be judged oios will therefore keep th is recom mendation open pending further clarification why service level agreem ent is not feasible b mem orandum of understanding mou on it services to third parties 30 eca has been providing internet connection services to other agencies in addis ababa in 2004 eca expanded the range of services to include such services as training and local area network adm inistra tion it was indicated at the com pound advisory com mittee on 3 decem ber 2003 that an mou would be drafted to cover the arrangem ents for delivery of such services at the tim of the audit mou had been finalised and there was obvious tim fram for its resolution due to technical problem s identified with undp access to its global enterprise resources planning system recommendation to ensure that the service standard and cost recovery arrangem ent are clarified with othe r agencies the chief of iss eca should establish concrete tim fram for finalising the mou on it service delivery with other agencies rec 10 31 eca explained that it understood the importance of signing an mou on it services with third parties and process is underway to sign one with the undp this practice will be replicated as appropriate with other agencies before the end of 2004 oios appreciates the inform ation on the progress in im plem enting the

security of ecas it services including the creation of new da ta centre within the eca premise financial plan associated with this will be submitted to ictc for its review and approval as appropriate oios thanks eca f or the inf ormation and will close the 8 recom mendation upon receipt of the approved im plem entation plan d managem ent inform ation and perform ance indicators 34 although survey on training and spot survey on helpdesk activities were recently introduced iss did not have any form mechanism s for assessing the quality of its services such as custom er surveys and statistical data on help desk calls which divisional m anagers whom oios interviewed felt would be helpful further regular inform ation was provided to the m anagem ent of user departm ents recommendation to enhance the perform ance of iss operations through strengthened m onitoring the chief of iss eca should establish through discussion with divisions and ictc perform ance indicators and reporting m

to measure the level of satisfaction of eca divisions on the quality of service being delivered by iss including the effectiveness of the information given to management to facilitate its decisions oios thanks eca for the explanation the recom mendation will be clos ed upon receipt of the approved plan of action from iss custom er support unit and tails of the perform ance indicators and monitoring m echanism management of outsourced activities overview 36 eca signed an mou and service delivery agreem ent sda with unicc in march 2003 for technical services an dditional sda was signed in septem ber 2003 for training and network support services under the contracts unicc would provide 36 staff for total cost of approxim ately us1 m illion per annum at the tim of the audit 6 professional staff and 21 general service staff were on board and 9 general service were yet to be recruited by unicc the unicc outsourcing was an effort to resolve the noncom pliance with the rules on the use of special service agreem ent ssa for it staff as observed in prev ious oios audit aa20020403 however several weaknesses were noted in the arrangem ents as discussed further below b noncom pliance with the outsourcing policy and guidelines and inappropriate approval 37 ga docum ent a53818 outsourcing practices as subm itted to the general assem bly pursuant to its resolution 52226 b of 27 april 1998 dated 4 february 1999 sets forth the basic policy and guidelines to be followed in considering the use of outsourcing paragraph 5 of the above doc ument states that the united nations outsourcing policy is designed to ensure that outsourcing decisions are based on transparent procedures proper analysis appropriate consultation between the departm ent or office responsible for the deliv ery of the activities or services and with due regard for the needs and interests of united nations staff m embers the policy emphasizes the need for clear criteria and rigor ous analysis of the costs benefits risks 9 and rewards to be obtained from outsourcing however oios noted evidence that eca had considered and docum ented adequately the four basic reasons for outsourcing outlined in a53818 b evidence to support that eca had ca rried out sufficient exam ination of other possible sourcing options c docum entary evidence of adequate and tim ely consultation with eca budget and finance section and procurem ent unit further ictc was not consulted due to its nonfunctioning this has created budgeting problem s d inappropriate contract approval th approval from the controller of was sought after the contracts had already been signed further while deputy executive secretary des eca signed the mou and first sda the second sda was signed and later revised by director of cgsd the second sda was not cleared either by the des or the controller 38 eca have expressed the opinion which oi does not accept that this was not outsourcing but insourcing3 c doubtful value for m oney 39 the estim ated annual cost for the unicc contract is approxim ately us1 million per annum which is approxim ately us800000 m ore per annum than the previous funding arrangem ent for ssa the di fference arises m ainly from staffing and overhead charges in the absence of conc rete cost benefit analysis eca could not demonstrate that the unicc contract provide d sufficient added value for the additional cost in addition although eca explained that it was result of an effort to m aintain the continuity and quality of services the staff em ployed under unicc contract were for the m ost part the sam staff em ployed under the old ssa arrangem ent d lack of analysis of the financial im plications of the contract 40 the annual contract costs have rise n from initial estim ation of us465000 to approxim ately us1 m illion there was evidence that this rise was either anticipated or adequately analysed for funding options consequently eca did not have available funds after the regular b udget allotm ent for 2004 contractual service was exhausted paying the first quarter invoice for 2004 unclear work arrangem ent between eca and icc staff 41 each of the five iss units com prised both eca and unicc staff and was headed by an eca staff m ember and uni cc team leader the unicc team leader reported to and was supervised by the uni cc project m anager and was not accountable to the eca unit head roles and responsibilitie s of eca staff had never been reviewed in light of the introduction of the unicc staff to determ ine whether there were opportunities for staff savings to help absorb the cost of the contract 3paragraph 9 of 53818 provi des that it d eserves em phasis th at as d efined in this rep ort the establishment and provi sion of com mon servi ces among t he vari ous uni ted nat ions funds program mes and agencies wo uld constitute fo rm of outsourcing 10 f inadequate m onitoring arrangem ent 42 the mou or sda did not provide eca with effective m onitoring and evaluation arrangem ent for the unicc servi ces there was agreem ent on how work plans would be form ulated approved and monitored in addition evaluation had been carried out as of the date of the udit including ensuring that costs paid were legitim ate and in accordance with mou term s and conditions recommendations the executive secretary eca should com mission review into the cost ef fectiveness of the arrangem ents with unicc including the assessm ent of funding options wh ich fulfils all the conditions of a53818 outsourcing practices th is should also include analysis of the im pact on job descriptions of existing eca staff rec 13 the executive secretary eca shoul d ensure that any contract with unicc or other service provide rs contains clauses relating to perform ance indicators and reporting m echanism s to determ ine satisfactory perform ance and pe nalties for nonperform ance rec 14 when renewing or renegotiation the unicc contract the director of cgsd eca should cons ult with bfs gss and hrss to ensure the procedures for outsourcing are followed as stated in a53818 including the exploration of other alternate service providers rec 15 43 eca explained that senior management group has been established under the office of the executive secretary to determine the funding options of subsequent uniccs contracts the other issues rais ed in this recommendation could also be addressed by this same group rec 13 cgsd will review the existing unicc contract and incorporate the required performance i ndicators during the renegotiation of the
