suburbs comments of terrorism investigating judge ref paris 7525 b october 25 paris points classified by political minister counselor josiah rosenblatt for reas ons 14 bd 1 s during conversation november 3 with terrorism investigating judge jeanfrancois ricard poloff asked for his analysis of recent violence in the suburbs ref ricard began by saying that one in the french government should be surprised by what has happened successive governments have tried and failed to integrate suburbs with high immigrant populations for the last twenty years said ricard the gof has known that the suburbs have become areas where respect for the state has dried up as result of this inattention the suburbs with high immigrant populations have lost their french identity and have built up an identity based on the cites similar to the projects french symbols of authority like the fireman and policeman are considered to be assassins and worthy of being targeted in addition gangs and radical islamic groups have an interest in keeping the cites free of gof influence to maintain their freedom of operation french intelligence can only do so much said ricard the areas need substantial gof presence ie police and gendarmerie 2 s ricard criticized many current french analyses as tired leftist critiques uttered by those who have understanding of the world of the cites he said they focused only on socioeconomic problems viewing the cites inhabitants as victims of precarious living situations young people who are unemployed and uneducated with poor prospects for the future when he had been an ordinary investigating judge in the northern suburb of bobigny ricard said people were relatively welloff they had cars and televisions and other material possessions other areas of france such as the north near belgium were much poorer said ricard the real problem was the gofs failure to be present in these areas inhabitants developed sense of being apart from french society and over time became proud of this the combination of setting oneself apart real andor imagined grievances against the gof state inattention and the interest of gangs and other groups including islamists to accentuate this divide has led to the current unrest said ricard 3 s if the unrest dies out very quickly this would be bad news said ricard it would mean that gangs and other groups in the cites exert powerful control over those currently burning cars and assaulting police these gangs have interest in triggering massive gof response because it would mean the longterm occupation of the cites if the unrest goes on for much more than week ricard said it would signify that the cites have become completely anarchic he speculated that one reason for the riots might have been sarkozys announcement in late october of an increased gof security presence in the cites including 17 companies of crs specialized crowd control police and 7 platoons of specialized gendarmes ref b note in strangely prescient interview with monde on october 25 about his plan to increase security in the cites sarkozy said that since the beginning of 2005 9000 police vehicles in france have had stones and other projectiles thrown at them every night sarkozy continued between 20 and 40 vehicles presumably not only police vehicles are burned or otherwise set on fire end note please visit paris classified website at
