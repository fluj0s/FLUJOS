6608c18 shspec76 study and intention the name of the source becomes identified with the product like kleenex the name dharma became identified with the product rather than with the source of the product so that today you cant find correct definition of dharma anywhere the word dharma does not have its original meaning preserved according to dictionaries it means 1 supreme law 2 the caste system of india 3 fate 4 love 5 the way in buddhism 2500 years ago gautama siddhartha said that the age of love was to begin in the west in 2500 years we started the age of love by making clears they talk about love lot we are longer in the age of reason thank god student should be aware of his intention in studying faulty source may be important in study student tends to assume that the source that he is studying from has some validity but this isnt necessarily the case in fact it frequently isnt the case difficult exams in universities dont correlate with excellence of graduates because for one thing study is an area that attracts suppressives like the areas of government or healing for instance in navigation the method used is what is tested in exams but the fact that you can navigate is all the sea cares about textbooks on navigation are often so complex that you have to know all about the subject before you can understand the bock many textbooks on the sea are full of nothing but disaster in great detail coast pilots are particularly full of warnings and disasters you could write any subject up to make it suppressive subject by making it seem too dangerous to practice on the other hand you can not give any cautions about the subject like leaving out the fact that wronglydone s and d that gets the wrong suppressive will make the pc sick because it restimulates and bypasses the right one the mind has been made too dangerous to study the writers of textbooks need knowledge of study materials as you study what do you intend to do with what you are studying for what purpose are you studying until you clarify that point you cant study intelligently the trouble with university education is that students study to pass exams not to use the materials in practice that is scholastic or academic study which isnt worth much this is why you get failures in practice after certification if someone studies just for examinations he doesnt have to know the exact meanings of the words thus we get very educated dumbbells some subjects are taught suppressively and are therefore ethics subjects where subject is very suppressive it can be studied for examination needing only to be memorized and spat back but it cant be applied because there was nothing there to be understood study gone wild leads to suicides cf french universities at exam time people who are very successful in life are frequently the dropouts who realize that university texts are not arranged to let you apply anything not single philosopher except mills stayed in school subject that is written up with slant or curve is relatively inapplicable too economics is good example economics hardly exists in its simple purity anymore similarly psychoanalysis has relation to freud anymore scientology is studied along the same lines that it was researched on it has curve to it if anything is inapplicable you will soon run into it
