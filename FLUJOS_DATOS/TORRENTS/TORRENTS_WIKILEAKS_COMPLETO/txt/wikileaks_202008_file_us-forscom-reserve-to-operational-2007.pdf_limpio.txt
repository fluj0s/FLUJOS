fouo limdis predecisional working papers forscom cgs ausa institute of land warfare panel transition the reserve component to an operational force questions for the panel from the udience with the panels response 1 q can we eliminate or at least signi ficantly reduce the use of derivative uic mobilizations that break units and rende r the remaining portions of the units incapable of meeting mission requirements under condition of reduced demand th diminished use of derivative uics may be possible the secretary of fenses 19 january 2007 memo total force utilization directed that rc units be deployed as cohesive units accordingly the army and the rc are taking measures to stabilize units by reducing the number of soldiers that are crossleveled between units for example the arng routinely fills personne l shortages within large formations brigade with units from other stat in order to preserve unit cohesion assigning soldiers to fill shortages wi th volunteers conti nues where necessary but this practice is utilized only with the consent of the soldiers tags and this is done only as last resort 2 q we train as team mob as team what is being done to prevent splitting up these teams we want the soldiers but we dont need the leadership type of deployments this phenomenon grows out the require ment to meet cocom requirements in theater forscom in collaboration wi th jfcom the joint force provider continues to work with those responsible for generating requests for forces to ensure compliance with modular design pr inciples also rc leadership makes every effort to mobilize units in accord ance with the 19 january 2007 secdef memo utilizing the total force for instance all arng brigades for 2008 and 2009 will deploy as brigades when personnel crossleveli ng is still required the goal is to prioritize using task organizati on of teams squads or platoons rather than individual fillers 3 q to what extent do the brac 05 deci sions affect the transition of the reserve component to an operational force brac is the law of the land and will be implemented by the army on the timeline specified it refers to the pr ocess the department of defense dod has used to reorganize its installation infrastru cture to more efficiently and effectively provide the army with the authority to dispose of excess facilities and installations while realigning and reconf iguring the remaining infrastructure to increase operational capacity warfighting cap ability and to take advantage of the efficiencies presented through consolidati on and joint activities brac realigns base facilities with the modular units of the future force sg 1fouo limdis predecisional working papers with regard to overall army transformation it is im portant to note that army brac recommendations are linked to the army future force initiatives brac realignments will provide the optimum in frastructure to stand up train support and rapidly deploy our brigade combat teams brac provides the primary mechanism and basis for locating our forces on installations that facilitate rapid deployment in support of global require ments against potential adversaries who threaten our security army brac execution will enable the tran sformation of the reserve component as well as the rebalancing of forces specifically brac directed closure of 211 arng and 175 usar facilities but directed total of 125 new joint facilities potentially available to station and trai n rc forces these measures directly enhance our ability to transition the rc to an operational force brac 05 was the catalyst for the army reserve to complete its full analysis of the structure that is needed to support the brac directives as well as fully support the manning equipping and training of its forces to meet arforgen requirements 4 q because of record demand and limited supply psyop has the fastest optempo in the rc attemp ts to stand up new batta lions have resulted in new slots but bodies to fill them with these givens proj ected to remain constant for the foreseeable future how will it be possible under the arforgen model to leave psyop units in the resett rain pool for four years the psyop specialty is one of several high demand low density skills that will continue to experience high optempo until the terror threat is defeated achieving the 14 arforgen employment goal for pysop units will remain challenging until either demand declines or pysop structure is increased in 2006 the army approved the redesign of usar psyop structure and an accompanying increase in end strength between fiscal years 2008 and 2011 the usar psyop force will increase from six to eight battalions and from 18 to 32 companies during the same period nd strength will increase by more than 1200 soldiers 5 q what tax incentives for employers ar being considered to assist employers as they support the guard and reserve recently there have been several bills introduced in congress that would provide tax incentives to employers of na tional guard and reserve members changes to the tax code are the purview of the department of treasury hence dod has referred the question of tax incent ives to treasury it is important to understand that some companies that em ploy rc soldiers have fewer than 50 workers therefore tax incentives may not necessarily be the optimal way to recognize employer support additiona lly osd is surveying employers to identify the key incentives needed to re tain employer support in december 2008 rand arroyo is expected to publish the fi ndings of study designed to identify similar critical incentives sg 2fouo limdis predecisional working papers 6 q could the military offer tricar for life to mobilized reserve forces tricare for life insurance see finition below provides coverage to all medicareeligible tricare beneficiarie s however healthcare for mobilized selected reserve members consists of variety of options including pre mobilization tricare benefit available 90 days prior to mobilization transition assistance management program tamp available for 180 days after separating from active duty on continge ncy order line of duty care tricare reserve select trs provides standard coverage for all selected reserve and their family members for monthly prem ium the continued healthcare benefit program chcbp provides coverage for monthly premium after selected reserve members separate from active du ty and department of veterans affairs provides eligible veterans hos pital care and outpatient care services the office of the surgeon general provid ed additional information on tricare for life and healthcare coverage for mobilized rc soldiers which can be found at the end of this document1 7 q are there any plans to increase ut ilization of the irr in order to reduce crossleveling and maintain unit integrity in the selective reserves as of 14 october 2007 there were 2813 individual ready reserve irr soldiers who were involuntarily mobili zed and an additional 498 who were voluntarily mobilized since 911 17 225 irr soldiers have been mobilized in support of contingency operations 7675 voluntarily and 9550 involuntarily these contingency mobilizations were necessitated by validated operational requirements and demonstrate the important role irr soldiers play in meeting manning requirements that said the irr was reduced in size by 13 over the last four years and its future role is under review but it is clear that opera tionalizing the rc which will enhance resourcing will produce fully eq uipped and fully trained units this has the effect of reducing the need for irr soldiers it is reasonable to expect however that irr soldiers w ill continue to be needed to fill indivi dual augmentee positions on joint manning docu ments and other staffs the arng plans to expand use of the inac tive army national guard ing the plan calls for soldiers wi th remaining mandatory service obligations to be transferred to the ing rather than th irr to serve the remainder of their obligation this will allow states to ma intain contact with these soldiers and allow them to deploy with unit if needed current department of defense policy provides that more than 6500 irr soldiers may be involuntarily mobiliz ed at any one time accordingly consideration will be given to request an increase to the current limit of 6500 when identified or anticipated requirements merit such request sg 3fouo limdis predecisional working papers 8 q what is the possibility of elim inating the agr force and making an ac to rc tour mandatory for promotion to ma jor and again to colonel this would not include tours at usarc and st louis tour must be in traditional rc unit the agr program provides unique benefits and addresses specific requirements of the rc these benefits and requirements are separate from the ongoing acrc tour program which provides an important vehicle for professional development to date ne ither the army reserve nor the army national guard has requested elimination of the active guard and reserve agr program likewise there has been formal request to make service in an acrc assignment prerequisite for promot ion to any grade any such request would obviously require thorough review of requirements to ensure readiness and to preclude potentially reducing promot ion opportunity for officers who due to fault of their own were able to complete an acrc tour the above notwithstanding the army emphasizes diverse experience in its assignment selection and promotion processes assi gnment to an acrc position remains an important vehicle in both developing l eaders and in building the total army team 9 q some soldiers have continued in tdy status while on multiyear orders why are soldiers on legitimate oneyear orders being forced to pcs without family the armys tcs policy is currently under review and as mra will issue guidance soon however we must highli ght that soldier is forced to pcs without his family rc soldiers in this category are given the option of pcs or tcs there are benefits associated with each of these options 10 q by institutionalizing recurring m obilizations across an rc career you institutionalize stress on civilian employ ment how do you anticipate partnering with civilian employers to preserve both parts of the civiliansoldiers livelihood army initiative 4 identified adapti ng incentives for rc soldiers their families and employers as essential task number thr ee one element of this task is to collaborate with employers in an effort to help minimize the impact of an absence by an rc citizensoldier this will of course require innovative approaches and partnering to realize our objectives one such initiative is seamless healthcare and an initiative for cost sharing the civilianemployer sponsored healthcare based on the ratio of utilization in acco rdance with the arforgen cycle an example of how we are communicating wit h employers is the usar employer outreach general officer steering committ ee the committee wi ll interact with the business community to ensure that army reserve soldiers remain competitive in both their military and civilia n careers as part of that effort the committee will be reaching out over the next year to chambers of commerce sg 4fouo limdis predecisional working papers professional associations and other bus iness organizations to explain the arforgen concept and the mission of operationalizing the rc also the initiative will require collabor ation with the national committee for employer support of the guard and r eserve esgr to identify employer incentives the esgr is dod agency that promotes public and private understanding of the national guard and r eserve in order to gain employer and community support esgr is compri sed of communitybased volunteer network of more than 4500 members that serve on 54 committees each state the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands that work to implement employer support programs wi thin their local communities 11 q please describe any incentives gislative attempts etc in order to encourage the employer sector to allow the continuum of service both in wartime and peacetime what does th future hold and how can ausa help in december 2008 rand arroyo center will publish the findings of study designed to identify ways to incentivize employers the study is focusing on three separate areas 1 what can the ar my do to motivate individuals to join or stay in the arng and usar 2 what in centives can the army provide that will motvate family members to support their soldiers continued service in the arng and usar given the demand for more time away from home for training and mobilization 3 what incentives will motivate small 50 or less employees medium 51 to 500 employees and large over 500 employees businesses to hire retain and promote rc soldiers retention is readiness issue incentivi zing families and employers is essential to permitting rc soldiers adequate time to train and mobilize as part of an operational force the near term objectiv is to determine which incentives might best serve the army in achieving it s readinessmanning goals the long term objective is to determine the programming costs and legislative actions necessary to enable the incentives there are two legislative proposals before the house and senate which will provide both tax incentives and tax credits to employers of reserve component members other incentives are being considered which would reward employer s for hiring and supporting members of the reserve 12 q has the rc leadership consider ed lifting or modifying the mandatory retirement date mrd policy what abou t an age 55 retirement what hurdles exist to adjust the retireme nt benefits to m ake retirements available at 20 years of service since it is prorated title 10 us code chapter 1223 retired pay for nonregular service sections 12731 32 and 39 specifically set the conditions for age and compensation criteria and exec ution this chapter has been in effect since 2 sg 5fouo limdis predecisional working papers january 2006 the 110th congress did not propose to modify the current language in the ndaa 08 from the department of defense persp ective those who c ould champion dod wide solution to rc retirement and comp ensation legislation would be the under secretary of defense for personnel and r eadiness and the office of the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs the military departments could also influence this effort through their respective personnel agencies 2 13 q we have heard about the s upporting to supported relationship particularly regarding premob and postm ob with forscom first army and the rc what does it mean exactly this arrangement describes the suppor t relationships betw een the operational army the institutional army and the in dustrial army the latter are in supported relationship to the operationa l army this support relationship also applies between first army and the reserve component rc prior to mobilization first army is supporting rc conducting premobilization training upon mobilization first army becom the supported organization and the rc becomes the supporting organization this relationship clarifies responsibilities and contributes to efficient and effective training 14 q assuming the current optempo for the next 5 10 years what are the optimal sizes for the ac usar and arng the army is increasing the size of l three components by the end of fy10 we will increase the size of the active com ponent ac from 482k soldiers to 547k and increase the size of the arng from 347k to 358k for the usar end strength will grow by only 1k from 205k to 206k but is dramatically reorganizing to better structure itself to meet the 21st century security requirements even with this growth the size of our ac without significant operational contributions by the rc wi ll be unable to meet sustained global demands however the rmy initiative to transition the rc to an operational force will enable us to meet those dema nds if we do not do this we would have to significantly increase the size of the ac by an order of magnitude 15 q gen campbell led with this theme we are engaged in persistent conflict that is generational in nature as the c ontext for the panel di scussion to what degree in his estimate does our elect ed leadership understand this and does the great american public understand this and will there be the political and public will to support decade or mo re of protracted conflict we believe the elected leadership unde rstands that we are in long struggle against terrorism there are different approaches among the elected leadership about how we respond to this threat but by their words and actions we can clearly see they understand the generational nature of the fight similarly the sg 6fouo limdis predecisional working papers american public understands we are in protracted conflict the enemy has demonstrated the continuing intent and d esire to attack us therefore the army remains prepared to defend against this determined undeterred enemy 16 q to relieve pressure on rc forces what is the long term goal are rc forces trying to keep to 1 in 5 arforgen cycle note that 1 in 5 deployment equates to ratio of 14 until global demand lessens combat ant commander requirements will require number of selected rc units to be remobilized sooner than the arforgen 14 standard the secretary of defense s 19 january 2007 memo total force utilization directed that rc units be ployed as cohesive units and established one year limit to mobilizations acco rdingly the army is taking measures to stabilize units by reducing the number of so ldiers that are crossleveled between units effective fy11 the arng intends to reset units into the 14 model 17 q if due to the nature of coin operations there is higher demand for civil affairs combat support and combat servi ce support units is there any plan to move some of this structure back to the regular army the army has formal process to routinely reassess force structure called the total army analysis taa the ar my has already rebalanced number of high demand low density skills between the ac and rc and may do more based upon taa the taa process is used by hqda to determine organizational authorizations taa develops the total re quirements and then the authorizations defining the force structure the army mu st build raise provision sustain maintain train and resource to meet osd army guidance combatant commanders requirements and force stru cture initiatives in accordance with army timelines these units w ill undergo the taa process 18 q stability and counterinsurgency operations are key in the contemporary environment as are participation in prts and mitts are there aspects of these requirements where you see pa rticular performance strengths and challenges for the guard and reserves there is question that the citizensoldier brings multitude of civilian skill sets that have tremendous applicability to the coin fight the army has demonstrated remarkable dexterity ligning units and indi viduals with these valued skills against requirements the army will continue to source prts and mitts with those who have these unique sk ills eg nursing law enforcement construction attorneys and public ser vice professionals the arng continues to function as key member of the prov incial reconstruction teams prts in order to help establish more secure reconstruction program beyond large cities these teams are established in various provinces and reflect shift in strategy to communitybased civil projects sg 7fouo limdis predecisional working papers 19 q when forces draw down in iraq there is an assumption that budgets will be reduced what specifically is th army doing to mitigate these fiscal reductions with the need to transition to an operat ional reserve that will establish longterm policy one assumption is that eventually th supplemental funding stream will be reduced commensurate with the reduction of operations in theater with respect to the initiative 4 the army seeks to progr am most associated costs into the base budget through the ppbes process and the po m doing so will avoid budget decrease if war supplementals stop sp ecifically however initiative 4 has identified costs both for the fy 08 and 09 supplemental and the pom fy 1015 20 q recently 300 million required for training and equipping soldiers and units who will respond to cbrne w as cut from the fy08 budget or 08 supplemental our army is not prepared to respond effectively to terrorist cbrne attack on the homeland whats the plan and will it affect arforgen plans the fy 08 national defense authoriz ation act is under consideration by the congress right now it would be inappr opriate to speculate on the outcome of congress decisions regarding next year s funding arforgen is flexible process that synchronizes resources to uni ts in order to meet combatant commander requirements aforgen is sufficiently adaptive to meet these requirements 21 q how can you have an operati onal reserve when both the army national guard and army reserve remain critically short of captains like the army reserve and the army na tional guard the active army is also short captains consequently many positi ons traditionally filled by captains are being filled by lieutenants and these ung officers continue to do tremendous job efforts to reduce these shortages include increased accessions from all commissioning sources reserve officer trai ning corps united states military academy officer candidate school intr aservice transfers through the blueto green program diverse menu of retention incentives for our captains increased promotion rates and earlier promot ion pinon points in the long term these initiatives could also result in so officers transferring to the reserve component the army will continue to pursue policies and dditional legislative authorities that help allevi ate the shortage of captains much like ensuring our reserve components are fully trained and equipped resolving personnel readiness is not shortterm endeavor it is complex issue that requires deliberate and thorough approach and is one to which we will remain committed 22 q how can retired soldiers and spouses support the message and the mission of the operational reserve component sg 8fouo limdis predecisional working papers first retired soldiers and their spouses must know and understand the army story the csas four imperatives and how this initiative is nested within the csas vision then they must tell the story to diverse audiences social groups churches civic groups only then wi ll the army begin to focus our existing support educate those who have limited contact with our nations military and gain the consensus needed to achieve this imperative 23 q what plans are in place to secure the proposals listed by the panel in the event of change in administration the initiative is in response to the demand and stress placed on the army today for that reason it is an issue of national security that transcends party branch of government and special inter est it is question that must be addressed regardless of administration in office congress has the constitutional responsibility to raise and support the army and this initiative ultimately is accountable to that body 24 q any comment on the rumor that the commission on the guard and reserve will recommend merger of the guard and reserve any questions regarding such rumor should be directed to the commission there are fundamental differences in th roles and mission of the guard and reserve and each component provides uni strengths and capabilities that ensure our nations citizens c ontinued safety and security 25 q the 39th bct cararng will conduct thr ee months of premob training on title 32 status at home st ation prior to reporting to the mob station the secdef agreed that title 32 mobilizat ion does not count against the 12 month mob policy and that he w ould evaluate this training model for use with the rc bcts what are the thoughts of the darng and cg first army about the use of this model is this viable model the 39th bct has requested 90 days of premob training to tigate the effects of late notice and shorten prep time iaw the arforgen resettrainingvalidation cycle the premob training model requ ested by the 39th bct should not by any means be considered the standard for l mobilizing units the overarching reason for this strategy is to ensure this bct receives additional time and resources to accomplish the tasks of resettrain valida in accordance with the arforgen model the three months of premob training on title 32 status at home station prior to reporting to the mob station was looked at as viable bridging strategy in resource and time constrained environmen t this course of action will enable actions and set conditions necessary to meet postmobilization training requirements and deployment timelines sg 9fouo limdis predecisional working papers 26 q will the slides be posted on the web site yes 1 the following additional information was provided by office of
