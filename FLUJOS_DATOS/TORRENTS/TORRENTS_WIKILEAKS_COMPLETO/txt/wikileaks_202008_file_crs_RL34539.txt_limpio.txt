in the 21st century global competition and rapid advances in science and technology will challenge the scientific and technical proficiency of the us workforce the 110th congress is currently discussing policy actions that could enhance the nations science and technology st workforce deemed by some as essential to both meet us workforce demands as well as to generate the new ideas that lead to improved and new industries that create jobs as in the past there are those who question whether the quality of science technology engineering and mathematics stem education received by all americans at the precollege level is of sufficient quality that workers are available to satisfy current and future workforce needs in addition the number of americans pursuing postsecondary stem degrees is considered to be low relative to students in countries considered to be us competitors many perspectives exist however on the supply and demand of scientists and engineers some question the fundamental premise that any action is necessary at all regarding us competitiveness they question whether or not the st workforce and stem education are problems at all the 110th congress passed the america competes act pl 11069 to address concerns regarding the st workforce and stem education and is currently debating funding for the programs authorized within it additional discussions in the 110th congress have focused on three issues demographic trends and the future st talent pool the current st workforce and changing workforce needs and the influence of foreign st students and workers on the us st workforce in response to the issue of demographic trends and the future st talent pool some policymakers propose taking actions to increase the number of americans interested in the st workforce these policies are motivated by demographic trends that indicate the pool of future workers will be far more diverse than the current stem workforce proposed policies would take actions to enhance the quality of stem education these americans receive so they are able to consider st careers and to recruit them into the st workforce on the issue of the current st workforce and changing workforce needs the goal of proposed policies is to reinvigorate and retrain americans currently trained in science and engineering who voluntarily or involuntarily are longer part of the current stem workforce the challenge in this situation is that science and engineering are constantly changing both in terms of workforce needs as well as the skills the stem workforce needs to obtain to be marketable relative to demand another policy before the 110th congress is increasing the ability of the united states to draw upon foreign talent to meet the nations st workforce needs these discussions focus on immigration policy primarily increasing the ability of foreign stem students currently in us universities to more easily obtain permanent admission and increasing the number of temporary worker visas available so more talent from abroad can be recruited to the united states contents background 1 status of the us science and technology st workforce 4 what are the historical

in science and technology will challenge the scientific and technical proficiency of the us workforce this report provides an overview of the status of the us science and technology st workforce and identifies some of the issues and options that are currently being discussed in congress the report concludes with summary of some pertinent activities in the 110th congress background the ability of the united states to be competitive in the global economy is viewed by many experts as major factor influencing the ability of the united states to maintain its economic growth and standard of living scientific and technological advances can further economic growth because they contribute to the creation of new goods services jobs and capital or increase productivity1 from company employee and possibly community perspective competitiveness may be defined as the ability of firm to compete for market share against imports from abroad or to compete with foreign firms in overseas export markets2 the 110th congress passed the america competes act pl 11069 to respond to some of these concerns3 congress is discussing additional actions that it may take in response to concerns about the st workforce interest in the competitiveness issue began following world war ii and perhaps reached its peak in the 1970s when some experts became concerned that japan europe and newly industrialized countries were becoming major competitors with the united states the united states had lost market share in autos cameras stereos television sets steel machine tools and microelectronics4 now that the

and negative on the economic futures of american companies workers and families increasing integration with the world economy can make the united states more productive leading to increases in living standards and real disposable incomes however rising trade with lowwage developing countries increases workers concerns about job loss lower wages and benefits as american companies take actions to

1 who should be included in the st workforce determining the st workforce is challenging task at its core are scientists and engineers but workforce estimates can vary based on whether or not the estimate includes those in defined occupations in related occupations eg precollege teachers managers technicians who use knowledge eg patent lawyers doctors health professionals or who have at least one degree in or an serelated fieldsa using these varying definitions st workforce estimates are developed by the national science foundation nsfnational science board nsb the bureau of labor statistics bls and the us census bureau each has different definitions of who should be included in the st workforce and estimates can also vary depending on the data used most estimates focus only on the workforce as opposed to the entire st workforce but estimates vary as well nsb indicates that depending on the definition and perspective used the size of the workforce varied between approximately 50 million and 214 million individuals in 2006 approximately 415 of all employed civilians in the united states 1444 millionb for example one nsf analysis finds that in 2006 50 million of the 189 million employed scientists and engineers worked in occupations 52 million worked in serelated occupations and 87 million worked in nonserelated occupationsc nsb suggests that the most relevant workforce estimate may be 170 million which in 2006 was the number of individuals who had at least one degree in an field or 214 million which includes both these individuals plus those with degree in an related field such as health or technology as it reflects the many ways science and technical knowledge is used in the united statesa sources national science board science and

americans with stem degrees is essential to providing an st workforce so that the united states is competitive8 others question whether or not us competitiveness the st workforce and stem education

current workforce projections and why if the demand is so high salaries for those in stem occupations are not higher10 other analysts suggest that the quality and number of scientists and engineers in china and india the primary nations that are the focus of todays competitiveness concerns are exaggerated11 another argument focuses on the possible unintended sideeffects of implementation for example will the act result in an oversupply of scientists and engineers these critics propose that policy actions focus on improving the information employers and universities supply to students so they can make better choices and enhancing the salary and career paths for existing scientific and technical staff12 status of the us science and technology st workforce this section describes the

shortage of technical professionalsresearch technology management pp 1013 march 1 2008 crs5 box 2 challenges in developing conclusions from st workforce data developing conclusions from st employment data can be challenging as analysis of data from different sources at different times often presents differing pictures of the workforce related factor is that while some data represent the supply of individuals seeking employment other data provide information on the demand for those individuals an example of demand data is january 2008 analysis of job openings this analysis found that major us technology companies averaged more than 470 usbased job openings for skilled positions while defense companies averaged 1265 eacha supply data just few months later in may 2008 however may lead some to different conclusion in this case bls indicated that overall unemployment is 55 compared with 45 in may 2007b the degree to which st employment is affected is unknown at this point and may not be known for 12 years leading to uncertainties in developing conclusion regarding the status of the st workforce even with longterm data such as that in figure 1 and figure 2 fieldspecific and degreespecific differences can offer very different picture of the status of the us st workforce while demand for those in one field can be high for others it can be low when broad industry or company future projection data are presented it is important to understand the data for example it is important to understand whether projected openings are worldwide or us data the degree of specialization involved and whether or not the projection is based on obtaining particular government or other contract this last point may be particularly important if multiple companies in given industry are all hoping to be successful in winning particular contract as the jobs projected may be duplicative bls conducted an analysis of the accuracy of its occupational projections and found employment change was projected correctly for approximately 70 of the occupations evaluated it found that bls projections tended to be conservative with projected employment for the largest number of occupations estimated at the average growth rate while in reality most occupations either grew faster or declined occupations bls projected for the most rapid employment growth had greater increases than bls expected and those expected to decline had greater decreases than expected bls concluded that good occupational projections rely on good industry projectionsc some experts worry that lack of understanding of the volatility of some st occupations and their dependence on the economy and government policy actions can lead policymakers to make false promises encouraging students to undertake long term stem education for jobs that may not be there when they graduate nsb acknowledges that predicting the demand for scientists and engineers is difficult unanticipated corporate and governments

occupations plus technicians and programmers grew at 68 average annual rate between 19502000 according to nsb13 from 1950 to 2000 the number of st employees increased from approximately 02 million in 1950 to 55 million in 2000 nsbs analysis found that workforce demand varied greatly by occupation with major changes both positive and negative within occupations for example economic downturns in

engineers out of population of 226 million scientists and engineers in the united states in 200616 the nsf data indicate that the overall unemployment rate for scientists and engineers at all degree levels in the united states dropped from 32 in 2003 to 25 in 2006 with those holding doctorate and professional degree at the lowest unemployment rate of 16 the majority of scientists and engineers according to these nsf data work in the businessindustry sector 694 followed by educational institutions 188 and government 118 in terms of demographics the us 2006 workforce included 548 men and 452 women17 looking at this same population an analysis of raceethnicity finds that 770 of this workforce was white 100 asian 56 black 53 hispanic any race with american indianalaska native native hawaiian and multiple race each at 1 or less these nsf data indicate that 845 of the us 2006 workforce were native us citizens 105 naturalized us citizens 37 nonus citizen permanent residents and 13 nonus citizen temporary residents what is the projected future st workforce in terms of future demand bls projects professional and related occupations employment will provide more jobs 50 million

whether or not the united states is educating enough americans with sufficient stem education today to meet this projected future demand science and engineering occupations have been primarily the domain of white males as discussed earlier 77 of the 2006 workforce is white within this population 56 are male20 as illustrated in figure 4 however these demographics are changing the number of us citizen white males receiving doctoral degrees declined from 19852005 while the number of us citizen white females and minorities increased these demographic groups are looked upon by some as possible

for congress discussions among policymakers in the 110th congress have focused on three issues demographic trends and the future st talent pool the current st workforce and changing workforce needs and the influence of foreign st students and workers on the us st workforce25 each of these issues is discussed in more depth below demographic trends and the future st talent pool few in the science and engineering community argue about the effect of national demographics on the future science and engineering workforce with the beginning of the 21st century larger proportion of the us population will be composed of minorities blacks hispanics and native americans with the fastest growing minority group being hispanics for example the population of hispanic or latino origin is projected to steadily increase as percentage of the total us population through 2050 rising from 126 in 2000 to 244 in 205026 as result many are looking toward these groups currently underrepresented in the st workforce as source of future us st talent as group minorities traditionally have been underrepresented in the science and engineering disciplines compared to their fraction of the total population27

220 continued crs11 generally minorities take fewer highlevel science and mathematics courses in high school earn fewer undergraduate and graduate degrees in science and engineering and are less likely to be employed in science and engineering positions than white males28 while minorities have increased their share of degrees awarded in the sciences poor preparation in science and mathematics is said to be major factor limiting the appeal of science and engineering to even larger numbers of these groups large number of blacks hispanics and native americans lack access to many of the more rigorous college preparatory courses29 in addition to recruitment retention of minorities in the science and engineering educational pipeline once recruited also is of concern the attrition rates for blacks hispanics and native americans are higher than for whites or asians in the case of women while enrollment in rigorous course work and advanced placement classes in high school has increased for women there is substantial attrition along the educational pathway according to national academy of sciences study fewer high school girls intend to major in science and engineering fields more alter their intentions to major in science and engineering between high school and college and fewer women science and engineering graduates continue on to graduate school30 as result some believe that programs are needed to strengthen the course taking and persistence of women all along the educational pipeline as there is substantial attrition of both men and women at all stages of science and

the current st workforce are the implications of constantly changing employment market an aging workforce and multinational and us firm employment outside the united states as science and engineering fields evolve so do the skills needed by the st workforce some policies are in place and others are recommended to encourage support of workers to pursue and employers to provide continuing education to help the st workforce to maintain its employment and for employers to have technicallyable workforce available in high need areas some us workers believe that if corporations were willing to train the st workforce whose skills are outofdate with the new skills these corporations need the corporations would not need to seek foreign workers either by bringing them into the united states or employing them abroad another issue is the aging workforce key issue for government university and industry many employers worry that an insufficient number of american st students are in the pipeline to replace those who retire this issue is often cited when us citizenship is required for employment particularly in the defense national security and similar fields33 on the other hand the overall st workforce may be sufficient if degree production retirement patterns or immigration do not change though the workforce will be older and the growth rate in such positions may slow significantly some worry however that this older workforce may not be as creative and may reduce the opportunities for junior researchers to become independent34 some policies being discussed in this area include recruiting and supporting more americans to pursue st workforce careers and increasing the number of federally sponsored earlycareer grants focused on younger researchers35 31 continued 2007 pp 5960

foreign students in those programs according to nsf while the firsttime fulltime science and engineering graduate enrollment of foreign students in science and engineering fields increased by 16 from 2005 to 2006 us citizen and permanent resident enrollment increased by slightly more than138 in addition to the number of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs significant number of nonus citizens with phd degrees are employed by universities and industry there are divergent views in the us scientific and academic community about the effects of significant foreign presence in graduate science and engineering programs39 some argue that us universities benefit from large foreign citizen enrollment by helping to meet the needs of the university and for those students who remain in the united states the nations economy40 others argue that the influx of foreign national scientists and engineers has resulted in depressed job opportunities lowered wages and declining working conditions for american scientists and engineers while many businesses especially hightech companies have downsized the federal government annually issued thousands of h1b41 visas to

that an overreliance on h1b visa workers to fill hightech positions has weakened opportunities for the us workforce42 there are those us workers who also argue that number of the available positions are being filled by lessexpensive foreign labor43 those critical of the influx of immigrant scientists have advocated placing restrictions on the hiring of foreign skilled employees in addition to enforcing the existing laws designed to protect workers those in support of the h1b program maintain that there is clear evidence that foreign workers displace us workers in comparable positions and that it is necessary to hire foreign workers to fill needed positions even during periods of slow economic growth44 activities in the 110th congress in response to the issues outlined above policy discussions during the 110th congress have focused on three possible actions 1 increasing the talent pool particularly by diversifying the st workforce 2 supporting the current st workforce and 3
