and 302b allocations the maximum budget authority for annua l appropriations including dhs are determined through twostage congressiona l budget process in the first stage congress sets overall spending totals in the annual c oncurrent resolution on the budget subsequently these amounts are llocated among the various appropriations committees usually through the statement of managers for the conference report on the budget resolu tion these amounts are known as the 302a allocations they include discretionary totals available to the house and senate committees on appropriations for enactment in annua l appropriations bills through the subcommittees responsible for the developmen t of the bills in the second stage of the process the appropriations committees allocate the 302a discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the appropriations bills these amounts are known as the 302b allocations these allo cations must add up to more than the 302a discretionary allocati on and form the basis for enforcing budget discipline since any bill reported with total above th ceiling is subject to point of order 302b allocations may be adju sted during the year as the

outlays1 federal government spending involves multistep process that begins with the enactment of budget authority by cong ress in an appropriations act federal agencies then obligate funds from the acted budget authority to pay for their activities finally payments are made to liquidate those obligations the actual payment amounts are reflected in the budget as outlays budget authority is established throug h appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts that are available for federal agencies to spend the antideficiency act2 prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority that was acted by congress budget authority may be indefinite however when congress enact s language providing such sums as may be necessary to complete project or pur pose budget authority may be available on oneyear multiyear or noyear basis oneyear budget authority is only available for obligation during specific fis cal year any unobligated funds at the end of that year are longer available for spending multiyear budget authority specifies range of time during which funds can be obligated for spending noyear budget authority is available for obliga tion for an indefinite period of time obligations are incurred when federal agencies employ personnel enter into contracts receive services nd engage in similar transactions in given fiscal year outlays are the funds that are actua lly spent during the fiscal year3 because multi year and noyear budget authorities may be obligated over number of years outlays do not always match the budget authority enacted in given year additionally budget authority may be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in future fiscal year especially with certain contractshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32863crs5 4 prepared with assistance from bill heniff jr analyst in american national government 5 pl 101508 title x iii 6 prepared with assistance from bill heniff jr analyst in american national governmentin sum budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments or outlays to be made from the treasury discretionary agencies and programs nd appropriated entitle ment programs are funded each year in appropriations acts discretionary and mandatory spending4 gross budget authority or the total funds available for spending by federal agency may be composed of discretiona ry and mandatory spending of the 41 billion gross budget authority requested for dhs in fy2006 83 is composed of discretionary spending and 17 is composed of mandatory spending discretionary spending is not mandated by existing law and is thus appropriated yearly by congress throug h appropriations acts the budget enforcement act5 of 1990 defines discretionary ppropriations as budget aut hority provided in annual appropriation acts and the ou tlays derived from that authority but it excludes appropriations for entitlements mandatory spending also known as direct spending consists of budget author ity and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts and is typically not appropriated each year however some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year and are included in the appropriations acts within dhs the coast guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated ma ndatory spending offsetting collections6 offsetting funds are collected by th federal government either from government accounts or the public as part of businesstype transaction such as offsets to outlays or collection of fee these funds are not counted as revenue instead they are counted as negative outlays dhs net discretionary budget authority or the total funds that are appr opriated by congress each year is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending some collections offset portion of an agencys discretionary budget authority some of these fees offset spending at the account level and are subtracted from the appropriations committee tables directly below the program they offset an example of this is the federal protective service which is immediately offset in the appropriations tables by an intergovernmental transfer from the general services administration other discretionary fees offs et spending at the agency level and are thus subtracted from the discre tionary budget authority of the agency to arrive at the actual appropriated level an example of this is the immigration inspection fee which is collected at ports of entry by cb p personnel and is used to offset both the cbp and ice appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32863crs6 other collections offset an agencys mandatory spending they are typically entitlement programs under which individuals businesses or units of government that meet the requirements or qualifications established by law are entitled to receive certain payments if they establish ligibility the dhs budget features two mandatory entitlement programs the secret service and coast guard retired pay accounts pensions some entitlements ar funded by permanent appropriations others by annual appr opriations the secret service retirement pay is permanent appropriation and as such is not annually appropriated while the coast guard retirement pay is annually ppropriated in addition to these entitlements the dhs budget contains offsetting trust and public enterprise funds these funds are not appropriated by congress they are ava ilable for obligation and included in the presidents budget

more than fy2005 enacted levels76 there are several key differences between hr 2360 and the presidents reque st regarding aviation security funding for private screening cont racts at airports was set at 65 million less than the requested level the house committee on appropriations found that the full request was not justified because of lack of interest in the federal screening optout program due to lingering concerns over airport liability and other aspects of the program the committee also found lack of justification for the proposed increases in aviation regulation and law enforcement recommending that the tsa trim staffing levels in this program element and the house initially agreed to funding level 98 million below the presidents request similarly the committee expressed concerns over staffing levels in ai rport management informati on technology and support and the house initially agreed to fund this co mponent of the tsa budget at level 1082 million below the presidents request the committee also did not agree with the presidents request for increased funding for the federal flight deck officer program citing high unobligated balances as evidence that this program does not need additional funds the house agreed to 25 million for this program the same as what was appropria ted in fy2004 and fy2005 in keeping with previous year trends th house initially agreed to larger funding amounts for air cargo security providing 60 million 20 million more than the presidents request this included an dditional 10 million to hire 100 new air cargo inspectors plus increased funding for trav for inspectors enhancements to the knownshipper database and security threat assessm ents additionally the house passed two general provisions calling for more thorough

language contained specific cap on the number of screeners but like the house bill sought to increase funding for screening technologies in move to rapidly shif t away from workforceintensive use of

housepassed amount in contrast to the fiscal concerns expressed by the house committee senate re port language noted that increased funding for information technology is imperative fo r maintaining realtime intelligence and operational effectiveness and efficiency the senate provision of 50 million for air cargo security fell directly between the budget request of 40 million and the housepassed

data security and redress for aggrieved individuals are adequately addressed similar provisions were enacted in appropriati ons legislation for fy2004 and fy2005 the provision in the fy2006 act also prevents the tsa from using commercial data in the system while commercial data is seen as possible means for authenticating passenger identities some in congress have raised concerns over tsas prior

the house and senate had agreed to this amount which is 12 million less than fy2005 enacted levels but 4 million above the presidents request issues for congress the presidents proposal to increase airline passenger security fees has been contentious issu that failed to garner sufficient support in either the house or the senate and met with considerable criticism during the appropriations debate financially strapped airlines still recovering from the economic impact of the 911 attacks and now facing rising fuel costs argued that they would likely have to absorb some of the proposed fee increases by reducing ticket prices77 some members of congress also voiced concern that the proposed fee increase could cut into the revenues of the airlines and could have greater impact on rural airline customers who w ould pay proportionately more in per segment fees because fewer direct flights are available to these customers78 the administration on the other hand argued th at increased fees could help reduce funding deficit by generatin g additional revenue to offs et expenditures for aviation security or could free up general tax re venues for spending on broader homeland security needs the administration maintained that increasing fees to offset costs is in line with longstanding transportation infrastructure policy to fund these services largely through user fees as well as its ssessment of the original intent of these passenger security fees blished under atsa pl 1077179 however some opponents of aviation security f ees contend that aviation s ecurity particularly since september 11 2001 is vital to national security nd therefore like defense spending is the responsibility of all taxpayers the house committee on appropriations noted that amending the statutory fee

prohibiting an increase in airline ticket taxes for aviation security was agreed to by large majority in the house despite opposition by aviation subcommittee chairman john mica while the senate also did not recommend any passenger fee increases language in srept 10983 directed the tsa to use its available authority to collect about 448 million from aviation security infrastructure fees paid directly by the airlines this is the amount determined by gao aud it that tsa should be collecting annually however the tsa has been collecting only about 318 million in these fees despite assuming that collections would total 750 million for fy2005 thus creating projected shortfall of more than 400 million another key issue for the tsa during the fy2006 appropriations process was the proposed creation of sco the propos ed transfer of programs related to credentialing and vetting of passengers and transportation workers raised several issues regarding coordination of effort be tween the tsa and the proposed sco the administration offered few details regarding how the proposed sco would interface with the tsa on several highprofile programs such as secure flight and the twic program citing concerns over disruptin g work on these key programs pl 10990 implements different approach that inte grates these various programs but keeps them within the tsa under new office of transportation vetting and credentialing the act establishes fy2006 funding level of 75 million for the newly created office of transportati on vetting and credentialing an amount consistent with the senatepassed bill but 9 million less than the housepassed amount in add ition to these sums it is anticipated that the office will handle an additional 180 million in credentialing accounts th at are expected to be fully offset by user fees another lingering issue that did not receive much attention during the appropriations process is th coordination between tsa and st in light of the transfer of the tsas research and deve lopment activities to the st directorate one particular oversight issue is how aviation security research needs will be prioritized given that st is more broadly focused on all homeland security research and development activities there may be some concern that aviation security projects could take back seat to other highprofile initiatives such as chemical biological radiological and nuclear weapons countermeasur that have been the primary focus of st to date also while consolidating resear ch and development on explosives and chemical weapons det ection the primary focus of aviation securityrelated research nd development may help verage resources for other dhs components these project s could potentially lose some of the aviation security specific focus that they recei ved while under the auspices of the tsa consequently congress may focus on what coordination and interaction between tsa and st will be established to ensure that aviation security research and development needs are adequately addressed80 house report language specifies that the st directorate is to carry out air cargo research and development pilot programs initiated by the tsa

operations background and issues for congress by ronald orourke and crs report rl31733 port and maritime security background and issues for congress by john frittelli high unobligated balances give

standards for emerging new technologies to screen carg noting past deployment delays occurred because such coordination was lacking appropriations to the tsa for surface transportation modes raise the issue of determining tsas role and in broader context the fe deral governments role in the security of the nonaviation modes of transportation while atsa made tsa responsible for the security of all modes of transportation it did not direct the tsa to take specific actions to address security needs in m odes other than aviation one view is that the federal government nd tsa in particular should assume more dominant or at least more prominent role in the security of surface modes proponents of this view hold that the fe deral treasury should fund most of the security needs of surface modes another view is that the federal role in securing surface modes should reflect or parallel its existing role in financing the infrastructure or operations of surface modes this view holds that federal funding for the security needs of surface modes shoul d be in partnership with state and local governments or the private sector for instance because freight railways are predominantly privately owned and finance d some believe that the freight railroad companies should pay for their security need s likewise in the case of mass transit in which state and local governments have primary responsibility for infrastructure financing and operations some believe the federal govern ments role in securing mass transit should be in partnership with state and local governments rather than having dominant role as it does in aviation united states coast guard82 the coast guard is the lead federal agency for the maritime component of homeland security as such it is the lead agency

insurance industry climatic study or ganizations and dhs and concluded that electoral motivations had dramatic eff ect on which states were granted disaster declarations 130 more specifically and less drama tically the author reports in published summary of his work the best predictor of disaster declaration bar none is actual need the question arises in these marginal cases when its unclear whether to give or not131 on the other hand study issued by gao also considered the effects of politics on disaster declarations but arrived at different conclusion after examining presidential declaration data from the perspective of the party affiliation of governors and members of st ate congressional delegations the authors concluded that there were indications that party affiliation affected white house major disaster declaration decisions132 in considering gubernatorial request for disaster relief the president evaluates number of factors including the cau of the catastrophe damages needs certification by state officials that state and local governments will comply with cost sharing and other requirements and offici requests for assistance neither the stafford act nor implementing regulations provide for congressional role in the declaration process133 the level of expenditures from the drf fluctuates from year to year primarily as consequence of three factors the num ber of disaster declarations issued the extent of destruction caused by the disast ers and the amount of uninsured losses that result from declared disaster s discussions in congre ss on the escalating disaster relief costs move between two policy concer ns the need to control federal costs particularly at time of significant deficits and the need of constituents who have suffered

the annual budget resolution some believe this pr actice of budgeting for emergencies might lead to unnecessary or wasteful spending in addition some believe that the existing budgetary treatment of emergency spending provides an incentive to designate nonemergenc spending as an emergency requirement in order to circ umvent the existing budgetary constraints to address these concerns some have proposed the following two reforms establishmen t of reserve fund or criteria for the designation of an emergency as follows establish reserve fund for disast er assistance proponents of reserve fund for disaster assistan ce argue that the average annual amount of overall emergency spe nding can be projected based on past experience even though specific emergencies cannot be predicted therefore they furthe r argue that an expected amount of disaster assistance spending should be incorporated into the overall amount of spending in the presidents budget and the budget resolution proponents of such re serve fund generally suggest that an historical average of actual disaster assistance spending would provide sufficient funds to meet sp ecific emergencies as they arise legislation pending before congre ss s 24 would establish such fund in the treasury establish criteria for emergency sp ending proponents of emergency spending criteria argue that any spending for disasters and other emergencies should meet specific criteria to be considered outside the constraints associated with th budget resolution and outside the regular annual appr opriations process past budget resolutions have required that spending designate d as an emergency requirementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32863crs65 135 for example the state of louisian defines emergency for the purpose of appropriating emergency funds as an event or occurrence not reasonably anticipated by the legislature an event not reasonably an ticipated shall be one not considered and rejected in the same relative form or

conference report h rept 108280 consolidating the coast guard rd program was proposed in the fy2005 budget request as well but the change was controversial and cong ress did not approve it for fy2006 the house accepted the coast guard move but the senate again rejected it and the conference agreement again followed the senate the house senate and conference agreement all accepted the other proposed fy 2006 consolidations as requested the fy2006 budget was the first to propose c onsolidation for the tsa rd program because the homeland security act which established dhs required that tsa be maintained as single distinct entity until november 2004 pl107296 424 the request for the newly created do mestic nuclear detection office dndo was 227 million although funded unde r st dndo has

pendi ng approval of anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32863crs77 expenditure plan by the appropriations committees the conference agreement provided 19 million for radiological and nuc lear countermeasures and concurred with the plan to transfer most funding for this activity into dndo although the proposed total rd budget for dhs would have changed from the previous year by less than in any othe r year since the departments creation the fy2006 request made substantia l changes in several existing programs as well as the new dndo chemical countermeasures s upport for other depa rtment components and efforts to counter the threat from manpads portable gr oundtoair missiles were all roughly doubled meanwhile funding for rapi d prototyping to accelerate the adaptation or development of technologies that can be deployed in the near term was dropped from 76 million to 21 million nd the consolidated rd activities currently conducted by tsa were dropped from 178 million to 109 million the house and the senate committees and the conference agreement all broadly accepted these proposals with some modifications and made various other changes to the request such as increasing funding fo r explosives count ermeasures see table 12 for details the fy2006 budget justification for the st directorate presented program level data on the directorat actual fy2004 expenditures as compared with the program allocations specified in the fy2004 appropriations conference report these data showed substantial reprogramming for example actual expenditures on biological countermeasures in fy2004 we re 455 million versus the enacted level of 197 million actual f unding for construction of the national biodefense analysis and countermeasure center was 4 million versus 88 million enacted university centers and efforts to counter manpads two items that we re of particular congressional interest and received more fy2004 funding than had been requested had actual expenditure s of 22 million and 17 m illion respectively versus 69 million and 60 million enacted as congre ss considered appropriations for fy2006 these fy2004 data raised questions about how the st directorate establishes priorities

the terrorist attacks of septem ber 11 2001 there has been an increasing interest in the levels of f unding available for homeland s ecurity efforts the office of management and budget as originally directed by the fy1998 national defense authorization act has published an annual report to congress on combating terrorism beginning with the june 24 2002 edition of this report homeland security was included as part of the analysis in subsequent years this homeland security funding analysis has become more refi ned as distinctions and account lines between homeland and nonhomeland security activities have beco more precise this means that while table 13 is presented in such way as to allow year to year comparisons they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis as outlined above with regard to dhs funding it is impor tant to note that dhs funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts in fact while the largest component of federal spendi ng on homeland security is contained within dhs the dhs homeland security request for fy2006 accounts for approximate ly 54 of total federal funding for homeland security the department of defense comprises the next highest proportion at 19 of all fede ral spending on homeland security the department of health and human services at 88 the department of justice at 62 and the department of energy at 33 r ound out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security these five agencies collectiv ely account for nearly 95 of all federal sp ending on homeland security it is also important to note that not all dhs funding is classi fied as pertaining to homeland security activities the legacy agencies that b ecame part of dhs also conduct activities that are not homeland security related therefore while the fy2006 requests total homeland security budget authority of 273 billion for dhs the requested gross budget authority is reported as 411 billion
