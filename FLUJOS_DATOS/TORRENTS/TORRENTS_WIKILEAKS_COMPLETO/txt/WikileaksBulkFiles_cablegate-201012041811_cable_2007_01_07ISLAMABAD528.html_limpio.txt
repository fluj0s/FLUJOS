muslim world 4 c when the speaker asked about musharrafs january 2025 visit to middle eastern capitals riyadh cairo amman damascus and abu dhabi musharraf initiated description of muslim world beset by tension an incipient iraqi civil war along sectarian lines sectarian strife in lebanon the shia dimension in the usiran conflict and at the core the unresolved palestinian question have led the president to believe the time is ripe for new muslim voice of moderation in his talks with his arab interlocutors musharraf laid out his goals promoting sectarian harmony organizing joint action against terrorist organizations and building partnerships with europe and the us the next step is to engage the major nonarab muslim states indonesia malaysia and turkey note musharraf is visiting jakarta and kuala lumpur this week end note he will then seek to develop statement of common principals if this succeeds saudi king abdullah has pledged to host an event to launch the initiative i am trying to lead on this issue musharraf said admitting that he cannot say whether his efforts will succeed 5 c while in damascus musharraf said that he had frank exchange with syrian president bashar assad telling the syrian president that his policies are contributing to instability in palestine lebanon and iraq are you for confrontation or not musharraf demanded noting that syria now has few friends left bashar responded by saying that he wants to reconcile with the international community and work to solve problems musharraf pointed to the need for peace between hamas and israel obtaining bashars word that syria would not obstruct communications between the two musharraf offered to help bashar regain standing in the international community if syria is serious about new direction representative hobson asked whether the us should take different approach with bashar musharraf advised the us to engage bashar he also believes that moderate muslims could influence the syrian he observed that bashar displayed sense of being overlooked by the international community for example bashar told musharraf that the entire world supports the palestinians but has forgotten the israeli occupation of the golan heights musharraf wondered whether observers credit bashar with wielding more power than he actually has speculating that other forces may be at work musharraf perceived bashar as facing problems similar to those along the pakafg border quoting bashar as saying that more than 1 million tribal refugees have flowed into syria from iraq note on hearing this musharraf offered bashar some friendly advice look into fencing end note straight talk on pakafghan border security 6 c responding to chairman skeltons desire to hear the presidents perspective on efforts to secure the pakafghan border musharraf decried the tremendous misunderstandings and misperceptions that have led us critics to accuse pakistans intelligence agencies of collusion with the taliban qaeda and other extremists musharraf frankly acknowledged that remnants of qaeda remain hidden in the mountainous border region pakistan is now also focused on the pashtun tribes who live on both sides of the pakafg border of the seven tribal agencies in pakistans federally administered tribal areas fata populations in north and south waziristan openly cooperate with taliban insurgents qaeda elements are concentrated in bajaur the other four agencies musharraf contended are relatively peaceful although the taliban has made an effort to infiltrate kurram where it has encountered local resistance in contrast musharraf continued pashtuns residing in balochistan are generally peaceful the trouble ther are afghan taliban commanders and foot soldiers who have found safe haven in lawless refugee camps from which they can operate with impunity 7 c speaker pelosi asked the president whether he knew the whereabouts of taliban leader mullah omar musharraf replied that mullah omar and the taliban movement emerged from kandahar where he presumably remains i do not believe omar has ever been to pakistan musharraf said contrasting this to qaeda leaders osama bin ladin and dr ayman alzawahiri who may be ensconced in the mountains along the frontier musharraf proceeded to describe pakistani efforts to locate and apprehend other qaeda leaders and taliban commanders including afghans mullah dadullah lang and jalaluddin haqqani and pakistani baitullah mehsud these leaders musharraf said come and go from pakistan where they recruit and motivate militants 8 c what is required to defeat the taliban musharraf answered his own rhetorical question saying that in afghanistan the coalition must deploy military and political resources while pakistan controls movement across the pakafg border the president painted vivid picture of the ontheground challenges there is easy way to identify taliban fighters amongst the 30000 people who cross the chaman border crossing in balochistan daily only one of 23 crossing points along the provinces 2300 km border with afghanistan even with 954 border posts the government has not been able to control dozens of informal crossing points in balochistan and the fata the strategy must therefore penetrate deeply into the border regions focusing on eliminating safe havens including refugee camps b launching military action against the militants commandandcontrol targets and c winning the loyalty of local tribes through economic growth social development and political reform 9 c arguing that military operations alone will alienate the tribes musharraf segued into an overview of the fata sustainable development plan and description of the traditional leadership roles of maliks who represent tribal authority and political agents who represent federal and provincial authorities to ensure that political agents and maliks have the necessary muscle to reinforce their authority to impose law and order the government is bolstering the numbers and capacity of tribal levies the frontier constabulary and the frontier corps as the speaker described chairwoman loweys leadership of the foreign operations appropriations subcommittee the president expressed appreciation for her support for reconstruction opportunity zones rozs and appealed for usd 150 millionyear for five years for fata development to supplement the national funds already budgeted 10 c political engagement is crucial musharraf said shifting to discussion of the september 2006 jirga accord in north waziristan this agreement is much maligned musharraf admitted but it was critical for the government to reach out to local tribal and religious leaders reestablishing the writ of the government is imperative but the authorities must work with the local tribes to make this reality the greatest failure musharraf continued has been controlling crossborder movement and expelling foreign fighters from the agency the government is now pushing the tribes hard to live up to their side of the bargain if they do not the president said we will take military action when we locate target we will hit it musahrraf promised noting that pakistani forces had done just that ten days earlier candidly assessing the agreement as only 25 percent successful so far musharraf was adamant that the jirga agreement isis the only way forward he said he believes that the north west frontier province nwfp governor should pursue similar accord with tribes in south waziristan 11 c shifting back to preventing unlawful border crossings musharraf addressed the possibility of selective deployment of fences andor land mines along the border mining has problems musharraf acknowledged but said he wants to proceed with fencing military experts have estimated that some 32 km in fata and 295 km in balochistan would be appropriate for fences when chairman reyes noted the controversy generated by proposals to fence the usmexican border musharraf nodded in agreement then cited pakistans long experience with fences and mines along its eastern border with india 12 c expanding his comments to include pakistani plans to close lawless afghan refugee camps musharraf asserted that nobody wants to assist us in this task frustrated that all the ideas i put forward for controlling the border are opposed by both the international community and the government in kabul musharraf said that he welcomes other ideas either help control the border or help move the refugees out he said defending pakistans commitment 13 c musharraf told the codel that the government is committed to fighting terrorism as pakistanis do not want to see their country succumb to creeping talibanization musharraf detailed the heavy losses sustained by pakistans security forces as well as the multiple assassination attempts against the countrys political leadership we are not banana republic and the isi is not rogue agency musharraf said explaining that he could retire any activeduty general officer with swipe of his pen isi is disciplined service staffed by seasoned military officers who follow my orders 14 c later in the conversation the president expressed concern about hr 1 implementing the 911 commission recommendations act musharraf said that language in the bill questioning pakistans reliability as an ally of the us directly damages his ability to wage war on our common enemies this weakens and to inoculate his country against the infection of islamic extremism shared objectives and enlightened moderation 15 c chairwoman lowey asked the president to explain why pakistan has not met mutuallyagreed targets for budgetary support for education set forth in the bilateral shared objectives musharraf defended his record saying that since he assumed power he has embraced human resource development as essential for sustained growth he opted for an inital focus on economic development to generate revenue for health and education and this is happening education spending is increasing from 26 to 4 percent of gdp under his leadership chairman murtha raised the subject of madrassas to which the president responded that the appeal of madrassa education will decline as the public education system improves musharraf also highlighted the governments record in improving health care delivery particularly maternalpediatric services 16 c speaker pelosi raised the specter of suicide bombings seeking the presidents advice on persuading all societies that such attacks are unacceptable musharraf agreed terming suicide attacks as unislamic all countries must find way to deal with extremism the president said but such terrorism must be addressed by force he then outlined his multipoint strategy for combating extremism and promoting enlightened moderation prevent the misuse of mosques prohibit speech that incites the public to violence ban extremist organizations and their leadership delicate business the president

poppy harvest in afghanistan musharraf responded there is effective government control in afghanistan pakistan was able to implement coordinated strategy of eradication and destruction complemented by programs to offer alternative livelihoods the poppy leads only to narcofueled financial flows supporting the insurgency musharraf suggested that the international community provide funds to buy the afghan poppy crop directly from the farmers earthquake relief 18 c chairman lantos asked the president whether pakistan needs the us to do more to support reliefreconstruction efforts in the areas devastated by the october 2005 earthquake musharraf assured the chairman that pakistan is managing the reconstruction process well noting that prompt intervention had prevented the predicted post

with confidencebuilding measures and have successfully maintained ceasefire along the lineofcontrol in kashmir but the process had stalled on conflict resolution now musharraf indicated he and prime minister manmohan singh are on the verge of an agreementsoon sooner than anyone might think musharraf appreciated singhs flexibility relating singhs personal invitation for the president to attend the saarc ministerial in new delhi in april musharraf explained his decision to decline the invitation saying that there is too much euphoria and expectation at present if i went to delhi but we didnt sign an agreement the people would think we had failed he said musharraf said that he has conveyed two options to new delhi either pm singh comes to pakistan before april to sign an agreement or the two hold signing ceremony at the saarc ministerial musharraf shared his enthusiasm for the justconcluded visit to pakistan by three jammmu and kashmir leaders of the all parties hurriyat conference

consequences for americas global reputation president musharraf opined that dividing iraq would be disastrous citing turkish opposition to an independent kurdistan he believes that iran is abetting the growing sunnishia schism referring back to his initiative to build movement of moderate muslim voices musharraf said this must be done by partners who have credibility in the region something that the us does not currently enjoy if consensus could be endorsed by sunnis shias and kurds musharraf mused perhaps an allmuslim security force could backfill following the withdrawal of us and british forces 21 u the codel did not have an opportunity to clear this cable crocker
