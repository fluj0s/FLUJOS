education policy domestic social policy division k12 teacher quality issues and legislative action summary the quality of elementary and secondary school teachers is increasingly recognized as critical element in improving education policymakers seeking to address teacher quality face many serious challenges among these challenges are the lack of consensus on what makes teacher effective the vast size and decentralized organization of k12 education and problems with teacher supply and demand the federal government is not responsible for the preparation hiring and work life of teachers these responsibilities rest with states and localities nevertheless the federal government primarily through the us department of education ed provides substantial resources to strengthen the k12 teaching force recently the focus of federal support has expanded beyond inservice training to include greater emphasis on teacher preparation recruitment and hiring further the federal government is attempting to strengthen accountability for teacher quality there is continuing interest in providing broad flexible assistance coupled with accountability the child left behind act of 2001 pl 107110 reauthorized the elementary and secondary education act esea replacing the eisenhower professional development program and the class size reduction program with single formula grant program supporting an array of activities to improve the elementary and secondary teaching force in addition among other provisions the reauthorized esea includes separate program of math and science partnerships to improve teaching in those fields in amending the esea the child left behind act also established requirements that k12 teachers be highly qualified and set deadlines for when those requirements had to be met these highly qualified teacher requirements have generated questions about their implementation some of which ed has sought to address through regulations and nonregulatory guidance the higher education act hea authorizes funding to improve k12 teacher preparation programs in higher education institutions it includes accountability provisions for the quality of the graduates from these programs it also supports efforts to increase teacher recruitment both the esea and hea may be considered for reauthorization by the 110th congress this report tracks major legislative action

public k12 education despite these efforts many remain concerned about the performance of todays schools and students throughout this process recurrent objective has been improvement of the public k12 teaching force the attention being paid to teacher quality has risen dramatically in recent years this was particularly true as the congress reauthorized the elementary and secondary education act esea in 2002 it remains true today and may be part of the process of reauthorizing the higher education act hea the hea authorizes several programs to improve k12 teacher preparation and recruitment this report provides brief overview of some of the most salient issues regarding the k12 teaching force describes the current federal role in this area describes major federal programs and tracks major legislative action by the congress it will be updated as major action occurs teachers at the center many education reformers have long recognized the importance of improving the k12 teaching force while concurrently marshaling teachers support for the process of reform the increasing focus on teacher quality has been fueled by several recent analyses concluding that among all schoolbased factors teacher quality is the most important that some teachers are much more effective than others with similar students and that teacher quality may specially affect the achievement of disadvantaged students challenges policymakers face many serious challenges in their efforts to improve teacher quality some of these challenges are considered briefly below identifying what makes teacher effective although some research has found certain teacher attributes positively related to student achievement such as verbal ability subject matter knowledge pedagogical knowledge years of experience and certification status there is consensus on what makes teacher effective nevertheless policymakers are focusing on improving certain of these attributes particularly subject matter knowledge and crs2 certification status in an effort to increase the likelihood that teachers will be effective with their students k12 organization and size the organization and size of the public k12 educational enterprise poses significant challenge to teacher quality improvement some 3 million teachers are employed in more than 89000 schools located in some 14800 school districts this is decentralized system states and localities have legal and administrative responsibility for k12 education the recruitment hiring compensation and retention of teachers are matters typically controlled by districts and in part schools and states teacher preparation generally takes place in higher education institutions teacher assignments and evaluations are often the domain of schools teacher certification and tenure are the province of states teacher supply and demand it may be difficult in the coming decade to raise k12 teacher quality when concerns about teacher quantity are growing warnings of potential shortage of teachers abound precipitated by projected increases in student enrollment and an anticipated surge in retirements this has prompted states and localities to initiate many recruitment efforts some analysts question whether rising demand for teachers necessarily portends shortage they point out that teaching can draw from large reserve pool those who might be newly drawn into teaching and those who have taught but are longer teaching and that teacher preparation programs prepare more individuals for teaching than go into teaching also many teachers leave the profession early in their careers efforts to stem this attrition may help address supply issues and raise teacher quality reportedly leavers may be higher academic performers than stayers certification standards state certification standards governing who can teach clearly contribute to the quality of the teaching force as well as to the number of individuals available for teaching some critics of current certification practices call for very substantial raising of standards call which some states have heeded other critics of current certification complain that raising the certification hurdles can impose unreasonable barriers to the entry of potentially high quality teachers particularly midcareer changers or may prompt districts to circumvent these requirements many observers assert that teacher quality and quantity may be served under welldesigned alternatives to traditional certification though some analysts warn that poorly designed alternative certification may create backdoor into teaching for unprepared individuals outoffield assignments another major challenge for policymakers is reducing the extent to which teachers are currently teaching outoffield that is teaching classes for which they crs3 have inadequate content knowledge in 19992000 over fifth of secondary school students took at least one class from teacher who neither majored nor minored in that subject in college over third received instruction in at least one class from teacher who was not certified in the subject taught and did not have major in that subject1 outoffield teaching assignments are function of many local primarily schoolbased factors how to change these practices and policies is an open question as is the impact of such action on the supply of qualified teachers teacher preparation and professional development efforts to address the quality of the teaching force often look to the preservice training process and to professional development ie inservice training for current teachers there is concern that graduates of teacher education institutions are inadequately prepared to teach to high standards some states are holding these institutions accountable for the quality of their graduates these institutions are taking steps to strengthen their programs traditionally professional development has been delivered to current teachers in sporadic and uncoordinated fashion efforts to improve professional development are being undertaken with the goal of remedying the academic and pedagogic deficiencies of current teachers daunting task given the magnitude of the teaching force compensation reform of teacher compensation is frequent element in initiatives to improve k12 teacher quality see crs report rl30217 performancebased pay for teachers it is argued that highly qualified individuals are dissuaded from entering or staying in teaching because current compensation is not competitive and does not reward quality past compensation reforms have generally been shortlived partly because it has proven difficult to address concerns about whether different pay schedules particularly merit based pay systems can be implemented objectively fairly and consistently some compensation reform may be particularly expensive as well tenure some educators and policymakers see state tenure laws as substantial challenge to teacher quality improvement to its critics tenure protects incompetent teachers creating dismissal process that is too costly and time consuming to its defenders tenure protects k12 teachers from arbitrary biased and unfair dismissal and may provide for stable workforce states have been reforming tenure by for example extending the period in which beginning teachers can be evaluated and dismissed expanding the reasons for dismissal and creating time limits for the dismissal process 1 quality counts 2003 ensuring highly qualified teacher for every classroom education week january 9 2003 crs4 unionization the vast majority of teachers are members of teachers unions critics have posited that the major teachers unions have been substantially more interested in job protection and higher salaries than in improving the quality of the teaching force union proponents point to examples of cooperation with different reform efforts including steps to assist underperforming teachers and to remove teachers who do not make necessary improvements nevertheless as reform efforts increasingly focus on teacher quality the challenges to union policies and practices are likely to increase federal role the federal government is not responsible for preparing recruiting certifying compensating testing tenuring and structuring the working conditions of k12 teachers these responsibilities rest with states and localities traditionally these areas have been viewed as largely outside the reach of the federal government nevertheless over the past several years the federal government has become increasing involved in issues of teacher quality and quantity the federal government funds many programs supporting k12 teaching some of these are explicitly targeted to teachers others with broader focus nevertheless support such activities as teacher training over the past several years the congress has been redefining the federal role relative to targeted support of k12 teachers funding although federal aid in this area comes from multiple federal agencies ed is the primary source some 34 billion of the departments fy2008 appropriation was spent on activities directed specifically to k12 teachers this funding includes among other programs 294 billion for the principal and teacher training and recruiting fund 144 million for the troopstoteachers and 437 million for the transition to teaching programs and 337 million for the higher education acts teacher quality enhancement program all of these programs are described below significant levels of funding also support teachers under other programs that are not targeted to teachers eg the esea title i program changing federal role the child left behind act marked significant shift in the federal role with regard to k12 teachers and teaching but in some ways it is the most recent in series of congressional actions modifying that federal role these changes in the federal role are described below immediately prior to the 105th congress federal aid for k12 teaching was largely focused on inservice training with limited funding for preservice training and recruitment the 105th congress began change in this focus by enacting amendments in 1998 to the higher education act hea that included the teacher crs5 quality enhancement program significantly these amendments also had broad based accountability requirements for teacher education programs see crs report rl31254 pass rates as an accountability measure for teacher education programs by james b seedman and bonnie f mangan funded states and their higher education institutions are now required to report publicly on teacher preparation including the pass rates of graduates on certification assessments states must identify lowperforming teacher preparation programs if lowperforming programs lose state approval or financing their institutions cannot receive professional development funding from ed and cannot accept or enroll any hea aided student in the teacher education program in an effort to improve student performance the 105th congress also appropriated funding for the general hiring of new qualified teachers to reduce class size the program was appropriated funding for three fiscal years 12 billion for fy1999 13 billion for fy2000 and 1623 billion for fy2001 this program broke new ground with its explicit and primary focus on federal support for the hiring of teachers further until enactment of the child left behind act this program and the eisenhower professional development program title ii of the esea under prior law had been the two largest federal initiatives targeting support to k12 teachers and teaching the teacher and principal training and recruiting fund in the reauthorized esea replaced those two programs and is the largest single source of federal support directed to k12 teaching the 106th congress continued this redefinition of the federal role in this area for fy2001 the congress specified that appropriated amounts for the eisenhower program above the fy2000 level 335 million were to be spent on such activities as reducing the percentage of teachers without certification or with emergency or provisional certification the percentage teaching out of field or the percentage lacking requisite content knowledge these excess funds could also be directed to such other activities as mentoring for new teachers multiweek institutes providing professional development and retention efforts for teachers with record of increasing lowincome students academic achievement among other new money for teachers approved in the fy2001 appropriations for ed was 3 million for the troopstoteachers program supporting entry of former military personnel into teaching available for transfer from ed to the department of defense2 and 31 million for new teacher recruitment activities targeting midcareer professionals in other occupations and highly qualified recent college graduates with bas in fields other than education the 107th congress further expanded the federal role in issues of teacher quality and quantity on january 8 2002 the child left behind act of 2001 was signed into law pl 107110 in amending and reauthorizing the esea this legislation authorized federal support for broad array of activities to improve k12 teaching ranging from recruitment to hiring to retention it more firmly focused federal interest on teacher quality by for example requiring all core academic subject 2 pl 10665 national defense authorization act for fy2000 signed on october 5 1999 transferred the troops to teachers program from the defense and transportation departments to the education department crs6 teacher to be highly qualified the programs and provisions added to the esea by the child left behind act are described in the following section selected major programs this section provides descriptions of the major federal programs addressing k 12 teaching its primary focus is on the programs in the esea as amended by the child left behind act esea as amended by the child left behind act in amending and reauthorizing the esea the child left behind act continued esea title ii as the primary title for teacher programs the major teacherrelated provisions in title ii and elsewhere in the esea are described below requirement that all teachers be highly qualified each state educational agency sea receiving esea title i part funding compensatory education of disadvantaged students must have plan to ensure that by later than the end of the 20052006 school year all teachers teaching in core academic subjects within the state will meet the definition of highly qualified teacher to be highly qualified public elementary or secondary school teacher must meet the following requirements every public elementary or secondary school teacher regardless of whether he or she is new or experienced 1 must have full state certification charter school teacher must meet the requirements in the state charter school law 2 must not have had any certification requirements waived on an emergency temporary or provisional basis and 3 must have at least ba each new public elementary school teacher must pass rigorous state test demonstrating subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading writing math and other basic elementary school curricular areas such tests may include state certification exams in these areas each new public middle or secondary school teacher must demonstrate high level of competency in all subjects taught by 1 passing rigorous state academic tests in those subjects may include state certification exams in those subjects or 2 completing an academic major or equivalent course work graduate degree or advanced certification in each subject taught each experienced public elementary middle or secondary school teacher must meet 1 the requirements just described for new teacher depending upon his or her level of instruction or 2 crs7 demonstrate competency in all subjects taught using high objective uniform state standard of evaluation housse3 as part of this plan each title ifunded state must establish annual measurable objectives for each local educational agency lea and school that at minimum include annual increases in the percentage of highly qualified teachers at each lea and school to ensure that the 20052006 deadline is met and an annual increase in the percentage of teachers receiving high quality professional development each lea receiving title i part funding must have plan to ensure that all of its teachers are highly qualified by the 20052006 deadline in addition beginning with the first day of the 20022003 school year any lea receiving title i funding must ensure that all teachers hired after that date who are teaching in title i supported programs are highly qualified states and leas must publicly issue annual reports describing progress on the stateset objectives questions have been raised about the scope of the application of these requirements the meaning of some of the requirements and the ability of different kinds of districts to meet them ed has sought to address some of these concerns through regulation nonregulatory guidance and other means early in the implementation of these provisions it was asked whether they apply to all teachers including vocational education teachers special education teachers or others not teaching core academic subjects final regulations for the title i program published december 2 2002 in the federal register apply these requirements only to core academic subject teachers ed noted that these requirements would apply to vocational education teacher or special education teacher providing instruction in core academic subject the final regulations also clarify that teacher in an alternative certification program will have maximum of three years in which to become fully certified without being in violation of the highly qualified requirements regarding certification this allowance is made only for teacher in an alternative certification program who is receiving high quality professional development intensive supervision and making satisfactory progress toward full certification in march 2004 ed announced that additional flexibility could be applied in the implementation of these requirements with regard to teachers in small rural school districts to science teachers and to teachers teaching multiple subjects4 in small 3 among requirements the stateset housse must provide objective information about teachers content knowledge in all subjects taught be aligned with challenging state academic and student achievement standards be applied uniformly statewide to all teachers in the same subjects and grade levels and consider but not be based primarily on time teaching those subjects it may use multiple measures of teacher competency 4 twopage fact sheet on these new policies is available at httpwwwedgovnclb methodsteachershqtflexibilityhtml more detailed letter to each of the chief state continued crs8 rural districts ed now provides that teachers teaching core academic subjects who meet the highly qualified requirements in at least one of the subject areas they teach may have an additional three years to meet these requirements in the other subjects they might teach for current teachers this threeyear grace period begins with the 20042005 school year meaning that rather than facing deadline of the end of the 20052006 school year to be highly qualified in all core subjects taught current rural teachers may have until the end of the 20062007 school year for newly hired teachers full threeyear grace period can be provided from the date of hiring but those newly hired teachers will have to be highly qualified in one of their core subject areas when hired states decide whether to offer this flexibility to eligible rural districts the flexibility announced in march modifies nonregulatory guidance issued in january 2004 by ed for the teacher program under esea title ii which stated that science teachers teaching more than one field of science eg biology and chemistry would have to be highly qualified in each of the fields being taught5 under the new flexibility states determine whether science teachers need to be highly qualified in each science field they teach or highly qualified in science in general based on how the state currently certifies teachers in these subject areas states may also design their housse procedures to allow teacher to go through the process single time to demonstrate competency in multiple subjects in an october 21 2005 policy letter to chief state school officers the secretary announced that its purpose was to assure you that states that do not quite reach the 100 percent goal by the end of the 200506 school year will not lose federal funds if they are implementing the law and making goodfaith effort to reach the hqt goal in nclb as soon as possible6 instead states that meet the laws requirements and the departments expectations in these areas but fall short of having highly qualified teachers in every classroom would be given an additional year to reach the 100 goal the most recently published data on meeting the hqt goal became available in january of 2008 as part of the congressionally mandated assessment of nclb the departments institute for educational sciences found that 91 percent of classes were taught by highly qualified teachers in 200405 two additional findings from the study are 1 students in schools that have been identified for improvement were more likely to be taught by teachers who said they were not highly qualified than were students in nonidentified schools and 2 among teachers who said they were highly qualified under nclb those in highpoverty schools had less experience and 4 continued school officers dated march 31 2004 is available at httpwwwedgovpolicyelsecguid

includes series of accountability provisions that essentially apply to all teacher preparation programs in the country these provisions seek to hold teacher preparation programs accountable for the knowledge and skills of their graduates in doing so they require institutions and states to report on the rates at which teacher education graduates pass teacher certification exams and require states to develop and implement procedures for identifying teacher education programs as lowperforming any higher education institution with teacher preparation program that loses state approval or financial support because of its designation by the state as lowperforming program is ineligible for any professional development funding from ed and cannot accept or enroll in its teacher preparation program
