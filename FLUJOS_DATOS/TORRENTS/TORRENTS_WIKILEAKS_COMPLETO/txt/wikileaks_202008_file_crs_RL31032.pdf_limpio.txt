1992 in 2007 however the trade imbalance decreased to 7386 billion from 8115 billion in 2006 this decrease was reflection of continued strong growth of exports sales up 182 billion or 126 over their level in 2006 and the continuing deceleration of import purchases advancing 1327 billion or 60 over their level in 2006 sizable depreciation of the dollar since 2002 has at once made us exports more attractive to foreign buyers and imports less attractive to american buyers as percentage of gdp the trade deficit in 2007 stood at 53 decrease from 61 in 2006 the surplus in the investment income component of the trade balance increased to 74 billion up from surplus of 366 billion in 2006 however the large and growing size of us foreign indebtedness caused by successive trade deficits suggests that the investment income surplus will soon be pushed toward deficit the size of the us trade deficit is ultimately rooted in macroeconomic conditions at home and abroad us saving falls short of what is sought to finance us investment many foreign economies are in the opposite circumstances with domestic saving exceeding domestic opportunities for investment this difference of wants will tend to be reconciled by international capital flows the shortfall in domestic saving rela tive to investment tends to draw an inflow of relatively abundant foreign savings seeking to maximize returns and in turn the saving inflow makes higher level of investment possible for the united states net financial inflow also leads to likesized net inflow of foreign goodsa trade deficit in 2007 both saving and investment fell but investment fell more causing the trade deficit to narrow the benefit of the trade deficit is that it allows the united states to spend now beyond current income in recent years that spending has largely been for investment in productive capital the cost of the trade deficit is deterioration of the us investmentincome balance as the payment on what the united states has borrowed from foreigners grows with rising indebtedness borrowing from abroad allows the united states to live better today but the payback must mean some decrement to the rate of advance of us living standards in the future us trade deficits do not now substantially raise the risk of economic instability but they do impose burdens on trade sensitive sectors of the economy policy action to reduce the overall trade deficit is problematic standard trade policy tools eg tariffs quotas and subsidies do not work macroeconomic policy tools can work but recent and prospective government budget deficits will reduce domestic saving and most likely tend to increase the trade deficit most economists believe that in time the trade deficit will correct itself without crisis under the pressures of normal market forces but the risk of more calamitous outcome can not be completely discounted this report will be updated annually

2007 however the trade imbalance decreased to 7386 billion from 8115 billion in 2006 this decrease was reflection of continued strong grow th of exports sales up 182 billion or 126 over their level in

2006 the trade deficit rose slowly and more or less steadily from small surplus in 1991a recession year to about 135 billion in 1997 over the next three years as the pace of the economic expansion accelerated the trade deficit grew substantially reaching 4134 billion in 2000 with recession in 2001 the trade deficit fell moderately to 389 billion with the economic recovery in 2002 the trade deficit again began to expand along with the steady improvement in the pace of economic growth the size of the trade deficit between 1997 and 2007 increased by 806 billion with particularly large increases occurring between 2003 and 2006 table 1 shows the anatomy of recent trade trends g9g152g152g141g156g561g22g155g138g141g142g561g4g138g149g138g151g140g142g561 goods trade is the largest component of the current account balance and what has happened in this form of trade has been the major source of change in the overall current account in recent years including 2007 the deficit in goods trade decreased to 8154 billion in 2007 from 8383 billion in 2006 over the last decade the us deficit in goods trade increased by over 600 billion during this period both exports and imports generally rose but import growth out paced export growth in 2001 in response to slack demand across the world economy us goods exports had fallen but the us recession in 2001 also led to an even larger curtailment in the us demand for imports causing the goods deficit and the current account deficit to fall in 2002 weak world demand continued to push us exports down but even tepid us economic recovery in 2002 was enough to cause goods imports to increase and the goods deficit and the current account deficit was once again on the rise 1 the balance on current account is the nations most comprehensive measure of international transactions reflecting exports and imports of goods and services investment income earnings and payments and unilateral transfers

began in 2004 in contrast goods imports grew only 55 in 2007 co ntinuing pattern of deceleration from 17 annual pace in 2004 this disparate performance of exports and imports reflects the impact of 26 real depreciation of the dollar since 20022 the depreciation has improved the price competitiveness of us exports in foreign markets and deteriorated the price competitiveness of foreign goods in us markets also contributing to this phenomenon was faster economic growth in japan and the euro area nevertheless in 2007 goods imports were still nearly twice as large as goods exports with the implication that growth of goods exports will have to substantially exceed that of goods imports for many years to erase the deficit in goods trade t able 1 us current account and components bop bas

goods services trade has consistently shown surplus in the postwwii era from 2001 through 2003 the services surplus decreased due to the dampening effects of strong dollar and generally weak growth in the industrial eco nomies since then however large depreciation of the dollar and faster economic growth abroad caused the surplus in services trade to nearly double in size by 2007 in general the persistent surplus in services trade is reflection of the competitive strength of most us service exports

366 billion in 2006 this increase was mostly the result of larger net inflows of interest and dividend payments 2 the depreciation of the dollar is measured by the inflation adjusted change in an index of the tradeweighted currencies of the united states trading partners individual currencies may of changed more or less than the average for the overall index

earn against what foreign investments in the united states earn this pattern of surplus seems inconsistent with the rapid growth of foreign assets in the united states relative to the stock of us assets in the rest of the world that has accompanied the rising us trade deficit nevertheless since 1998 the surplus in investment income has exhibited rising trend even as us net indebtedness to the rest of the world increased sharply the persistence of the us investment income rplus through 2007 is the result of the interplay of several forces first us investments abroad on average earn higher return than foreign investments do in the united states this differential is thought to result from higher incidence of mature high yielding assets in the us investment portfolio greater risk exposure and the special status of the dollar as the worlds reserve currency of choice second the sharp fall of interest rates in 2006 and 2007 translated into significant fall in payments because large portion of us foreign debt is shortterm and has been rolled over at lower interest rates third in the period 2002 to 2007 falling dollar particularly against the euro caused the foreign currency value of us foreign assets and the associated earnings to rise in the long run however it is likely that the united states large and still growing stock of net foreign indebtedness will come to dominate movement of this balance and lead to steadily larger deficits in the investment income balance 3

brisk economic expansion is not remarkable event for the us economy in the 1960s brisk economic growth steadily eroded small current account surplus in the 1970s modest deficits occurred with each economic expansion however from the 1980s through 2007 the average size of the trade deficits steadily increased cyclical factors certainly have at times played some role in this phenomenon particularly in recent years with the united states growing rapidly relative to most major trading partners trend forces are also at work however inclining the us economy toward generating large trade deficits in all but recession conditions the next section examines in more depth the fundamental determinants of the trade balance the trade deficit widens as the economy expands not because of trade barriers abroad not because of foreign dumping of exports and not because of any inherent inferiority of the us goods on the world market but because of underlying macroeconomic spending and saving behavior at home and abroad in the us economy there is strong tendency to spend beyond current output with the excess of demand met by net inflow of foreign goods and services that manifests as the us trade deficit 4 3 the level and composition of the united states accumulated net indebtedness to foreigners is f ound in the annual tally of the nations net international investment position niip by the us department of commerce and published in the june survey of current business in 2005 the niip was deficit of 27 trillion the capital inflow manifests in foreign holdings of several different types of assets including bank accounts stocks bonds and real property for more detail on crossborder capital flows see crs report rl32462 foreign investment in us securities by james k jackson 4 it is useful to remember that income spending are the flip side of production output any given value of production generates an equal value of income thus the income the economy earns can support spending sufficient to purchase the economys current output with international trade however it is possible for there to be divergence of continued

economies that produce more than is absorbed by their current spending and are able to export the surplus trade deficits and trade surpluses are jointly determined through inte rnational capital flows that lead to mutually favorable reconciliation of these domestic spendingproduction imbalances these imbalances will be sensitive to the shortrun effects of the business cycle at home and abroad as well as longterm effects of trends in spending and production but these imbalances will not be significantly changed by trade policies that try to directly alter the levels of exports or imports such as tariffs subsidies or quotas g3g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g556g11g151g159g142g156g157g150g142g151g157g561g11g150g139g138g149g138g151g140g142g561 national spendingproduction imbalances are analyzed by economists from the standpoint of national saving and investment behavior saving is just the flip side of spending an excess of spending essentially translates into deficiency of savings but focusing on saving has the analytical advantage of rooting the phenomenon in the transactions on international asset markets that are the key to understanding aggregate trade imbalances

trading system growing from flows totaling only few bi llion dollars in 1970 to 7 trillion in 2005 the united states has been major participant in international asset markets in 2007 it received capital inflows of nearly 19 trillion and send capital outflows to the rest of the world of over 12 trillion 5 with fluid world capital markets domestic savinginvestment imbalances will tend to cause two equivalent transfers one an initiating capital market transfer of real purchasing power ie loan from the country with surplus of saving to the country with shortage of saving and two corresponding transfer of real output ie an import to the borrower and an export from the lender through goods market transaction it is an economic identity that the amount of investment undertaken by an economy will be equal to the amount of savingthat is the portion of current income not used for consumptionthat is available to finance investment but for nation this identity can be satisfied through the use of both domestic and foreign saving or domestic and foreign investment therefore saving investment imbalance is relationship between domestic saving and investment and one that can only occur if foreign saving or investment are available to satisfy the overall saving investment identity 6 international capital flows from lender to borrower are the means by which the saving of one country can finance the investment of anot her if international capital flows did not exist domestic investment could be larger or smaller than domestic saving continued spending and production through the borrowing and lending of current income and output between nations 5 see crs report rl32462 foreign investment in us securities by james k jackson 6 saving in macroeconomic framework is the portion of current income that is left after households businesses and government pay for their current consumption household that diverts some amount of current income to bank mutual fund or government bond is saving similarly the tax revenue that the government has left after paying for its spending is public saving httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31032g22g145g142g561g23g495g21g495g561g22g155g138

functioning international asset markets it is possible for domestic savinginvestment imbalances to be reconciled by international capital flows with willing lender and willing borrower flows of capital from saving surplus country to saving shortage country can achieve overall savinginvestment balance for both nations these asset market transactions will change the demand for and supply of national currencies needed to purchase foreign assets causing changes in exchange rates which in turn induce an equivalent sized net fl ow of goods ie trade deficits and trade surpluses between economies g11g151g157g142g155g142g156g157g561g20g138g157g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g138g153g146g157g138g149g561g8g149g152g160g156g561 differences in the level of interest rates betw een economies are the basic equilibrating mechanism that works to induce saving income flows between countries as investors seek out higher rates of return nation with surplus of domestic saving over domestic investment opportunities will tend to have relatively low domestic interest rates because the domestic supply of loanable funds ie saving exceeds the domestic demand for loanable funds ie investment pushing down interest rates ie the price of loanable funds as result this economy will likely see some portion of domestic saving flow outward attracted by more profitable investment opportunities abroad this net outflow of purchasing power which generally can only be used to purchase goods or assets denominated in the countrys currency will through changes in exchange rates induce likesized net outflow of real goods and servicesa trade surplus japan is an example of nation that in recent decades has produced large net outflows of saving to the united states and other nations conversely another nation that finds its domestic saving falling short of desired domestic investment will tend to have relatively high domestic interest rates because the domestic demand for loanable funds exceeds the domestic supply of loanable funds as result this economy will likely attract an inflow of foreign saving attracted by the higher rate of return and that inflow will help support domestic investment such nation becomes net importer of foreign saving income able to use the borrowed purchasing power to acquire foreign output and leading to like sized net inflow of foreign outputa trade deficit that deficit augments the output available to the domestic economy allowing the nation to invest beyond the level of domestic savings and more generally have domestic spending exceed domestic output international asset market transactions and goods market transactions influence both the demand and supply of dollars on foreign exchange markets in most circumstances however there is strong expectation that asset market transactions will tend to be dominant and ultimately dictate the exchange rates actual direction of movement this dominance is the result of asset market transactions occurring on scale and at speed that greatly exceeds what occurs with goods market transactions electronic exchange makes most asset transfers nearly instantaneous and in most years us international asset transactions were two to three times as large as what would be needed to simply finance that years trade deficit in 2007 the balance of payments account show both 12 trillion purchase of foreign assets by us residents capital outflow and 19 trillion purchase of us assets by foreign residents capital inflow so while the united states could have financed the 811 billion trade deficit for 2007 simply by 811 billion sale of assets to foreigners us and foreign investors engaged in much larger volume of pure asset swapping telling sign that asset transactions have been the determining force is that the dollar appreciated as the trade deficit grew if goods market transactions were the determining force the

although relative levels of interest rates between countries are likely to be strong and prevalent force directing capital flows among economies other factors will also influence these flows for instance the size of the stock of assets in pa rticular currency held in the foreign investors portfolio of assets can cause change in investor preferences prudent investment practice counsels that an investors portfolio have an appropriate degree of diversification across asset types including the currency in which the assets are denominated diversification of holdings spreads risk across wider spectrum of assets and reduces over exposure to any one asset therefore even though dollar assets may still offer high relative return if the accumulation of dollar assets already in the investors portfolios is large at some point foreign investors considering both risk and reward may decide that their portfolios share of dollar denominated assets is large enough to improve the diversity of their portfolios investors may slow or halt their purchase of such assets given that well over 8 trillion in us assets are now in foreign investor portfolios achieving sufficient degree of asset diversification may be an important factor governing the behavior of international investors toward dollar assets there is also likely to be significant safehaven effect behind some capital flows this is really just another manifestation of the balancing of risk and reward by foreign investors some investors may be willing to give up significant amount of return if an economy offers them particularly low risk repository for their funds th united states with long history of stable government and steady economic growth presen ts continually safe investment climate also there is also an important market size effect influencing the attractiveness of dollar assets not only do us asset markets offer great variety of instruments they are also very liquid markets with the ability to handle huge sums of money with only small impact on price the precise size of these effects is not easy to determine but the persistence of large capital inflows despite already large foreign holdings of dollar assets and the disproportionate share of essentially norisk us treasury securities in foreign holdings suggests the magnitude of flows attributable to the special status of us asset markets is probably substantial further foreign investors expectations about the future path of the dollar will also influence the relative attractiveness of dollar assets 6 yield on dollar denominated asset will have an expected yield of 00 if the dollar is expected to depreciate 6 per annum against the investors home currency over the bonds holding period it would seem that investors at this time would likely take into consideration that keeping the rapi dly rising us external debt to gnp ratio in realistic bounds will require an elimination of the us trade deficit and erasing the trade deficit can only be achieved by substantial real depreciation of the dollar therefore the prudent investor must include this trend of decline into the calculation of the expected return in their own currency of holding dollar denominated assets this expected depreciation makes the relative return on dollar assets even lower than what is indicated by the nominal interest rate differential in addition to private investors governments will with varying frequency also buy or sell assets on the international capital market such official purchases are seldom motivated primarily by the

government official purchases can serve two objectives one the accumulation of reserve of foreign exchange denominated in readily exchangeable currencies such as the dollar serves as store of international liquidity that can be used for coping with periodic currency crises arising out of often volatile private capital flows this is most often device used by developing economies that periodically need to finance shortrun balance of payments deficits and can not fully depend on borrowing on international capital markets to offer timely finance of these deficits the asian financial crisis in the late 1990s heightened the importance for many developing economies of having very large stocks of international reserves to weather periodic financial crisis two official purchases are used to counter the im pact of capital flows that would otherwise lead to unwanted changes in the countries exchange rate the united states and most other industrial nations while most often allowing the value of their currencies to float on the foreign exchange market have at times undertaken such intervention this however is common practice for many east asian economies that buy and sell foreign assets to influence their currencies exchange rate relative to the dollar and other major currencies to maintain the price attractiveness of their exports globally dollar assets in official foreign exchange reserves increased 1 trillion between 2001 and 2006 among the large industrial economies in recent years japan has been highly visible practitioner of accumulating international assets so as to slow the rise of the yen relative to the dollar accumulating dollardenominated foreign exchange reserves in 2003 of about 117 billion among emerging economies china has undertaken large scale accumulation of dollar assets to fix the value of the renminbi relative to the dollar accumulating nearly 500 billion dollar denominated assets between 2001 and 2007 in most cases however government exchange rate intervention is unlikely to be substantial enough to change the direction in which private investors are pushing the dollar this intervention has likely slowed the fall of the dollar

domestic savinginvestment imbalance can occur as result of either investment rising relative to saving or saving falling relative to investment see table 2 in the 1980s the saving rate and the investment rate both declined but the saving rate fell substantially faster inducing capital inflows and rising trade deficit the fall of th saving rate in this period was rooted in two occurrences the first was substantial fall in the public saving rate caused by the run up of large federal budget deficits which amounts to negative saving or dissaving the second occurrence was the decline of the household component of the private saving rate in the late 1980s this imbalance narrowed due to increased public saving ie smaller deficits and sharp decline in the investment rate in response to decelerating economy headed for recession after recovery from the 1991 recession the us savinginvestment imbalance began to increase steadily but the form of the imbalance changed the rates of saving and investment both rose but the investment rate increased more the turnaround in the overall saving rate in the 1990s was the consequence of sharp change in the public saving rate where the steady move by the federal government from budget deficits to budget surpluses increased the public saving rate from 25 ie dissaving in 1992 to 52 in 2000 dampening the rise of the overall saving rate however was the continued decline in the household saving rate falling from about 65 in 1992 to 00 in 2000 the rise of the overall saving rate in the 1990s did not bring that rate up to the magnitude that prevailed in the 1950s 1960s or 1970s and fell well short of the 1990s briskly ascending httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31032g22g145g142g561g23g495g21g495g561g22g155g138

savingsinvestment imbalance was rising inflow of foreign savings to close that gap and in turn an ever larger trade deficit substantial decrease in the rate of investment during the 2001 recession narrowed this gap and the trade deficit from 2002 to 2005 the us rate of investment increased and the rate of saving declined causing the investmentsaving gap to widen and the trade deficit to expand the higher rate of investment was the result of the faster pace of economic activity in the ongoing economic expansion the further fall of the saving rate was caused by reductions in both the household and government saving rates the overall rate of saving in the economy in this period remained positive due to generally steady rate of business saving in 2006 however with stabilization of both the saving and investment rates the investmentsaving gap stopped rising and the trade deficits advance slowed significantly in 2007 substantial fall of the rate of domestic investment caused the

saving rate has been the object of much economic research but the reasons for the decline remain problematic single theory can fully account for the phenomenon but three have considerable plausibility first capital gains on real estate stocks and other investments particularly in the 1990s have greatly increased household wealth economic theory predicts that rise in wealth reduces the need to save and increases the tendency to spend second increased government outlays for medicare and social security transfer income from relatively high saving segment of the population to relatively low saving segment third more streamlined credit market vehicles such as credit cards and home equity loans have removed constraints on household liquidity and prompted increased spending and reduced saving7 7

somewhat unclear but three plausible forces have been suggested first the wealth induced spending mentioned just above also provides stimulus to business investment as new plant and equipment is needed to meet the rising demand for output second it is argued that recent deregulation of industry liberalization of trade and massive integration of ever cheaper and more powerful computers into the production process have boosted productivity and raised the profitability of investment in the united states third and perhaps most plausible pervasive economic weakness abroad most recently in asia has made the united states singularly attractive destination for foreign investment even the relatively slow pace of the us economic recovery in 2002 and early 2003 when juxtaposed with generally weaker growth in the rest of the world made it likely that the trade deficit would expand in 2002 and 2003 in 2004 and 2005 the us economic growth was brisk and outpaced that of other major economies change of significance in us saving behavior over the past five years is the shift in the trajectory of public saving in 2002 the federal budget moved back into deficit and in 2004 that budget deficit had risen to 413 billion with th prospect of similar sized budget deficits persisting into the foreseeable future this has resulted in the federal government moving from being net saver in 2000 at magnitude equal to about 28 of gdp to being net dissaver at magnitude of about 25 of gdp in 2005 this fall in government saving exacerbates the savinginvestment imbalance and other factors constant widens the trade deficit in 2005 the federal budget deficit was reduced and government diss aving improved to 18 of gdp the budget deficit continued to fall in 2006 down to about 11 of gdp this recent reduction of the budget deficit has not been the result of any policy change but rather the result of an unexpectedly large inflow of corporate tax revenue generated by record levels of profits despite this shortterm reduction most longterm projections see large budget deficits extending for many years into the future for that widening of the trade deficit to happen however there will also need to be foreign lenders willing to invest in the united states if to take one extreme position there are such investors then any fall in the domestic saving rate will through higher interest rates lead to like sized fall in the domestic investment rate if at the other extreme there are legions of investors eager to invest in the united states the savings shortfall will be overcome with little dampening of domestic investment more realistically there will likely be willing foreign investors but that willingness might have to be gained through the prospect of higher rate of return the higher domestic interest rates must go to attract investors to bridge the domestic saving shortfall the more downward pressure there will be on domestic investment the macroeconomic forces that generate trade deficits are entirely consistent with high rates of capacity utilization and employment trade deficits however can have negative effects on output and employment in particular sectors the out put employment and sectoral effects of trade deficits are discussed at greater length in latter section of the report the united states has regularly been the net recipient of foreign capita l inflows and regularly had trade deficits for the past 25 years it has also regularly achieved high rates of economic growth and low rates of unemployment over this time period 8 this is more understandable in that although deficit in goods and services trade caused by the rise of the exchange rate tends to have negative effect on 8 for fuller discussion of this analytical framework see n gregory mankiw

there is also positive effect on domestic economic activity because of the lower interest rates caused by the likesized net inflow of foreign capital saving therefore the trade deficit changes the composition of domestic output but does not change the overall level of domestic output it is also true that an overall trade imbalance need not be reflected in the balance with individual trading partners bilateral balances will reflect additional forces such as geographic proximity scale economies and comparative advantage therefore some could be in deficit and others in surplus similarly overall trade balance can be consistent with significant bilateral imbalances for example even if unites states were to eliminate its trade deficit it would likely have sizeable trade deficit with china or seen the other way reduction of the us trade deficit with china not accompanied by change in the us economys overall domestic savinginvestment imbalance will not lead to reduction of the overall us trade deficit if however decrease in the us trade deficit with china is the result of reduced inflow of capital saving from china and there is likesized increase in another source of foreign saving then the overall us trade deficit will also fall but so must domestic investment in the united states to bring it into line with the smaller pool of saving that would be available to finance domestic investment this overall scenario leaves three strong impressions one us trade deficits appear to be largely but not completely created and propelled by macroeconomic forces in the domestic economy that influence international flows of capital two those deficits must be sustained by willing foreign lenders and substantial reduction of that willingness other factors constant might lead to deficit reduction on less than the most favorable terms and three these forces are not easily manipulated by economic policy

relative ease nevertheless an ever larger trade deficit is not likely to be sustainable indefinitely there are automatic adjustment processes that will dampen the willingness of borrowers to borrow and of lenders to lend and which can cause more or less orderly reduction of the savinginvestment imbalance and in turn the trade deficit

pay that is the economys capacity to meet the interest and principal payments on the accumulated debt to foreigners such payments must come at the expense of other forms of national expenditure and therefore will not increase without bound for the united states the net international investment position niip is the measure of its stock of obligations and gdp is the measure of its ability to pay the ratio niipgdp is possible proxy of the borrowers constraint because the united states does not have much experience with rising foreign debt to gdp ratio it is difficult to judge at what value this ratio would begin to sharply deter more borrowing between 1992 and 2003 this ratio expressed as percentage has risen from 73 to 216 substantial gain but that is still below the 25 to 35 common among other high income countries and well short of the debt burden of most households httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31032g22g145g142g561g23g495g21g495g561g22g155g138

account deficit in that year it may seem odd that the debt to gdp ratio did not increase however the change in the total dollar value of us foreign debt reflects not only current borrowing but also changes in the market value of existing assets these valuation effects were particularly beneficial for the united states in 2006 slowing the rate of advance of the negative niip but such strongly favorable effects are unlikely to persist over the long run nevertheless it is still problematic what level of the debt to gdp ratio would begin to significantly constrain the behavior of us borrowers an alternative measure of constraint is the ratio of the current account balance ca to gdp cagdp this measure lays more stress on the si ze of the annual flow of foreign obligations relative to gdp as an initiator of borrower behavior the value of cagdp for the united states has risen from 08 in 1992 to high of 61 in 2006 historically for industrial economies when the cagdp ratio exceeded 42 the current account began to narrow 9 the united states cagdp ratio has moved beyond that point however there are special attributes of the american economy that would allow it to prudently push borrowing beyond this benchmark ratio see below g14g142g151g141g142g155g514g156g561g5g152g151g156g157g155g138g146g151g157g561 the willingness to lend to particular destination will be influenced by the riskreturn profile to other available assets broad array of alternatives with comparable riskreturn prospects would tend to reduce the willingness to lend to single borrower similarly paucity of alternative investment opportunities would have the opposite effect it can be expected that the array of alternatives faced would be influenced by the strength of economic conditions across the globe in addition the desire of investors for some degree of portfolio diversification will tend to limit their willingness to become overly saturated in assets denominated in single currency beyond the willingness to invest is the issue of ability to invest the ability to sustain large or rising outflow of capital will be limited by the size of the lenders economy and its wealth portfolio other economies are substantially smaller than the us economy and may be unable to sustain the magnitude of outflow the united states can apparently readily absorb also limiting crossborder lending is the observed preference in most economies to hold high percentage of wealth in home assets although it is suspected that this preference is steadily being eroded by the improving efficiency of international asset markets finally the holders of dollar assets particularity shotterm portfolio investments will be sensitive to the expected path of the dollars exchange rate because sizable depreciation can quickly decrease the rate of return of the dollar asset to the foreign holder therefore the expectation of depreciating dollar is likely reduce the foreign investors demand for dollar assets three events have likely caused substantial diversification of foreign investor portfolios toward dollar assets in recent years one the recent liberalization of the japanese postal saving system with portfolio of 3 trillion that had been held almost exclusively in very low yielding japanese government bonds two large accumulation of foreign currency earnings by petroleum exporting

the inflow will be all the greater three there has been large increase in the level of foreign exchange reserves particularly dollar reserves held by foreign central banks the willingness of central banks to accumulate dollar assets will be governed by different considerations than the standard profitloss calculation that motivates private investors and can be sustainable for long periods of time nevertheless there will be pressures that will work to limit such official purchases unless the asset accumulation is sterilized the growth of official reserves will be inflationary and since the capacity for sterilization is not likely to be infinite particularly if the financial markets of the lending country are not well developed and have small absorptive capacity the inflationary impulse of official lending may not be avoidable forever in general sustained asset accumulation through official purchases ties the monetary policy of the lending country to that of the borrowing country and the lending countrys need to avoid an acceleration of inflation will make it an unsustainable policy 10 also like private investors the prospect of incurring capital losses on holdings of dollar assets due to likely depreciation of the dollar on the foreign exchange market could dampen foreign central banks willingness to purchase more or continue to hold the dollar assets it has

to the united states that may reduce the constraints on international lending or borrowing first more than 90 of the us international borrowing is denominated in dollars 11 this means that the pressures facing othe r countries which cannot borrow in their own currency because of potentially large fluctuations in the value of debt service burden caused by volatile exchange rates are largely not an issue with the united states second large portion of foreign capital inflows to the united states is in relatively stable longterm investments such investments tend to be less prone to volatility caused by sudden changes in investor confidence third about 50 of the investment in the united states by foreigners is in the form of equity stock holdings equity holdings tend to carry less strict payment requirements than debt holdings working to lower the potential service payments for given level of niip and extend the period over which the nation can prudently run current account deficits fourth the size stability and liquidity of the us asset markets puts the united states in special position as borrower finally that importance is enhanced by the dollar also being the world economys principal reserve currency and therefore readily held asset as well as readily exchanged asset as noted above foreign central banks have recently substantially increased their holdings of dollar reserves g18g155g152g156g153g142g140g157g156g561 where is the trade deficit headed in the period just ahead in the economic framework presented in this report the answer to that question will hinge on the net direction of capital flows into and out of the american economy at present the united states is an international borrower receiving net inflow of foreign capital if that net inflow decreases the trade deficit will also decrease if 10 on the subject of sustainability of the trade deficit see crs report rl33186 is the us current account deficit sustainable coordinated by

the capital inflow remains the same so will the trade deficit so what direction are capital flows likely to take whether the current capital inflow gets bigger smaller or remains the same will most likely be determined by the resolution of two contenting forces risk and reward if on balance foreign investors see further investment in the united states as far more riskier undertaking other factors equal the capital inflow will ebb and bring the trade deficit down with it on the other hand if the relative rate of return from investment in us assets grows more attractive the net capital inflow could expand and bring the trade deficit up with it an important risk factor now is the adequacy of diversification in investor portfolios that contain large dollar balances survey by the economist magazine shows that american assets make up 53 of the typical foreign investors equity portfolio and 44 of the typical bond portfolio as recently as the mid1990s these percentages where only about 30 it has also been estimated that the average investor in recent years has allocated about 80 of his increased wealth to dollar assets and would have to continue at this rate or higher to sustain the us trade deficit for the next few years 12 this is possible outcome but it is fair to doubt that it is probable as standard investment practice increasingly suggests that investors move away from dollar assets such shift was likely cause of the dollars depreciation from early 2002 through 2004 in 2002 almost all foreign capital inflows were from priv ate sources but by 2004 only about 75 of that inflow was from private sources however as infl ows of capital from private investors weakened there was sharp increase in official purchases of dollar assets by foreign central banks the annual increase of holdings of dollar denominated foreign exchange reserves by foreign central banks grew from 28 billion in 2001 to peak increase of 440 billion in 2006 in 2007 foreign exchange holdings increased by 413 billion the dollar changed course and appreciated in 2005 reflecting some reshifting of private foreign investor preferences toward dollar assets two factors are probably the principal reasons for this rise first bourgeoning petroleum earnings looking for safe and liquid resting place moved toward dollar assets second significant nudging up of shortterm interest rates by the fed had made shortterm dollar assets more attractive to all investors the dollar was fairly steady through most of 2006 but began to weaken significantly at yearend and fell 9 in 2007 the recent weakness of the dollar may reflect the markets response to the fed pushing interest rates steadily lower since mid2006 it also may reflect some softening of the demand for dollar assets by some oil exporting countries in the period ahead it seems likely that private foreign investors will continue to move away from dollar assets there are three reasons for this first yields on high quality bonds in japan and the euro area are higher than yields on similar us securities making investments in those currencies more attractive than dollar investments second keeping the rapidly rising external debt to gdp ratio in realistic bounds will require an elimination of the us trade deficit erasing the trade deficit can only be achieved by substantial real depreciation of the dollar therefore the prudent investor must include this trend of decline into the calculation of the expected return in their own currency of holding dollar denominated assets this expected depreciation makes the relative return on dollar assets even lower than the nominal interest differential third for the next few years the us trade deficit although it might be falling will continue to add large 12 the economist

accumulation generates an increasing need for portfolio diversification into assets in other currencies it is uncertain if foreign central banks will continue to increase their holdings of dollar assets but if they do it would probably not be on scale sufficient to fully offset the weakening demand of private investors and prevent the dollar from depreciating declining dollar does reduce the purchasing power of americans but the magnitude of this effect is not huge because imports account for only 15 of us gdp therefore further 20 reduction of the dollar over the next two to three years only reduces consumer purchasing power by about 3 further the weaker dollar makes us exports more competitive in world markets strong export sales have been one of the few positive developments in the economy recently and continued growth of export sales will provide an important offset to economic weakness in the period just ahead there is likely to be some degree of uncertainty in forecasting the us trade deficits path nevertheless the likelihood of continuing weakening of foreign investors demand for dollar assets points to further dollar depreciation and further reduction in the trade deficit the imf is now projecting the us current account deficit falling to 605 billion or 42 of gdp by 2009 13

costs and the former may exceed the latter trade deficits are vehicle for extending the gains from trade where lending and borrowing among nations can lead to more efficient allocation of saving and preferred pattern of consumption over time trade deficits do not necessarily cause slower economic growth or lead to any economywide loss of jobs as seen in the 1980s and as was evident again in the 1990s the us unemployment has fallen to record lows and the economys growth rate has accelerated to record highs even as the trade deficit has risen that deficit therefore does not necessarily come at the expense of current domestic economic activity of course borrowing carries cost as the lender demands that interest be paid on the funds borrowed and the principal one day be repaid this debt service cost is burden the borrower must carry tomorrow for living beyond his means today an evaluation of the desirability or undesirability of trade deficit will hinge on the current benefits gained from that added spending relative to the future debt service burden that is incurred also reliance on foreign sources of finance often raises concern that trade deficits carry an elevated risk of instability and disruption to the economy finally trade deficits have differential effects on different sectors of the economy often placing large burdens on exporting and importcompeting sectors 13

claims on future goods and services that is an exchange of goods and services for an asset ie cash in bank account stock or bond when the united states or any trading nation borrows from abroad to import materials for current investment project it is undertaking intertemporal trade in such transaction the borrowing nation gains because it can support higher rate of investment in capital goods than what current domestic saving alone could finance the lending nation gains an asset yielding higher rate of return than is available in the home economy because of the difference in their preferences for spending over time the international asset market allows both parties to the transaction to raise their economic wellbeing the borrowers economic wellbeing is raised by being able to spend more in the current period than current income allows the lenders economic wellbeing is raised by being able to spend more in some future period country that is net borrower will also run trade deficit while the country that is net lender will run trade surplus this type of international asset transaction allows more global utilization of the worlds saving more efficient allocation of investment spending across nations and preferred distribution of spending over time 14 since the early 1980s the united states has incurred trade deficits of moderate to large size using international borrowing to push spending beyond current production pursuing desired consumption and productive investment now rather than later similarly nations like japan have been able to run trade surpluses using interna tional lending opportunities to earn higher returns on their excess national savings and expanding the prospects for spending in the future such net flows have not grown as fast as gross flows of ca pital so that external sources of finance still claim only small share of the total funding of domestic investment in most industrial countries for the united states in 2005 for example the trade deficit was equal to 64 of gdp and about 38 of domestic investment spending the trend nevertheless has clearly been toward larger external imbalances surpluses and deficits an aspect of the current pattern of international capital flows of some concern is that the inflows to the united states are largely outflows of capital from the developing economies this is not pattern that makes economic sense over the longter m the united states has large stock of high quality capital to equip its workers with and slow growing but rapidly ageing population the developing world in contrast tends to have low ratio of capital to labor and have young rapidly growing populations economic reasoning leads to the expectation that investment opportunities are likely to be greater in the capital poor developing economies and the need for saving to support future retirees greater in the united states and that the united states should be running trade surpluses and be net lender to the developing economies not vice versa 15 14 in addition to international transactions involving the exchange of goods for gods and the exchange of goods for assets there is the exchange of assets for assets as noted earlier asset for asset transactions occur on larger scale then do the two other types of international transactions the benefit of international exchange of assets is that it allows both parties to reduce the riskiness of the returns from there wealth by diversifying their portfolios 15 see ben s bernanke the global saving glut and the us current account deficit sp eech delivered

formally measured by the net international investment position niip in 1981 the united states was net creditor with net accumulation of assets in the rest of the world of 374 billion but steady and substantial stream of net foreign borrowing has swung the niip to net debtor position of about 25 trillion in 2006 up from about 22 trillion in 2005 again favorable valuation effects on existing holdings cause the net creditor position to increase by less than the size of the 2006 current account deficit nevertheless the cumulative increase in us net foreign debt since 1981 is more than 3 trillion16 the current annual debt service cost of americas net foreign debt can be roughly judged from the size of the investment income component of the current account balance see table 1 that series is measure of the nations net payments and receipts on past investment and debt if positive the united states earned more than it paid if negative the united states paid more than it earned over time the movement in this measure will be reflective of changes in the stock of net indebtedness as seen in table 1 us international investment income in 2007 was surplus of 746 billion up from surplus of 366 billion in 2006 as discussed earlier the investment income balance has shown surplus in the 20 billion to 30 billion range for the past 30 years in recent years the surplus of investment income has persisted despite the united states having large negative international investment position ie large external debt this continuing surplus means that there has been true debt service burden to the us economy from its net external debt this lack of economic burden has happened because there has been net outflow of investment income meaning there was net diversion of us real output to the rest of the world to service the external debt even with the trade deficit growing smaller until the deficit is eliminated the volume of debt obligations will continue to grow and as result it is credible to expect us international debt payments to also grow it is possible that us foreign debt service payments will reach or exceed 100 billion before the current account deficit is erased and net foreign borrowing stops 100 billion transfer of real income to the rest of the world would be significant but it would not be an overwhelming outflow for the worlds largest economy in 2006 the united states has gdp valued at more than 13 trillion and by decades end it will likely exceed 14 trillion for an economy of this size 100 billion foreign debt service burden amounts to 08 of gdp clearly insolvency is not lurking just over the horizon particularly since the economy in the future will be larger and more capable of meeting debt service payments nevertheless debt service payment of this size would be significant particularly if viewed in the context of the economys average annual growth rate of real gdp for mature industrial economy like the united states the longterm growth rate of real output can optimistically be expected to average as much as 30 per annum thus yearly debt service burden of about 10 of gdp would mean that the rate of growth of output that is effectively available to the 16 see us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis 2005 yearend net international investment position june 30 2006 the term net debtor is somewhat inaccurate in that only fraction is true debt obligation such as bond where there is fixed term and contractual obligation to pay fixed amount to the holder holdings of equities carry the expectation of earnings but there is obligation to pay if earnings are made

erosion of the rate of improvement in the us living standard at 30 annual growth rate national income doubles about every 24 years whereas at 20 annual ra doubling occurs every 35 years put another way if the per capita gdp in 2002 of 36600 grows on average at 30 for 24 years gdp per capita would equal about 75000 whereas growing at 20 for that same period would bring per capita gdp to only 59000 or about 21 less the degree of burden actually incurred however will depend in part on how the nation has used what it borrowed since 2001 foreign borrowing has financed an increase in domestic consumption public or private therefore it will not generate any boost to future productive capacity therefore to meet debt service expense future consumption must be reduced below what it otherwise would have been such reduc tion represents the burden of foreign borrowing this is not necessarily bad it all depends on how current versus future consumption is valued on the other hand in the period from 1994 to 2000 foreign saving was used to finance an increase domestic investment allowing the debt service burden to be avoided or at least reduced investment spending increases the nations capital stock and expands the economys capacity to produce goods and services the value of this added output may be sufficient to both pay foreign creditors and also augment domestic spending in this case because future consumption need not fall below what it otherwise would have been there would be true economic burden it is difficult to assess to what extent us debt service cost will be attenuated by the shift in the 1990s to the pattern of supporting rising domes tic investment using foreign borrowing from the pattern of the 1980s of support more or less exclusively added domestic consumption with foreign borrowing keep in mind however that the accelerated rate of investment makes only small net contribution to the size of the nations huge capital stock thus its growthaccelerating effect is commensurately modest g11g151g156g157g138g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 trade deficits often raise concern about the potential instability of external sources of finance what if foreign investors begin to pull their funds out of the united states disrupting domestic capital markets and the wider economy there are good reasons to doubt that sharp turnaround in foreign capital flows is likely recent experience of other countries with the panic of foreign investors has shown that such behavior most of ten results from the growing likelihood that they would not be repaid that debt service payments were doubtful very often because many economies particularly emerging economies are not able to borrow in their own currency weakening of the home currency can lead to sharp in creases in the cost of servicing such external debt this ability to pay problem would also be exacerbated by weak economic growth or the rapid consumption of the nations foreign exchange reserves in the defense of an overvalued currency these are not risk factors that have much relevance to the circumstances of the united states which has strong growth does not fix its exchange rate and borrows in its own currency in addition large proportion of investments made in the united states have been longterm in nature and not particularly prone to quick changes in commitment it is very likely that many foreign investors generally see the us economy as bastion of longrun economic strength and will continue to invest for longterm gain it is true that sizeable share of the stock of us foreign debt is in short term assets that can move quickly that these types of assets will change direction as relative yields rise abroad is quite likely and does raise the risk of instability somewhat but given the absence of the risk factors noted just above it is far more likely that

process and not lead to undue economic instability the impact of any exodus of foreign capital absent any compensating increase in domestic saving would tend to raise interest rates and dampen credit sensitive activities it is very likely that falling dollar and shrinking us trade deficit would be more disruptive to the more export dependent and exchange rate sensitive economies of europe and japan the united states underwent very orderly correction from large trade deficit in the 19851990 period however the current task is likely to be more difficult and carry higher risk of disorderly adjustment for four reasons one oil prices were falling sharply in the late 1980s but now oil prices and other commodity prices are rising sharply this will add to the inflation impact of falling exchange rate and hamper the federal reserves ability to counter upward pressure on domestic interest rates caused by rapidl dwindling inflow of foreign capital two in the 19851990 episode other economies central banks particularly japans were willing to buy large volume of dollar assets providing stabilizing counter force on the falling dollar and the rising yen given the already huge stocks of dollar assets being held abroad this action seems improbable today three in the 19861990 period europe the strongest market for us exports was booming today economic growth in europe is slower four holders of the us external debt are accepting yields that seem too low given to keep the volume of us external debt in realistic bounds the dollar must continue to fall perhaps even faster than has occurred so far as foreign investors come to fully appraise the expected depreciation it will increase their reluctance to hold dollar assets 17 and five the size of the current trade deficit is more than twice as large as the deficit in 1985 for the united states the pain of such an adjust ment would be somewhat muted by the large size of the overall us capital market relative to the scale of the foreign capital flows in recent years the total funds raised annually in us credit markets have been around 2200 billion therefore net borrowing from the rest of the world at around 600 billion to 800 billion per year represents 25 to 30 of the nations annual flow of credit this is magnitude of significance but if withdrawn gradually it is not necessarily overwhelming for the united states

deficit does not cause net loss of output or jobs in the overall economy trade deficits will however likely change the composition of output and employment this compositional effect occurs because the forces generating the trade deficit will tend to increase the dollars exchange rate raising the incentive to substitute some types of foreign output for similar types of domestic output but this dampening effect on some domestic industries will tend to be offset by the positive effects of the trade deficits associated capital inflow on other parts of the economy with trade deficit some import

recently some domestic manufacturing industries have been harmed by the trade deficit but there has also been great surge in home building stimulated by lower interest rates afforded by the trade deficits attendant inflow of foreign capital also the federal reserve using monetary policy can set the overall level of spending in the economy to level consistent with full employment18 although deviations from full employment can occur wellrun monetary policy will minimize the incidence and duration of such episodes and help keep the total level of employment high in most years with or without outsourcing trade deficits or trade in general trade deficits are most often means of augmenting the level of goods and services available to domestic purchasers in effect allowing the nation to spend beyond current domestic output by means of importing foreign output both domestic and foreign output are used to meet current domestic demand with strong demand in an economy operating near or at its productive capacity and unable to generate nearterm expansion of that productive capacity sufficient to meet that demand it is possible for domestic industries to be working at full capacity even as there are also large inflows of similar or related foreign products another reason why more imports do not lead to reduction of domestic output and employment is because very large share of us trade is intraindustry trade in intermediate productstrade within the same industry due to an internationally fragmented production processa final product will often be composed of several components some of domestic origin and some of foreign origin 19 with this structure of production an increase in the demand for the final product will increase both domestic output and imported foreign output of necessary components regardless the level of capacity utilization finally there may simply be domestic counterpart for some goods because product differentiation has led to specialization across countries in the production of particular goods the economic gain from such specialization arises from economies of scale not comparative advantage and is common among high income economies with very similar resource endowments 18 economies always have some amount of unemployment each economy will tend to have natural rate of unemployment around which the actual unemployment rate fluctuates this natural rate will also represent the rate at which the economy is effectively at full employment b ecause lower rate of unemployment would not be sustainable due to the inducement of higher rate of inflation the natu ral rate is not zero because at any point in time there will be some people who are changing jobs and other people who normal market forces have temporarily displaced more fluid the economys labor markets the lower its natural rate of unemp loyment is likely to be for most of the last 30 years the united states economys natural rate was judged to be in the 55 to 60 range since the mid1990s the natural rate has likely fallen to the 45 to 50 range most often an appropriate level of aggregate spending is that consistent with employment at the natural rate there is theory or evidence to indicate full employment is influenced by the trade deficit 19 the significance of intraindustry trade varies by industry for industries that make sophisticated manufactured goods it tends to be very high with over 90 of trade of this form in labor intensive industries that manufacture less sophisticated products very little trade is intraindustry intrai ndustry trade is to great degree manifestation of wide spread move towards more fragmented production processes or what is called vertical specialization it is estimated that about onethird of the growth of world trade since 1970 is the result of this phenomenon and can be expected to be even higher for the trade of an advanced industrial economy such as the united states for further examination of the nature and significance of intraindustry trade see paul krugman and maurice obstfeld international economics theory and policy reading ma addison wesely 1997 pp 139142 for further examination of the vertical specialization phenomenon see david hummels dana rapoport and keimu yi the nature and growth of vertical specialization journal of international economics vol 54 june 2001 pp 7596

deficit during an economic expansion as during the 1980s and 1990s cannot be taken as oneforone measure of reduced domestic output and the loss of the associated jobs since the end of the recession in 2001 the trade deficit has increased about 400 billion whereas the unemployment rate fell from 6 in 2003 to 46 in 2006 and total civilian employment climbed from low of 136 million workers in 2002 to 144 million workers in 200620 g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561g152g151g561g18g138g155g157g146g140g158g149g138g155g561g21g142g140g157g152g155g156g561 although large trade deficits do not necessarily reduce the total level of economic activity they can alter the composition of domestic output evidence shows that over the past 20 years persistent trade deficits may have caused reduction in the size of the domestic manufacturing sector 21 the trade deficit exerts some downward pressure on the size of the domestic manufacturing sector because the trade inflow cannot easily augment the full spectrum of goods and services that comprise the nations increase in domestic demand about 70 of domestic spending is on services but because trade is relatively poor vehicle for acquiring services only about 15 of us imports are services therefore the trade deficit largely net inflow of manufactured goods may not meet the augmented domestic demand for goods and services in this circumstance relative prices can be expected to change so as to reallocate some resources out of the domestic manufacturing sector and into the production of services to help meet the added domestic demand for services this in turn should induce greater reliance on the net inflow of foreign manufactured goods to help meet the added domestic demand for manufactures the outcome will be greater real output by the domestic service sector and smaller real output by the domestic manufacturing sector 22 recent surges of the trade deficit have clearly had sharp negative impact on particular sectors on the export side agriculture and commercial aircraft experienced dampened export sales mainly due to general weakness in other economies particularly in asia on the import side the steel industry and the textile and apparel industries came under considerable pressure from low price competition from countries affected by economic crises the trade deficit is certainly factor in the fall of employment in the us manufacturing sector from 17 million in 2000 to 14 million in 2006 however of greater importance in the reduction of jobs in manufacturing is the rapid increase in worker productivity adjustment to such trade effects can be economically painful for workers in these harmed sectors many economists argue that it is usually more beneficial to the overall economy to encourage adjustment than it is to protect sectors from the disruptive effects of trade there are government programs that provide some amount of trade adjustment assistance but there are important questions about the adequacy of these programs 20 see the economic report of the president february 2006 appendix b statistical tables 21 see crs report rl32350 deindustrialization of the us economy the roles of trade productivity and recession by craig k elwell crs report rl32179 manufacturing trends longterm context for todays policy issues by stephen cooney bernard gelb and robert pirog deindustrialization causes and implications staff studies for the world economic outlook imf 1997 22 this argument is not likely undermined by the development of us trade surpluses in services in this period as tradable services are small subset of the full spectrum of largely nontradable services in domestic demand

manufacturing sector may also undercut the countrys ability to make future debt service payments to foreign creditors manufacturing is major part of the exporting sector and it is that sector which will be the means for paying debt service healthy manufacturing sector is likely to make that task easier

domestic investment and an inflow of foreign saving is available to fill all or part of the gap the united states will run trade deficit this suggests that the use of trade policy tools to alter the flow of exports or imports while imposing efficiency costs on the domestic economy would not over time change the domestic investmentsaving imbalance and therefore would not change the overall size of the trade deficit 23 on the other hand macroeconomic policy tools have the potential to alter the saving investment balance and the trade balance but the realistic scope for their use is limited g22g155g138g141g142g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g142g156g561 trade policy involves actions to directly stimulate or retard the flows of imports and exports such as the erection or removal of tariffs and subsidies such actions will have significant impacts on the level of trade and economic efficiency positive or negative but will not change the balance of trade in each instance action aimed at altering one side of the trade equation tends to induce effects via the exchange rate that will cause the other side of the equation to change in the same direction and by an equal amount for example using tariff or quota as barrier to stem the flow of imports into the united states would also reduce the demand for foreign exchange needed by the united states to purchase imports appreciate the dollars exchange rate and induce an equivalent curtailment of export sales with this policy the level of trade has been reduced along with the economic gains from trade and general economic wellbeing but the trade deficit would be unchanged alternatively getting the trading partners to remo ve trade barriers would stimulate export sales but would increase the demand for dollars by foreigners appreciate the dollar exchange rate and induce an equivalent increase of imports in this case the level of trade is increased along with the gains from trade and economic wellbeing but the trade deficit would be unchanged finally an export subsidy would also stimulate export sa but an exchange rate induced rise of import sales would also leave the trade balance unchanged in the case of the subsidy economic theory holds that higher level of trade does not lead to an increase in economic welfare as the gains from trade are more than offset by the economic inefficiency of distorting the allocation of resources towards the export sector

must be rebalancing of global spending the united states must reduce domestic spending and the economies with trade surpluses must increase domestic spending in the framework of the saving 23 similarly the removal of us trade barriers while conferring efficiency gains would not change the domestic investmentsaving imbalance and therefore would not widen the trade deficit

states faces three option 1 the rate of domestic investment falls 2 the level of domestic saving rises due to reduced consumption spending 3 some combination of one and two in all cases the dollar will have to fall to induce changes in spending at home and abroad the inducement is caused by the depreciating dollar increasing the relative price of foreign goods in the us market and decreasing the relative price of us goods in foreign markets macroeconomic policy the use of monetary and fiscal policy tools can in theory effect changes in these saving and spending flows for example monetary policy by raising domestic interest rates and braking economic activity can lower the rate of domestic investment reduce the saving investment gap and decrease the trade deficit at the extreme recession could dramatically reduce the trade deficit as it did in 2001 because of its negative effects on economic growth however decreasing the rate of domestic investment is not generally considered the most desirable economic course to follow however also fiscal decisions on taxing and spending influence the deficit or surplus position of the federal budget and the rate of public saving as seen in the late 1990s rise in the us overall saving rate as consequence of rising public saving rate stemmed from the sharp swing of the federal budget from deficit of 290 billion in 1992 to surplus of 236 billion in 2000 since 2002 budget deficits have fallen and the government saving rate has increased accordingly this change has restrained the growth of the trade defi cit but to eliminate the trade deficit by raising government saving would likely require the government to run substantial and sustained budget surplus given the political nature of budget deliberations it seems problematic whether the federal budget can be an easily exploitable policy tool for eliminating the trade deficit also there is less than oneforone change in the total saving rate from given reduction of the budget deficit the lower interest rates that come from the smaller budget deficit will also tend to stimulate some amount of domestic spending and reduce national saving accordingly the ultimate effect on the overall saving rate is likely to be 050 to 080 for each dollar reduction in the budget deficit this also means that dollar of budget deficit reduction results in less than dollar of trade deficit reduction other factors constant therefore if the savinginvestment gap is about 700 billion to 800 billion an elimination of the trade deficit achieved through an increase of government saving would require running budget surplus of well over trillion dollars can macroeconomic policy lift the low private saving rate proposals have been made to use the tax code to raise incentives for saving by households careful analysis reveals that such proposals most often have uncertain effects on the savinginvestment balance as they tend to raise both saving and investment 24 other proposals such as individual retirement accounts may just redistribute saving raising the household rate little but lowering the public rate by an offsetting amount in addition the adverse effects of the current fall in housing prices on household wealth could prompt hi gher rate of personal saving

willingness to lend on the other side of the us inclination to spend beyond current domestic output is symmetrical inclination of foreign nations to spend well short of domestic output and export the difference it seems that american spending is as important to these economies as foreign borrowing is to the united states the most orderly adjustment to smaller us tr ade deficit is likely to occur through mutually supporting policy actionsas the united states brings domestic spending down closer to domestic output and its major trading partners bring domestic spending up closer to their domestic output in so doing the us efforts to become less dependent on imports is complemented by foreign efforts to become less dependent on exports to the united states as already noted above this change would require substantial appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the dollar the less willing foreign economies are to change this current pattern of spending the more protracted and difficult shrinking the us current account deficit could be if foreign economic policies work to counter us policies attempting to raise domestic saving by reducing their domestic saving then the dollar depreciation needed to induce sizable reduction of the us trade deficit would be larger than if foreign policies were more supportive of the change in spending patterns without mutually supporting policies the dollar might need further 40 to 50 real depreciation to induce any sizable reduction of the us trade deficit depreciation of that magnitude is risky for two reasons one some would argue that the greater the size of the currencys fall the greater the chance that it will fall too far too fast sending jolt to world financial markets that could possibly precipitate world recession two the dollar may not fall evenly against other currencies for example from 2002 through 2007 the dollar fell by nearly 70 against the euro but only about 11 against the chinese yuan this has occurred because china has actively limited the strengthening of the yuan relative to the dollar accumulating large stock of dollar assets this very uneven depreciation across currencies places more of the burden of adjustment of trade flows on the euro area economies and raises the risk of major economic crisis there because of their size and degree of economic interaction with the united states japan and the euro zone particularly germany would likely have to play key role in assuring the world economy has an orderly adjustment to weaker dollar and much smaller american trade deficit yet neither has had recent history of economic strength and there are reasons to doubt their willingness to undertake the actions that would better insure an orderly adjustment to smaller us trade deficit japan has struggled with poor economic performance for more than decade and despite much better performance recently it is unclear that it is willing to overcome its fears of deflation and move strongly toward stronger yen and reduced dependence on exports to support economic activity there in europe structural rigidities continue to slow economic growth and distinct bias towards tight macroeconomic polices further inhibits economic activity in addition there is an evident tendency of the euro zone to also use exports to support economic activity and therefore an inclination to avoid significant strengthening of the euro this adjustment process would also be assisted by the appreciation of other currencies particularly in other asian economies that have pegged their currency to the dollar much attention has been focused on china and its pegged currency many economists would argue that there is need for china to allow its currency to appreciate much more substantially

large pool of domestic saving into investment in china an appreciation of the yuan without changes in the savinginvestment asymmetries between the united states and china would not lead to any significant changes in each trade imbalance at present it can be argued china by accumulating shortterm reserves to maintain an undervalued exchange rate is running neomercantilist policy that allows it to run large trade surplus to generate demand for its products and also have large net inflow of longterm capital to help propel its economic development for an economy of chinas this is not likely to be sustainable process from the viewpoint of its trading partners if it needs the inflow of longterm capital then it should allow the real transfer of those resources by running trade deficit or be prepared to use more of its own saving to support domestic investment rather than transfer those saving to the rest of the world in general policies that improve the investment climate in many developing countries such as improved macroeconomic stability increased financial transparency and better bank regulation will tend to redirect international lending toward them and away from the united states nevertheless it would seem quite problematic whether other countries will follow polices that would greatly increase the prospect for an orderly or quick shrinking of the us current account deficit g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 trade deficit is not necessarily bad it is most useful to see it as vehicle to achieve an economic end conferring some benefit at some cost whether the trade deficit is good or bad will hinge on weighing of these benefits and costs the overriding benefit is the ability to borrow internationally so as to push current spending beyond current production trade deficits in the 1990s have been means to help finance an elevated level of domestic investment investment augments the nations future productive possibilities and is boon to longterm economic welfare in contrast the large trade deficits of the 2000s have been used to finance greater public and private consumption in this situation the benefit of an increase in current consumption must be weighed against the cost of reduction of future consumption the longterm cost of the trade deficit is the debt service that must be paid on the associated borrowing from the rest of the world the us debt service burden has been avoided so far but this is not likely to be true forever the shortterm cost is the adverse effects the trade deficit has had on trade sensitive sectors of the us economy particularly the manufacturing sector certainly true that standard trade policy tools such as tariffs quotas and subsidies will not significantly change saving or investment behavior and therefore will not reduce the trade deficit but in most cases will create distortions that reduce national economic welfare macroeconomic policy can affect the savinginvestment balance and can change the trade deficit but how to do so by raising domestic saving rather than reducing domestic investment remains unclear the government budget deficit and government saving have improved in recent years but much more sizable increase would be needed to eliminate the trade deficit by this means httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31032g22g145g142g561g23g495g21g495g561g22g155g138

moving in the opposite direction under the pressures of rising entitlement spending however the prospect of more vigorous economic growth in the euro area and japan could cause greater opportunities for investment in those economies slowing their saving outflow to the united states and working to shrink the us trade deficit generating sustained increase in the us economys rate of saving by reversing the steadily sagging rate of household saving would reduce the trade deficit but how to do that rate is uncertain it is possible that the trade deficit could correct itself without any inducement by economic policy there are good reasons to expect that economic forces will work to sate the demand for foreign borrowing as well as reduce the supply of foreign funds being offered significant acceleration of the rate of growth abroad relative to that of the united states raising domestic investment relative to domestic saving abroad would likely initiate such process change in relative growth rates would most likely alter rates of return between the united states and the rest of the world redirect larger share of internat ional investment flows towards destinations other than the united states and shrink the us trade deficit nevertheless smaller trade deficit lacking an increase in the rate of us domestic saving will mean that the reduced saving inflow from abroad wi ll have shrunk without any offsetting increase in domestic saving this will increase us inte rest rates above where they would otherwise be forcing reduction of domestic investment to the level of domestic saving available to finance it g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 craig k elwell specialist in macroeconomic policy
