provisions of the new law with previously existing law as well as the versions engrossed by the house and senate in the 107th congress while the energy provisions in the house version were spread throughout the bill the senate version consolidated most of its energy provisions into title ix energy both bills provided for the use of reserve land for renewable energy production the house vers

fuel education renewable energy systems energy audits rural energy systems hydrogen and fuel cells and technical assistance among these topics the house version addressed grants for biobased product research and loans for renewable energy systems and instead of creating new programs expanded or extended existing programs further the senate version cr eated new programs for carbon sequestration research and demonstration while the h ouse version extended the authority of an existing research program the final version generally follows th senate provisions although there are some key differences including the add ition of funding for the commodity credit corporation bioenergy prog ram which supports ethanol and biodiesel production and reductions in funding fo r several other
