civilian workforce has been reduced by 40 percent since th first brac rounds began in 1988 less than 10 percent of the affected employ ees were involuntarily separated11 for the current round dod stated one of the departments challenges at installations subj ect to brac decisions is the fair and effective management of human resources the closure of installations with the potential for separating large number of civilian employees presents major challenges to commanders and human resource personnel while these installations will still have missions to accomplish the employees will be stressed about their careers and employment security in this atmosphere productivity will suffer and the employees overall quality of life may diminish the department has number of mitigating placement transition and worker assistance programs to draw from12 in order to assist with efforts to mitigate the impact of job separations eg through reduction in force and otherwise help civilian employees with transitions dod established brac transition website and created brochure to assist civil service employees appropriated fund em ployees and nonappropriated fund naf employees13 the

employee might or might not be offered the opportunity to move with the work19 an employees right of assi gnment depends on whether the employees organization is being moved due to transfer of function as dod explains transfer of function occurs when function ceases in one location and is moved to one or more ot her locations that are not performing that specific type of work20 in such case

bargaining agreem ent may include provisions that affect the brac process such provisions could arguably be nullified by the implementation of the nsps section 9901905a of the nsps regulations indicates that any provision of collective bargaining agreement that is inconsistent with the regulations or dod implementin g issuances is unenforceable31 in addition section 9901917d2 of the regulations states that management has obligation to bargain over change to condition of employment unless the change is foreseeable substantial and significant in terms of both impact and duration on the bargaining unit or on those employees in that part of the bargaining unit affected by the change32 in february 2006 however federal distri ct court enjoined the regulations on the grounds that they failed to ensure collec tive bargaining rights did not provide for the independent thirdparty review of laborrelations d ecisions and failed to provide fair process for appealing adverse
