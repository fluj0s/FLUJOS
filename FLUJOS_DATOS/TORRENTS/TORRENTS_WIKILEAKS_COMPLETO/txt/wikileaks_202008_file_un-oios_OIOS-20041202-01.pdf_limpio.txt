interviewing staff reviewing available docum ents and assessing control procedures where docum entation was available 8 there were two scope lim itations oios requested unep to obtai n records held on its behalf by unops to enable oios to conf irm the propriety of arrangem ents m ade by unep for handling certain aspects of hum an resources m anagem ent financial m anagem ent and procurem ent of goods and services unops denied unep access to the records and requested advice from their legal officer who had not responded at the end of fieldwork unep was therefore unable to provide oios with basic inform ation to support how it had conducted its business further di scussions with unops resulted in an inform agreem ent between oios and unops on how to handle direct requests from oios but the prin ciple of unep having sufficient safeguards over rights of access to inform ation handled by unops remained unanswered at the tim of issue of this report b unep pcau was unable to provi docum entation of goods and services acquired for its offices in geneva oios was unable to confirm the cost effectiveness of the arrangem ents iv audit findings and recommendations governance 9 pcau m aintains database of organizations such as universities research institutions nongovernm ental organizations consultants and institutional consultancies it interacts with but had not identified the bodies with which it should have som form of an institutiona l relationship to ensure that it did not duplicate or undertake work which was the responsibility of another entity the risk of duplication was reduced becau unep is an observer of the developm ent group and the head of pcau xplained to the audit team that unep staff m embers who attend these m eetings br ief pcau weekly on the issues raised however oios is of the opinion that pcau needs to identify and establish m ore 2 form links with bodies also involved in this work such as the office for the coordination of hum anitarian affairs nd the unhabitat disaster managem ent unit recommendation to ensure that pcau activities are properly aligned with those of other entities the head of pcau should identify all entities which

above however the m ission statem ent and the activities unde rtaken are not fully covered by the mandate given to the unit by unep gove rning council the governing council therefore needs to be advised of the need to align the m andate with the type of requests being received from mem ber states recommendation to ensure that the work actually undertaken at the request of mem ber states is covered by the m andate of pcau the executive director of unep should present paper to the next governing council in 2005 outlining the need to change the m andate to reflect operational experience to
