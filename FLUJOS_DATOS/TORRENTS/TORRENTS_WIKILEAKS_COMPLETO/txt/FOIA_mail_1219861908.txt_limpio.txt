tosbornueaacuk caspar thanks phil at 1416 27082008 caspar ammann wrote phil i worked on the figures yesterday and sent them off to gene for double check will be one panel each 6 much improved legibility and significantly reduced footprint in the appearance of the text you should have them before the end of your day thanks for all your work on this paper tim too cheers caspar on aug 27 2008 at 242 am phil jones wrote caspar gene were going to send the manuscript back tomorrow if we get revised diagram well include otherwise we wont have had few more comments but nothing substantial all yours gene are in as are those from gavin mike juerg and the coral people there is completely revised tropical dendro section and peck finally came through with section on lessresolved proxies and varves all in all it reads very well and the recommendations should prove very useful for pages cheers phil at 0452 26082008 caspar ammann wrote hey gene ill see how i can adjust the figures to fit caspar on aug 25 2008 at 830 pm eugene wahl wrote hi phil and tim and caspar here are my full set of comments on the entirety of section 3 the figures relevant to section 3 the authors address and abstract none there i made slight changes in the portion of the text already sent last night sorry that i could not avoid that caspar please note that ive operated here on the assumption that figure 3 is simplified to one panel for each section according to the suggestions we have talked about but does contain all 6 portions af there are two versions one with just the relevant portions of the text and the full amended text document the changes noted should be identical in each version peace gene dr eugene r wahl physical scientist noaanesdisncdcpaleoclimate branch 325 broadway street boulder co

comments so far and all are in new figure 3 most appreciated we must send this off on thursday or friday hope youre settling in to boulder life at least you should be able to contact caspar more easily cheers phil original message subject new wengen draft from 3eugenerwahlnoaagov date mon august 25 2008 245 am to 4pjonesueaacuk hi phil ive had to wait to the weekend to get to this due to several other matters that had to be attended to here at noaa this week and in relation to report required by funder that was due friday ive looked over about half of section 3 up to the start of section 342 and also the abstract and the authors address section attached are my comments on those sections i will be getting to the rest of section 3 tonight and tomorrow and will send anything else to you everything is done in word with track changes turned on highlights 1 my address information has been updated to include my noaa information which is now appropriate the original alfred information is kept as also appropriate ive condensed it all to not change the overall page spacing of the address citations 2 the addition to the results description of the riedwyl et 2008 paper across pp 1011 here near the top of p 56 in the text you sent this week it is necessary to keep this addition as the text as it was overemphasized the differential quality of the regem results in this study their graphs 4 and 6 clearly show the results i added in which regem for winter adds quite problematic artifacts at the highest levels of noise added the whitenoise snr at which this happens 025 while low is not outside of what reality might bring nb i have talked with juerg about this situation and he is clearly aware of my sense that regem is given too high marks in this context 3 i added very brief descriptions how the cfrs actually come up with reconstruction to the descriptions of them in section 32 if you feel these three sentences cannot be included i understand but i think they are useful for the readers to know how the covariance information we are talking about there is actually used to come caspar and i are working out much simplified version of figure 3 one panel per each section af which i think will be much better than what is there now we communicated on that friday and yesterday and are now close to having new graphic i will adapt the references to figure 3 in section 342 and in the figure caption in my next message accordingly which i plan will come either tonight or tomorrow peace and again thanks gene original message from from phil jones new wengen draft dear all heres the revised version of the paper together with the responses to the reviewers we have told john matthews that we will get this back to him by the beginning of next week to us in
