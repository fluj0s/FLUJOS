loans through the federal housing administration fha having created the voluntary program it remains to be seen if people will be willing and able to participate under current ﬁnancial market conditions meanwhile the pace of foreclosures continues to rise even as another category of loans alta approaches the peak of its payment resets the foreclosure process may be costly and cumbersome3 some have argued for moratorium on foreclosures to give distressed borrowers and lenders time to seek ﬁnancial relief others might argue that delaying foreclosures may also delay the recapitalization of the banking system and ultimately delay restoration of stability in ﬁnancial markets proponents might counter that providing additional time to keep current borrowers in their homes will ultimately

counter that providing additional time to keep current borrowers in their homes will ultimately reduce the magnitude of bank losses and lessen the need for recapitalization the persistence of large unsold inventories of housing may be an indicator that house prices may fall further further declines in house prices might contribute to more foreclosures and more instability in financial markets although economists generally believe that prices adjust to clear shortages and surpluses it could be argued that the housing market has characteristics that make that process longer and more painful than in some other consumer goods markets in housing markets several factors may contribute to feedback loop where housing market instability becomes selfreinforcing potential obstructions to price adjustment and market clearing in the housing market include builders hesitating to lower prices for new houses because they may have duties to previous customers the reluctance or inability of some homeowners to sell their houses for less than they owe on their current mortgages the addition of foreclosures to housing supply when prices fall the tendency of some potential buyers to wait for market prices to hit bottom and the reduction of available mortgage credit during housing market downturn moratorium would have costs and benefits on the benefit side it would provide all market participants with more time to assess asset prices and evaluate alternatives on the cost side it could delay the ability of markets to clear excess inventories and restore financial stability evidence from the great depression suggests that states that enacted moratoriums provided relief to some home owners but saw higher costs of credit and fewer loans compared with states that did not it nevertheless has been argued that natural disasters are an appropriate analogy and that the oncoming schedule of alta mortgage resets creates time pressure that in the absence of moratorium could overwhelm the capacity of loan servicers regulatory foreclosure freeze has been announced by the fdic for indymac loans some have called for foreclosure freeze for loans held by the gses in

delaying foreclosure could have benefits borrowers who may not have fully prepared for payment increases built into their mortgages would have more time to adjust their household finances they would also have more time to consider participating in the newly enacted voluntary program to refinance loans into fha at reduced principal if their lenders agreed similarly lenders would have more time to consider loan modification or participation in the new fha program as lossminimizing alternative to the costly foreclosure process especially considering the decline in the value of houses which serve as collateral for the loans other home owners trying to sell their homes would not ve to compete with quite so many foreclosure sales which often drive down prices neighborhoods and communities might

may desire to purchase home but were priced out during the previous housing boom might have fewer opportunities than they would without foreclosure deferment program some banks who are already experiencing liquidity and solvency problems would lose at least one potential avenue of recapitalization selling the collateral of underperforming loans it is possible that deferment plan could simply delay the bottoming out of th housing market and extend the period of large unsold housing inventories in which case potential buyers who are waiting for prices to trough might remain on the sidelines if the return of potential home buyers were delayed on large scale then it would be possible that mortgage markets and related financial institutions might remain in turmoil for an extended period disrupting the financing of student loans auto leases municipal funding and other seemingly unrelated markets tradeoffs such as the potential benefits and costs of foreclosure deferment are central to the economic approach although competitive markets are said to allocate resources efficiently under certain assumptions the persistence of large unsold inventories of houses is not consistent with market in equilibrium8 rapid declines in house prices have not as yet drawn buyers back in on large scale in economic theory the ability of private actors to effectively evaluate trade offs and reach efficient outcomes depends upon transaction costs the availability of relevant information and the presence of competing buyers and sellers9 these theoretical conditions for economic efficiency can be useful for diagnosin g potential obstacles to private bargaining solutions the central tradeoff in evaluating deferment is the cost and benefits of quickly moving the ownership of assets from distressed hands to secure hands many observers recognize that delays in reallocation has opportunity costs at least some of the policy considerations in bankruptcy are intended to facilitate this asset transfer and minimize the costs of delay but economists recognize that speed itself has costs for example two researchers of financial crises have observed that speed can actually work against wellfunctioning procedure if time is required to properly assess the value of assets and claims allow for negotiations search for potential bidders and generally increase the liquidity of the bidding process 10 from an economic perspective analysis of moratorium on foreclosures in the current housing cycle focuses on the factors that could affect the speed of reducing the

in relatively free market prices are expected to adjust up or down to eliminate surpluses and shortages persistent surpluses such as excess inventories of unsold homes are often sign that quantity supplied at the current price is greater than quantity demanded in the current housing market the inventory of unsold homes in many formerly appreciating markets is far above the historic average an indicator that prices could fall further11 the expectation of further price declines could itself discourage new buyers and delay the restoration of more normal conditions g21g158g153g153g149g162g561g138g151g141g561g6g142g150g138g151g141g561 the recent fall in house prices in formerly booming areas was not random event that one could have predicted rather period of rising pr ices followed by period of falling prices is the expected economic outcome when demand for good rises and suppliers are delayed in their ability to respond to the increased profits although it is often difficult to determine the timing and magnitude of price changes that is the increased demand initially bids up prices and increases producer profits but eventually producers are able to increase capacity prices are then expected to fall back to reflect producer costs this basic supply and demand approach is consistent with the recent experience of many formerly booming housing markets including in florida california nevada and arizona that is not to say that the housing market does not have various features that affect the speed by which house prices reduce shortages and surpluses for example producers must comply with zoning restrictions and home purchasers are typically restricted by the availability of mortgage credit from an economists point of view the good news is that we do not have to wait for random shock for the housing market to recover rather the market is expected to recover as 1 producers reduce construction which has already happened in many areas 2 normal demographic household formation increases the number of potential home purchasers and 3 price declines bring affordable home ownership within the reach of greater percentage of an areas population the combination of fewer housing units for sale and more potential home buyers will eventually stabilize the housing market from the point of view of many policymakers however the bad news is that this process may take longer and the amount of dislocation caused may be greater because of several features of the mortgage marketfeatures that may be subject to amelioration five factors may tend to prolong surpluses of unsold homes and delay the stabilization of housing markets builder attitudes toward prior home buyers nominal mortgage contracts foreclosure supply feedbacks potential buyers waiting for pric to bottom out and financial problems of the providers of mortgage funds such as banks and governmentsponsored enterprises gses moratorium on foreclosure could potentially address some but not all of these factors

home builders who develop large neighborhoods are often reluctant to lower prices because this can anger earlier buyers rather than lower the asking price of the home the builder might prefer to offer other incentives such as reduced financing costs or discounted options such as granite 11 the national association of realtors report 11 months pply available at httpwwwrealtororgresearchresearch

conditions allow but seek alternatives to recording price declines when conditions are reversed period of slowing sales may occur rather than period of falling prices as result potential buyers may not know that the real cost of homes has fallen into their price range and other sellers such as owners of existing homes may not realize that they will be unlikely to find buyer if they do not lower their asking price this reluctance of builders to lower asking prices was observed earlier in the housing cycle but many builders have since capitulated in the current housing cycle builder reliance on financing incentives and construction options rather than price reductions is probably longer significant obstacle to the clearance of unsold inventories builders began aggressively cutting prices and trying to clear their own inventories in many areas earlier in the housing cycle builders have also reduced new construction as measured by housing starts and have cancelled or failed to exercise many of their options on land for development moratorium on foreclosures would be unlikely to affect the incentives of builders to try to avoid lowering asking prices

prices that are not adjusted for inflation are called nominal prices the vast majority of mortgages do not directly adjust the monthly payment for changes in the inflation rate because the united states has generally experienced inflation since world war ii most americans have had the real as opposed to nominal price reflected in their monthly mortgage payment decline over time similarly inflation has masked periods of declining real house prices nominal house prices continued rising in some areas even though the real prices of houses declined once inflation was taken into account in individual cities even nominal house prices had been known to fall sometimes sharply the claim that the united states as whole has not experienced house price decline is not true for real house prices the distinction between nominal and real prices is important first some americans may have been overconfident that the price of their home would never decline as result they may have accepted mortgage terms that would commit them to refinancing their houses quickly even if they could only do so if house prices continued climbing consistent with this analysis the use of mortgages with low down payments and low introdu ctory monthly payments is concentrated in areas that formerly had rapid price appreciation now the default and delinquency rate on these loans for all classes of borrowers has risen significantly the wave of payment resets caused by the expiration of these introductory periods in areas in which the expected appreciation did not occur is one of the reasons that some policymakers wish to quickly facilitate mortgage refinances the second reason why the nominal mortgage ct is important is because it may create an obstacle to clearing the unsold housing inventory homeowner who cannot make the current monthly mortgage payment can avoid foreclosure by selling the house as long as there is positive equity in the home falling house prices reduce the homeowners equity in some areas prices have fallen enough that many recent home purchasers even prime borrowers now have negative equity person cannot sell his or her home to avoid foreclosure if he or she does not have adequate equity or sufficient savings to pay off the current creditor and any other selling costs such as the real estate agent unless the lender agrees to accept less than the amount owed on the original loan eg short sale there is nominal price floor below which these homeowners cannot goa price floor prolongs an economic surplus such as the inventory of unsold homes historically it was common for distressed debtors to advocate for greater inflation which is consistent with desire to lower the real price when it is difficult to lower the nominal price

because it would increase the length of time that inflation can affect real house prices that being said the current inflation rate is significantly below the magnitude that is probably necessary to lower real house prices enough that prospective buyers could meet many sellers nominal price floors the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index from july 2007 to july 2008 was 56 which is significantly less than nominal price declines in some areas12 for example the nominal price decline for san francisco measured by the case schiller home price index from may 2007 to may 2008 was 2313 if inflation is included the real price declined even further another example from an alternative measure of housing prices from the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo which is generally less volatile than the case schiller index reported nominal price decline in sacramento ca of 13214 because it would take two to three years for the current rate of inflation to compensate for even one years nominal price decline in some areas it is unlikely that brief moratorium on foreclosures would significantly reduce that part of the impediment to equilibrium that is caused by the use of nominal prices in mortgage contracts

there are some problems in housing markets that create feedback loop that can increase the number of homes being offered for sale when prices are falling in areas where the direction of prices unexpectedly switches from rising to falling for example people who counted on further price appreciation to enable them to refinance their homes on more favorable terms will be frustrated and some may try to sell their homes to avoid foreclosure15 price reductions also increase the number of home owners who owe more than their home is worth especially if there have been large number of buyers who put little or nothing down the combination of home owners who cannot afford scheduled increase in their monthly mortgage payments and those who longer have sufficient incentive to continue paying down loan because their negative equity is large more than 100000 in some areas tends to increase the number of homes offered for sale in precisely those areas that once had rapid price increases but are now experiencing rapid price declines although the peak period of payment resets for subprime mortgages reportedly is passing other mortgages with reset feature eg socalled alta and hybrid arms that are even more highly concentrated in formerly rapidly appreciating regions will be triggered in 2008 2009 and 2010 16 the net result is that falling house prices can also increase supply over some range through feedback process between negative equity and default rates foreclosure moratorium may under some circumstances help to reduce the supply feedback effect of falling house prices in the short run it would slow down the number of distress sales in 12 unadjusted twelve month calculation bureau of labor statistics july 2008 available at httpwwwblsgovnewsreleasepdfcpipdf 13

foreclosure sales also affect the existing homeowners perceptions of the value of their own homes it could be argued that foreclosure sales increase the incentive of people to choose to default opportunistically when their negative equity is high17 on the other hand negative equity is necessary but not sufficient condition for foreclosure because preforeclosure sale can avoid default if there is positive equity one study of borrowers in massachusetts with negative equity in the 1990s for example found that more than 90 retained their homes suggesting that opportunistic default may be overstated in some cases 18 moratorium might also allow households that have unmanageable payment resets to adjust their household finances eligible families may be able to refinance into more affordable loan or negotiate new terms with their existing creditors perhaps by taking advantage of the new fha program 19 some people who used mortgages with low introductory payments and were surprised when house prices failed to continue appreciating would have time to adjust both their expenses and their earnings household earnings can be raised in some cases for example by having family member return to work or by renting room to boarder20 in some cases there may be delay between realization that payment reset will be unaffordable and the familys ability to adjust earnings and expenses the effect of moratorium on the supply feedback of foreclosures and unmanageable resets is hard to project on the one hand delay in foreclosure is unlikely to reduce the incentive of people with large negative equity to opportunistically default if these people will eventually default anyway then moratorium merely delays the inevitable and extends the period of destabilizing unsold inventories on the other hand delay in foreclosure could provide those families whose expectations of market conditions were frustrated and now face large payment reset additional time to adjust their finances to new market realities these families might avoid foreclosure altogether given extra time which would tend to reduce the total supply feedback both during the moratorium period and after its expiration

during the moratorium period then fence sitters would gain little by waiting on the other hand if fencesitters believe that moratorium will merely delay inevitable distress sales then the moratorium

the mortgage finance system is another factor that could tend to limit the ability of housing markets to restore equilibrium quickly in the united states the vast majority of home sales require mortgage financing so the supply of mortgage funds is critical component of the demand for houses falling house prices create negative feedback loop in the mortgage finance system because mortgage funds tend to dry up as housing markets decline first when housing prices are declining lenders tighten lending standards and require larger downpayments to reduce the probability of negative equity and default because the decline in the value of the collateral the house increases the risk to the lender in the event of default second the higher delinquency rate on existing loans that usually occurs concurrently with falling house prices also reduces the revenues of banks and other mortgage lenders because financial institutions that provide mortgage financing are typically leveraged they have liabilities that are many times their capital the failure of existing borrowers to repay their ans can force the lenders to curtail new lending by multiple of the lost revenue as result the ability of potential house buyers to obtain financing can be reduced when prices fall which can further reduce prices in the current housing market downturn the financial condition of many mortgage lenders and related financial institutions such as fannie mae and freddie mac is significantly troubled 22 moratorium on foreclosures is unlikely to help mortgage lenders except those that might wish to modify loans on wide scale but are uncertain whether and under what terms they may legally do so23 for those lenders and loan servicers with encumbered ownership of their loans they already have the option of delaying foreclosure proceedings one reason for not delaying foreclosure is that the declining housing market is already eroding their capital position and the inability to recover any funds from loan exacerbates their problems24 it is difficult to assess the effect of moratorium on the factors that tend to frustrate stabilization in the housing market in some cases such as the reaction of fencesitters and financial institutions it depends on expectations and calculations that policymakers may not be able to anticipate the primary economic benefit of moratorium in terms of facilitating return to equilibrium in the housing market is that it gives market participants time to evaluate relevant 22 see crs report rl34661 fannie maes and freddie macs financial problems by n

uncertainty is one of the factors contributing to continued instability in mortgage markets and the financial system it is difficult in the present circumstances to know if loan servicers have the capacity to conduct effective loss mitigation including alternatives to foreclosure in the face of rapidly rising delinquency rates and falling house prices press releases by the hope now alliance coalition of loan servicers and counselors list hundreds of thousands of loan workouts but it is difficult to know if these are actions merely begun or actions completed 25 g14g152g138g151g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g155g156g561 uncertainty about the value of houses in declinin g markets for example complicates the ability of loan servicers to evaluate the returns to loan modification compared with completing the foreclosure process similarly uncertainty about home values also complicates the funding of new loans that could serve to bring buyers back into the marketplace because lenders generally raise qualification standards and down payment requirements if they believe house prices might fall after the loan is finalized26 in addition to uncertainty about the value of homes loan servicers had period of uncertainty with regard to the extent of their discretion to modify loans in anticipation of payment problems innovations in financial services had allowed for fracturing of ownership of the loans with the result that there was not single lender to authorize changes in loss mitigation strategies this may have resulted in overreliance on loanbyloan loss mitigation efforts instead of greater use of broadbased action for loan categories experiencing delinquencies on large scale over the past year some of this uncertainty has been reduced by series of industry standards securities and exchange commission sec announcements and internal revenue service irs rulings 27 given these recent developments it is difficult to establish

balance to be reduced to 90 of the current appraised value but one can know the current appraised value without conducting new appraisal without knowing this new balance troubled borrowers may not be

need information on current house prices as determined by host of new appraisals the shelflife of an estimate of an areas house prices might not be very long in areas with rapidly declining prices therefore it may be difficult at least on large scale to get information on current house prices to determine new balances under the voluntary fha program depending on their assessment of house prices banks may wish to pursue their own broadbased alternatives such as the one put forward by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic rather than participate in the new fha program even if the banks decide to forgo the foreclosure process 28 similarly the willingness of banks to lend to new customers in an area depends on the banks changing perception of the area

late 1970s falling house prices on national scale was more common prior to world war ii in part because inflation generally adds to the home equity of borrowers with traditional 30year fixed rate mortgages and holds down foreclosure rates it has been several generations since there has been call for mortgage moratorium on national scale there have been localized programs for natural disasters

feedback loop between mortgage defaults and financial market turmoil reported efforts of market participants to address unsold inventories and economic analysis of the mortgage moratoriums during the period mortgage defaults and financial turmoil feedback in the 1930s in drawing lessons from the great depression bernanke says that major aspect of the financial crisis one that is currently neglected by historians was the pervasiveness of debtor insolvency given that debt contracts were written in nominal terms the protracted fall in prices and money greatly increased debt burdens 29 bernanke goes on to explain how debtor insolvency also caused problems for lenders contributed to banking crisis and ultimately damaged the ability of financial markets to provide credit intermediation in bernankes analysis when wave of insolvencies causes big shock to the lending system the cost of credit intermediation the ability to distinguish good borrowers from bad borrowers 30 rises and provides separate nonmonetary channel through which problems in the banking sector can negatively affect the real economy bernanke cites depressionera sources who say that the extrao rdinary rate of default on residential mortgages forced banks and life insurance companies to practically stop making mortgage loans except for renewals31 bernanke concludes that economic institutions matterthat institutions which evolve and perform well in normal times may become counterproductive during periods when exogenous shocks or policy mistakes drive the economy off course some might consider the modern day rise and fall of the securitization of mortgages as another example of shock to credit intermediation32 for example laura kodres division chief in the international monetary funds monetary and capital markets department is one of many critics of the originate to distribute model of mortgage finance she attributes some of the lax underwriting during the boom to supervisors had insufficient information and clout to halt the proliferation of overpriced securities thus competitive pressures to issue and sell these types of products were so intense thatas charles prince chairman and chief executive officer of citigroup told reporter in early july that yeartop management felt that as long as the music is playing youve got to get up and dance 33 the securitization system which appeared to work well during the housing boom appears to have become counterproductive since housing markets have declined global collateralized debt obligation cdo issuance was 62 lower in the second half of 2007 than in the second half of 2006 34 this decline in securitization occurred despite the federal reserve lowering the fed funds rate 25 basis points between august 2006 and august 200735 even borrowers with good credit are reporting problems in obtaining loans efforts to stabilize markets by preventing price declines during the great depression some believed that the way to recovery was to hold products off the market to slow down price 29 ben bernanke nonmonetary effects of the financial crisis american economic review vol 73 june 1983 30 in this context good and bad

perversefarmers stopping their neighbors milk wagons and dumping out the milk for example36 reducing inventory to support prices was also one of the justifications for paying farmers to reduce the amount of acreage under cultivation few observers believe that depressionera price supports were effective in facilitating recovery of individual markets37 in the current housing market there have been several efforts to reduce the number of properties for sale and support prices for example some state and local governments have programs to acquire foreclosed properties and the recently passed omnibus housing bill has provisions for community developm ent block grant funds to be used to acquire vacant properties 38 moratorium on foreclosures may give state and local governments more time to remove vacant properties to try to support prices economic analysis of depressionera mortgage moratoriums between 1932 and 1934 25 states passed moratoriums on the foreclosure of mortgages economists might argue that interference with lenders ability to recover loan collateral will tend to either reduce the amount of lending or raise interest rates on new loans economist lee alston examined the economic effects of the 1930s moratorium legislation alston found that some borrowers gained from the temporary reprieve but that this reprieve was at the expense of private creditors and prospective farmers who were precluded from securing credit to purchase farm because of the increased costs to private creditors39 he arrived at this result by examining whether the quantity of private loans fell or the interest rates on loans rose in states that passed moratoriums relative to states that did not controlling for other credit market factors he found that the quantity of private loans fell and that interest rates rose under variety of model specifications criticism of the depression analogy some would argue that evidence from depressionera moratoriums is not necessarily the best analogy as discussed above farm mortgages were often the primary source of family income so that fa lling commodity prices simultaneously reduced the value of the farm and the ability to make mortgage payments unlike the present situation in which an individual households income is largely divorced from house prices although aggregate regional income may affect regional house prices similarly depression era efforts to support prices by reducing supply were largely directed at commodity prices not house prices also the basic macroeconomic policy approach to recovery especially the modern bias toward inflation and expansionary monetary policy as response to recessions may make evidence from prior periods less relevant finally institutions for financial markets have changed significantly including greater reliance on global sources of funding and more alternatives for federal subsidies since the depression so alstons eviden ce may apply to system that is longer in place finally current moratoriums are being considered to give both borrowers and lenders more 36 for one personal story of the farm holiday movement see the interview of harry terrell in studs terkel hard times an oral

disruptions of traditional communications can add to the obvious difficulties of distressed residents to meet their mortgage payments on time in these situations it is not uncommon for there to be temporary reprieve of debt obligations until normalcy can be restored one example of this wa s moratorium on foreclosures of fhainsured mortgages in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita 40 as in most natural disasters the event that caused the communications disruption also reduced the ability of families to raise funds to pay their mortgages and destroyed some of the housing stock in the case of hurricanes katrina and rita flooding reportedly damaged 12 million housing units of those 300000 were seriously damaged or destroyed41 the longterm impact on some communities was severe and in some cases outmigration may have permanently reduced the local population42 these shocks to both the supply and demand of housing have left an area that arguably remains in disequilibrium the moratorium likely provided time for affected re sidents to determine if they wished to make longterm commitment such as home ownership to the affected region some aspects of the natural disaster analogy seem to fit the current housing market and some do not if forecasts of the inability of many borrowers to meet higher payments after initial reset are accurate then some would argue that the schedule of resetting mortgages represents an approaching tsunami of mortgage defaults43 in this view traditional avenues of communication between borrowers and servicers are inadequate to handle the volume of renegotiations necessary to modify loans prior to severe delinquency most loans that become more than 90 days late never again become current in part because of the time constraint the fdic has recommended simply writing down loan balances masse to more affo rdable payments to keep current borrowers in their homes and prevent more housing units to be added to unsold inventory through the foreclosure process 44 40 hud repeatedly extended forbearance and moratorium on fha insured mortgage foreclosures in the hurricane affected region see for example mortgagee letter 200605 february 3

appropriate unlike natural disaster neither the housing stock nor the communications network have been damaged beyond the control of market participants rather borrowers in some cases avoid communications with loan servicers who try to contact them similarly some loan servicers might try to contact borrowers but then avoid negotiating more lenient terms both because it might make it more likely that other borrowers will seek more lenient terms borrowers who do not necessarily have an affordability problem and because reputation for lowering balances may be bad for bidding for future loan servicing contracts unlike in natural disaster it could be argued that borrowers and lenders are in position to bargain g17g157g145g142g155g561g7g161g138g150g153g149g142g156g561 the great depression and hurricanes katrina and rita are arguably the two extremesan extreme macroeconomic collapse on the one hand and extreme natural disasters on the other the historical record of moratoriums on debt collections is extensive for example the may 1933 edition of the harvard law review contains comparative study of moratorium legislation 45 historic examples include court case of demo sthenes regarding general prohibition on debt collection actions against greek soldiers away at war general moratorium decreed by the emperor justinian when the franks invaded italy and sicily and many other moratoriums during wars providing moratorium on debt recovery has not been confined to periods of war many us states attempted to provide moratoriums during times of economic stress in the 1800s excluding war years the article lists 20 instances in which states tried to impose moratoriums on debt collections many of these attempts by states were found to be unconstitutional but such restrictions would not necessarily apply to the federal government 46 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 edward v murphy analyst in
