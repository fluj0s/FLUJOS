g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the us department of agricult ure usda is responsible for conducting agricultural research at the federal level and for providing partial support for cooperative research extension and postsecondary agricultural education programs in the states this mission area of usda is called research extension and economics ree in addition to research in the biological sciences the mission also includes substantial economic data collection and analysis1 the state partners are the colleges of agriculture at land grant universities in 50 states and eight us territories with their affiliated state agricu ltural experiment stations schools of forestry and veterinary medicine and cooperative extension there also are 18 historically black land grant colleges of agriculture the 1890 institutions and more than 30 native american colleges that gained land grant status in 1994 referred to as the tribal colleges small grant programs have supported agricultural education at hispanicservi ng institutions and at alaskan and hawaiian nativeserving institutions the omnibus farm bill enacted may 22 2008 also extends eligibility for certain research education and extension programs to nonland grant institutions that offer degree programs in agriculture g13g142g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 usda differs from other federal research agencies in allocating the majority of its annual research appropriation directly to inhouse research ars ers and nass most federal science agencies primarily fund extramural research through competitive peerreviewed grant process the national academy of sciences nas has recommended for more than decade that at least 35 of total usda research money be distributed competitively when the academy first made its recommendation in 1989 it determined that less than 6 of usdas research funding was competitively awarded in fy2006 it wa s approximately 14 according to crs calculations the primary and longeststanding mechanisms for distributing annual federal appropriations to the colleges of agriculture at the state land grant universities are contained in the hatch act of 1887 for cooperative research and smithlever act of 1914 for extension activities formulas set forth in each of these acts determine how annual federal appropriations are divided among states the majority of funding for statelevel programs however comes from state appropriations competitive grants from usda nd other federal agencies and private industry states are required to match hatch and smithlever formula funds most states appropriate three to four times the federal allotment nonetheles s despite the fact that federal formula funds represent only small percentage of total funding at the state level they traditionally have been viewed by state research and extension directors as very reliable source of support for their core programs 1 under the ree mission the usda is responsible for conducting agricultural research at the federal level and for providing partial support for cooperative research extension and postsecondary agricultural education programs in the states the usdas intramural activities are carried out by the agricultural research service ars economic research service ers and national agricultural statistics service nass the federally funded extramural activities are managed by the cooperative state research ducation and extension service csrees for additional background information on the ree mission area see crs report rl33327 agricultural research education and

research education and extension programs as part of omnibus farm bills since 1977 permanent authority for most of the programs resides in older laws but the farm bill renews the authorization for appropriations to address the challenges posed by the perceived need to increase competitive grants in agriculture several major proposals released in advance of congressional debate on the research title recommended significant changes in how ars and csrees are structured and administered g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g561

proposed to rename the researc h education and extension mission area the office of science and to merge ars and cs rees into single agency conducting both intramural and extramural programs under the leadership of chief scientist the proposal called for the current formulafunded authorities to be retained ers and nass would be the other two agencies also under the office of science the administration maintained that an integration of budgets and programs would provide more efficient and effective program implementation and resource allocation in its call for unified budget and single scientific agency this proposal mirrored some of the key aspects of the land grant systems create21 proposal see below 2

commissioned task force to conduct review and evaluation of the merits of establishing one or more national institutes focused on disciplines important to the progress of food and agricultural sciences among other things the task force recommendations released in july 2004 called for the formation of national institute for food and agriculture nifa within usda to supplement and enhance not replace the existing research programs the task force conceived of the nifa as separate entity solely for awarding competitive peerreviewed grants and called for an annual budget for the institute to build to 1 billion over fiveyear period3 the task force proposal was reflected in companion house and senate bills prior to c ongressional activity on drafting farm bill hr 2118 c petersons 971 bond

agencies called for the president to submit unified annual budget reflecting the total amount requested for each of two categories of mission area programs the first category called capacitybuilding programs would include all of the formulafunded programs support for research at the tribal colleges the 1890 colleges the hispanicserving institutions and other selected programs the second budget category called competitive programs administered by the new nifa would reflect the total amount requested for all programs that distribute funds through peerreviewed competitive processes the house bill provided substantial amount of mandatory research funding totaling 865 million over the fiveyear life of the farm bill the existing organic research and extension initiative would receive 25 million in total mandatory funds for fy2008fy2012 and 25 million in annual appropriations authority for fy2009fy2012 new specialty crop research initiative would receive total of 215 million in

institute of food and agriculture the institute would plan coordinate and manage all existing extramural usda research education and extension funds competitive grants capacitybuilding grants and formula funds the nifa director would report directly to the secretary of agriculture not through the under secretary the bill explicitly directed the under secretary to coordinate research between ars and nifa and to recommend funding for all the programs within usdas research mission area the senate bill provided 160 million in mandatory research funding over the fiveyear life of the farm bill this bill would reauthorize the organic research and extension initiative with 16 million in annual mandatory funds for fy2008fy2012 new specialty crop research initiative would receive 16 million in
