is significant internet copyright case arising from the ninth circuit court of appeals there the court addressed the interface between the publics fair use rights and two of copyright holders exclusive rightsthose of reproduction and public display g8g138g140g157g158g138g149g561g138g151g141g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g138g149g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 in kelly the defendant arriba operated visual search engine that allowed users to search for and retrieve images from the internet to provide this functionality arriba developed computer program that would crawl the internet searching for images to index it would then download fullsized copies of those images onto arribas server and generate lower resolution thumbnails once the thumbnails were created the program deleted the fullsized originals from the server arriba altered its display format several times in response to search query the search engine produced results page which listed of number of reduced thumbnail images when user would doubleclick these images fullsized version of the image would appear from january 1999 to june 1999 the fullsized images were produced by inline linking process that retrieved the fullsized image from the original website and displayed it on the arriba web page from july 1999 until sometime after august 2000 the results page contained thumbnails accompanied by source link and details link the details link produced separate screen containing the thumbnail image and link to the originating site clicking the source link would produce two new windows on top of the arriba page the window in the forefront contained the fullsized image imported directly from the originating website underneath that was another window displaying the originating web page this technique is known as framing where an image from second website is viewed within frame that is pulled into the primary 1 336 f3d 811 9th cir 2003

sent to the originating site via an out line link link that directs the user from the linkingsite to the linkedto site2 arribas crawler copied 35 of kellys copyrighted photographs into the arriba database kelly sued arriba for copyright infringement complaining of arribas thumbnails as well as its inline and framing links the district court ruled that arribas use of both the thumbnails and the full sized images was fair use3 kelly appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals g22g145g142g561g16g146g151g157g145g561g5g146g155g140g158g146g157g514g156g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g561 on appeal the ninth circuit affirmed the district courts finding that the reproduction of images to create the thumbnails and their display by arribas search engine was fair use but it reversed the lower court holding that arribas inline display of the larger image was fair use as well4 thumbnails an owner of copyright has the exclusive right to reproduce copies of the work5 to establish claim of copyright infringement by reproduction the plaintiff must show ownership of the copyright and copying by the defendant there was dispute that kelly owned the copyright to the images and that arriba copied those images therefore the court ruled kelly established prima facie case of copyright infringement 6 however claim of copyright infringement is subject to certain statutory exceptions including the fair use exception7 this exception permits courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when on occasion it would stifle the very creativity which that statute is designed to foster8 to determine whether arribas use of kellys images was fair use the court weighed four statutorilyprescribed factors 1 the purpose and character of the use including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes9 2 the nature of the copyrighted work 3 the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as whole and 4 the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work10 2 arriba soft subsequently ch anged its name to dittocom 3 kelly v arriba soft corp 77 f supp 2d 1116 cd cal 1999 4 an earlier decision subsequently withdrawn by the ninth circuit court of appeals and often referred to in judicial opinions as kelly i held that the inline display of the larger image of kellys work was not fair use and was therefore infringing kelly v arriba soft corp 280 f3d 934 9th cir 2002 in its revise d opinion referred to as kelly ii discussed above the court determined that the issue of inline linking had not been adequately raised by the parties and should not have been decided by the district court 5 see 17 usc 106 6 kelly 336 f3d at 817 7 17 usc 107 8 dr seuss enters lp v penguin books usa inc 109 f3d 1394 1399 9th cir 1997 9 the supreme court has held that the central purpose of this investigation is to see whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation or instead adds something new with further purpose or different character altering the first with new expression meaning or message it asks in other words whether and to what extent the new work is transformative campbell v acuffrose music inc 510 us 569 579 1994 10 17 usc 107

the new work the less important the other factors including commercialism become11 and held that the thumbnails were transformative because they were much smaller lowerresolution images that served an entirely different function than kellys original images12 furthermore it would be unlikely that anyone would use arribas thumbnails for illustrative or aesthetic purposes because enlarging them sacrifices their clarity the court found13 thus the first fair use factor weighed in favor of arriba the court held that the second factor the nature of the copyrighted work weighed slightly in favor of kelly because the photographs were creative in nature14 the third factor the amount and substantiality of the portion used was deemed not to weigh in either partys favor even though arriba copied the entire image15 finally the court held that the fourth factor the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work weighed in favor of arriba the fourth factor required the court to consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant would result in substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original16 the court found that arribas creation and use of the thumbnails would not harm the market for or value of kellys images17 accordingly on balance the court found that the display of the thumbnails was fair use g8g146g142g149g141g561g159g495g561g9g152g152g144g149g142 g497g561g5g138g140g145g146g151g144g561 in field v google 18 us district court considered claim for copyright infringement against the internet search engine google field sought statutory damages and injunctive relief against google for permitting internet users to access copies of images temporarily stored on its online 11 kelly 330 f3d at 818 n 14 citing campbell 510 us at 579 12 kelly 330 f3d at 818 while kellys images were artistic works used for illustrative purposes and to portray scenes from the american west in an aesthetic manner arribas use of kellys images in the thumbnails was unrelated to any aesthetic purpose arribas search engine functions as tool to help index and improve access to images on the internet and their related websites 13 id at 819 14 id at 820 15 while wholesale copying does not preclude fair use per copying an entire work militates against finding of fair use however the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use if the secondary user only copies as much as is necessary for his or her intended use then this factor will not weigh against him or her id at 821 applying this principle the court found that if arriba only copied part of the image it would be more difficult to identify it thereby reducing the usefulness of the visual search engine therefore the court concluded it was reasonable to copy the entire image 16 id at 821 citing campbell 510 us at 590 see also 3 m nimmer d nimmer n immer on copyright 1305a4 at 1310261 1993 17 kelly 330 f3d at 821 the court emphasized that arribas use of kellys images would not harm kellys ability to sell or license his fullsized images arriba does not sell or license its thumbnails to other parties anyone who downloaded the thumbnails would not be successful selling the fullsized images because of the lowresolution of the thumbnails there would be way to view create or sell clear fullsized image without going to kellys websites id at 821822 18

google the court explained the caching process there are billions of web pages accessible on the internet it would be impossible for google to locate and index or catalog them manually accordingly google like other search engines uses an automated program called the googlebot to continuously crawl across the internet to locate and analyze available web pages and to catalog those web pages into googles searchable web index as part of this process google makes and analyzes copy of each web page that it finds and stores the html code from those pages in temporary repository called cache once google indexes and stores web page in the cache it can include that page as appropriate in the search results it displays to users in response to their queries when google displays web pages in its search results the first item appearing in each result is the title of web page which if clicked by the user will take the user to the online location of that page the title is followed by short snippet from the web page in smaller font following the snippet google typically provides the full url for the page then in the same smaller font google often displays another link labeled cached when clicked the cached link directs an internet user to the archival copy of web page stored in googles system cache rather than to the original web site for that page by clicking on the cached link for page user can view the snapshot of that page as it appeared the last time the site was visited and analyzed by the googlebot 19 the court emphasized that there are numerous indus trywide mechanisms such as metatags for website owners to use communicate with internet search engines owners can instruct crawlers or robots not to analyze or display site in its web index owners posting on the internet can use googlespecific noarchive metatag to instruct the search engine not to provide cached links to website in view of these wellestablished means for communicating with internet search engines the court concluded that the plaintiff decided to manufacture claim for copyright infringement against google in the hopes of making money from googles standard practice 20 despite its acknowledgment of the plaintiffs rather dubious motives the court nevertheless discussed the merits of the copyright infringement claims specifically the plaintiff did not claim that google committed infringement when the googlebot made initial copies of fields copyrighted web pages and stored them in its cache rather the alleged infringing activity occurred when google user clicked on cached link to the web page and downloaded copy of those pages from googles computers assuming for the purposes of summary judgment that googles display of cached links to fields work did constitute direct copyright in fringement the court considered four defenses raised by google and found in its favor on all counts implied license first the court found that the plaintiff had granted google an implied nonexclusive license to display the work because consent to use the copyrighted work need not be manifested verbally and may be inferred based on silence where the copyright holder knows of 19 id at

the search engine not to cache could reasonably be interpreted as grant of license for that use estoppel the court invoked the facts supporting its finding of an implied license to support the equitable argument that field was precluded from asserting copyright claim the court reiterated that field could have prevented the caching did not do so and allowed google to detrimentally rely on the absence of metatags had google known the defendants objection to displaying cached versions of its website it would not have done so fair use in detailed analysis the court concluded that googles cache satisfies the statutory criteria for fair use purpose and character of use the search engines use of the protected material is transformative rather than serving an artistic function its display of the images served an archival function allowing users to access content when the original page is inaccessible nature of the copyrighted works even assuming the copyrighted images are creative field published his works on the internet making them available to world for free he added code to his site to ensure that all search engines would include his website in their search listings amount and substantiality of the use the court found that googles display of entire web pages in its cached links serves multiple transformative and socially valuable purposes it cited the us supreme courts decision in sony corp v universal studios inc 22 and kelly supra as examples where copying of an entire work is fair use the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work although the plaintiff distributed his images on the internet for free he argued that googles activity undercut licensing fees that he could potentially develop by selling access to cached links to his website the court found that there was evidence of an existing or developing market for licensing search engines the right to allow access to web pages through cached links good faith in addition to the statutory criteria of 17 usc 107 the court considered equitable factors and found the google operates in good faith because it honors industrywide protocols to refrain from caching where so instructed conversely the plaintiff deliberately ignored the protocols available to him in order to establish claim for copyright infringement the digital millennium copyright act dmca finally the court held that google is protected by the safe harbor provision of the dmca which states that service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief for infringement of copyright by reason of the intermediate and temporary storage of material on system or netw ork controlled or operated by or for the service provider 23 21 id at 1116 22 464 us 417 1984holding that inhome

amazoncom the ninth circuit revisited and expanded upon several of the issues that it had considered earlier in kelly perfect 10 company that markets and sells copyrighted images of nude models filed actions to enjoin google and amazoncom from infringing its copyrighted photographs specifically it sought to prevent googles display of thumbnail images on its image search function and to prevent both google and amazon from linking to thirdparty websites that provided fullsized infringing versions of the images the district court found that inline linking and framing were permissible noninfringing uses of protected content therefore it did not enjoin go ogle from linking to thirdparty websites that display fullsized infringing versions of the images holding that perfect 10 was not likely to prevail on its claim that google violated its di splay or distribution rights by linking to these images but the district court did enter preliminary injunction against google for its creation and public display of the thumbnail versions of perfect 10s images in separate action the court declined to preliminarily enjoin amazoncom from giving users access to similar information provided to amazoncom by google the court of appeals affirmed the district courts holding with respect to the permissibility of in line linking and framing but it reversed the holding with respect to the use of thumbnail images finding the use to be fair despite the potential of the thumbnails to encroach upon potential commercial market for their use it left open the questions of possible liability for contributory copyright infringement andor immunity therefor under the dmca remanding the case to the district court for appropriate findings these decisions are examined below 24

district court considered the issue of thumbnails in different context from that of kelly perfect 10 p10 publishes an adult magazine and operates subscription website that features copyrighted photographs of nude models its proprietary website is not available to public search othe r websites however display without permission images and content from p10 google in response to image search inquiries displayed thumbnail copies of p10s photos and linked to the thirdparty websites which hosted and served the fullsized infringing images p10 filed suit against google claiming among other things direct contributory and vicarious copyright infringement as framed by the district court the issues before it pitted ip rights against the dazzling capacity of internet technology to assemble organize store access and display intellectual property content the issue in nutshell is does search engine infringe copyrighted images when it displays them on an image search function in the form of thumbnails but not infringe when through inline linking it displays copyrighted images served by another website 26 24 although google and amazoncom were separately named defendants in actions that were subsequently consolidated the issues examined and the majority of the courts analyses focus on the issues as they relate to google as does this report 25 416 f supp2d 828 cdca 2006 affd in part

inline linking to and framing of infringing fullsize images posted on thirdparty websites was not infringing but that its display of thumbnail images was likely to be considered infringing27 linking and framing with respect to inline linking and framing of fullsize images from third party websites the court considered not whether the activity was infringing but more preliminary question is linking or framing display for copyright purposes if it does not come within the ambit of the copyright holders exclusive rights it is not necessary to reach the question of copyright infringement linking is basic function of the internet the term hyperlinking is used to describe text or images that when clicked by user transport him to different webpage inline linking is somewhat different it refers to the process whereby webpage incorporates by reference content stored on and served by another website the parties before the court offered two theories for considering whether inline linking is display the server test advocated by google and the incorporation test advocated by p10 the server test defines display as the act of serving content over the web ie physically sending ones and zeroes over the internet to the users browser 28 the incorporation test would adopt visual perspective wherein display occurs from the act of incorporating content into webpage that is pulled up by the browser p10 argued that the webpage that incorporates the content through inline linking causes the appearance of copyrighted content and is therefore displaying it for copyright purposes regardless of where it is stored reviewing precedent the court acknowledged that there is substantial authority to the effect that traditional hyperlinking does not support claims of direct copyright infringement because there is copying or display involved 29 but there is little discussion of inline linking30 the court adopted the server test and held that site that inline links to another does not itself display the content for copyright purposes among the reasons given for its determination is that the server test is more technologically appropriate and better reflects the reality of how content travels over the internet further it viewed the server test as liability neutral application of the test doesnt invite infringing activities by search engines nor does it preclude all liability it would more narrowly preclude arch engines from being held directly liable for inline linking andor framing infringing content stored on thirdparty websites 31 the direct infringers were the websites that stole p10s fullsize images and posted them on the internet finally the court reasoned that the server test maintains however uneasily the delicate balance for which copyright law strives ie between encouraging the creation of creative works and encouraging the dissemination of information merely to index the web so that users can more readily find the 27 because the action before the court was motion for preliminary injunction the court cast its findings as probabilities of success on the various claims 28 id at 839 29 id at 842 30 the ninth circuit found it to be

host and serve infringing content may directly violat the rights of copyright holders32 thumbnail images applying the server test to the thumbnail images it was clear that google did display them google acknowledged that it copied and stored them on its own servers the issue then became like that in kelly whether googles use of p10s images as thumbnails was fair use analyzing statutory fair use criteria the court concluded that googles use of the thumbnails was not fair use purpose and character of use googles use of the thumbnails was commercial use it derived commercial benefit in the form of increased user traffic and advertising revenue in kelly the court of appeals acknowledged that arribas use of thumbnails was commercial yet concluded that search results were more incidental and less exploitative than other traditional commercial uses here the commercial nature of googles use was distinguishable because google derived specific revenue from an ad sharing program with the thirdparty websites that hosted the infringing images p10 had entered into licensing agreement with others for the sale and distribution of its reduced size images for download to and use on cell phones significant factor supporting finding of fair use is courts determination that the use is transformative discussed supra although the court found that googles use of thumbnails to simplify and expedite access to information was transformative it found it to be consumptive as well ie the use merely supersedes the object of the original instead of adding further purpose or different character googles thumbnails superceded or usurped the market for the sale of reducedsize images because cell phone users could download and save the images directly from google nature of the copyrighted works use of published works including images are more likely to qualify as fair use because the first appearance of the creative expression has already occurred amount and substantiality of the use as in kelly the court found that google used more of the image than necessary to achieve the objective of providing effective imagesearch capability the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work while googles use of thumbnails did not harm the market for copyrighted fullsize images it did cause harm to the potential market for sales of p10s reducedsize images to cell phone users the court also considered and rejected p10s allegation that google was guilty of contributory and vicarious copyright infringement liability

users to believe they are viewing google web page when in fact google through html instructions has directed the users browser to the website publishers computer that stores the image but the copyright act unlike the trademark act does not protect copyright holder against acts that may cause consumer confusion33 the same logic obtains with respect to the display of cached webpages even if the cache copies are longer available on the thirdpartys website it is the website publishers computer not googles that stores and displays the infringing cached image burden of proof in establishing the fair use defense before reviewing the district courts conclusion regarding googles fair use defense the appellate court first dealt with the question of which party bears the burden of proving an affirmative defense such as fair use on motion for preliminary injunction in copyright infringement case the ninth circuit court of appeals had not previously conclusively ruled on this issue 34 the appellate court disagreed with the district courts holding that p10 had the burden of demonstrating its likely success in overcoming the fair use defense raised by google the court of appeals ruled that at trial the defendant in an infringement action bears the burden of proving fair use35 thus once perfect 10 had shown likelihood of success on the merits the burden should have shifted to google to show that its affirmative defense of fair use will succeed the appellate court explained that the district court was in error for placing the burden with respect to the fair use defense on the party seeking preliminary injunction in copyright infringement case 36 thumbnail images the district court was also in error regarding its determination that googles display of thumbnail images was not fair use in reversing the lower courts decision on fair use the court of appeals reconsidered the weight to be accorded to the statutory factors it differed with the district courts analysis regarding character of use and market impact purpose and character of use the court laid major emphasis and weight on the transformative nature of search engines display as an electronic reference tool although an image may have been created originally to serve an entertainment aesthetic or informative function search engine transforms the image into pointer directing user to source of information search engine provides social benefit by incorporating an original work into new work namely an electronic reference tool in other words search engine puts images in different contex t so that they are transformed into new creation 37 the court considered the judicial rule that parody is fair use and concluded that indeed search engine may be more transformative than parody because search engine provides an 33 perfect 10 inc v amazoncom inc 508 f3d 1146 1161 9th cir 2007 34 the appellate court had previously used qualified language in addressing this issue thereby not reaching

the same entertainment purpose as the original work38 the fact that google profited from its adsense advertising program and that p10s market for the sale of thumbnail images could be superceded by the google display did not outweigh the public interest value of the transformative use in the courts opinion it noted the absence of evidence that downloads of thumbnails for mobile phone use actually occurred hence the courts analysis of thumbnails from kelly was controlling accordingly we disagree with the district cour ts conclusion that because googles use of the thumbnails could supersede perfect 10s cell phone download use and because the use was more commercial than arribas this fair use factor weighed slightly in favor of perfect 10 instead we conclude that the transformative nature of googles use is more significant than any incidental superseding use or the minor commercial aspects of googles search engine and website therefore the district court erred in determining this factor weighed in favor of perfect 10 39 effect of use on the market similarly with respect to p10s market for the sale of its fullsized images the court rejected the argument that market harm may be presumed if the intended use of an image is for commercial gain market harm to copyright holder will not be readily inferred when an arguably infringing use is otherwise tr ansformative and since the potential harm to the market for the sale of thumbnails was hypothetical the court concluded that the significant transformative use outweighed the unproven use of googles thumbnails for cell phone downloads it vacated the district courts preliminary injunction regarding googles use of thumbnails likewise the copying function related to caching of fullsized images performed automatically is transformative and ultimately fair use so long as the cache copies more than necessary to assist the internet user and the copying has more than minimal effect on the owners right while having considerable public benefit 40 secondary liability the court of appeals opinion devotes considerable attention to the question of googles possible liability for secondary copyright infringement that is contributory andor vicarious infringement it was uncontested that thirdparty websites were posting infringing copies of p10s images the court rejected the assertion that googles automatic caching of copies of fullsized images from thirdparty sites was direct infringement but it reversed the district courts determination that p10 was not likely to succeed with claim for secondary liability against google and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of its opinion as defined by the supreme court one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement and infringes vi cariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise right to stop or limit it 41 as applied by the ninth circuit computer

provide access to infringing works42 the court of appeals first considered whether google intentionally encouraged infringement the district court held that google did not materially contribute to infringing conduct because it did not undertake any substantial promotional or advertising efforts to encourage visits to infringing websites nor provide significant revenues to the infringing websites43 but the court of appeals disagreed reasoning there is dispute that google substantially assists websites to distribute their infringing copies to worldwide market and assists worldwide audience of users to access infringing materials we cannot discount the effect of such service on copyright owners even though googles assistance is available to all websites not just infringing ones applying our test google could be held contributorily liable if it had knowledge that infringing perfect 10 images were available using its search engine could take simple measures to prevent further damage to perfect 10s copyrighted works and failed to take such steps 44 with respect to vicarious infringement plaintiff must establish that the defendant exercises the requisite control over the direct infringer and that the defendant derives direct financial benefit from the direct infringement 45 the court found that p10 did not demonstrate that google has the legal right to stop or limit direct infringement by thirdparty websites because the district court determined that p10 was unlikely to succeed on its contributory and vicarious liability claims it did not reach googles arguments that it qualified for immunity from liability under the dmca 17 usc 512 the district court was directed to consider whether google was entitled to the limitations on liability provided by title ii of the dmca on remand g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 it is coincidence that search engines are frequentlynamed defendants in online copyright infringement litigation their role in internet

internet they must factor in its functionality and architecture in kelly the ninth circuit grappled with the concept of displaying thumbnail images as search tool it found the use to be highly transformative socially valuable and fair but reserved judgment on the questions of inline linking and framing in field the district court considered caching finding it to be fair as well of great significance to the court was the fact that content owners can control the ability of search engines to search andor cache their websites in perfect 10 the ninth circuit considered thumbnail displays in different context namely where search engine displays thumbnails of infringing images and derives advertising revenue that is more closely linked to the posting although plaintiff had persuaded the lower court that the thumbnails though transformative of the fullsize images could or would undermine developing market for reducedsize images the court of appeals reaffirmed the fair use analysis derived from kelly and it took up where kelly left off holding that inline linking and framing were not displays for copyright purposes but the court left open the possibility that search engines actual conduct with respect to infringing content could be proven to be contributory infringement taken together these cases indicate willingness by the courts to acknowledge the social utility of online indexing and factor it into fair use analysis to adapt copyright law to the core functionality and purpose of internet even when that means requiring content owners to act affirmatively such as by the use of metatags and to weigh and balance conflicts between useful functions such as online indexing and caching against emerging viable new markets for content owners
