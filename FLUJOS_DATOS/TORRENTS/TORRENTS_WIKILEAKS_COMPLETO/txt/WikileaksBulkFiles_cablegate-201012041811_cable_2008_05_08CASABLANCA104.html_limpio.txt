270 classified by principal officer douglas greene for reasons 14 b and d 1 sbu summary in casablanca moroccos largest city and economic capital prosperity is increasingly on display raising the question of where it comes from family money the banking and real estate sectors and strongperforming stock market account for some wealth remittances from moroccans living abroad tourism and foreign investment especially from gulf countries comprise the major external sources of money illicit sources of income including drug trafficking money laundering and endemic corruption play role in the growing economy as well increased consumption has been boon to the economy but casablancas wealth must be shared more broadly to benefit all segments of society end summary internal sources of wealth 2 sbu the easilyobservable phenomenon of wealth in casablanca begs the question of where the money comes from many casablancans cite family money as one key contributor to the citys affluence according to samir benmakhlouf president of century 21 morocco the textile industry based in fez traditionally drove the moroccan economy in the 1970s and 80s textile producers relocated to casablanca for retail opportunities creating economic momentum and bringing money to the city an article in the middle east report on moroccos bourgeoisie supports this historical view though dates the shift to the end of world war ii the economic center of gravity shifted to the coastal cities especially casablanca enterprising businessmen left fez for casablanca where they continued to be known as fassis even today natives of fez retain their reputation as members of businesssavvy elite one of moroccos richest men othman benjelloun hails from fez and is chairman and ceo of bmce moroccos third largest bank according to bmce employees fez mafia dominates the banks culture benjelloun and others like him belong to longstanding moneyed elite who contribute to casablancas prosperity 3 u the banking sector based in casablanca also generates wealth moroccos 15 banks include five moroccanowned private banks and five foreign banks thanks to expanding geographic networks and increased banking products and services including ebanking mortgages and consumer credit the sector has enjoyed impressive growth overall bank revenues rose 105 percent in 2006 to reach usd 256 billion the same year moroccos banks registered net profits of usd 825 million 68 percent increase over the previous year such strong performance has triggered an increase in hiring particularly of young welleducated moroccans it has also led several of the six banks listed on the casablanca stock exchange to offer employee stock options enabling staff members to share in their banks profitability bmce banks 2007 annual report notes that employees averaged gains of 380 percent from the banks second public offering which is the equivalent of roughly 15 times the net monthly salary such tremendous performance has spillover effect on casablancas economy 4 sbu just as the banking sector contributes to casablancas wealth so does the real estate market due to convergence of factors the scarcity of land in denselypacked casablanca puts property at premium according to the oxford business group the city covers 695 square miles of land but needs over 100 square miles to support the current population of over three million as moroccans have moved from rural areas to casablanca land prices have risen the influx of foreign direct investment fdi compounds this effect of the seven billion dollars of fdi that morocco received in 2007 real estate accounted for 26 percent second only to tourism at 29 percent given that 63 percent of investors find casablanca the most attractive locale for investment in morocco fdi has had significant impact on property values in the city and on the development of market for highend goods and services 5 sbu in such an environment speculation occurs pushing prices upward and enabling landowners to make staggering profits sooner is new master plan for urban development sdau announced than speculators buy up property in targeted areas with the sole intention of flipping them according to century 21s benmakhlouf you can buy property for one million dirham and itll be worth 15 million in six months 6 sbu the tremendous performance of casablancas stock exchange is also factor in wealthcreation according to jawad kerdoudi an economist who is president of the moroccan institute of international casablanca 00000104 002 of 003 relations many companies attract investors by listing shares at weak prices for the initial public offering after few weeks prices shoot up allowing shareholders to sell at considerable profit as moroccos largest city and economic center casablanca sees much of the money that moroccans make in the stock market external sources of wealth 7 u as indicated above casablanca has benefited from an influx of money from outside the country first remittances from moroccans resident abroad mres have risen since mohammed vi became king in 1999 reaching about usd 78 billion in 2007 second tourism brings in significant capital the sector has increased 12 to 14 percent per year since 2001 when the king launched the strategic tourism development policy vision 2010 according to 2007 report issued by casablancas regional investment center tourism accounted for more investment in casablanca than any other sector 8 u foreign investment is third significant source of wealth in casablanca benefiting heavily from rising oil prices oilexporting gulf countries seek substantial investment opportunities in the middle east including casablanca dubai holding for example has begun usd 500 million project to build multipurpose marina adjacent to casablancas port kuwaitimoroccan group has plans for residential development in the city investors outside the gulf are also pursuing financial opportunities in casablanca as money from mres tourism and foreign investors is channeled into banks real estate the stock market and other investments casablancas economy expands illicit sources of wealth 9 c most casablancans acknowledge that at least some of casablancas wealth comes from illicit activities such as drugtrafficking and money laundering in the words of khalid belyazid ceo of the publishing group ecomedias we have dirty money the problem is we dont know how much statistics do not exist to quantify how much of casablancas wealth can be traced to illicit activities however one indication can be found in the usgs own 2007 international narcotics control strategy report morocco is the worlds biggest producer of cannabis resin hashish and is consistently ranked among the worlds largest producers of cannabis the report estimates that moroccos drug trade mostly to europe nets about usd 13 billion per year more than twice the amount brought in by tourism in 2007 some portion of this money finds its way to casablanca where it is either spent on jewelry cars houses and other items or it is laundered referring to the use of cafes as fronts for illegitimate business activities one finance professional joked that money laundering creates nice cafe culture in casablanca 10 c corruption also accounts for certain amount of casablancas wealth you cannot imagine how big the impact is said one longtime resident after explaining the phenomenon of officials exploiting inside information andor power for financial gain in one notorious case police officer created business to import bmw motorcycles after learning that the police force had plans to equip motorcycle brigade century 21s benmakhlouf noted that building permits for land set aside by the city sometimes become available to developers who pay bribes such corruption enables those who benefit from it to amass significant if undeclared wealth 11 sbu the informal economy is yet another vector by which individuals amass wealth while the term conjures up images of smallscale retailers or undocumented laborers it can include fullfledged businesses that operate outside the legal framework and its requirements in moroccos textile industry for example entire plants have closed their formal operations only to reopen outside city limits as allcash enterprises that function under the radar of moroccan authorities or with their complicity the casablanca mattress factory that burned down in late april 2008 killing 58 workers ref offers prime example of situation in which business owner flouted labor safety and building codes in the name of profit 12 c the consulates own experience trying to purchase land for new facility illustrates how entrenched informal underthetable arrangements are in the moroccan economy ninety percent of property transactions in casablanca are done informally of over 30 sites identified more than 20 fell off the list immediately because the brokers were unwilling to sell in an official deal others declined to sell because they are waiting for prices to appreciate of those who would sell many wanted money under the table in addition to the casablanca 00000104 003 of 003 asking price whether selling property running company or starting business the high volume of activity conducted outside of formal channels is part and parcel of doing business and often enables individuals to skirt regulations and increase financial gain consumption 13 sbu explaining the sources of casablancas wealth however does not necessarily explain consumption as khalid rouggani of bmces research division sees it moroccans are cultivated to be open and want to know what exists outside their country as result they are aware of foreign brands and products and willingly purchase them particularly in cosmopolitan casablanca in contrast rouggani cited algeria country with usd 120 billion in reserves that is less open to foreign culture and less apt to consume foreign goods sales clerks at dior and roberto cavalli seemed to support the view that culture plays role in stimulating consumption noting that moroccans like to be stylish and make up the majority of their clientele 14 sbu strict foreign currency exchange controls may also contribute to consumption in casablanca while morocco has loosened restrictions on the amount of currency moroccans can take out of the country external controls are still in place unable to put significant savings overseas many moroccans invest and spend locally 15 c comment the wealth that is evident in casablanca indicates many positive developments including stock market and real estate booms fueled by remittances and strong foreign investment it also suggests some toughtotrack but significant negative elements such as drugtrafficking and deepseated corruption matter what the sources of wealth however the contrasts between rich and poor in casablanca are likely to persist as there are few signs of trickle down if casablancans do not have opportunities to share in the wealth that surrounds them the risk of broader social tensions is likely to increase end comment greene
