ration fda announced the approval of an application to switch plan b an emergency contraceptive from prescriptiononly drug to an overthecounter otc drug for women 18 years of age and older plan b will only be sold in pharmacies or healthcare clinics it will continue to be dispensed as prescription drug for women 17 years old and younger plan b is brand of postcoital contraceptive that is administered within few hours or days of unprotected intercourse emergency contraception prevents pregnancy it does not disrupt an established pregnancy approval of the switch to otc status for plan b has been controversial some members of congress urged the fda to deny otc status for plan b individuals who criticize the threeyear delay in deciding to switch to otc believe that bush administration policy and fda actions were based on political and ideological considerations rather than on sound science conservative religious and prolife groups believe plan b may increase unsafe sexual activity and should be used only under the supervision of healthcare professional and therefore should not be available otc their major concern with plan b however is that it might prevent the implantation of an embryo in the uterus which to prolife groups constitutes abortion however the medical community does not consider prevention of implantation to be an abortion and fda does not classify plan b as an abortion drug emergency contraceptives are currently available without prescription in more than 40 countries according to barr pharmaceuticals sales of plan b in the united states have doubled since august 2006 rising from about 40 million year to what will probably be close to 80 million for 2007 womens health advocates claim that otc status will improve access to the drug thereby reducing the number of unintended pregnancies and reducing the number of abortions however medical literature review published in april 2007 found that advance provision of emergency contraception did not reduce pregnancy rates when compared to conventional provision the interventions tested thus far have not reduced overall pregnancy rates in the populations studied the office of violence against women within the department of justice doj has developed guidelines for the treatment of sexual assault victims the guidelines released in september 2004 have been criticized by numerous organizations because they do not mention offering emergency contraception to female rape victims in january 2005 letter signed by 97 members of congress was sent to the director of the office on violence against women expressing concern over the failure to mention emergency contraception and urging that the guidelines be changed to include such information legislation introduced in the 110 th congress s 21hr

the age restriction booklet will be distributed with plan b that explains proper use of the drug the manufacturer barr pharmaceuticals began shipping the otc version of the drug to us pharmacies early in november 20062 approval of the switch to otc for plan b has been controversial critics believe that initial policy decisions made by the bush administrati on regarding plan b were based on political and ideological considerations rather than on sound science3 conservative religious and prolife groups believe that readily available plan b may increase the occurrence of unsafe sexual activity and that such drug should be used only under the supervision of healthcare professional their primary concern with plan b however is that it might prevent the implantation of the embryo in the uterus which for those who believe human life begins at conception would constitute an abortion however the medical community does not consider prevention of implantation to be an abortion and fda does not classify plan b as an abortion drug although the precise mechanism of action remains undetermined scientific evidence suggests that prevention of ovulation or fertilization is the most likely mode of action for plan b rather than prevention of implantation of developing embryo 4 this report discusses the fda approval of plan b as prescription drug as well as the more recent and controversial fda approval of plan b as an otc drug legal issues regarding the recent fda decision are also discussed as well as various state policies that affect access to emergency contraceptives in addition the report discusses the department of justice guidelines for the treatment of sexual assault victims which have been criticized by numerous organizations because they do not mention offering emergency contraception to female rape victims the doj guidelines were the focus of legislation introduced in the 109 th congress lastly this report discusses the likely impact of the fda

g5g152g151g157g155g138g140g142g153g157g146g152g151g561 emergency contraception is therapy that may prevent pregnancy for women who have had unprotected sexual intercourse there are two methods of emergency contraceptive therapy insertion of an intrauterine devise or iud within five days of intercourse or ingestion of pill containing the hormones commonly found in the contraceptive pill although hormonal emergency contraception is often referred to as the morningafter pill it can be given up to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse and can involve taking more than one pill reasons for using emergency contraception include problems with contraceptive condom breakage missed pill sexual assault or exposure to an agent which may cause birth defect eg live vaccine cytotoxic drug or radiation the current approach to emergency conception began with the recognition in the 1920s that estrogen prevented pregnancy in mammals in the mid1960s dutch physician gave highdose estrogen to 13yearold rape victim in order to prevent pregnancy during the 1960s and 1970s highdose estrogen became the standard emergency contraceptive treatment in the early 1970s canadian physician albert uzpe began studying emergency contraception and published his first study in 1974 the yuzpe method used conventional birth control pills combination of estrogen and progestin taken in two doses 12 hours apart 5 in 1984 the united kingdom became the first country to approve such combination pill regimen as an emergency contraceptive in january 2001 the united kingdom began allowing pharmacies to dispense emergency contraception without prescription6 in april 2005 an emergency contraceptive plan b progestinonly pill was approved by the canadi an government for use by all women without prescription7 emergency contraceptive pills are used by women in more than 100 countries in over 40 countries the pills are sold without prescription either by pharmacist or otc see table 1 below8 t

patients to take multiple pills from standard onecycle oral contraceptive package for emergency contraception this is referred to as an offlabel use of the drug9 on february 25 1997 notice in the federal register stated that the commissioner of fda had concluded that certain oral contraceptives are safe and effective for use as emergency contraception and asked manufacturers to submit new drug application for this use in 1998 fda approved preven for use as an emergency contraceptive available by prescription preven utilized the yuzpe method two pills containing estrogen and progestin taken 12 hours apart 1993 study conducted on about 800 women in hong kong found that use of progestin alone was somewhat more effective for emergency contraception than the yuzpe method and had fewer side effects 10 in 1998 the world health organization who followed up with larger international trial using almost 2000 women comparing the yuzpe method and progestinonly pill11 the who trial found that progestin alone was significantly more effective than the yuzpe method at preventing pregnancy and caused fewer side effects most importantly for either method the who trial found that the earlier the pill is taken the better it works in the who trial the progestinalone regimen re duced the risk of pregnancy by 85 when taken within 72 hours of intercourse progestin prevented 95 of expected pregnancies when taken within 24 hours 85 when taken between 25 nd 48 hours and 58 when taken between 49 and 72 hours in contrast yuzpe reduced the risk of pregnancy by 57 when taken within 72 hours yuzpe prevented 77 of expected pregnancies when taken within 24 hours 36 for 25 to 48 hours and 31 for 49 to 72 hours who also found that the yuzpe method resulted in significantly more side effects than progestin alone the incidence of nausea was 50 with uzpe and 23 with progestin v omiting with yuzpe was 3 times higher than with progestin 19 vs 6 which is significant as women who vomit afte r taking the first combination pill may need to take an extra dose 12 on july 28 1999 fda approved plan b progestinonly emergency contraceptive for use by prescription plan b consists of two pills each containing 075 mg of levonorgestrel progestin 13 one pill is taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse and the second is 9 offlabel use is defined as use for an indication dosage form

it is 89 effective if taken within three days 72 hours after unprotected sex in other words 7 of every 8 women who would have become pregnant will not become pregnant as mentioned earlier plan b is even more effective 95 if taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex g15g142g140g145g138g151g146g156g150g561g152g143g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 in humans the fertile days when sexual intercourse can result in pregnancy include the five days before ovulation release of the egg from the ovary and the day of ovulation although the precise mechanism of action by which plan b prevents pregnancy remains undetermined scientific evidence suggests that prevention of ovulation or fertilization is the most likely mode of action for plan b rather than prevention of implantation 15 the active ingredient in plan b levonorgestrel has been used in birth control pills for more than 35 years emergency contraception is not as effective as the regular use of oral contraceptives however the higher dose of levonorgestrel in plan b works like birth control pill to prevent pregnancy most probably by stopping ovulation several studies indicate that hormonal emergency contraception interferes with the events in the ovary that lead up to release of the egg 16 plan b may also interfere with fertilization by tering the transport of sperm andor egg within the female reproductive system in one study administration of levonorgestrel after sexual intercourse reduced the number of sperm within th uterus increased the ph of the uterine fluid which immobilized sperm and increased the viscosity of cervical mucus which impeded entry of sperm into the uterus17 it is possible that plan b may inhibit implantation of the fertilized egg within the uterus by altering the endometrium the uterine lining three studies of hormonal emergency contraception in human subjects found alterations in the endometrium but whether such changes had an impact on implantation was open to question 18 four other studies found either negligible or alterations in the endometrium however in the case of levonorgestrel publications in refereed journals do not support the hypothesis that it alters endometrial receptivity or impedes implantation19 in addition studies in the rat and monkey indicate that levonorgestrel does not disrupt postfertilization events such as implantation20 continued treatment is 40

implanted in the uterus and therefore cannot interfere with an established pregnancy which is defined as an embryo implanted in uterus plan b is used before pregnancy can be diagnosed plan b does not use the same active ingredient as mifeprex also known as the abortion pill ru486 or mifepristone mifeprex in combination with misoprostol is used after positive pregnancy test to terminate an early pregnancy up through seven weeks21 g5g152g151g157g155g138g146g151g141g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g138g151g141g561g3g141g159g142g155g156g142g561g20g142g138g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 the fact that there are relatively few side effects for plan b was major factor in the approval of otc status for this drug the fdaapproved otc labeling lists known pregnancy and hypersensitivity to any component of the product as contraindications for preven or the yuzpe regimen the fda who and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog list known pregnancy as the only contraindication pregnancy is listed as contraindication only because these drugs wont work to prevent pregnancy if the patient is already pregnant harm will result if pregnant patient takes either pill the fda however lists some relative contraindications based on evidence from combination estrogenprogestin oral contraceptives these include clotting problems stroke and migraine among others which are related to the presence of estrogen in the combination pill 1997 review found that since the uzpe regimen was approved in 1984 in the uk the product was used more than 4 million times only six serious stroke or blood clot events were reporte d and there was clearcut relationship between drug administration and any of these events 22 in contrast such events are much more likely during pregnancy 60 cases100000 women without the presence of estrogen the incidence of such events for use of plan b should be even lower than the yuzpe regimen adverse reactions to plan b listed in the fdaapproved label include nausea 23 abdominal pain 18 fatigue 17 and headache 17 less common adverse events listed on the label include menstrual changes dizziness breast tenderness vomiting and diarrhea there is medical evidence that plan b will harm developing fetus if taken accidentally while pregnant23 several studies have shown that availability of plan b does not lead to an increase in

in april 2003 womens capital corporation wcc submitted an application to the fda requesting that plan b be switched from prescription to otc25 requiring prescription for emergency contraception may create barriers to access for many women the woman must 1 identify physician who will prescribe plan b 2 obtain prescription via telephone call or physician visit and pay the financial cost of the visit and 3 find pharmacy that stocks the product and employs pharmacist who will dispense the product because the effective use of plan b is time dependent the earlier it is used the more effective it is switch from prescription only to overthecounter otc would likely benefit women who may need to use this product fda formalized the process of switching prescription drug to otc status in 1975 and has approved over 90 such applications the requir ements for making the switch from prescription only to otc include making sure the drug is safe for selfmedication and has low toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect 26 the patient must be able to recognize the condition and require minimal health care provider intervention in order to use the drug correctly the otc applications are reviewed by fdas center for drug evaluation and research cder because it is considered to be first in class drug the plan b application was reviewed by two rather than one of the six offices within cder one of fice with expertise in reproductive health and second office that reviews all otc switch applications cder also requested joint meeting of two advisory committees of outside experts in order to obtain scientific advice on the plan b application the two committees the nonprescription drugs advisory committee and the advisory committee for reproductive health drugs met in december 2003 27 after reviewing over 15000 pages of data and 40 scientific studies the committees voted unanimously that plan b is safe for use in the nonprescription setting and voted 23 to 4 that the plan b switch to otc status should be approved28 in may 2004 the fda rejected the advice of its scientific committee and issued not approvable letter for the plan b switch to otc the fda cited inadequate sampling of women 25 wcc submitted supplemental new drug application under section 505b of the federal food drug and cosmetic act for plan b in february 2004 wcc sold the rights to market plan b to barr pharm aceuticals barr had begun acting as the agent for wcc regarding plan b in october 2003 gao report november 2005 duramed research inc the current sponsor of plan b is subsidiary of barr 26

actual vote count is in brackets question 1 does the actual use study demonstrate that consumers used the product as recommended in the proposed labeling 27 yes one question 2 are the actual use study data generalizable to the overall population of potential nonrx users of plan b 27 yes one question 3 based on the actual use study and literature review is there evidence that nonrx availability of plan b leads to substitution of emergency contraceptive for the regular use of other methods of contraception zero yes 28 question 4 do the data demonstrate that plan b is safe for use in the nonprescription setting 28 yes zero question 5 are the plans for introduction of plan b into the nonrx setting adequate with respect to consumer access and safe use 22 yes five one abstain question 6

about use of the drug without supervision by physician or other health care provider however studies published in 2004 and 2005 do not support an association between wider availability of emergency contraception and an increase in unsafe sexual behavior among teenagers29 counseling against unsafe behavior in this age group is presumably the reason why fda believed the supervision of physician was required barr labs reapplied in july 2004 requesting that plan b be available over the counter only to women 17 years and older the fda did not issue decision by its regulatory deadline of january 2005 at his confirmation hearing in march 2005 fda commissioner lester m crawford indicated that the science part is generally done for the plan b approval process and were just now down to what the label will look like30 fda announced on august 26 2005 that an immediate decision on the otc switch could not be determined fda commissioner lester crawford cited novel regulatory issues profound policy questions and specific concerns over how the exact same formulation of the drug could be available otc for an older group of women while remaining prescription only for the younger group 60day public comment period was opened to help decide these issues this announcement led to the resignation on august 31 of the director of the fda s office of womens health susan wood in protest of the agencys action fda commissioner crawford resigned abruptly on september 23 2005 reportedly due to financial improprieties unrelated to the ongoing controversy over plan b when the comment period ended on november 1 2005 fda had received approximately 47000 comments 31 on that same day senators hillary clinton and patty murray delivered 10000 name petition urging the agency to expeditiously make decision on the application for otc status for plan b based strictly on scientific evidence 32 members of congress asked the government accountability office gao to investigate if there was political interference in the fda decision process the gao report released in november 2005 stated that the process was unusual and that the decision may have been made months before the scientific reviews were completed it noted that it was not typical of the other 67 proposed prescriptiontootc switch decisions made from 1994 through 2004 for two reasons first it was the only decision that was not approved after the members of the advisory committees voted to approve the application second the gao reported that three highlevel fda officials had declined to sign the letter that refused approval this

35 representatives of several reproductive health organizations filed complaint against fda commissioner andrew von eschenbach on behalf of women seeking emergency contraception the suit was filed on january 21 2005 over year and half before the fda announced its approval of the otc switch for plan b for women 18 and older 36 the case has yet to go to trial in light of the fdas bifurcated approval the plaintiffs amended their filing and asked the court to require the fda to approve plan b for all ages remove the agencys requirement that pharmacists keep plan b behind the counter and allow all businesses to sell plan b37 the plaintiffs some as young as 13 argue that the fda did not follow proper agency procedures when it mandated age and pointofsale restrictions for plan b38 because the drug is used only by women they contend that the fda engaged in sex discrimination in violation of the fifth amendment right to equal protection the plaintiffs also assert that the agency violated their fifth amendment right to privacy without serv ing any compelling significant or even legitimate government interest by restricting access to certain ages the location of the drug 33 memorandum

plaintiffs object to alleged violations of the right to informational privacy that will occur because they must disclose their ages and possibly other information such as names and addresses to obtain plan b from behind the counter the plaintiffs view this as disclosure of information to third parties about their personal sexual activity40 finally the plaintiffs contend that the agency ignored certain requirements under the administrative procedure act apa41 with regard to the alleged apa violations the plaintiffs specifically argue that the agencys imposition of age and pointofsale restrictions was arbitrary capricious and an abuse of agency discretion the fda allegedly required greater information for the approval of plan b than the agency required for past approvals of otc medications42 additionally the plaintiffs argue that the fda had enough data regarding plan bs safety and effectiveness to make the drug available otc without further restrictions 43 the plaintiffs also contend that the agency took improper action when determining age restrictions for plan b despite recommendations within the agency that the fda approve plan b without age limits44 according to the lawsuit the fda also violated the apa by overstepping its statutory mandate in two ways first the fdas denial was purportedly influenced by logic other than scientific or medical evidence sworn depositions taken by lawyers from the center for reproductive rights legal advocacy organization show that some of the fdas staff members were convinced that amount of scientific evidence would have persuaded the fdas political appointees to approve the application dr john jenkins director of the office of new drugs at the agency said in deposition that his boss dr steven galson told him that he felt he didnt have choice but to reject the application 45 second the plaintiffs assert that the fda lacked the statutory authority to restrict the types of businesses that can sell otc drugs and the authority to control the point of sale of nonprescription drug products46 in response to the amended complaint the fda moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that 1 the court lacks jurisdiction 2 the plaintiffs do not have standing to bring the case 3 the complaints allegations fail to state claim for which the court may grant relief 4 the plaintiffs claims are moot and 5 the court lacks the authority to grant the requested relief47 furthermore the fda acknowledged that it has received at least four citizens petitions on plan b and denied at least one48 the fda also admitted that for the

recommended granting the applicant otc status or the agency did not reach final determination on the application49 the fda said that in those ten years it requested subsequent information on teen use not only for plan b but also for otc nicotine replacement therapies and noted that several past supplemental new drug applications included information on teen use of prescription drugs when requesting otc status50 in addition the fda specifically denied that it created behindthecounter regime for plan b and that the fda mandated that it be kept behindthecounter51 in response to the plaintiffs suggestions that the fda s plan b review procedures were politicized and unusual the agency initially claimed that privilege protected it from discussing its deliberative process including advice opinions and ideas received by the agency and presented by those involved in the process52 in an amended answer the fda later stated that such allegations were irrelevant and immaterial to the complaints causes of action as well as beyond the courts jurisdiction53 notably scientific data reviewed by the fdas center for drug evaluation and research determined that plan b could be safely used by women age 17 and older54 as noted above the suit was filed before the fda approved the application to switch plan b to otc status for women ages 18 and older but the plaintiffs are currently pursuing the case with respect to women younger than 18 most recently the plaintiffs have asked for summary judgment request made because allegedly material issues of fact exist and thus the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment in their favor in judicial watch inc v fda 55 the conservative nonprofit sued the fda for violating the freedom of information act with regard to the agencys communications with members of congress about plan b the relevant provision of that act requires that the agency upon receiving request for records decide whether it will comply with such request within 20 business days after receiving such request 56 judicial watch had requested records of any and all communications between the fda and senators clinton murray and enzi and their staff members with regard to plan b the fda filed motion to dismiss noting that it had produced all responsive records57 which the agency argued renders the case moot because it gives the 49 see 05366 p 29 answer

the fda moved for summary judgment on the issue of the adequacy of the agencys records of its communications with the senators and their staff members asserting that its search was adequate and reasonable as matter of law59 these motions are pending before the federal district court for dc in association of american physicians surgeons inc v fda 60 notforprofit organization representing physicians in typically small or solo practices and three conservative womens and reproductive health groups filed suit seeking to overturn the fda s approval of plan b as an otc drug so that the drug would become available again only by prescription first the plaintiffs argue that plan b is unsafe for otc distribution because the label does not adequately warn consumers of plan bs ineffectiveness for routine contraception and because information submitted to the fda in support of the change to an otc drug did not establish either plan bs safety or effectiveness 61 second the plaintiffs allege that the fda lacked the authority to approve drug both otc and as prescription because the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca does not authorize approval or dist ribution of the same drug for sale both otc and as prescription third citing the fdas inability to enforce age restrictions and alleged errors in waiving pediatric research requirements the complaint asserts that the fda could not lawfully bifurcate drug products otc versus rx status based on the patients age under the ffdca62 fourth the plaintiffs assert that the fda doe s not have the power to create new third class of drugs those that require pharmacist s to supplement the labeling or that certain subpopulations might misuse with direct access63 next the plaintiffs assert that the fda did not engage in the necessary rulemaking under the apa when amending its interpretation of statutory provision to approve plan b as an otc drug64 in addition the plaintiffs allege that the fda did not follow the ffdca when it removed plan b from prescription status without rulemaking65 finally they argue that the fda unlawf ully approved plan b as an otc drug under improper pressure from senators clinton and murray66 as result according to the plaintiffs the fdas approval of plan b and th agencys avoidance of the rulemaking process was arbitrary and capricious in response the fda moved to dismiss the suit on five grounds 1 the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the fdas approval decision of plan bs supplemental new drug application 2 the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the fdas approval of the plan b supplemental new drug application 3 the plaintiffs failed to state claim as far as their allegations that the fda lacked the authority to approve plan b both otc and as prescription drug and that the fda did not have the power to create third clas s of behindthecounter drugs 4 the plaintiffs contentions that the fda violated the apa and the ffdca by failing to engage in rulemaking

pharmacists or pharmacies but does not specifically include them in illinois however pharmacies that stock contraceptives must also dispense emergency contraceptives in the state of washington recent rulemaking by the states board of pharmacy requires pharmacy owners to ensure that if one pharmacist refuses to fill prescription another pharmacist will deliver the lawfully prescribed drug or device to the patient74 if prescription drug or device is outofstock the new rule provides several options to the patient including transmitting the patients prescription to another pharmacy chosen by the patient that will fill the prescription75 the washington state regulations are being challenged in federal district court by the parent corporation of two grocery stores including one that has pharmacy and two pharmacists who are the sole ph armacists on duty at pharmacies that allegedly could not hire another pharmacist to dispense drugs such as plan b76 on march 20 2006 all walmart pharmacies began stocking and filling prescriptions for plan b prior to that date the company only stocked and filled prescriptions for the drug at its pharmacies in massachusetts and illinois where it was required by law the company decided to change its policy because walmart expects more states to require plan b to be available for sale because of this and the fact that plan b is an fdaapproved product we feel it is difficult to justify being the countrys only major pharmacy chain not selling it77 the company intends to keep its conscientious objection policy which allows pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions and refer patients to another pharmacy or pharmacist there are more than 3700 walmart pharmacies nationwide connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal announced on march 4 2006 that state health plans would not cover prescriptions from pharmacie s that do not stock plan b attorney general blumenthal said that his decision to remove pha rmacies from the states health plan coverage would remain until he is certain every pharmacy will dispense plan b wherever it is medically prescribed 78 there is great variation among the states regarding emergency contraception coverage for medicaid beneficiaries79 following the august 2006 fda decision 16 states have implemented written policies to address coverage of emergency contraception as an otc drug most of the remaining states had policies on emergency contraception coverage prior to august 2006 and those policies remain in effect because the billing procedures of most state medicaid programs require the pharmacist to submit prescription in order to be reimbursed for otc drugs low income women must either obtain prescription or pay the 40 outofpocket cost in nine states alabama

period from when it was filed with fda in april 2003 to its august 2006 approval individuals who criticize the delayed fda decision believe that bush administration policy and fda actions were based on political and ideological considerations rather than on sound science fda is required by law to make decisions exclusively on substantial scientific evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of drug these critics believe the fda decision was delayed to appease conservative religious and prolife groups that are long time supporters of president bush president bush indicated his support for the thenimminent plan b decision during news conference on august 21 2006 91 the fda decision and the presidents support of the decision have greatly angered conservative religious and prolife groups one such organization concerned women of america asked that dr andrew von eschenbachs nomination as fda commissioner be withdrawn and recommended that consumers stop doing business with drug stores that sell otc plan b 92 the family research council christian conservative nonprofit think tank and lobbying organization states that it is pursuing legal and legislative options to overturn the fdas decision93 such groups are unhappy because they believe plan b should only be used with the supervision of healthcare professional they also believe plan b use may lead to an increase in unsafe sexual activity recent review of the medical literature published in april 2007 found that having emergency contraception on hand did not lead to increased rates of sexually transmitted infections increased frequency of unprotected intercourse nor changes in contraceptive methods94 us study also found that easier access to emergency contraception did not decrease the use of condoms or oral contraceptives or lead to an increase in sexually transmitted infections or unprotected sex 95 followup study found that adolescents younger than 16 years of age behaved differently in response to increased access to emergency contraception compared with older age groups96 their behaviors did not become riskier increased incidence of unprotected sex sexually transmitted disease or pregnancy nor did they become more vulnerable to unwanted sexual activity including the very youngest participants in the study moreover the adolescents were equally capable as adults in taking ec correctly with the youngest adolescents under 16 years showing the best results these results are consistent with findings from previous study that specifically examined young adolescents there was reason to restrict access in

not be singled out due to concerns about their inability to follow the regimen correctly97 the society for adolescent medicine does not place an age limit on access to emergency contraception98 the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog believes that plan b can be safely used without supervision by physician and that the age restriction imposed by fda is medically unnecessary in statement released on the same day as the fda approval of otc status for plan b acog stated by restricting its otc availability to women age 18 and older the fda has missed an unparalleled opportunity to prevent teenage pregnancies each year there are more than 800000 teen pregnancies in the us with many ending in abortion pregnancy itself is not without risk especially for young woman there is scientific or medical reason to impose an age restriction and to withhold emergency contraception from this population emergency contraception is safe for overthecounter use by women of all ages 99 as stated above studies of plan b have shown that women even young adolescents can follow the directions on the package and use the product correctly without an increase in high risk behaviors100 one member of the fda advisory panel pharmacist noted that for even the youngest women the morningafter pill poses less of health risk than pregnancy in terms of age im not an obgyn but i cant imagine that i would prefer ten or 11 year old to be pregnant over some hypothetical risk that there might be with ten or 11 year old taking this product so i guess i would feel pretty strongly about not having any age restrictions 101 the side effects of plan b would probably influence most women to find another method of regular birth control for rape victims who dont immediately seek medical care otc availability would be expected to be beneficial under the fda approv agreement with barr the drug will only be sold in pharmacies or health clinics where consumers can obtain advice from pharmacist or other health care professional plan b will not be available at gas stations convenience stores online pharmacies or other places wher other nonprescription drugs are sold the primary concern of conservative religious and prolife groups with plan b however is that it may prevent the implantation of the embryo in the uterus prolife groups believe that prevention of embryo implantation in the uterus is an abortion according to the catholic prolife group human life international president bushs implied support for the abortioncausing drug plan b is completely inconsistent with his recent veto of the embryonic stem cell research escr funding bill what the president apparently fails to realize is that plan b kills the same innocent 97 ibid 98 melanie gold et

however does not consider prevention of implantation to be an abortion pregnancy begins with implantation not fertilization medical organizations and the federal government concur on this point fertilization is necessary but insufficient step toward pregnancy any method of regulation of fertility that acts before implantation is not an abortifacient103 fda does not classify plan b as an abortion drug research has found that the use of emergency contraception rises when it is made available without prescription in france sales of nonprescription emergency contraceptive introduced in 1999 rose 72 over five years104 in british columbia use of emergency contraception increased 102 after new policy allowed pharmacists to dispense without prescription105 some experts have estimated that use of emergency contraception in the united states could prevent 1 million abortions and more than 2 million unintended pregnancies that result in childbirth each year 106 however report in the january 2007 issue of obstetrics gynecology which looked at 23 studies of emergency contraception use found that increased access to emergency contraceptive pills enhances use but has not been shown to reduce unintended pregnancy rates107 this same conclusion was reached in separate review of the medical literature published in april 2007108 the authors of this second study found that advance provision of emergency contraception did not reduce pregnancy rates when compared to conventional provision the interventions tested thus far have not reduced overall pregnancy rates in the populations studied 109 prochoice groups believe otc status for plan b will reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and reduce the number of abortions performed in the united states although pro choice groups believe the fda decision is step in the right direction they would have preferred that otc status for plan b would have been appr oved for all women not just those 18 and older they believe that the age restriction might keep the drug from women who need it the most an estimated 35 million unwanted pregnancies occur annually one third of which involve teenagers 110 in the united
