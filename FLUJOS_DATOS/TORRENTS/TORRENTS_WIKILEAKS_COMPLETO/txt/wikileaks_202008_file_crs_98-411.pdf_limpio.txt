the privileges of the house are those affecting the rights of the house collectively its safety dignity and the integrity of its proceedings for example questions relating to the seating of members and the organization of the house at the beginning of congress have been held to raise questions of the privileges of the house as have questions relating to the health and safety of members and staff other subjects cited in house practice as giving rise to questions of the privileges of the house include the presence on the house floor of unauthorized persons the conduct of those in the press gallery the integrity of the journal the protection of house records and files the accuracy of house documents and records and use of an allegedly forged document at committee hearing the speaker determines whether question that member has raised does in fact qualify under the houses precedents as question of the privileges of the house two of the general principles that guide the speaker in making these determinations are stated in house practice first question of the privileges of the house may not be raised to effect change in the rules of the house or their interpretation and second member may not by raising question of the privileges of the house under rule ix thereby attach privilege to question not otherwise in order under the rules of the house in other words make question

personal privilege as those affecting the rights reputation and conduct of members delegates or the resident commissioner individually in their representative capacity only again it is the speaker who determines whether an allegation or statement gives rise to question of personal privilege according to house practice the allegation or statement must refer to an individual member and must reflect directly on the members integrity or reputation mere statements of opinion about or general criticism of his actions as memberor his voting record or viewsdo not constitute grounds for question of personal privilege members have raised questions of personal privilege to respond to allegations about matters such as misuse of public funds conflicts of interest abuse of the franking privilege corruption and bribery criminal conspiracy or perjury violatio n of the securities laws and knowingly making false statement with the intent to deceive members may rise to questions of personal privilege to respond to such public criticisms whether made by other members or for example in private publications however question of personal privilege may not be based on language uttered on the floor of the house in debate according to house practice because the offended member has another recourse timely demand that the objectionable words be taken down t

proceeds to consider the resolution under the onehour rule with the time for debate equally divided between the resolutions proponent and either the majority leader or the minority leader as the speaker determines the house may agree to order the previous question after the first hour of debate on the resolution if so the house proceeds to vote on the resolution without amendment or further debate if the previous question is not ordered debate may continue under the onehour rule and the member controlling the time may propose an amendment to the resolution motions to table or refer the resolution or to postpone its consideration also are in order member raises question of personal privilege simply by stating that he or she is rising on the floor for that purpose question of personal
