jonathan sanford foreign aﬀairs defense and trade division july 19 2006 abstract many in the united states believe that the large volume of chinese exports to the united states is damaging the us manufacturing sector and feeding the us trade deﬁcit they believe that the undervalued yuan is an important reason why china is able to price its goods so competitively and why production in many areas is shifting to china other analysts believe that by virtue of its undervalued currency china is damaging the world trading system and denying export opportunities to other countries whose currencies are more fairly priced congress is considering legislation which would place countervailing duties or special tariﬀs on chinese goods entering the us in order to oﬀset the trade beneﬁts china presumably gains from its present exchange rate policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs

defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322china the united states and the imf negotiating exchange rate adjustment summary in recent years the united states and other countries have expressed considerable concern that chinas nati onal currency the yuan or renminbi is seriously undervalued some analysts say th yuan needs to rise by as much as 40 in order to reflect its equilibrium value critics say that chin as undervalued currency provides it with an unfair trade advant age that has seriously injured the manufacturing sector in the united states chinese officials counter that they have not pegged the yuan to the dollar in order to gain trade advantages rather they say the fixed rate promotes economic stability that is vital for the functioning of its domestic economy on july 21 2005 china announced new foreign exchange system which is intended to allow more flexibility and to permit the international value of the yuan to be established by market forces the yuan was increased in value by 2 and managed float was introduced however the value of the yuan has changed little since then despite the publication of ma ny studies scholars do not agree whether or by what percent the yuan is underval ued the wide range of estimates suggests that there is reason to believe that any particular figure is correct it is not clear that the us trade deficit would be wer or us manufactur ers would benefit if china raised the value of the yuan in th short run us producers might be able to sell higherpriced products to us consum ers if the inflow of chinese goods were reduced in the long run though as long as the united states is net importer of capital it would have trade deficit nd other countries would ultimately replace china as suppliers of lowcost goods to the us market the treasury department has strongly urged china in recent years to adopt procedures that would allow the yuan to rise in value congress is considering legislation that would penalize china if its currency is not revalued the united states has pursued the yuandollar exchan ge rate issue as bilateral uschina issue other countries are also affected by the presumably undervalued yuan some more than the us but they have allo wed the united states to take the lead there are at least five ways the united states could deal with the yuan exchange rate issue some of these would involve other countries more explicitly in the process first the united states could c ontinue pressing china publicly to raise the value of the yuan on the assumption that change will not occur without foreign pressure second it could stop pressing china publicly on the expectation that china might move more rapidly towards reform if it is not pressured third the united states could restrict imports from china pe nding action to revalue the yuan fourth the us could ask the imf to declare that china is manipulating its currency in violation of imf rules fifth the united states could refer the issue to the world trade organization wto asserting that the united states has been injured by unfair trade practices linked to the underv aluation of chinas currency the wto in turn could authorize trade remedies t ariffs on chinese goods for example aimed at correcting this abuse this report w ill be updated as new velopments arise httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322contents s c p n d c n t n t 1 v r v i

the united states and the imf negotiating exchange rate adjustment scope and content overview in recent years there has been growing concern in the united states and elsewhere that china may be manipulating the value of its currency to gain unfair trade advantages many believe that china s national currency the yuan or renminbi rmb may be seriously undervalued co mpared to the dollar and other major currencies1 the united states and other countri have urged china to raise the value of its currency chinese officials say they want to make their exchange rate system more flexible but they say china also needs longterm stability in its currency value in order to avoid internal dislocati ons discussion of th is question has taken place at the international monetary fund i mf and at other multila teral fora such as the periodic meetings of the g8 the seve n largest industrial countries plus russia the united states and other countries ve also spoken directly to china on bilateral basis about this issue the key issue is what if the yuan is undervalued china and the world should do about it china is undergoing major shift from statedominated to marketbased economy it has pursued policy of exportled growth in order to generate the employment and income necessary to facilitate change in the overall structure of its economy it has priced its currency in order to facilitate that policy in july 2005 china adopted reforms aimed at giving market forces possible role in the valuation of the yuan most observers say the initial changes 2 rise in value were too small and they note that little change has occurred since chinese officials retain firm control over the mechanisms which produce the yuandollar exchange rate and the criteria they use in this process remain opaque international discussions have sought to persuade chin to accelerate the process but while the concerns of other countries may bear weight in the thinking of chinese officials httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs2 there are effective teeth in the inte rnational monetary fund that could compel china to change its policies and procedures more rapidly than it wishes to do so many in the united states believe that the large volume of chinese exports to the united states is damaging the us manufacturing sector and feeding the us trade deficit they believe that the unde rvalued yuan is an important reason why china is able to price its goods so co mpetitively and why production in many areas is shifting to china other analysts be lieve that by virtue of its undervalued currency china is damaging the world trading system and denying export opportunities to other countries whose currenc ies are more fairly priced congress is considering legislation which would place countervailing duties or special tariffs on chinese goods entering the us in order to offset the trade benefits china presumably gains from its present exchange rate policies this report in four parts events and issues this report has four parts the first part discusses the issues and events surrounding the yuandolla r controversy it describes the actions which chinese authorities have taken to re value the yuan and arguably to lay the groundwork for larger future role for ma rket forces in its valuation it also describes the methods the chines authorities have used and s till use to hold the value of the yuan at the level they prefer this section discusses the efforts the international monetary fund the us government and othe r governments have made to encourage or press china to revalue its currency it also reviews the us treasury departments disc ussion of china in its miannual report on currency manipulation and legislation currently pending in congress which would levy special duties on chinese goods if the yuan is not increased considerably in value five questions which frame the controversy the second part of this report looks at five central questions first is the yuan undervalued and if so by how much this question may be harder to an swer than many people assume most economists agree the yuan is undervalued but the 17 studies reviewed in this report show widely different conclusions some say the yuan is slightly overvalued others say it is 15 or 25 or perhaps 49 undervalued while several say it is impossible to make an accurate computation the data are poor china is changing rapidly and scholars use different assumptions in th eir studies moreover new economic data published in december 2005 seem to render ll previous studies obsolete as they give very different picture of the chin economy than was available before in recent studies imf experts say the yuan is undervalued but they also say it is impossible to know how large the distortion might be the imf also says that it is impossible to separate the trade effects of that distortion from the other factors labor costs productivity etc which also affect the price of chinese goods without some objective way of determining what the real value of the yuan might be it may be difficult for china and ot her countries to agr ee what size increase is enough likewise without knowing the proper rate it might be difficult to design special us tariffs which the wo rld would consider fair and compensatory rather than arbitrary or punitive it might be helpful if china the united states and other countries could agree on criteria by which to decide how an appropriate exchange rate for the dollar nd yuan might be determined httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs3 second does china manipulat the value of the yuan the imf rules state that countries may not manipul ate the value of their currency in order to gain unfair trade advantage the second section of this report examines chinas behavior in light of the five standards the imf uses to judge whether manipulation is taking place the imf has not publicly declared that china is manipulating its currency chinas actions seem to meet four of the imfs criteria in this regard the imf has evident means other than persuasion to ma ke countries comply with its rules in this context it is not clear that an imf announcement that china was violating its rules would help or hinder the current discu ssions aimed at persuading china to raise the value of the yuan third how fast could china revalue the yuan if it wanted to theoretically the peoples bank of china could raise the exchange value of the yuan to any specified level overnight however ch inese officials are concerned about the growth and employment effects any change in the value of the yuan may have on their economy toorapid increase mig ht have serious negative effects on employment output and growth some also worry that hot money could complicate the process of revaluation and may require china to delay any changes until the perceived speculative pressure abates many experts believe that gradual and measured approach to currency revaluation is appropriate for china the imf says for example that emerging market countries generally do not handle rapid and large exchange rate movements well and that rious dislocations can occur others believe however that basic fairness to ot her countries requires china to raise the value of its currency some analysts believe china could ffer serious damage to its economy if it does not change is economic strategy its heavy reliance on export led growth makes it vulnerable for ex ample to slowdown in world demand higher currency values would stimulate growth of its domestic economy fourth has china cooked the books in terms of its trade surplus some analysts believe that chinas actual net income from trade is many times larger than that which chinas publishes in its official trade statistics data published by the imf show that while china reports that it had net trade surplus of 41 billion in 2004 its trading partners report that they had combined trade deficit of 267 billion with china some people say that trade surplus this large is proof that chinas currency is substan tially undervalued others would ask however where if china is accruing an extra 200 billion annually in trade income beyond the amounts accounted for in its balance of payments figures that money might be it might be hard for example for china to hide all this additional income year after year in secret undeclared foreign exchange reserves without somebody discovering that it exists trade data for other countries also s how though on smaller scale this same mismatch between the amount reported by exporter countries and the amounts reported by those who import their products bad data collection by individual countries and methodological problems in th reporting system seem to be better explanations for these discrepancies than is the uniform prospect that exporters fudge their data while importers report their incoming trade data correctly httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs4 2 for further discussion of the effects of the undervalued yuan on the us economy see crs report rs21625 chinas currency peg and crs report rl32165 chinas exchange rate peg both by wayne m morrison and marc labontefifth would the us economy benefit if china revalued the yuan correcting the international value of the yuan may improve the efficiency of international trade but will it reduce the us trade deficit and strengthen the us manufacturing sector most economists believe not the us and chinese economies have become increasingly interdependent in recent years china is pursuing policy of exportled growth and the united states provides ready market for its goods meanwhile the united stat imports large quantities of capital from abroad by borrowing or by opening its economy to foreign investment and in order more money chasing the same qua ntity of goods to avoid turning that imported money into inflation it must also import goods and services for the imported money to buy if china raised the value of the yuan its exports to the united states would likely shrink and the amount of money it could place in the us economy would decline multinational firms based in the united states are major presence in the chinese economy and large share of chin as exports to the united states are produced by or mediated through those firms for them the undervalued yuan provides major benefits b ecause it keeps down their production costs and it enables them to produce things which might be too costly to produce in the united states us consumers who purchase the output from these facilities in china are able to get more product at lower cost than they would be able to get if the products were produced domestically or if the value of the yuan were higher these firms say they need to produce some of their output in lowcost places such as china and they would move their facilities elsewhere but not back to the united states if china were longer available to them on the other hand many usbased sm all and medium size enterprises cannot or wish not to move their operations abro ad for them the undervalued yuan is major threat to their commercial viability and their bottom line to compete with goods produced in china they must redu ce their costs perhaps by economizing on labor or lowering their pr ofit margins find nonprice ba sed reasons for consumers to prefer their products to those produced abroad merge some of their operations with similarly affected domestic firms or seek some type of political remedy to shield them from the foreign competition temporarily if exports from china were restricted because of trade legislation us producers might be able to take over some of the market albeit at higher prices previously supplied by china from longer perspective though it is likely that multinational firms would shift much of th eir production to other lowcost countries and these would ramp up their exports in or der to supply the us market previously supplied by chinese goods the inflow of foreign goods might decline and us manufactured goods might be more competitiv in us and foreign markets if the us savings rate increased the united states borrowed less and received fewer investments from abroad and the international value of the dollar declined2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs5 however this would require major change s in american economic behavior which cannot be easily legislated it is difficult to know on net basis whether the us economy bene fits or whether on net basis it is hurt from the w cost of products it imports from china the interests of the large and smalltomedium sized firms appear to conflict and the interests of us consumers seem to conflict in some ways with the interests of some us producers of products which compete with chinese exports from an economic point of view the profit margins realized by the chinese exporters appear to be relatively small whereas the profit margin s earned by the distributors of those products in the united states may be higher meanwhile though the data are not clear many experts believe that on trade weighted basis the us producers benefit more from their exports to china than chinese exporters do on their sales to the united states at the same time chinas investments in the united states provide badly needed capital which helps spur grow th in the american economy at the same time that the growing volume of debt owed to foreigners increases the international exposure of the us economy weighing all of these factors together in order to determine on an overall basis whether the undervalued yuan is benefit or burden to the us economy is difficult task three dilemmas for china the third section of this report looks at some of the monetary and financ ial dilemmas which affect chinas views about exchange rate policy first what should china do bout its foreign exchange forex reserves china has 819 billion in foreign exchange re serves rough 70 in dollars these are an important source of income influe nce and future spending power however they are also problem for one thing the growth in chinas forex reserves fuels domestic inflation for every dollar the peoples bank of china buys to hold down the value of the yuan and to increase its reserves it injects 8 yuan into chinas economy chinas reserves grew by 100 billion in 2005 so this is lot of new printing press money the central ba nk has tried with limite d success to bottle up the inflationary effect of this money with public debt transactions and tight monetary policy if china raised the value of the yuan the growth in its foreign exchange reserves would slow or stop and if it relaxed its monetary policy the growth and reform prospects of its inte rnal economy might be enhanced on the other hand revaluation would cost china great deal of money if the yuan increased in value by 20 the purchasing power of chinas foreign reserves would go down corresponding it would from chinas perspective about 13 trillion yuan about 200 billion in purchasin g power if china began withdrawing assets from the us market and converting them to ot her currencies in order to reduce its exposure it would lose money because its actions would push down the value of the securities and the dollars it sold when it purchased other currencies and foreign assets to replace its former us holdings it would lose money again because its actions would also push up their prices chinese officials may want to reduce the inflationary pressure which comes from grow th in their foreign exchange reserves but they may not be happy about the prospect of major financial losse s if they revalue or if they move their current assets elsewhere second where is the money coming from that fuels those growing reserves many people believe that ex ports and incoming foreign investment account for mosthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs6 of the increase in chinas foreign exchange reserves some suggest however that hot money speculative inflows of foreign funds seeking to profit from revaluation of the yuan may account for mo st of the growth in chinas reserves depending on the source of the money the policy implications for china are very different if trade and investment are the main source of the funds then if chinese officials want to slow the growth in reserves they should raise the value of the yuan however if speculative inflows are the primary source then chinas policy choices are more difficult large quick revaluation would stop the speculative pressure but it might also da mage chinas economy gradual increases would allow the chinese economy to adjust but it might also encourage speculators to bring more money into china in hopes of profiting as the currency goes up in value refusal to consider any change in the value might discourage the speculators over long period of time but if the status quo prevailed during that period this would also make chinas trading partne rs angry and give them reasons to doubt whether chinese officials are sincere when they say they want to revalue the yuan third would revaluation strengthen or weaken chinas banking system chinas banks are riddled with bad debt and their competitiveness weakened by years of state control if the yuan were increased in value would the shock cause chinese banks to strengthen their procedures or w ould it put the system at risk change in exchange rates which weakened the export sector without simultaneously stimulating domestic commerce could hold ba d news for chinas banks some experts point out that chinese banks hold only small portion of their assets in foreign currencies and the g overnment has recently established asset management companies similar to the mechanisms the us government used in the 1980s to resolve the us savings and loan crisis to take bad debt off the books of the banks however exportrelated ac tivities account for major share of the customers in chinas banking system ne vertheless most experts agree that bad debts nonperforming assets account for perhaps 30 of the assets of chinese banks and they say the government will n eed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in yuan to recapitalize and restructure the major banks the imf says that the strength of chinas banking system s hould not be an impediment to gradual increase in the value of the yuan however chinese officials have expressed reservations and may not be willing to revalue the yuan very quickly until their concerns about the impact on their national banking system have been alleviated external pressure to revalue ra pidly might be seen as an effort by foreigners to create more opportunities for their firms to buy ailing chinese banks policy options for the united states the fourth part of this report identifies five major options which us policymakers might consider if they want to encourage china to revalue the yuan they are not mutually exclusive though it might be difficult for some of them to be pursued simultaneously first the united states could continue pressing china publicly for further changes in its foreign exchange system in order that the yuans value would better reflect market conditions and economic realities if chinese reformers need outside pressure to help them persua other officials to consider reform this strategy might help second as recipro cal of the first option us policymakers might refrainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs7 from pressing china to move more quickly with its reforms this might be an effective strategy if the chinese proponent s of change find that outside pressure strengthens the hand of those resisting reform third the united states could levy special tariffs on chinese imports in an effort to encourage china to be more accommodating in their discussions with the united states about the yuan however ch duties may violate wto rules also chinese exporters may be able to absorb some of the cost of the new duties further if the yuan were revalued the price of chinese exports would need not increase by the same rate as did the yuan chinese exports include high proportion of inputs imported from other countries the price of those inputs would not change if the yuan went up in value to break even producers in china would only need to increase the price of their exports by an amount which reflects the higher dollar equivalent cost of chineseproduced inputs and labor paid in yuan fourth and fifth the united states might refer the dollaryuan controversy to the imf or the world trade organization as not ed above this issue has been discussed at the imf for some time proposed changes in the power of the imf might give it more authority over country exchange rate policies including authority to address problems of manipulation whether china would be the main country affected whether the united states and other countries would allow the imf to determine their exchange rates and what impact these rule changes might have on the policies of the countries with the worlds largest economies are matters for speculation an appeal to the wto might be base d on the grounds that chinas undervalued currency allegedly constitutes subsidy to its export sector the wto can evaluate trade disputes and it can author ize countries to levy trade penalties in order to enforce its decisions however it has authority to judge exchange rate issues the wto and imf have an agreement though specifyin g that any exchange rate issues which arise in wto deliberations shall be referred to the imf and the imfs decision shall be final in effect the wto would be th enforcer if the imf decided that country was manipulating its currency to gain unfair trade advantage issues and events yuandollar excha nge rate issue the controversy in 1994 the peoples bank of china pbc lowered the value of its currency from 58 to about 87 yu an to the dollar the rate gradually settled by 1997 to 83 and was locked at that rate during the asian financial crisis in the past dozen years chinas economy has grown substantially both in size and in the level of modernization and the proportion of its economy oriented towards exports has increased considerably one might expect that these changes would have had an impact as well on the relative exchange value of chinas currency particularly its rate compared to the us dollar as the united states became chinas most important single export market however the value of the yuan remained largely unchanged during most of that period and it remained fixed at 83 yuan to the dollarhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs8 3 see for example report and data published by the china currency coalition chinese currency manipulation fact sheet april 2005 the coalition is group of us

3004after 1997 as the peoples bank of china pbc sold yuan into the market in order to keep the yuans value constant many argue that this constitutes manipulation arguments pro and many argue that china is manipulating the value of its currency in order to gain unfair trade advantage3 they believe this has seriously injured the manufacturing sector in the united states and contributed significantly to the us trade deficit the act of currency manipula tion is often hard to see however the effect of manipulation on currency prices is more apparent critics of chinas exchange rate policies argue that chinas currency is perhaps 25 to 50 undervalued compared to the us dollar they cite various studi which support their view they say the undervalued yuan adds to the us tr ade deficit and hurts us output and employment many have urged the administr ation to put pressure on china in order to make it stop manipulating the yuan they say china should either raise the value of the yuan by official action revalue or let it trade freely in foreign exchange markets float so that the free market can determine its real international value the issue of manipulation is controversial the imf says in its articles of agreement article iv that countries shall avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other members4 member countries are supposed to comply with this requirement in addition the us omnibus trade and competitiveness ac t of 1988 requires that the secretary of the treasury determine whether other count ries manipulate th rate of exchange between their currency and the united stat dollar for the purpose of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade5 chinese officials say they are not trying to gain unfair trade advantage with their foreign exchange policies rather they are seeking economic stability china is experiencing rapid and farreaching economic changes they say major reforms in chinas economic policie s and institutions have taken place in this view but more are yet needed the economy has grown rapidl in the past decade they say but the distribution of the benefits has been uneve n and the strains between the needs of the old economy and the new economy are great meanwhile they say the export sector is the engine of growth for the chinese economy chinese officials acknowledge that chin as foreign exchange policies stimulate economic growth however they say the go is not the attainment of unfair trade advantage but rather continued growth in the export sector many chinese exporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs9

fixedrate currency washington post july 22 2005 p 1industries operate on very thin profit margins they report and an increase in the value of the yuan would lead to widespr ead bankruptcies chinas export sector is the engine driving the growth and modern ization of chinas national economy downturn in that sector would lead to sl owdown in growth or even decline in the national economy as whole this could lead to widespread instability they say with potentially serious consequences t hus they believe chinas exchange rate policy is aimed at promoting stability in the countrys export sector and economy as whole achieving trade advantages th rough undervaluation of the currency is only an instrumental means towards the achievement of this goal from this point of view efforts by foreigners to raise the ex change rate for chinas currency are aimed not merely at the elimination of this tr ade advantage but at undercutting chinas economic and political stability and at thwarting its emergence as great power chinese officials have not entered into the debate concerning the real value of chinas currency though some say ther is convincing evidence that the yuan is undervalued they could cite econometri c studies see below which support the view that chinas currency is slightly overvalued or perhaps only little undervalued compared to the dollar many economists doubt that chinas ac tions have had any appreciable impact on the longterm value of the dollar the dollar plays broad role in international finance and the amount of dollars in circulation globally is very large recent survey by the worlds leading central banks indicated that the daily trading of foreign currencies totals more than 19 tr illion 90 of which is in dollars6 china announces change on july 21 2005 chinas central bank announced new exchange rate system for ch inas currency first it increased the value of the yuan which rose from 828 to 811 to the dollar7 second the yuan would be referenced not just to the dollar but to basket of currencies and it would be allowed to vary by 03 each day above or below central parity third the central bank said that the closing price ofthe us dollar traded against the rmb yuanafter the closingof the market each working day would become the central parity for thefollowing working day8 this seemed to be an exchange system which economists call crawling peg httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs10 9 see for example richard mcgregor aim is to allow greater flexibility while s till keeping firm control and making sense of chinas choice financial times july 22 2005 pp 2 and 4 10 chinese bank reaffirms revaluation policy bbc monitoring asia pacific september 21 2005 if the new procedure had been allowed to function as announced the yuan could have increased in value by 30 in five months on july 27 2005 however the central bank announced that further chan ges in the value of the yuan should be expected rather it said chinas new system would be managed float the central bank would compare the value of the yuan to basket of currencies issued by its major trading partners however the chinese authorities made it clear that they would decide what the value of the yuan would be and they would determine when and how liberalization might occur the yuan might fluctuate compared to other currencies but they said its dollar value would be fixed too small to many observers the 2 increase in the value of the yuan announced in july 2005 was too small and th process for possible future increases was too obscure and uncertain some might argue that the changes in the new system reflect the current debate bout economic policy within the chinese leadership some chinese officials may believe that reform including liberalization of the yuan is in chinas best interest others may believe that china must continue the policy of exportled growth and the dvantages of the old system should not be disposed of lightly from this perspective some might say the new system was adopted in order to buy time to delay reform and to forestall outside pressure china was scheduled to discuss its exchange rate policies with the imf executive board in august 2005 and the advent of new system gave the chinese something new to present the imf board was critical of chinas exchange rate policies in 2004 and imf staff had strongly urged china in mid2005 to introduce market forces into chinas exchange rate regime the change was also announ ced just before congress was scheduled to consider several bills which sought to put pressure on china if it did not revalue its currency arguably series of ambig uous steps which seemed to herald change might buy china time to consider its options and lay its plans it might give the imf board reason not to press for faster action and it might persuade congress to postpone action on the pending bills9 alternatively instead of seeing the new system as the product of internal debate one might say that it is obscure because it seeks to confuse and frustrate speculators the inflow of speculative hot money is serious an official with chinas state administration of foreign exchange repor tedly observed that whether we can effectively refrain speculation on yuan is the key to the success or failure of the reform10 if china wants to avoid instability and sharp changes in currency prices its actions must not invite speculators to bring in more foreign currency and buy more yuan in effect china faces challenge of doing what the speculators expect increase the value of the yuan without encouraging them

oneway norisk bet since there was little chance the yuan would fall in value whereas there seemed real possibility that the value would eventually rise perhaps substantially this offered potentially large rewards to those who owned yuan or yuandenominated assets11 the inflow of speculative money puts pressure on china to revalue the yuan to reduce the flow12 however if the increase were not s

two additional steps that would either reduce the demand for yuan or increase the demand in china for dollars the central bank announced that it was raising the interest rate for posits held in us or hong kong dollars widening the gap between those rates and those paid for accounts denominated in yuan15 this was aimed at discouraging speculators from buying yuan in hopes they can turn profit by converting them back into dollars if in the near future the yuan should increase substantially in value the central bank also announced that it would soon scrap the existing limits on the amounts that

flexibility and encouraged the authorities to utilize the flexibility afforded by the new arrangement it reiterated its earlier point that greater exchange rate flexibility was both necessary and in chinas best interests21 it also said that more flexible exchange rate not simply revaluation is the key to providing scope for monetary policy independence and enha ncing the economys resilience to

than earlier in part due to congressional pressure if current trends continue wit hout substantial alteration ie revaluation the report said chinas policies will likely meet the statutes technical requirements for designating china as country which unfairly manipulates its currency value nevertheless the report said that chinese authorities had assured treasury secretary snow that they were

that chinas foreign exchange policies did not violate the terms of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 whatever the effects of chinas policies might be the department said it was unable to determine from the evidence at hand that chinas foreign exchange system was opera ted during the last half of 2005 for the purpose ie with the intent of preventing adjustments in chinas balance of payments or gaining china an unfair competitive advantage in international trade therefore without demonstr ation of intent the tec hnical requirements for china to be designated under the terms of

economists agree that this index provides only general suggestion of the relative valuation of currencies48 the disparity in hamburger prices around the worl d can also be read as comment on the valuation of the us dollar the economist says that the index shows that the us dollar is more overvalued now compared to most other currencies than at any time since measure was introduced 16 years

accurate than others57 it appears that few of the participants in the debate about the value of chinas currency have studied the thodologies or the assumptions of the various studies rather it seems that advocates select the studies they quote more because they like their conclusions than because they believe th ey are the best research available few of the participants in the debate cite finding s which support conclusions other than those they support or provide reasons why their preferred studies are superior on substantive grounds to others which disagreehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs22

principles principles for the guidance of members exchange rate policies and principles of f und surveillance over exchange rate policies specified in the imf board decision surveillance over exchange rate policies review decision 6026913 janua ry 22 1979 as amended pp 1016is china manipulating its currency the imf and excha nge rate policy in the past thirty years the role of the imf in the international financial system has changed until the early 1970s the imf had central role in determining world exchange rates all currencies had fixed value par value compared to the us dollar and the us dollar was worth specified amount of gold if countries wanted to ch ange their par value compared to the us dollar the imf had to firs t approve since 1976 however with passage of the second amendment to the imf article s of agreement each country is free to determine the exchange rate system it will use some countries have floated the value of their currency in world money market s others have fixed the value of their currency to that of another major country and others have pursued mixed strategy imf surveillance the imf is longer the arbiter of world exchange rates rather in the modern world it exercises surveillance over exchange rates in order to encourage and to help countries comply w ith the basic rules article iv of the imf charter prohibits countries from manipulatin g their exchange rates in order to gain unfair trade advantage it also says that the fund shall exerci firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members and shall adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies its current principles for surveillance were adopted by the imf execu tive board in 1979 and have been revised periodically since58 the principles say that count ries may peg the value of their currency to another currency but they ca nnot do this in ways which violate the requirements of article iv basically the pegged rate needs to reflect countrys underlying economic realities these include for example changes in the volume and composition of its domestic output in the size composition and direction of its foreign trade in its domestic rates of growth and national income in the size of its reserves and in shifts in its domestic fiscal and monetary policies relative rates of productivity and of change and technological advance countries are allowed under the guidelin to use their exchange rates to promote growth and development the imf rules for surveillance say the funds appraisal of country policie s shall take into account the extent to which the policies of member including its exchange rate policies serve the objectives of the continuing development of orderly underlying conditions that are necessary for financial stability the promotion of sust ainable economic grow th and reasonable levels of employment however countries are also required to take into account in their intervention policies the interests of other members including those of the countries in whose currencies they interven in other words countries can use exchange rate policy to help sustain growth and employment in their domestic economy but they cannot use an unrealistic exchange rate to prevent balance of payments bop adjustment or to gain unf air trade advantages adjustment includeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs23 59 in addition to the four cited here the other imf criteria include numbers three prolonged reductions or incentives for bop purpos affecting current transactions or the inflow or outflow of capital and six unsustainable flows of private capital 60 imf selected decisions footnote 56 see principles of fund surveillance over exchange rate policies pp 1215 section 2i iv and vsuch things as increased imports capital in flows to fund bop deficits or outflows to offset bop surpluses increased domestic interest rates or price levels and the accumulation of excess reserves if one country does not adjust its bop imbalance the burden of adjustment will be thrown upon its trading partners through monetary contraction unemployment and the like china and manipulation the imf has six criteria which might be used to identify situations where countries are mani pulating their currencies in order to gain unfair trade advantage any one of the criteria would be sufficient to note the likely presence of manipulation it appears that chinas foreign exchange practices are congruent with at least four of the imf criteria59 persistent intervention the imf says its criterion number 1 that protracted largescale intervention in one direction in the exchange market is one indication that country ma be manipulating the value of its currency countries may intervene in foreign exchange mark ets to counter shortterm disorderly conditions that cause disruptive shortterm movements in the exchange value of their currencies however the imf guidelines say that persistent oneway interventionmight indicate the need for discussion with member60 if chinas currency were properly priced and the goal were exchange rate stability the central bank would intervene in the market in both directions buying and selling yuan in order to dampen the effect of temporary shocks and to spread the effects of change over longer period of time instead china routinely sells yuan in order to keep the market price from rising it rarely buys yuan to keep the market price from sinking too low this would em to be the kind of protracted large scale intervention in one direction which the imf specified in its first operational definition of manipulation an unchanging peg the imfs second criterion which indicates that country might be manipulatin g its currency is behavior of the exchange rate that appears to be unrelated to underlying economic and financia l conditions including factors affecting competitiven ess and longterm capital m ovements countries may peg the value of their currency to anot her currency but the pegged rate needs to reflect the countrys economic realities th include for example changes in the volume and composition of its domestic output in the size composition and direction of its foreign trade in its domestic rates of growth and national income in the size of its reserves and in shifts in its domestic fiscal and monetary policies relative rates of pr oductivity and of change and technological advance the yuandollar exchange rate was largely unchanged from1994 to 2005 since reforms were announced in mid2005 it has changed very little some might argue that the fact that china held its exchange rate constant during this period is evidencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs24 61 see for example morris goldsteins argume nt to that effect china and the renminbi exchange rate in c fred bergsten and john williamson eds dollar adjustment how far against whom washington dc institute for international economics november 2004 special report 17 that china was not manipulating the yuan through finetuning of its valuation however manipulation can be as much lack of change as an act of change61 whether an unchanging exchange rated is violation of ar ticle iv depends on the way the country holds the rate constant china did not have to micromanage the daily rate for its currency in order to maximize its export opport unities they merely sold yuan whenever the yuandollar exch ange rate increased beyond the level the central bank desired chinese authorities used domestic monetary policy and other domestic economic practices to offset the effects of the fixed yuandollar rate economic conditions have changed mark edly in china since 1994 production and consumption patterns changed import and export patterns changed the relative value of goods and services and th relative value of bor capital and other factors of production changed the intern ational value of ch inas currency should have changed as well to reflect these chan ges among other things this would have produced price signals that could have changed consumption and production patterns promoted efficient and effective utilization of resources and improved the chinese peoples standard of living and level of real income the behavior of the yuandollar exchange rate after 1994 appears to be unrelated to underlying economic and financial conditions and is therefore consistent with the imfs second criterion for identifying currency manipulation prolonged foreign lending the imfs fourth criterion says that excessive and prolonged short term official or quasioffi cial lending for balance of payments purposes can be evidence that currency manipulation is taking place prolonged borrowing for the same purpos is also evidence of manipulation since 1994 chinas foreign exchange rese rves have grown sixteenfold from 53 billion to 819 billion some of the funds in chinas foreign exchange reserves are equity investments most however ar loans to foreign governments or private borrowers for example chinas investment in us government debt has more than tripled in the past five years from 71 billion in 2000 to 242 billion in 2005 by definition these are loans to the us gove rnment and they are shortterm in the sense that they can be liquidated at any time through sales in security markets they help the united states cover its balance of payments current account deficit and they help china adjust its balance of payments in way which does not require it to spend its international income on purchases of goods and services from abroad at least on the part of china this appears to be the kind of behavior to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment in the words of article iv that meets the imfs fourth test fo r currency manipulation influence on capital movements the imfs fifth criterion says that conversation with country mig ht be in order if it eviden ces the pursuit for balance of payments purposes of monetary and ot her domestic policies that provide abnormalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs25 encouragement or discouragement to capital flows many observers say that the growing size of chinas reserves show s that its government is promoting an abnormal outflow of capital for bop purposes the chinese government purchases large amounts of foreign exchange in order to maintain the price of its currency thus foreign money is less available to chinese citizens and firms than it might be otherwise consequently instead of being cleared on the current account thr ough imports and other current activity chinas balance of payments is cleared through the capital account by large additions to chinas foreign exchange reserves many analysts agree that chinas reserves are larger than its normal trade or financial needs would require they are larger for example than any need china is likely to face if its international income s uddenly declined as result for instance of an economic shock orig inating elsewhere in the world economy and it needed money for while to pay for imports or to service debt in this light many would argue with reference to the imf criterion noted above that continued expansion of chinas foreign exchange reserves is not just an encouragement for the outward flow of capital but an encouragemen t for abnormal flows as well some would argue in addition that the c ontinued growth of chinas reserves is inconsistent with provisions of the imf charter article iv also stipulates that all members shall seek to promote stability by fostering orderly underlying economic and financial conditions and monetary system that does not tend to produce erratic disruptions every dollar that china adds to its reserves is dollar that some other country adds to its foreign debt arguab ly the accumulation of large reserves and large debts does not enhance the stability of the world financial and trading system countries with large foreign exchange rese rves do not import as much as they could and debtor countries have diffi culty retiring their foreign obligations by trade in that sense high reserves are not formal trade barrier but they have the same effect they hamper the expansion and balanced gr owth of international trade one of the purposes stated in its articles of agreement for which the imf was created china is not the only country accumulating large reserves but many would argue that its practices are source of concern chinas view chinese officials say they are not seeking unfair trade advantage they only want exchange ra stability to protect their economy from destabilizing change the result however is the same chinese officials say that whatever the technicalities might be the ec onomic benefits of stability are important and are shared by many countries more over they could argue their efforts to influence exchange rates through intervention in currency markets differ little in their effect from similar action which countri with floating exchange rates take to influence their currencies exchange rates changes in interest rates and other policies for example furthermore they might say japan and other asian countries also buy dollars in order to keep down the value of their currencies and to stimulate their exports arguably they would argue it is unfair to single out china in thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs26 62 for discussion of japans efforts at currency manipulation see crs report rl33178 japans currency intervention current issues by dick k nanto see also jt

institute november 3 2005 available from the china page on the imf website regard when others do the same thing nd their trade impact on the us economy is at least as great as that of china62 how fast should china revalue if china can continue to contain the inflationary pressures caused by rapid growth in its economy and its foreign exch ange reserves it can probably delay for some time any need for major change in the dollar value of its currency unlike countries with overvalued currencies it w ill not run out of foreign exchange if it postpones the decision rather its fo reign exchange reserves will grow china could increase the value of the yuan overnight to much higher level if it wished to do so however chinese offi cials are concerned that toofast and too steep an increase could hurt the growth rate employment rate and reform prospects of the chinese economy chin officials say they want to shift away from export led growth towards an econo mic program focused more on growth in the internal economy however they do not want to slow down the export sector until their internal economy is able to provide th growth they need to continue the transformation process now underway thes considerations seem to suggest that revaluation should take place gradually however if speculative capital flows are problem as discussed below they may want to delay the pr ocess considerably most experts agree that chinas current situation is not sustainable and they cannot postpone revaluation of the yuan indefinitely if nothing is done to slow the growth of chinas foreign exchange reserves for instance inflation may eventually push up domestic prices in china and raise its export prices experts differ though as to how quickly china should move toward s marketbased exchange system the imf says gradual approach is needed in july 2005 the imf staff proposed that china adopt phased approach in moving towards full exchange rate flexibility63 more recently the director of the imfs research department urged deliberate pace64 experience has shown he said th at emerging markets do not handle large rapid exchange rate movements well in china he suggested rapid change might disrupt or bankrupt major segments of the economy particularly the banking system and make reform long drawnout and painful process other experts believe that policy reform must occur more quickly some say that chinas undervalued currency is hurtin g other countries nd fairness requires rapid action to remedy the s ituation some suggest that china risks financial

thomas lum and dick k nanto imf figure citedif it does not revalue soon65 one says that rapid revaluation is needed because chinas emphasis on exportled growth makes it vulnerable to any slowdown in global demand66 otherwise they say china risks being another asian miracle country like those that went bust during the asian financial crisis in the 1990s many also believe quick action is needed because the current economic relationship between the united states and ch ina is unstable and harbors serious risk roubini and setser argue for instance that change is inevitable and the only question is how it will take place67 smooth landing is possible they say if chinese officials lessen chinas emphasis on exports and the accumulation of reserves and us policy makers reduce their countrys dependence on foreign loans and capital otherwise they believe some unforseen ev ent may trigger crisis which could have serious negative conseque nces for both countries is china hiding its real trade surplus some people argue that chinas trade surplus is many times larger than the amount which china publishes in its official statistics the china currency coalition says for instance that chinas trade bala nce was nearly six times larger in 2003 than its official statistics suggest68 imf data show that in 2004 th 156 countries it categorized as world had combined trade deficit with china of 267 b illion roughly six and onehalf times more than trade surplus of 41 billion that china reported that year69 if chinas trade income were the larger of these figures this would be strong evidence the yuan is undervalued in theory the net trade figures repor ted by exporter and importer countries should match in practice th data are often inconsistent there is strong reason to believe that methodological reasons account for much of the discrepancy in data perhaps countries keep better count of thei r imports than their exports perhaps the figures are confused and intermingled wh products are impor ted and reexported or when inputs from several sources are ch anneled through fina l exporter countries the imfs direction of trade statistics dots shows in any case that when the exports of all countries to ev ery country are subtracted from the imports every country receives from all countries the world had 269 billion trade deficithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs28 70 imf direction of trade statistics 2005 yearbook p 2 the dots data are computed on somewhat different basis than are those for individual countries on this table industrial countries are net exporters and

73with itself in 200470 other countries show simila r disparities between the trade balances they report and those re ported by their trade partners71 in 2005 the imf executive board noted weaknesses in china s bop statistics in its annual article iv review in 2005 and it urged the chinese au thorities to take dvantage of funds technical assistance to help improve them72 the china currency coalition says however that china is hiding the ball by deliberately reporting incorrect trade statistics it believes the figure reported by importer countries more accurately reflects chinas net income from trade this is further evidence the coalition says that the yuan is seriously overvalued if this is correct china must be r eceiving over 200 billion more each year from trade income than it reports in that case the money must be somewhere china could not have spent this money on imports as it would have then shown up in the trade statistics of the exporter countries it seems unlikely that chinese exporters would have brought this add itional foreign currency back into china if they had the peoples bank of china would have had to spend three times more yuan than the amount officially announced to keep the yuan at the pegged rate the inflationary impact of these additional yuan would be substantial and would have manifested itself through rapidly increasin g domestic price levels alternatively the presumed 200 billi on in extra annual revenue might have been held abroad this would require the cooperation of chinese officials since it would mean that roughly 80 of chinas trade income each year does not come back to china it seems unlikely that china has been giving the money away since this would make it the worlds largest foreign aid donor ten times the size of the united states and international effects of its generosity would be evident possibly if the money exists and is not the product of methodological flaw the government of china might have accumulated it annually into secret foreign exchange reserves this would mean again if the money exists that china has perhaps 1 trillion in clandestine funds invested in other count ries over and above its announced official reserves even if china were only using this money to acquire revenue not influence it would be difficult to hide if the assets were registered as chinese at the time of purchase for instance they woul d likely show up in host country statisticshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs29 as another possibility if the government of china does not control the money then it might be held by chinese citizens and companies in any other country the fact that people prefer to hold foreign cu rrencies rather than their own currency might be taken as evidence of capital flight it might suggest that people in the know believe the yuan is overpriced and likely to crash keeping their assets in foreign currencies would be way of protecting themselves against that eventuality for china however the general view is one suggesting that the yuan will be going up in value and foreign currencies will go down in value compared to it it seems unlikely that chinese insiders would see the situation so differently from the common view or that they would have been able to hold secret this big for so long the above scenarios are not be impossibl but they seem unlikely it seems more likely that the 200 billion difference in the trade data reported by china and its trade partners is not real money rather it is probably the result of methodological and procedural error ch inas real export figures may be higher or its trading partners import figures may be lower than the reported amounts we do not know caution in the use of published data would seem ppropriate it is probably not good idea t hough to ignore or discard the existing body of world trade and finance statistics just because some of the data do not match the imf and its member countries might scrutinize their procedures to see whether errors and inaccuracies of this sort can be reduced or eliminated over time would revaluation help the us economy symbiotic relationship the dollaryuan exchange rate is not determined in vacuum rather the relationship betw een the two currencies reflects the broader relationship between the countries which i ssue them the rates are the consequence of each countrys economic pr iorities and the way those priorities interact the united states needs to import capital from abroad to finance its present level of economic activity without incurring higher interest rates consequently the international value of the dollar must be relatively high in order to encourage the inflow of capital china needs to encour age exports in order to stimulate economic growth and facilitate economic reform therefore fo r chinas purpose the value of the yuan must be low enough to encourage export growth so long as these are the main issues on each countrys economic agenda major changes in yuandollar exchange rate or the us trade deficit are unlikely the us imports capital the united states does not save enough domestically to finance simultaneously its preferred levels of consumption and investment and to cover the federal budget deficit by contrast other countries including several in asia save more than their economies can effectively absorb the united states needs more capital than it can generate on its own to sustain the us economy and foreigners need safe and profitable ways to invest their surplus funds this generates tinual inflow of foreign funds into the united states the inflow of funds in turn helps generate mo re demand for imported goods the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs30 73 see for example geoff dyer and andrew balls questions grow over chinas forex strategy ftcom london january 6 2006 p 1 74 for further discussion of the causes of the us trade deficit see crs report rl31032 the us trade deficit causes consequences and cures by craig elwell 75 not all would agree with this view one ma nufacturer notes for example that labor and other chinese content account for more than 30 of total operating costs for chinese exporters and with most materials costs denom inated in dollars content priced in yuan accounts for only about 20 of total costs if chinas currency were to increase in value the cost of the imported components would be unchanged and the price of chinas exports would need to be increased only marginally to recover the higher local costs see for example kathrin hille chinas currency shift frays nerves financial times august 7 2005 p 1 available from its we bsite at http wwwftcomcurrent account deficit equals about 6 of gdp and requires the united states to import more than 2 billion daily from abroad73 this capital inflow pushes up the exchange value of the dollar which lowers the relative price of imports nd generates corresponding inflow of foreign goods it is basic principle of economics that c ountries which are net borrowers of money from the world must be net importers of goods and services as well74 if the value of the yuan increased the volume of chinese exports and chinese capital flows to the united states would likely decrease75 in the short run us producers would probably take over share of the market previously supplied by chinese goods though consumers would likely have to pay more for those goods than they did for chinese imports profits and employments in those firms would likely increase if chinas trade balance declined under this s cenario its rate of investment in the united states would also likely decline in that case many economists believe us interest rates would probably increase this would likely have negative impact they expect on the housing market and w ith interest taking larger share of household income on consumer purchases over the longer run foreign production is likely to shift from china to other lowcost countries as their exports to th united states increase producers in these other countries would likely recover much of the market previously supplied by the chinese on the other hand higher interest rates in the united states might stimulate an inflow of capital from other foreign sources one can only speculate whether interest rates would eventually decline to their former level and what the impact these changes would have on the us economy china wants growth china for its part also has priorities other than an accurate valuation of the yuan chinese officials believe they need to pursue policy of exportled growth they believe thei r domestic economy is too inefficient to generate the levels of em ployment and resources need ed for economic reform and conversion of the economy from statedir ected to marketbased system they worry that the domestic economy cannot ot herwise absorb the unemployment being generated by reform in the rural sector nd stateowned enterprises they also worry that their banking system would be unable to allocate capital effectively or to cope with the speculative pressure that might follow the introduction of more flexible exchange rate system and mo re open capital markets

experts believe this rate cannot be sustained i ndefinitely given both the present levels of productiv ity and the strain and infla tionary pressure such growth places on the economy many believe china needs to slow down its growth rate in order to consolidate recent gains and to correct imbalances increasing the value of the yuan would help they say by sl owing the growth in reserves lowering inflationary pressures reducing the cost of imports raising per capita income reducing distortions and encouraging the fl ow of resources from the export sectors to the domestic economy however chines officials are reluctant to shift from policy of exportled growth to one based more on internal growth until they believe their domestic economy is mo re efficient and productive and economic reform has further progressed according to the imf most chinese offi cials believe they eventually need to liberalize the yuan and shift more to policy of domestic led growth76 senior chinese officials told the press in decem ber 2005 that the value of the yuan would be increasingly influenced by the market and the trend is for chinas currency to appreciate over time77 yu yongding member of the central banks policy committee said at the time that there is risk that inflation could be ignited if the exchange rate is not allowed to appreciate he also said that chinas foreign exchange reserves had been growing too fast many in the chinese leadership believe their country is not yet ready for substantial changes in the value of the yuan in any case they say efforts to resolve the imbalances in the world economy will re quire concerted acti on by many nations and china should not be expected to solve them alone78 three dilemmas for china intervention and reserves the peoples bank of china

china foreign exchange reserves many see them as potential financial threat to other countries many believe the growth in chinas reserves proves that its currency is undervalued and manipulated however the growth in chinas reserv causes problems as well for one thing it puts great pressure on chinas monetary system china cannot have an independent monetary policy since its domestic money supply grows at the size of its foreign reserves expands for every do llar bought by the central bank to maintain the peg the peoples bank of china creates 8 yuan which it gives to the seller the pbc has reportedly intervened in the curre ncy market at rate equal to about 12 of chinas gdp81 the imf says that only about half the liquidity caused by the increase in reserves has been sterilized that is removed from circulation through sales of government bonds82 thus the central bank has had to hold down the growth of credit and lending by state banks in order to keep this excess liquidity from causing inflation the june 2005 imf artic iv staff report urged china to wring more excess liquidity from the system and to tighten monetary policy still further the growth in chinas reserves also creates another problem roughly 70 of its reserves are held in dollars or dollarde nominated securities if the yuan should go up in value compared to the dollar the value of chinas reserves will go down and china would lose great deal of money83 if change in the value of the yuan visa vis the dollar is inevitable then chinese officials might want to act quickly to revalue the yuan because the problem will only get wo rse the longer they wait on the other hand if they raise the value of the yuan too much they will lose large amounts of money unnecessarily further if the change in the value of the yuan is gradual process china might reduce the size of its exposure if it gradually shifted some of its present dollardenominated assets into other currencies the state agency for foreign exchange announced in midjanuary 2006 that it would be actively exploring more efficient use of our fx foreign exchange reserve assets and widening the foreign ex change reserves scope it said it wanted to optimize the currency and asset structur of chinas reserves and to actively boost investment returns84 some market analysts thought this meant that chinahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs33

us interest rates will increase large sale of chinas dollar assets could also drive down us security prices intended to sell some of its dollardenominated assets85 their alarm abated however when it

chinas foreign exchange reserves are growing because the countrys central bank is buyin g dollars and other foreign currencies in order to stabilize the market price of the yuan the question is where

balance is the net sum of countrys exports and imports of goods and services plus its net income from foreign investment the capital account balance is the net sum of all the monetary flows to or from country net foreign investme nts loans made or received transfers by indi viduals remittances from migra nt workers for example and other transactions needed to fi nance activity in the current account conceptually the current account nd capital account balances should cancel each other out one being positive and the othe r negative imports which are not paid for with current revenue for example w ould have to be financed directly or indirectly by capital from abroad in f act however some fina ncial and commercial transactions are not recorded and the current account or capital account is often larger than the other to make the two part s of the bop match economists add third figure called errors and omissions eo which acknowledges that for unexplained reasons more money is in one account or the other this may reflect income from illegal trade mismeasurement or undisclosed m ovement of money by individuals capital flight seeking to protect their assets from an expected change in the exchange rates or by speculators hoping to profit from that change analyzing chinas bop table 1 breaks chinas balance of payments figures into these three components it also provi des separate figures in the capital account for foreign direct investment prasad and wei the au thors of the table identified the annual changes in chinas foreign exchange re serves and the amounts recorded for each element of chinas balance of payments and they present the average annual amounts for each item for the first three and the last four years of the 1998 to 2004 period86 from that data they derive the amount of change which occurred in each instance between the first and the last lves of that sevenyear period on first inspection looking only at the ddle column it seems that most of the growth in chinas reserves was due to trade and investment between 2001 and 2004 prasad and wei note chinas net annual current account balance was 422 billion while the net inflow from fdi was 466 billion87 it appears therefore thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs35 87 continued countries accounted for 60 of the to tal see prasad and wei p 79 88 portfolio investment in china cooling down the economist january 28 2006 p 73the 888 b illion from these two sources accounted for most of the 128 billion average annual increase in chinas foreig n exchange reserves during that period prasad and wei find however that other factors particularly the inflow of hot money were mo re important as table 1 also shows comparing the first and second columns that the average annual vel of chinas foreign exchange reserves grew by 85 billion from 1998 to 2000 and by 1228 billion from 2001 to 2004 in column 3 prasad and wei found that the annual change in chinas trade receipts 185 billion and fdi 81 billion shown in column three were not sufficient to account for the average 1143 billion in chinas reserves on the other hand the swing in flows from nonfdi investme nt and eo were substantial between 1998 and 2000 they observe capita l flowed out of china openly non fdi or covertly eo they specula that initially chinese firms and families moved money abroad to take advantage of favorable investment and exchange rate opportunities after 2001 however they suggest chinese firms and families and foreign speculators began moving money b ack into china in hopes of profiting from the expected increase in the value of the yuan they observe that as table 1 indicates the net flow of funds from non fdi investment and eo between the two periods amounted to an average 877 billion year nearly 77 of total change in chinas foreign exchange reserves during the 19982004 period policy implications the policy prescriptions ar different depending on the source if one wants to reduce the inflow of foreign currencies and to lessen the central banks incentive to sell yuan in foreign exchange markets if traderelated factors are the major reason why foreign exch ange is flowing to china then changes in the countrys trade policies and exchan ge rate would help diminish the flow chinas government would need to take steps in this scenario to shift resources and employment from the export s ector to the domestic economy on the other hand if hot money is responsible for the buildup in reserves then gradual appreciation in the value of the yuan might encourage further inflows of speculative funds in that case the central bank might cool the inflow of hot money by holding the value of the yuan constant for sustained period of time the economist reported in late january 2006 th at the delay and uncertainty of the new chinese exchange rate system may have had this effect88 the flow of portfolio capital investment one form of hot money declined to about 1 billion month in late 2005 it reported from the average level of 8 billion month seen from late 2003 through mid2005 it appears the economist suggests that the speculators who have been furiously pumpi ng money into china for the past three years have at last given up and gone home the magazine predicts that chinas trade surplus may also start to fall and import growth may revive httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs36 89 as noted earlier though china has announced that it will soon relax its controls over capital outflows it is unclear if this is precu rsor for greater future exchange flexibility or merely means to limit growth in chinas forex reserves 90 authors interview with imf staff december 2005 91 prasad and wei footnote 85 p 13if the data for the last part of 2005 are correct and if the economist s predictions are right and it is much too soon to know whether these are so then the peoples bank of china may have an easier time managing monetary policy in the future there would be less need for exampl for it to print yuan in order to keep down the value of the yuan by buying up the inflow of dollars this would make it easier if the pbc wishes to do so for the central bank to relax its control and to allow market forces more influence on the yuandollar exchange rate would revaluation hurt chinas banks many believe china needs to reform its financial system before the yuan can rise appreciably in value if revaluation occurs first they say the banking system may not be able to cope and this might have negative effect s on economic growth others believe however that while more reform is needed chinas banking system should be able to accommodate more flexibility in the value of the yuan nevertheless there is serious worry on the pa rt of many that floating exchange rate system could lead to destabilizing capital outflows89 the imf says that major steps have been taken to restructure the banking system even though further action is required and the condition of the banking system is longer an obstacle to exchange rate re form as result of recapitalization sales of nonperforming loans and other reform fforts the imf staff reported the capital strength asset quality and operating results for chinas banks have significantly improved in the old days state banks made loans to state industry with little expectation those loans would be repaid thus the savings of chinese individuals were sunk into subsidizing these moneylosing firms most of these legacy loans have been transferred to four governmentowned asset management cor porations amcs so the govern ment budget rather than the banking system will bear the cost of those bad loans consequently the imf reports bad loan ratios for the major commercial ba nks the four largest state banks and 14 joint stock commercial banks have fallen from about 24 of loans in 2002 to about 13 in september 200590 these institutions account for about threequarters of total bank assets they say that efforts to tighten the banks balance sheets and to strengthen their internal controls and risk management procedures are still needed the imf does not report figures for th ratio of bad loans nonperforming loans in the banking system as whole because the procedures for reporting bad loans by small banks are different from t hose for large banks two imf economists prasad and wei reported in their 2005 ar ticle that nonperforming loans in the banking system amounted to 30 of gdp in 200391 imf staff indicates that this larger figure calculates the bad loan ratio for smaller banks in the same way that

foreign exchange reserves may need to clear up the accumulated bad debt setser asserts that conditions in the chinese banking system are grim and the costs of reform will be great92 he says the banking system is not ready yet for more flexible currency bad debt in the ba nking system is equivalent to 20 or 30 of gdp he says officials estimates re ported that 40 of all loans in 2002 were nonperforming he indicates and legacy bad loans debt owed by state firms totaled 400 billion other estimates put the figure at 650 billion he says or about 50 of chinas 2002 gdp the recent boom in bank lending may have reduced the level to 25 or so he says however he suggests the total volume of bad debt may be higher once the bad loans made since 2002 are included in the total setser says that many analysts believe that the government will need to buy out the bad legacydebt if it wants to imp rove the soundness of the banking system the imfs statement see above that some bad loans were transferred out of the banking system seems to confirm this view setser says the government will also need to provide large amounts of money to stabilize its undercap italized state banks some estimates report he says that the cost of cleaning up the financial system could equal 20 of national gdp about 340 billion of chinas 2004 gdp and nearly all of it will be borne by the national government this could push the national debt togdp ratio he says from 33 in 2004 to perhaps 50 overall imf experts say that china does not need to resolve the problem of bad debt in its banking system before its currency can be liberalized they argue that so long as capital controls continue the yuandollar exchange rate could be more flexible without harming the chinese banks the chinese banks know how to trade currencies and manage their foreign exchange exposure the imf staff reports they already do this in their worldwide operations some economists believe that china cannot have flexible currenc until it ends capital controls93 imf experts argue however that chinas banks cannot handl full liberalization of the capital account at this juncture if capital controls were removed they assert substantial outflow of capital from the banks would likely occur and this would be very destabilizing94 options for the united states there are several ways the united states might encourage china to move more quickly towards increasing the value of the yuan these options or policy tools arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs38 95 some of these options are also discusse d with similar conclusions in crs report rl32165 chinas exchange rate peg by wayne m morrison and marc labonte not mutually exclusive but it might be difficult or awkward for the united states to pursue some of them simultaneously 95 first the us government might continue pressing china publicly for additional changes in its foreign exchange system in order to make the international value of the yuan better reflect market conditions and economic realities this assumes either that china is reluctant to change or that reformers in china will be helped by external stimulus second the us government might stop pressing china publicly for change this option is predicated on the expectation that reformers will be able to move china more rapidly towards currency liberalization if china is not pressured from abroad third the united states could enact legislation restricting chinese exports to the united states if the value of the yuan is not increased this assumes that china will change its exchange rate policies only if forced to do so fourth the us government might refer the question to the imf asking the international agency to determine whether china has been mani pulating its currency in violation of imf rules this assumes that technical finding s and persuasion by the imf and its major member countries may have ffect fifth the us government might refer the issue to the world trade organization wto alleging that the united states has been injured by unfair trade practices linked to the undervaluation of chinas currency if the wto found that the us petition had mer it it could authorize trade remedies to correct the allege abuse this assumes that exchange rate issues and questions of general systemwide subsidy will fall within the purview of the wto rules continue public pressure continued public pressure is one method the united states might use to encourage china to adopt further reforms in its foreign exchange procedures this might include official findings by the treasury department that china is manipulator or strong exhortations by highl evel us officials among other things us officials might press chinese officials to provide them more information as to the ways they intend to link reform of their domestic economy to reform in their exchange rate regime and the criteria th ey might use for discerning progress in evaluating this option it would be he lpful to know whether chinese officials really intend to move towards marketbased valuation of the yuan or whether they intend to drag the process out as long as possible if china adopted the reforms announced to date mainly in response to foreign pressure then it is possible that further pressure might persuade them to go faster however if chinese officials adopted these reforms because they believe that marketbased reform is in chinas best interests foreign pressure may complicate this process china has long tradition of not giving in to foreign pressu re foreign pressure might strengthen the hand of the reformers but it might also stiffen resistence by the opponents of reform and make it harder for the refo rmers to achieve their ends it also might be helpful if us officials and legislators had more information about chinas internal decision making process how strong are the reformershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs39 what key choices do chinese officials belie ve they face as regards the economy and value of the yuan how do they think chin and other countries can best determine what the true international value of the yuan might be what criteria do they believe are relevant for determining currency value and their timetable for change given their most recent statements ot her g7 countries will likely support the united states if it continue s to press china for more rapid action however they may also back away and leave the united states on its own if they believe us efforts are potentially counterproductive pursue policy of restraint instead of pressing china publicly for reform the united states might decide on policy of restraint this is not an option in favor of the status quo rather it accepts the premise that chinese officials want to proceed with their reform program as rapidly as economic conditions and the policy consensus in china permits this option assumes that overt foreign pressure may be counterproduc tive if it slows the process and strengthens the hand of thos in china who oppose reform arguably the treasury department has shown restraint of this sort when it said in its recent reports that china was not manipula ting the value of its currency some might argue that the united stat should view the trade and currency dispute within the context of its overall relationship with china while economic issues are important this view would ggest it is also important not to raise tensions to the point where china become s reluctant to coopera with the united states on other issues such as north ko reas policies on nuclear weapons pressing the yuandollar exchange rate issue to the exclusion of other important us interests might be seen from this perspective as counterproductive others might respond however that china will coope rate with the united states in other areas when it believes that this serves its interests china may have strong reasons for wanting change in its foreign exchange system as noted before china faces the prospect of serious inflation if it does not slow or stop the growth in its foreign exchange reserves an increase in the value of its currency would be key way of accomplishing that goal ironically some kind of external encouragement may still be needed to help china accomplish its plans even if chin authorities want to move forward with their reform program they may need some external pressure if only in the form of agreed deadlines and benchmarks to help them overcome inertia when they encounter difficult choices as they put th eir currency reform policies into effect restrict exports to the united states instead of exerting public and mostly ve rbal pressure the united states could adopt legislation restricting chinas access to the us market until it raises the value of its currency there are several ways this could be done the english bill hr 3282 ryanhunter bill hr 1498 nd schumergraham bill s 295 all mentioned above would have this effect by raising the us price of chinesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs40 96 section 301 to 309 of the trade act of 1974 as amended see also crs report 98454 section 301 of the trade act of 1974 as amende d its operations and issues involving its use by the united states by wayne m morrison see for example china currency coalition factsheet footnote 3 97 see crs report rs20570 trade remedies and the usch ina bilateral wto accession agreement by william h cooperimports they would presumably reduce the flow of chinese exports to the united states raise the prices paid by us consumers perhaps helping some us producers and stimulate the growth of expor t industries in other countries that would take chinas place similar effects would likely occur if the us government invoked the provisions of section 301 authorizing the us trade representative to respond to unreasonable or discriminatory practices th at burden or restrict us commerce 96 likewise if the treasury partment found in its semia nnual report that china was manipulating the value of its currency to the detriment of the united states consultations with china and trade acti ons would also be required under the section 301 mechanism the united states could impose trade sanctions against chinese goods if china does not change its trade or foreign exchange policies the united states could also use other us trade laws to impose special safeguard restrictions on chinese goods if the growth in chinese imports is found to have caused or threatens to cause market disruption to us domestic produce97 measures of this sort are allowable unde r wto rules on tem porary or limited basis but it is less clear that they may be used across the board or for longer periods it is not clear how much the price of chinese goods would need to increase or the volume of chinese exports to the unite d states would decrease though if the value of the yuan increased components purchased from other countries account for major share of the value of exports bearing the label made in china the cost of malaysian or thai inputs would not change for the producer in china if the value of the yuan increased the price of the fina l product would only need to increase by an amount sufficient to recover the higher cost of the producers that were denominated in yuan depending on the products and thods of production it is possible that the overall increase in product costs would be modest and the volume of chinese exports to the united states would be large even after the value of the yuan increased it is uncertain what the chinese aut horities and chinese firms would do if faced with restrictive import legislation of this sort they might cut prices and trim profits in order to keep unchanged their share of us markets they might retaliate against us exports setting off trade war between the united states and china they might also ask the wto for authority to levy trade sanctions on grounds that the united states was not complying with the wto rules on international trade alternatively they might raise the value of the yuan in hopes that this will eliminate the new us tariffs on their goods the wto trade rules allow countries to levy countervailing duties to offset any subsidies foreign exporters might receive from their home governments wto rules do not allow countries to impose tariffs or restrictions merely for the purpose ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs41 98 for discussion of the wto dispute re solution mechanism see crs report rs20088 dispute settlement in the world trade organization by jeanne j grimmettexcluding foreign goods if the united stat hopes to persuade other countries that its special levies on chinese imports are fair and compensatory it will likely need to show that the size of the levies match the degree of subsidy which chinese producers receive through the undervalued yuan it might be helpful in this regard if there were more agreement among scholars and the aff ected countries as to whether and by how much chinas currency is undervalued if the united states put special levies on chinese goods china might ask the wto to rule that the united states acted in manner inconsistent with its obligations98 the countervailing duties and an tidumping penaltie s allowed under wto rules are usually applied to specific goods rather than to all exports coming from particular country exchange rate manipulation might be seen as type of general acrosstheboard subsidy for count rys exports nevertheless there is little precedent but see below at the wto for considering exchange rates from this perspective the wto may be concerned th at the rules governing world trade would be harder to enforce if countries were free to impose countervailing duties whenever they decided unilaterally that the currenc ies of other countri were undervalued if the wto agreed with chinas petiti on it could authorize china to retaliate by withdrawing tariff concessions on u s goods the wto dispute settlement process is adjudicated with reference to the wto rules and there seems little room for political pressure by the united states and other countries ot her countries could however submit briefs in support of th us or the chin position countries likely will give some thought to the potentia l impact that trade dispute between the united states and china might have mo re broadly on world trade negotiations if the volume of chinese exports to the united states declines because of new trade legislation the profits of foreign firms located in china which produce those goods will likely go down as well expor ters could shift th eir production facilities further to the west in china where labor costs are lower than on the coast this might reduce costs enough for chinese exporte rs to pay the new tariff and leave their prices unchanged alternatively chinese companies and international firms might shift production to other countries where th costs of production have become lower than those in china because of yuan reva luation in that case these countries might replace china as major suppliers of manuf actured products to the united states if the united states wants to keep out foreign products not just chinese products which undersell us manufactures then new legislation would be needed to penalize other countries as they ramp up to take chinas place this would violate wto rules and the terms of international trade agreements to which the united states is party because the us ec onomy needs to import foreign goods of similar value to the foreign capital it imports each year it may be hard for the us government to stop countries from expandi ng their exports to the united states role if the volume of imports declines however prices for manufactured products in the united states may increase giving us producers some relief ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs42 99 paul blustein imf chief pressured on trade

of their income in this case to purchase the goods which were previously produced abroad take it to the imf the united states could also pursue the issue of chinas exchange rate policy at the international monetary fund the key issue is whether china is complying with the requirements of ar ticle iv of the imf articles of agreement and if not what steps it should take to comply thoug h other countries seem to have preferred that the united states take the lead and break the ice for them they are also affected by chinas trade policies arguably international meetings where representatives of the major countries may speak with ch inese officials at the same time will be more persuasive than scattered bilateral talks where the only strong public statements come from the united states there continues to be debate as to wh at if anything the outside world can do to accelerate the reform process in china in late september 2005 treasury under secretary adams demanded that the imf cr ack down on countries that violate the prohibition in article iv against currenc manipulation though it is not clear what tools he thought the imf should use99 the imf was he said asleep at the wheel and it should confront china concerning the ficiencies in its exchange rate policies imf managing director rodrigo rato rejected that charge100 the i mf was addressing all aspects of the issue he replied the imf had already investigated and rejected suggestions that chinas curre ncy policies warrant the use of special consultations rather he suggested the united states should act more vigorously to straighten out its own budget and econo mic policies rather than blaming other countries for its problems according to imf sources special cons ultations between imf management and country have occurred twice previously in response to formal complaints by another country that it was manipulating its curre ncy in the 1990s the united states made complaint about korea and germany file d complaint about sweden the two countries eventually adjusted their curre ncy values though they may have done this for their own reasons rather than in response to imf consultations in january 2006 adams maintained that the imf should play stronger role enforcing exchange rates and preventing currency manipulation101 the imf should demonstrate strong leadership on multilateral

given the power to police exchange rates and bop policies it would probably start with the industrial count ries whose policies have the greatest impact on the world economy rather than middle income countries such as china enhanced role for the imf restoring its central role on exchange rates while adams did not mention china by name he said the imf shoul d identify countries whose exchange rate policies might not be in accord with fund principles and it should seek to identify problematic or in appropriate exchange rate behavior however imf managing director rato told session at the world economic forum in davos switzerland that he does not consider china to be currency manipulator he rejected proposals that the fund should put greater pressure on china he said there is tradeoff be tween our role as conf idential adviser in our surveillance work and our role as transparent judge102 he noted that the imf had been the first international body to urge china to move from its fixed peg to more flexible exchange rate process rato so said the imf should not take proactive role on exchange rates in response to adams question what the imf should do about countries that are ttempting to thwart balance of payments adjustments on february 9 2006 rato outlined his future plans for the imf he said the imf should put more emphasis on surveillan ce but he raised several reservations about the funds taking the central policing role adams had proposed103 the imf is place where the views of ffected countries can be presented to china and efforts can be made to press china to revalue its currency the imf cannot force countries to have exchan ge rate policies which mirror underlying economic conditions even if they might be noncompliant with imf rules however continuing discussion at the imf and at othe r international meetings serves to focus attention on the issue at the least it puts chinese officials in situation where they need to explain or justify their policies nd to respond in some way to international pressure arguably it has caused them to take steps towards liberalization that they otherwise might be reluctant to take or they might have ta ken more slowly if these conversations had not taken place if the imf were given the broader author ity contemplated by adams and others the fundamental structure of the world exchange rate system would change and many countries in addition to china would have to seriously revise their domestic and international economic policie s china might not be willing to make fundamental changes in its foreign exchange and ec

and 30 members of congress petitioned the us trade representative separately asking the administration to take action of this sort the undervalued exchange rate for the yuan is kind of subsidy for chinese exports they argue it lowers the cost of production in china and enables chinese exporters to sell products abroad at prices lower than their real costs of production should allow they believe this is an unfair practice which is inconsistent with the rules of the world trading system and they appear to believe that wto dispute settlement panel would support that view if the issue were put before it the administration rejected the two petitions however104 officials expressed doubt th at the united states could win case of this sort in the wto though they did not detail the reasons for their doubt they also said that action to ch allenge chinas exchange rate and trade policies in the wto might be more damaging than helpful at this time105 the wto and imf have formal agreement between them which specifies that certain kinds of international finance issues shall be referred to the imf for judgment if they come up in the context of wto deliberations and the imfs findings will be considered conclusive106 the scope of the agreement is discussed below chinas critics acknowledge that the wto has authority to adjudicate exchange rate issues some believe however that if the united states complained to the wto that china was manipulating its currency in orde r to gain unfair trade advantage and the imf agreed the wto could authorize the united states and other countries to put special tariffs on chinese goods these woul d stay in effect until china raised the value of its currency this section discusses whether appealing this issue to the wto is feasible alternative

issue108 there are several issues with the china scenario discussed above first some critics may misconstrue the nature and extent of the agreement between the imf and the wto the agreement has to do

provisions which allow countries to impos temporary trade barriers in order to safeguard their external financial situ ation certain fina ncial and balance of payments conditions must be present

july 2002 pp 561599 111 second amendment to the imf articles of agreement approved april 30 1976 and entered into force april 1 1978 the only exchange rate system prohibited by the new language of the imf articles is the one where countries defined the value of their currency in terms of gold the golddollar system had been the key feature of the fixed parity exchange system and exchange rate policy are not mentioned in the interagency agreement between the wto and imf or in the text of the gatt itself 110 second the key issue is not so much wh ether chinas exchange policy gives it unfair advantages in international trade but whether this is kind of subsidy which is prohibited by wto rules when chinese officials say they need to keep their currency at roughly its present rate because an increase might bankrupt large sectors of chinas export economy they are admittin g that their exchan ge rate subsidizes exports however the wto has specific finition as to the types of things which are subsidies and therefore prohibited unde r its rules currency manipulation is not included among them when the core rules and obligations of the world trading system were laid down in 1947 with the adoption of the gatt the world was on fixedparity exchange rate system managed by the imf it wa s difficult during this period for countries to manipulate their exchange rates in order to gain unfair trade advantage during the 1970s the fixed rate system broke down and the rules of the imf were changed to allow countries to have floating fixe d or whatever other types of exchange rate systems they desire111 the imf was given the task of monitoring surveillance exchange rates but as discussed above it was given effective means of enforcing its rule article iv against currency ma nipulation for its part the gatt did not amend its rules when the imf procedures changed to take into account the possibility that countries might use exchange rate ma nipulation as trade policy tool the wto likewise took steps when it was formed to f ill this apparent lac in the rules and obligations of the world trading regime the wto defines the concept subsidy in very specific terms if governments actions do not meet the terms of the definition even if they benefit exporters or cause trade injury they are not actionable subject to challenge for purposes of the wto dispute adjudication process further to be actionable subsidies must be specific to an indus try specificity the wto agreement onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs47 112 agreement on subsidies and countervailing duties articles 1

are defined as subs idies contingentupon export performance the ascm deems export subsidies to be per specific domestic subsidies are not prohibited but may be challenged if they cause trade injury as specified in the ascm subsidies that are not directly export contingent are also not allowed if 1 the government makes financ ial contribution and 2 it benefits the recipients government financial support can take variety of forms such as direct payments to the exporter the waiver of tax payments or other revenue that would otherwise be collected from the exporter or special gove rnment purchases or the provision of low cost goods and services other than genera l infrastructure which lowers the cost of production tax subsidies to broad categ ories of exporters through mechanisms such as foreign sales corporations also meet the test for specificity the wto agreement makes mention of subsidies provided through exchange rate practices or monetary policy all of the subsidies mentioned in the agreement occur on the fiscal side of th governments ledger and involve direct cost to the government some legal an alysts believe that though doing so would be difficult it might be possible to challenge chinas actions in the wto113 benitah suggests for instance that if the united states were able to show that chinas fixed exchange rate is facto export subsid it could take advantage of the per specificity language he also suggests that chinas fi xed rate might be viewed as form of in kind subsidy similar to that prohibited by the ascm other legal commentators believe however that the likelihood that the wto would view chinas exchange rate practices as prohibited subsidy are at best very slim114 some critics of chinas exchange rate policies have sought to circumvent this difficulty by arguing that china pays di rect subsidy to chinese exporters through its exchange rate policy the direct financial support occurs they say because chinese exporters receive more yuan in ex change for the dollars they earn from trade than they would if the yuan were valued correctly an exporter might receive 8 yuan from the central bank today when it exchanges its dollars for yuan whereas it might receive 7 yuan instead if the yuan were valued appropriately that extra yuan is subsidy to exporters the theory holds and it is therefore direct violation of wto trade agreements115httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs48 the idea that exports can be subsidized in this fashion seems to contradict the normally accepted concepts about international monetary transactions moreover the effects on the world trading system would be considerable if the idea were accepted and applied to all countries the chinese are perhaps more blatant in the way their official actions effect currenc values but most governments do things from time to time which influence the value of their national currency if central bank lowers interests rates and the exchange value of its currency declines one could argue that the central bank is making its national exports more competitive and increasing the amount in local currency th at its national exporters earn from trade likewise an increase in exchange rates might be seen as an effort to purchase goods from other countries for less than their tr ue value or to reduce the price that countrys foreign investors would need to pa in real terms for foreign acquisitions if every change in the exchange rate for currency is deemed to provide subsidy or raise barrier to trade then the current rules of the world trading system would be unworkable in world of floating or inaccurately fixed exchange rates some would also argue that the concept that exchange rate differences can provide subsidy to exporters is fundame ntally flawed regardless of the exchange rate the exporter receives dollars worth of its local currency whatever the current rate might be when the local currency goes up in value the exporter receives less local currency but each unit is more valuab than before imported goods would also be cheaper and dollars worth of local currency would buy more foreign goods than before firms that use imports as part of their commercial process would see their costs decline proportionally in any case the presumed subsidy implicit in the yuan exchange rate is not paid solely to exporters as likely would be nece ssary for it to be found in violation of the direct payment and export contingency provisions of the ascm anybody exporters tourists banks or persons wishin g to buy yuan in order to make foreign investments in china receives the same exchange rate for their money it is also not clear that the exchange rate subsidy is paid by the government or at the governments behest many organizations in china buy and sell currency and while the central bank continues to ve substantial effect on currency prices market forces determine the context in which the central bank exerts its influence if an exporter sells dollars to co mmercial bank the implicit subsidy in the transaction would be paid by the bank nd not the government if chinese exports were priced in yuan the purchaser would ve to sell dollars and buy yuan in order to settle its bill in that case the purchaser would pay any subsidy that is implicit in the transaction it appears that strict interpretation of the wtos current rules would provide little latitude for finding that chinas exchange rate practices constitute subsidy for exports insofar as that term is used within the wto the united states has taken strict construction view of the wto rules special trade representative susan schwab told congress in may 2006 for ex ample that the united states has emphasized the necessity for strict adhe rence to the rules negotiating mandate which requires that the effectiveness and basic principles of the wto antidumpinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs49 116 written responses to senate finance committee questions for the record the honorable susan schwab may 17 2006 p 31 available at httpwwwglobalservicesnetworkcomschwabquestionspdf 117 ibid p 40 and subsidies agreements must be preserved116 efforts by other countries to interpret the rules more broadly or flexibly have been met she said by vigorous us attacks schwab also said that initiating wto case on this matter currency manipulation would place china in the positi on of defending rather than reforming its currency regime117 this would be the first occasion where the wto was asked to resolve currency dispute she said nd it would therefore ve an unpredictable outcome and take relatively long time to reach completion some suggest that wto decision against the us position coul d have the effect of making currency manipulation an implicitly acceptable practi ce under the wto result quite contrary to us goals schwab said that tinued dialog with china about its currency regime would likely be mo re constructive means for resolving this concern article iv of the imf charter prohib its countries from manipulating their exchange rates for the purpose of gaining an unfair trade advantage giving the imf the authority to enforce that provision of its charter would be one way of addressing the currency manipulation problem howeve r as noted above this could require major changes in the structure of the worl d financial system nd it could give the imf new authority over the economic polic ies of its member countries many countries might be reluctant to adopt fa rreaching changes of this sort merely to address the exchange rate aspects of controversy about international trade it might be possible to address this issue through adjustments in the rules governing world trade it could be argued for example that restrictions on currency manipulation should be included in the ru of the wto in order to make its procedures consistent with the requirements of the articles of agreement of the imf the imf may not have the effective au thority to enforce the prohibition in its articles of agreement against currency ma nipulation for the purpose of unfair trade advantage this does not mean however th at the world must live with the problem of currency manipulation and contrary effects it may have on the relative efficiency of international production nd the patterns of internati onal trade the wto could choose instead to incorporate this same prohibition against currency manipulation into its own text in order to take deleterious trade effects into account there are two ways the united states might seek to make exchange rate manipulation actionable within the wto dispute settlement framework if it wished to pursue the issue first it could raise the issue during the doha round trade negotiations second it could raise the issue separately at the wto governing council or the wto ministerial conferen ce in hopes of garnering sufficient majority to reinterpret the wto rules or to amend the trade agreements in both cases the goal would be adoption of change s in the wto language in order to make exchange rate manipulation prohibited trade practice httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs50 118 articles of agreement of the wto articles ix and x see also an explanation of these procedures in john h jackson william j davey and alan sykee jr legal problems of international economic rela tions cases materials and text 4th ed st paul mn west publishing company 1995 pp 2245 first the united states might broach the issue in the current world trade negotiations the doha round of trade negotiations is currently discussing major changes in the basic ground rules for world trade as well as possible adjustments in tariff rates the united states could ask that the currency manipulation issue should be added to the agenda there are already many difficult subjects on the agenda however and the wto members have not ye t agreed on framework for negotiating the most contentious issues before them adding another contr oversial issue to the agenda may not make the task of the ne gotiators any easier on the other hand nobody knows at this point how many c ountries might want to make currency manipulation actionable under wto rules alternatively the united states could raise the issue of currency manipulation in the wtos governing council and in th biannual meeting of its ministerial conference the doha round negotiations s eem to be in trouble and it may be too late as practical matter to add anothe r controversial issue to the agenda the ministerial conference consists of the trade ministers of all the wto member countries these are the top policy making bodies of the wto positive action by them could lead to change in wto treatment of the exchange rate issue either through reinterpretation of the existing wto rules or through amendment to the international agreements themselves118 article ix of the agreement establishing the world trade organization wto agreement says that decisions shall be ma by consensus however it says when consensus cannot be achieved decisions sha ll be made on the basi s of majority of the votes cast each country having one vot interpretation of the charter and of international trade agreements and amendments to those documents require higher majority however to be effective article ix of the wto charter says that the general council and minister ial conference have exclusive authority to adopt interpretations of the wto agreement and the multilateral trade agreements such as the gatt gats trips ascm etc interpretations are to be based on recommendations of the council and require an affirmativ vote of threequarters of the entire wto membership in theory threequarters vote of the general council and ministerial conference could interpret the existing trade rules in such way as to make exchange rate manipulation for the purpose of gain ing unfair trade advantage actionable under wto rules however article ix says th at the interpretation clause should not be used to undermine the amendment clause rticle x of the wto charter the procedural difficulties of using article ix are daunting threequarters vote of the entire membership is required yet at most meetings of the wto less than that share of the membership is in attendance at any one time nevertheless there are sections of the gatt which might be considered anew in terms of their contemporary relevance article xv says for instance that the contracting parties shall not by exchange action frustrate the intent of the provisions of this agreement nor by tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs51 119 telephone conversation between the aut hor and john h jackson professor of international law georgetown iversity law center july 11 2006 action the intent of the articles of agr eement of the international monetary fund whether this could be interpreted as m eaning that members of the wto should not violate article iv of the imf charter by manipulating their currency might be matter for debate the united states could also propos that the wto agreement should be amended article x of the wto agreemen t says that any country may propose to the ministerial conference that the wto charter or the multilateral trade agreements should be amended amendments can so be proposed by the wto general council or its subsidiary bodies the nisterial conference may adopt amendments to these documents by consensus if consensus is not reached then the conference may recommend by twothirds vote of th entire membership to submit proposed amendment to the wtos member countries for their consideration generally amendments become effective if they ar ratified by twothirds of the wtos member countries amendments to fe w articles of the wto charter and the multilateral trade agreements require nimous vote however none of these seem to involve exchange rate issues or questions of export subsidy the impact of any amendment to the wto agreement or the multilateral trade agreements may be limited however article x says that any amendment which affects member rights and obligations shall apply only to the c ountries which ratified it one prominent wto legal scholar john h jackson says th at in practice this means that any changes of substantive nature would pply only to the countries which endorsed them119 it would seem likely then that an amendment which said that currency manipulation for the purpose of achievi ng unfair trade advantage was not an acceptable trade practice would apply onl to the countries which endorsed it the ministerial conference can also decide by threequarters vote of the entire membership however that an amendment sh all apply to all countries even if all countries have not ratified its adoption article x says that the ministerial conference may decide that country which does not accept an amendment within time period specified by the conference shall be free to withdraw from the wto or to remain member with the consent of the ministerial conference presumably serious negotiations would predate any decision that country would be allowed to remain wto member without accepting the appli cation of new amendment to itself it cannot be known in advance whether the united states and other countries that are concerned about the trade eff ects of currency manipulation would succeed in gaining the votes necessary to reinterpret or amend the trade rules this is very steep requirement while the united states and its associates were lobbying the membership to consider the change china and other countries which employ that practice would presumably be lobbying the membership to vote the other way the result would likely depend on the strength of the arguments brought forth in support of the initiative and the number of countries that believe that currency manipulation for the purpose of gaining unfair trade advantage is injuring their interests or is otherwise undesirable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33322crs52 it may not be possible to achieve the threequarters positive vote needed to reinterpret the wto agreement or to adopt amendments which are mandatory for all member countries nonethel ess discussion of this issue within the wto may have salutary effects it would require the count ries which favor use of this trade practice to defend their policies and to explain wh they believe currenc manipulation is an appropriate tool of trade policy the c ountries which might be amenable to changes in the wto rules might also be identified this information may be useful if the united states decides to seek negotiated arrangement during later phase of the doha trade negotiations or in some future round of talks strategy of taking the chinese currency issue to the wto is not likely to lead to prompt resolution of the controvers it seems doubtful that adequate grounds can be found given the current language of the wto agreement and the accompanying multilateral trade agreements to successfully address the question in the wto dispute settlement process addressing the question in the wto policy process may offer opportunities for buildin g support for changing the rules and guidelines used by organization however discussion in the general council and ministerial conference would offer the unite d states an opportunity to discuss why as general principle currency manipul ation should not be legitimate tool of national trade policy it need not be discu ssed in this context as an issue affecting only china obtaining the threequarters vote to change the language or prevailing interpretation of the wto agreements would be difficult discussion in this context may help identify potential supporters nd lay the groundwork for possibly including currency manipulation as an additional ag enda item in future trade negotiations
