project 80 lecture given on 22 august 1963 thank you well what is the day audience 22nd of august twentysecond of august boy youre lucky you got all the way up to the 22nd of august and youre still alive boy some people have all the luck all right saint hill special briefing course lecture and were going to recapitulate now on the itsa line and levels of auditing and et cetera et cetera et cetera going to talk to you first about project 80 why 80 why does ron always use these 80s and so forth well 80 is mathematical trick because you turn it over on its side you see and you have infinity and its sort of mathematical joke youve got an infinity you see and youve got zero so you have embraced the totality so its just mathematical trick of saying all now project 80 has to do with organization targets and dissemination and technical planning and this has great deal to do with organizations and it has great deal to do with anybody who is in practice and has great deal to do with anybody who is in scientology and the only reason resignation of project 80 has been assigned to it at all is because theres whole cluster and collection of bulletins and policy letters which will be coming out along this line and there are great many publications will be coming out along this line and youll recognize them when you see them because they will have designations like scientology one or scientology two and the embracive action of what to do with these things is included in project 80 now youre watching here now the dawning of 1964 which is the year of scientology for everyone you see and what has happened here precisely is lot of guys have come along and weve been all together in plowing through the research and its been very trying at various times research is very far from ended when you can make breakthrough of the magnitude of the itsa line here just in the last couple three weeks but weve come all the way along this line and weve seen it changing changing changing and this and that coming and going and stable gains and lot of hope going along the line and all that sort of thing well this has made in essence special breed of cat and were not in situation where were going to lose such people see most organizations activities forward pushes in this particular universe are up against continuous loss of personnel its one of the most crippling things that they havethe loss through death and casualty and implant and this that and the other thing all the way on up the line you see and frankly if anybody could live long enough he would be rich just think of that for moment supposing you went on with someat least the vigor that you might have at thirty or forty and just keep going keep going with wipeouts well lets take movie stars lets take movie stars all during the all during the 40s and 50s you had the movie stars who had made it in the 30s and 20s which is quite remarkable those that came up in the 30s particularly john wayne gary cooperthese characters you see and you just saw them on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on my god hesgary cooper playing the lover at sixtyfive was quite interesting i think but they simply were not necessarily good they simply were persistent i dont know anybody who ever handled dialogue worse than cooper but they were persistent and what happened to their rivals well it wasnt that their rivals didnt make it or werent so good or something like that they simply fell by the wayside preys to various ills and even those that were prey to considerable ills still made it like look at judy garland the ups and downs and so forth persistence if you could just keep going you yourself become sort of an institution dont you see well weve got this particular factor to some degree lickedat least the solution of it is well in view as i told you yesterday at the end of the lecture why give problem and ill get the solution to it usually ive been operating on the basis that if i can conceive of the problem1 amplify that little bit furtherif i can conceive of the problem why i know were about fortyeight hours from what made it problem not the solution to that problem which is mest universe reverse end way of looking at the thing but how did it become problem and this is organizational you see and we see this pretty well so that ive become cocky to this degree i know that if i can conceive of what were up against and i know if we can conceive of what were up against we canin dissemination and technical and that sort of thing we can whip it its all very important to our future progress now we are also incidentally working here with the problem of vanishing people and that problem is the one that causes most organizations to deteriorate and go by the boards now weve had quite struggle coming up the line one way or the other that struggles long way from over but the murderousthe most murderous aspect organizationally is well within our realm of resolution which is losing all your people in any givenany given twenty thirty forty years on this planeton this planet any organization practically loses the totality of its people now were not up against that we have lot of people here who in the last some less than this five six seven twelve some thirteen years have been going along this research line with see and things have ebbed and flowed and youve seen it all changing and reversing and the ink was dry on the bulletin so therefore it must be out of datethis kind of thing right here this particular unit of saint hill has had to cope with shifts and changes but i myself have never compromised with this for moment and i think youre awfully good sports all of you who have put up with this to put up with it because im sure you understood that if there were something better coming up you didnt want the something worse just for the benefit of stability you see in essence we are the stability when it finally works out well now it may not be apparent to you and it may be apparent to you particularly those in z unit that weve pretty well got level four scientology four the road to otthats pretty well wrapped up you could know few shortcuts theres few refinements theres terrific number of releases to be made on this subject for instance i discover lots of exciting things along in four that arent yet released for instance just last night i got my hands on the pattern of the ow sequence itselfthe overtmotivator sequence rathergot the whole pattern tailormade and its lolly man its doll its gpm of sorts and its own special breed of cat and there goes your overtmotivator sequence well theres lot of stuff coming out like this you see but the modus operandi by which you find that material is there and the type of material which is going to be found has already been established and the various ways by which you use this material on the pc has all been established dont you see and you call that wrapup see its an incomplete release but research wrapup nobody is going to be working very very hard to find some new type of incident or something like this they just arent there was one more type to be found after the gpm and that was the screentype incident theres some ramifications of postulationtype incidents and so forth but these we already have the technology for we already have any kind of drill you ever heard of for thetan exterior has already been wrapped up years ago so call that level wrapup its just practically office work to put the stuff together see ifthat which isnt together anybody finishing the z unit here at this particular time is perfectly competent to handle all of this hell pick it up and say oh oh yeah yeah well thats one of those you know so in viewin view of course is wrapup of the between lives and stripping it out so person doesnt do reportback now thats very very pertinentvery pertinent situation and i thought that was going to be very tough it is little bit tougher than i thought it was going to be you can undoubtedly strip out the reportback mechanism without doing much else but the between lives is full of gpms haha isnt that nice and theyre all negative on the beginning end of the screen and theyre all positive on the end end of the screen so of course the positivenegative type goals the diits dichotomy you see those that are positive dichotomy are as you leave and those as you arrive are negative so of course that collapses one on the other to marked degree and makes it very nice mess fortunately theyre not given with very much violence and the earlier sequence and series of these things is given much earlier before one has actually entered the civilization which you now unwittingly find yourselves theyre the train goals and we have the pattern ive got to confirm this and dabble around with it for while but its that kind of work which were doing exciting enough in its way and certainly valuable enough and vital enough to make ots but i dont think that anybody has very much doubt except if hes been dropped in the middle of session that were going to have all of this worked out and its mostly matter of grind away and get the gpms out of the road and keep the tone arm flying and so forth and gradually work it out work it out and hold the pcs hand through the rougher passages of it and rough it out and then well finally have arrived at that its matter ofonce more its matter of shovel work its more comparable now to moving pile of coal from point to infinityzero see its justits just auditing its number of auditing hours there are some rules im working out that make it faster and easier such as if you get your paws on gpm the running of which gives you tone arm action do not let it go till you have run it and its whole series this is the faster ways to do this sort of thing you see if you are stripping off betweenlives screen and you suddenly find some incident thats way back in somethingorother land just dont just date it and let it gorun it and when youve got it run come back to the screen livesbetweenlives screen to strip it down some more dont you see and eventually the whole puzzle all comes apart and everything falls apart in your hands case all goes back to battery and bangthats it thats just matter of working at it but what is the central action of this the central action of this is auditing and auditings central action has to do with keeping the pcs attention directed to those significant portions of the track which give him tone arm action and which take his case apart thats the highest level of professional auditing there it is well now look you know how long youve been on the road and look how much youve studied and how much youve sweated and groaned and that sort of thing in order to achieve the technical level which you right now have achieved that applies to anybody here you know how far youve gone thats quite ways thats quite ways if we expected everybody to go that similar distance we would lose and what we happen to havewe have group now who have come along over tremendously long distance and who then form an advised cadre they would know which way these cats are going to jump theyve been exposed to just about every brand of process that you can imagine and so forth now this is very important this is very important to have such people were not going to lose these people its going to go on for quite while but how about all of those other blokes huh how about all those other people well to expect them to graduate up the hard wayits too much to expect lot too much to expect theyre operating at certain levels of reality and that level of reality establishes their arc and if were going to bring off any coup with regard to large public acceptance broad disseminationif were going to bring off any coup on this particular planet were going to have to pay attention to that arc now this bloke is plodding along there and the highest level of his understanding of mentality is women are all alike this he knows when he finally decided that wisdom burst upon him he felt pretty good every time somebody throws coffee pot at him or something like this why he just sits there and hes satisfied as can be he grabs hold of that stable datum inserts it into the middle of his thinkingness and he knows now the answer to it women are all alike see and that explains the coffee pot and that explains everything you see and we come along to this bird and we say hey bud youre convict you live on planet called earth its part of the marcab confederacy what you got is whole lot of gpms and you got to run these out see because theyre positivenegative items that go into dichotomy now you give his arc what is his arc at that moment see audience broke broke but good thats right correct at least its just going to be kind of unreal hes not going to be very happy with us well what then in essence has happenedis weve carried along here by our bootstraps at many times great personal sacrifice certainly through lots of disappointments upsets through tremendous loses all kinds of thingsweve carried along here and we have been making our way and weve been getting along just fine and the gap between us and them has been getting wider and wider and wider and eventually we find ourselves in an informed ivory tower which of course we can take off from to lord knows what but weve left bridge behind us so the particular cadre of dianeticists and scientologists who have come forward to this point could very well just sever at that point and we all goes our ways selectively or we do or we dont but we have left bridge behind us i consider that somewhat important particularly since its going to take long time to bail out things and square things around and that sort of thing i want to point out to you this planet is in slightly different situation than other planets in thatnot to go space opera on youbut this planet has prayer of not getting tilted that is what you put into this planet has tendency of remaining here theres probability that it will dont you see well this is not necessarily true of the other planets in the immediate vicinity of this planet because very often you get into condition of warfare of some kind or another and things happen now all im talking about is that to get any kind of entrance into the social strata of nearby planets and so forth to get any entrance into that is fairly improbable theyre far more likely to explodebeing very tightly and intimately governed theyre far more likely to explode and go up in smoke do you see what i mean theyouve got your feet into this one and this one does make rehabilitation center of one kind or another its worth salvagingwith all the other crude expletives ive been using about planetary tilting and so forthit is worth salvaging now what happens to the other immediate planets that are connected with this confederacy in this system i could not bet on just for two seconds i just could not bet on it in the first place these are invasionary planets they possibly were facing some type of invasion here into this particular galaxy theres probably political situations in existence and you and i would not know what of dont you see and i know theyve made considerable incursion into the thing because i know that the espinol confederacy used to control this very much and i found out the other day that their return platforms were closed were barred off with speakers you know saying get away from here and report to the ones we told you to report to and get away from here and we dont want anything to do with you in other words their return points are closed well that just spells nothing but defeat see so what is this now is there some other planetary systemis there some other empire system which is deeper in to the heart of this galaxy which is going to backfire against this one i would say probably yes probably yes thereprobably this is coming right up over the hill i mean it probably is not long maybe this confederacy or this activity right now is in trouble but conquerors nearly always spare the jails did you realize that the allied troops going inauschwitz belsen places like that they didnt knock those apart they knocked apart the belligerents property but they didnt knock apart their jails all kinds of political situations complicate this picture im not trying to tell you what they are about or the solutions to them im merely saying that these are complicated and ive only vaguely touched how complicated it might be see we cant bet on that we actually cant bet on the preservation of earth but we can bet on thisthat this planet has better chance of becoming rehabilitation center than other planets see thats very faint bet dont you see but supposing supposing now you have not left any bridge toin the rehabilitation center dont you see well then everybody in this area now just keeps floundering around without any contact and way to get up on it and very mad at the only group of people that could assist them i dont think thats desirable situation at all in fact i think its highly undesirable situation and i think it could actually impede what we ourselves are trying to do weve got to leaveweve got to leave bridge now organizationally and in private practice and other functions our feeder lines into the public are very very weakextremely weak but they are not weak administratively they are weak technically its technical weakness now thats why ive circled around and come back to scientology one as heavy point of concentration in research and development now this is all very very interesting that we would consider scientology one heavy area of research and development well the other is wrapped up im working on it as fast as i can you see little things sandwiched in amongst other things for instance you just saw bulletin if youve gotten it yethow to handle the pcs postulates when encountered in gpms and engrams and that sort of thing you see well you see stuff like that all the time but this other stuff is coming out now which is this bridge and that bridge is project 80 see thats just scientology for everyone now it requires actually that we study joe and bill and pete bit and find out what they agree with and utilize that agreement to improve their arcnot with us but just to improve their arc up to point where we can bit another level of agreement see in other words raise them from level of arc from where they are to next gradient point of arc and then at that next point of arc put them in the way of getting their arc improved up to the next level and they come to scientology three clear and then put them up from that up into higher level do it by gradients in other words not with crush and crash now the eight dynamics various scales the arc triangle the dynamic principle of existenceall of these things are too high for scientology one interesting isnt it so they comprise scientology twohcahpa level and youre back toyoure back to what you might call thirty sixtyday hpa training that means lot for central organization well now how could we possibly make an hca or an hpa in that length of time its because of our breakthrough on the itsa line its this piece of technology which has made this possible and we couldnt have climbed this hill with the technology we had because we had to have technology that could be grasped so easily that even if misinterpreted somewhat would still work now thats an easy one so we come back to that and we get various definitions for these various levels now in studying over this problem i am now supported by tremendous amount and growing rapidly technical datatechnical resultsfrom the itsa line and this exact approach and im very very interested why iym also very interested that some of you as auditors havent yet coped with the level of win see youre living here on cloud nineteen see and you know what terrific win would be in auditing you know well run out whole series of gpms on somebody with terrific tone arm action and so forth youre hoping for that level because you know youre setting them right straight up for ot you see and you overlook what is big win to pc for instance our staff auditor has just made that mistake hes worried of course hes trained up to the nines you see and he got perfectly raw piece of meat and their first session she couldnt say word really benefit nothing few repetitive questions were asked her practically spun her next session she was very happy to have been able to talk to the auditor about these things now that was her gain for the session but the auditor hadnt been able to get her to talk about and get good ta action on what he wanted her to talk about so he was regarding this as lose see he was getting worried about the case isnt that right i just saw her folder and i havent had chance to talk to the auditor yet hes at disadvantage here well hes getting his itsa line in on brandnew fresh pc and probably what he doesnt realize is she is violently pro medicine oriented and would ordinarily be what you would consider an impossible case to process in couple of sessions shes got himshes talking to the auditor and getting little ta action doing so well i consider this is terrific because this case would have barred us out few years ago or even year ago even few months ago its at the level of win see you have to learn to settle for these little wins see see you have to settle for these wins on gradient so hes winning he must be doing an awful smooth job of auditing to get over all of that and in actual fact the moment he started putting in the itsa line just as such even though she wasnt particularly interested in talking about what he was putting the itsa line inhe had win think of that i consider it fascinating tells at once the auditor must be doing splendid job and it tells the case must be winning and it tells this case which i would have considered unauditable who has been refusing auditing left and right not really refusing it just ignoring it much worse than really refusing itand he gets the itsa line on this person little bit and he gets win so i think he must be doing well that case must be doing well and he doesnt have to do anything very very extraordinary about what to get this case to talk about see as long as he can keep the case talking shell win aw thats an awful easy level of auditing so here we are operating in the operating climate of where weve known this is very hard to do so hard to do weve almost forgotten that we ever hoped it could be done and there it is sitting in front of us doing it and its almost too spectacular to be accepted how long has it been since you took somebody who was halfseas over or upset in existence and tried to audit him and wouldnt be audited and had to then fall into an unauditable category whens the first one of those you ever had and when was the last one well now those are the real loses man because you see you didnt get to process him at all so its win if you processed him at all and you actually when you get your hands on this you will be completely surprised to find out that in this kindergarten of auditing you have very stellar results obtainableso obtainable that medical healing is contained in this linesolutions to the problems of medical healing now im not saying we are going to do medical healing i wouldnt be caught dead with it ive done myive served my time that way and pretty poor so dont think were downgrading result is all im trying to put across to you were not downgrading result but its going to take us little while to get used to the level of result i had quite shock on this the first time first time i justi had worked out completely in the absence of tone arm action the pc wasnt winning see id worked this out theoretically and so forth and i started putting it to use and kept very close tally on it and found out that the significance which i would erase off the case did not have value comparable to the amount of charge that was tonearmed off the case and i was completely flabbergasted it was matter of watching pcs over twenty four hour to fortyeight hour periods after session and it was astonishing that the session following good tone arm action on the pc regardless of the completion of that session regardless of the significance of the sessionestablished very high level of win for the pc pc felt brighter more alert and so forth now you could get tone arm action and too much significance entered into the situation and be pressuring the pc along very hard in the direction the pc had to go and yes you were driving the pc toward his ultimate goal and that sort of thing but the pc wasnt particularly happy about it it was tryinglike trying to get speed out of motor boat half full of water not lots of charge was being released and slopped over and the pc felt groggy and weary and sluggish and so forth you nevertheless were making it you understand so the optimum level of cheerfulness as far as the pc is concerned and the feeling of getting case advance as well as actual case advances lies just in the direction of the itsa line in and the tone arm moving you can almost delete on what see at your lower levels of auditing now when i sayi used that medical healing unadvisedly because theyll be wiped out soon if our plans mature these birdshere weve got guy who iswhos got ahes got wonderful case of lumbosis and so forth and his lumbar has been bothering him for long time its douglas fir or something and termites have gotten in there and this is predisposed toward disease this area predisposition toward disease well i think this is quite remarkable because if they treat the disease they never get at the predisposition so something else has got to happen to the lumbar so the obvious thing to do to the lumbar is to surgicalize itcut it out so there is lumbar obviously the solution to trouble with the lumbar is lumbar see but theyve completely overlooked the predisposition of the lumbar to disease because of trauma they keep concentrating on the bugs you see well this has aperhaps has its limitations but what exactly does this do do you know that if you could get somebody talking about his health or his lumbarfor instance youre handling that right now you actually are trying to head in and get her to talk about something about her health something and youd probably have to make very fancy assessment to find out what it is but the final analysis here is if we can get her talking this pc about her health well eventually get her talking about her lumbar and well find out that the cures and solutions and decisions and discoveries and cognitions and comments and considerations and hopes concerning that lumbar in their aggregate caused her to have lumbosis and if we can get those off with ta action we will then have recovered lumbar it sounds utterly incredible doesnt apply to broken legs yet see probably have to set broken leg im just trying to give you where the zone goes your scientology two is probably the opensesame to healing weve got to accumulate lot more material on this and iveas ive said already in descriptions of scientology two and in the process of getting this material togetherwell my whole statement is is were not putting in this hca or hpas hands weak tools just because theyre simple theyre not weak and by using the itsa line we possibly could take this person and cause him to be very effective in the treatment of some physical conditions from spiritualmental level that have never before easily surrendered see i mean weve got door open there it isnt just cracked open its crashed open now that means then that your hpahca level training is just exactly in the zone of where youve been here with the itsa line and the ta action with slight direction of the pcs attentionmethod of direction of the pcs attentionmostly to this lifetime to limbs to conditions in their life and so forth so we have to train him at this level we have to train him in the auditors code we have to give him of course some trs we have to tell him about the axioms so he sees that the subject has breadth and depth but mostly we tell him about the arc triangle the cdei scale matter energy space time form and location we tell him about the dynamicssee what i mean and when we get him all grooved into this line we teach him the tone arm of the meter and thats it now this is certainly several cuts above scientology one and is an expectable cut because hell be able to use that information particularly if we put it together so he can use it now puppy to the root with great curiosity and facing the unknown he will of course and his instructors may of course wish to charge up into the character of this bloke and his name rank and serial number before he came into the marcab confederacy and considering it very important that the auditor know this and then its very important that the auditor know something about 3n its very important they really know how to run an engram and its very very important that they know how to run this and run thatand in the course of few weeks they try to press in an education which has actually taken you something on the order of what thats heading for success but if they could learn these other factors and well and if they effectively produced result for them then that whole group undergoing that training and handling that processing would win they would win all the way across the line their arc then would again come up lets take scientology one again we study this guy and that guy and we find out what they are in agreement withalready what they are in agreement with and what they are antagonistic toward and studying these factors we give it scientological orientation and organizationthats scientology one you got datum somethingif you realize that psychology has not even come up to that level that were aspiring toward in scientology oneyou realize these guys dabble around with stuff like this and consider it very wise such as when troops get letters from home their morale risespsychological report rendered to the commanding officertherefore i advise that you have more mail transports to the front lines chief and god almighty of the psychiatric division of the army of the republic signed this date scientologists look at that and say oh pfft why is the morale of frontline troops down the morale of front line troops is down because they dont get mail from home bull this bird then is occupying point of swindle to some degree because hes supposed to be highcaste character that knows about these things but what he does is put out these fantastic banalities see were not even were not even going to go that low for scientology one scientology one says that it is possible to have happy marriage improbable but imnot completely impossible to have happy marriage see thats its level of discussion of marriage you see not marriage is marvelous experience which can be you see all built up on the line and how do you actually live happy marriage how do you get along with children well you make the whole of child psychology something on the basis ofsomething on the basis of when the kid tries to tell you something understand it and acknowledge it dont ignore it employeeboss relationship communication formula with regard to the employee with regard to the boss the project of saying good morning to somebody over period of forty days until they finally say good morning back you know the use of its just getting into communication see your common denominator of all that now you turnyou turn you loose on platform talking to the mothers of east orange new jersey about their children now look at your levels of choice there you are facing all of these girls and they know you know your business now you can say your little rollo has just been through the between lives area has the following gpms or you can sayor you can say your problem with little rollo is basically one of communication i think you could take off from there i think you could really take off what is he trying to say when he cries how to handle him how to handle him ill give you case in point the stuffs effective but it takes while one little boyone little boy wenti dont know it must have been the better part of four five monthswithout feeling anything but hostility but at the end of that time became very anxious to please and what exactly was being used every time he said something great care was taken to find out what hed said and to acknowledge it every time he showed up one said hello to him this brought about the total reform as long as we deleted out of existence any punishment the child was getting during that period and this reformed very bad boy that doesnt sound like much but youd find people who were not particularly ambitious would care to undertake project of that character within their own limits long before they would undertake more complicated project and the joke is that that project happens to be real the case history i gave you is perfectly correct and it is way of handling the situation and is quite remarkable now theresodd thing about it is is once youve given them single datum you have an enormous series of complexities that add on to the datum and youd just be amazed at how many questions there are that arise around that complexity and you can amaimagine after youve answered few questions from the floor on the subject of what you have just told them youd be surprised how your repertoire goes up and how you finally find out what they want to know and you may be incredulous at what they want to know but nevertheless that is what they want to know dont you see and you with great deal of technology at your fingertips of course are able to evolve that rather easily now it doesnt really put you on withhold with regard to the thing i understand that you scientologists believe that everybody has lived before is that true of little rollo well madame that would be up to little rollo if he wanted to tell you that why im sure he could or would experiment of exact nature was carried on at wichita kansas one time little rollo in this particular case was about five six years old and he was over at the swimming pool when mama was asking this somewhat snide question she was intending to be rather nasty and she saidi said well why dont you ask little rolloinvolved and so forth and she called little rollo over and she said now darling she says you dont remember when you were baby do you oh yes mommy he said i remember when i was in your tummy and went off and dived into the swimming pool its all very interesting now where you cut this line and how you design it and what you do with it and so forth is all regulated by what people can go into arc with and theres the only point where dissemination program or training program would fall down now you have not any good example in justim not good example of this because im mainly talking to you and i dont care if stuff wanders out into outlaw and wildcat handsi can take it i simply say what is with regard to what i am now looking at at scientologists and some of them think im kind of unreal lately or batty and so forth i am sufficiently insouciant and confident and confident of my arc with scientologists in general to know that they will forgive and also know that they will look it over and run into it themselves and say hey what do you know and all of this sort of thing so im operating on differenton different basis to marked degree in that particular regard it doesnt mean that you have to withhold what you know about it but you certainly have to talk to people at level where people can talk if you intend to have any arc with those people and therefore your basic dissemination area throughout the public must be at level that people can go into arc with the technical material must be such that they can use it and there we go now you could make book auditor who will get fantastic results and imi was just telling you i was very proud of the fact ive been studying some of this in just the last few days and ive been getting lot of material on this itsa line and so on and r1c isyoull be getting it in proper bulletin formbut it is simply list of questions that anybody can add to that you get people to talk about to get in the itsa line that is all that is what you do and its bunch of canned questions but it actually could be thousands of questions and i can see it now i can see some book auditor with dictionary of these questions guys got lumbosis and here are the crossreferenced things with regard to what this guy can talk to that will cure up his lumbosis see this is how you get the r1c run on his lumbosis and you can get very complicated crosscoordination of the number of questions he could answer that would finally add up to his lumbosis see and it wouldwhich is much more surprisingit would answer up to his lumbosis now thats book auditor line of course we expect book auditor to have many more failures flubs be incapable of possessing sufficient self control and discipline to keep from flying in the pcs face we expect this kind of catastrophe but oddly enough my experience at this level of auditing has been rather good it has been rather good and if we put into their hands very very securely stuff which they actually can coaudit on and get results withmerveilleuse and thats your r1c dont you see and you hear somebody starting to dive for gpms something like that say well perfectly all right for you to dive for gpms perfectly all right but your pcyour pc probably feel better if you take the hca course and the hhs course and go to saint hill and then come back and run it on him youre liable not to make as great mistake and hell say oh well i can still run it call you up in couple of days and say what do i do you know say well all right thats good why dont you ask him about things he has not quite liked about auditing or youll find your brains are sufficiently stretched even handling that level of coaudit you see with just r1c that type of question but they gonna get results and that type of processing going to raise their level of arc and if this type of processing also exists on coaudits and so forth you actually can divide scientology one into two grades the nonauditing and the auditing well the nonauditing are going to stay much less advancing and so forth but remember they will still exist old dianetic and scientology groups always had people in them who wouldnt ever audit or be audited but were members of the group and they very often would form majority of the group they hung around the fringes of this and they never dared quite get their toe wet and you had other members of that group who considered themselves very very upscale because they did audit and they were auditing somebody and being audited and so on well the natural evolution of this thing then divides it into two is the nonauditing and the auditing levels of scientology one so therefore youve got to have quite bit of theory that matches up with scientology one that people can talk about lot of theory going along with it scientology twoscientology two is capable of getting tremendous results i think even an oldtime auditor wouldnt really believe the results that are obtainable at that level the backbone processesthe backbone processes are r2cany assist line or anything like thatbut r2c and getting complicated now with r2cthis is complicated process this is r1c but an assessment predetermines the thing i can give you very rapid rundown of what r2c is and i think youll find its workhorse process its with an assessment you have your new expanded cdei scale and you have an expanded scale of eight dynamics that gives you two lists the session is begun and the tone arm is used needle actions take place and the person is given the expanded cdei scale to inspect to find out which one of these things best characterize his life now you dont expect this assessment to take place in any specific period of time it might take ten minutes and it might take fifty hours as long as you can get tone arm action out of the assessment why youre in you dont care how long it takes him to pick over this little cdei scale of cards and try to figure out which one most applied at what times in his life and where and how and which and what they are and how they relate and that this is pretty clever scale andi can see some guy getting stuck for hundred and fifty hours just doing nothing but examining this scale see see so id never discourage him or speed him up from examining the scale because theres lot of residual tone arm action to be gained right there with that scale well lets say he finally came upanywhere between ten minutes and five hundred hourshe finally comes up with level see you dont care if he picked it right out or it took long time as long he was getting tone arm action while he was doing it thats the only condition and wehes picked out this level hes decided that that is the one which most applies to his existence hes got that now all right thats level x and now he thinks hes all set and youre now going to do something else but you dont give him any chance to do that you repeat the operation you give him the eight dynamics expanded theyre expanded with their subdivisional dynamics you see and he has to inspect that list and tell us which one he has been most concerned about and how in this lifetime what one has he been most concerned about in this lifetime and thats again anywheres between ten minutes and five hundred hours you see thats repeat and replay of this thing it actually doesnt matter whether he does this slow or fast dont you see as far as his case gain is concerned it doesnt matter darn whether he does fast assessment or slow assessment so weve got these two scales now and we havey has been picked out as that dynamic he is most interested in therefore our question for r2c now becomes xy all in one questionfalse actions about animals anything that you want to do now theres third oneif you want to put your auditing question together perfectly you could have third one which has decision solution cure consideration ideas about concern for dont you see youd have whole bunch of verbal actions if you needed it to continue to put your question together again that just makes your question neat what has he been with regard to animals and so forth well hes had concern for them all right thats fine now concern about falsity about animals and you just plow right down the middle of his case man youve got wideopen significance that and itll make that tone arm flow like mad and what have you done essentially youve matched up the arc triangle against matter energy space time form and location in neat little package and hes away see and youve matched it up on gradients so that it first starts out arc versus arc and he gradually gets around to where he can confront mest little bit you find out hed eventually swing into the sixth dynamic and hed eventually swing into the seventh dynamic as you repeated this operation i think you are looking at clearing this lifetime i think thats what youre looking at i think this is process which would bring about free needle now in two you also havethis is upper grade two and we would expect this on retread we expect this on retread you would have r2h and you would have any other process thatsuch as prepchecking and so on is relegated more or less to that band not really to the band of hpa because thats needle action so what do you do you just take up the itsa line purely and then at the lowest professional level you take up the tone arm and then at the retread professional level you take up the needle youre moving these things up gradually consistently on gradient and youve got people who at every level can produce result its whether or not they can produce result that permits us to do this trick dont you see if they were unable to produce result at these levels we wouldnt be able to do this trick so ive just been glowing glowing like welloiled halo on the subject here of watching this itsa line produce some remarkable results with regard to it now if youre going to run anything like this type of an activity youre going to pay any attention to this at all youll find out that another element enters the scene just as the devil always entered paradise according to the very best implants of the ow sequencethe overtmotivator sequence rathertheyre all apparently associated with the devil and hell i think its quite interesting devil hell and punishment thewe already found heaven now weve found hell very good but just as the devil always enters in so does the arc break theres always the auditor who couldnt keep his mouth shut and we have tool which requires the use of the needle so we make the arc break assessment specialized activity and we try to bring it home to everybody that if this person is arc breaking all the time that the person has to have an arc break assessment well this gives us crack at the auditor as well as the pc so you say bring the pc in for an arc break assessment and you go ahead and give the pc an arc break assessment now as central organization operating special division or department in which this is done can also keep an awful lot of coaudit activities running here and there throughout the field and can keep lot of teams straightened out when i said coaudit i meant just individual teams and can keep an awful lot of stuff on the fire and can keep lot of actually professional auditors who are having trouble one way or the other can keep them patched up by giving their pcs some arc break assessments and straighten them out we also would have crack at the auditor at that time right and we lay the fear of something or other into him on the subject of breaking up the itsa line and chopping off the pc or evaluating for the pc basically by pointing outfollow the auditors code and in such wayin such way youd have high level of effective activity going in community or an area if you add such things as testing and very cheap coaudits and if you add some little course in which an hba can get classificationyou know he can come in and he can study these drillsthis little basic drill on how you listen see and how not to cut the line and give him some gen about the auditors code and thats it hes classified auditor see we straighten him out to that degreethe organization or the auditor in private practice is always willing to give an arc break assessment to somebody who is falling apart and straighten out somebodys pc for him dont you seewhy youd have wellknit wellrunning very orderly forward progress in the community providing that arc is maintained to agree with the public at large to agree with the partially indoctrinated to agree with the first levels of professional if the arc is there to match why of course we will communicate like mad the whole secret of our communication is the fact that its up to us to establish the level of the communication line and we have to some degree considered it rather dishonest to establish line less than everything we knew well its not true its not true theres particular reason to hit everybody in the head with everything we know but we all do it we all do it one way or the other i suppose well continue doing it i can hear it nowthis book auditor hes sitting there and hes were trying to do an arc break assessment and he keeps coming up and he says but all this person will talk about is wanting to moo and they just keep saying to moo to moo to moo and so forth and ive gotten them to repeat it several times but it gives them headache i can hear you now he gets the equivalent of saint hill course in the next fifteen minutes you know at high velocity but im not at afor any instant even vaguely pretending that this wont happen see im not pretending for moment that the program will go forward perfectly and without hitch there are various reasons why it wont go forward without hitch and one of those reasons is is some people get nervous when they see action in their vicinity gets them nervous gets them nervous they see fifteen people in the registrars office and they know thats too disorderly people have place to sit down or anything like that the place is crowded the registrar cant do her work shes putting money in cash registers you know and they keep dashing around having trouble with the invoicing machine and commotion going on shes leaving pieces of paper on the floorvery very unneat and so they know what to do so they cut down the line going in to see the registrar thats obviously the right solution to the situation because they want things neat and you see testing being knocked out in various ways i think testing there was some fortysome ways testing was knocked out in johannesburg one time after it was put in those forty ways were counted i think they were the subject of an info letter ive forgotten how many there were such things as leaving bicycles across the walk into the testing office dont you see making sure that forms or blanks were available making sure that the person in charge of testing had too many other things to do and couldnt test now that isnt being really vicious this is the consequence of people who are upset about motion and they get too much traffic and theres too much going on and they getthey get emotionally disturbed about the whole thing so they want to shut it off you find that kind of action and you finally find people who think that if they could just be left quietly to by themselves the best solution to the whole thing is to go get rich man someplace and have two auditors process him and audit each other and hundred years from now why somebody will make it ive had that advanced to by the way two or three times as the only real solution to scientology well thats awfully quiet but the funny part of it is its been tried and it always failed i think thats the most remarkable condemnation of it oh theyll have other things going along that will be hashed up one way or the other youll have situations of the unusual solution they cant get the tone arm moving they cant get the tone arm moving on an itsa line cant hit the right questions so they ask you and theyyou give them quthe answer and they despair of ever fitting in the answer and they go off and run something unusual and then they cant get any tone arm motion there as matter of fact its little higher so they run something more unusual and the tone arm is bit higher and they run some needle getting tight now so they run something that is even more unusual and you keep telling them to do the usual and then you find out to your horror that you have pc youve got to put together again with tweezers practically you can only bleed off charge one microamp at time see there will be casualties of this sort of thing theres going to be some you say to this husband and wife team they have training of any kind whatsoever and you tell them that they should coaudit all right and they go off and they coaudit and you hear the house is burned down or something theyre busy getting divorced now because they got rid of some ows inadvertently dont you see and the other one couldnt take it and blew up in their face in the middle of session and all this sort of thing this is notyou see this doesnt make for peace thats what im bringing home theres certain amount of catastrophe involved in this sort of thing and the only thing you can do is minimize the catastrophe just minimize it and hold it down and keep it along the line and then not get pinned on this dissident member of the congregation and that character who is raising trouble and that situation and then just get pinned totally against these things and forget that everywhere else its just running fine these various things occur actually you can practically destroy an organization by getting your attention too fixated on two or three small evils of one kind or another and you dont realize that the rest of the organization is running wonderfully well i had that happen to in johannesburg my attention got riveted and i hadthe situation was picked up long after i could do anything about it and the attention and so forth got riveted on everything but the fact that the staff was doing extremely well and the traffic was going as well as could be expected they were getting their throats cut from certain quarter and i think to this day dont even realize that they got their throats cut from that particular quarter outside pcs were being used to collect money individually and the poor staff was not getting any of the money it was working for and therefore was working for practically nothing and then being told by the very people who were doing it to them that its all very sad and they should do something extraordinary and so forth and these guys were cutting their throat and the second i tried to do something about it the situation was so triggered and so explosive and so forth that it practically spattered over that corner of africa just now getting back together again this kind of thing occurs and that occurred from the result of getting your attention too fixated upon some evil and trying to take this evil apart forgetting the rest of the organization dont you see and it was running all right it comes from what you could call crusading crusading in illadvised directions youve got mobs of people who are walking in for the pe lectures mobs of people see theyre just walking in and they sit down and so forth and the pe director makes his biggest mistake when theres that guy named swinkopf and damn that fellow you know he comes in and he sits down in the front row and he sits there with sneer on his face you know and so forth and the whole lecture gets twisted around swinkopf guys talking to fiftyfive people out in front of him you see and yet addresses his lecture to this one dissident character who is probably commie anyhow see it doesnt make sense you know if swinkopfs get too much in my road why i always tip off couple of guys the nextin the next lecture when he comes in why you put him out they always do it very gladly theres sense in then narrowing down the whole of the forward progress and all the information youve got and all the theta you could generate you see to take care of swinkopf the odd part of it is there probably arent dozen people in the united states actually who are against scientology i mean count them numerically there are probably not dozen look at the amount of time and effort being invested in that particular line great two birds at the ama fellow by the name of keaton and fellow by the name of field and these birds throw all the brickbats generate all the press kick all the fuss up that is kicked up and so forth well theres probably member or two of the ama board that sicked them on and theres probably some bird down in the fda whoi dont know maybe hes done somethingi dont know maybe he got somebody in family way at some time or another or maybe he takes all the drugs that are sent insomething anyway this guy feels absolutely imperiled by something or other so hes just johnny to the root on it and so forth well theres doubt about it they can cause lot of fuss but just let point out something to you you dont see spending very much time concentrating on that particular dozen because every moment of time i spend on them is wasted on the remainingcount them mana hundred and eighty millions it just isnt figure you see thats proportionate one way or the other probably all evil generates from too great concentration on evil you can neglect fantastic amount of entheta and still get by and you keep the show on the road and you make it very easily but the way not to keep the show on the road is get so fascinated with how the show is not on the road while it is still on the road that you of course contribute to not getting it on the road you eventually contribute to stopping the show dont you see you have to be very careful along in this line so there are fifteen coaudit teams going in your immediate vicinity and so forth and theres one team that is always in trouble every saturday night that you have off its an arc break assessment for this pair theyve blown up in smoke see and there it is there it is now what are you going to do about it man id lay down the law id say now look either sign up for professional auditing go into the local hgc something on this situation because why because theyre taking up all the time you actually should be spending with the remaining fourteen teams which is bad economy bad estimation of effort dont you see there are means of taking care of these situations and what you want to do is form up ways of taking care of these things and take care of them on routine basis not on emergency basis all the time well appreciating and predicting that things like this are going to occur and then traffic will run and then the consequences of stirring up such tremendous activity in the public at large and so forth actually will be very easy to handle and when we getfinally get through with this thing well be handling lot more than were handling now this thing has fallen out into its natural consequences finally when you go out through the top you can generally pick up simplification at the bottom we are very long way from totally finished with research but i think that when weve gotten down to the basis of where we have shaped auditing at its lower levels totally around the definition of auditorone who listensif you can get any simpler than that i would like to hear about it therefore i think that we have laid in safe basic and have made safe assumption that this is good dissemination channel material and will remain constant enough for us to project it very easily and heavily and consistently and keep it going for long time and get it all grooved in and get things shaped up in that direction and take the general public and make 1964 the year of scientology for everyone okay thank you
