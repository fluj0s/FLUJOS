workforce characteristics and trends summary understanding the characteristics and trends of the federal workforce is important because among other things agencies accomplish their missions via that workforce total personnel costs direct co mpensation and benef its for all federal employees civilian and military current employees and retirees were estimated at more than 523 billion in 2008 and civilian personnel costs in the executive branch alone were estimated at about 194 billion three cabinet departments the departments of defense dod veterans affairs dva and homeland security dhs accounted for almost 60 of the nearly 19 million executive branch civilian employees in 2008 the duty stations for more than 35 of these employees were in four states california virginia texas and maryland and the district of columbia and dod was the top federal empl oyer in 35 states dod also employed more than 90 of federal civilian employees in foreign countries and was the top federal employer in us territories the federal workforce grew by more than 120000 employees between 2000 the low point during the last 10 years and 2008 with the growth concentrated in hom eland securityrelated agencies and dva civilian employment in other agencies including dod and most independent agencies declined during the last 10 years the number of bluecollar and clerical federal jobs declined between 1998 and 2008 but the number of professional and ad ministrative jobs increased during this period the percentage of the federal wo rkforce that was made up of minorities also increased but the percentage that was wo men remained almost constant although women and minorities represented an increas ing portion of the growing professional and administrative groups the representati on of women and minor ities in the senior executive service was less than their presence in the overall workforce the federal workforce was somewhat older in 2008 th an it was in 1998 but the average length of service declined from 152 years in 1998 to 147 years in 2008 the number of whitecollar employees in the general schedule gs pay system declined during the last 10 years while the number of employees in agencyspecific pay systems primarily at dod and dhs increased dramatically from less than 1 of the workforce in 1998 to 16 in 2008 if these trends continue the gs system will cover less than half of the federal civilian workforce by the year 2020 the average salary of the workforce was 69061 in 2008 but average salaries varied substantially between and within fe deral agencies and pay systems although the federal workforce has gr own somewhat in recent years 2006 study estimated that the hidden federal workforce of contractors and grantees grew by more than 50 betw een 1999 nd 2005 when it reportedly included more than 105 million jobs in 2005 that figure is more than twice as large as the combined total of all three branches of government the us postal service

understanding how the federal government can better accomplish its various missions as the government accountability ffice gao said in may 2008 the importance of topnotch federal workforce cannot be overstated the nation is facing new and more complex challenges in the 21st century as various forces are reshaping the united states nd its place in the world to address these challenges it will be important for fe deral agencies to change their cultures and create the institutional capacity to become highperforming organizations this includes recruiting and retaining em ployees able to create sustain and thrive in organizations that are flatter resultsoriented and externally focused and that collaborate with other government entities as well as with the private and nonprofit sectors to achieve desired outcomes1 in 2001 however gao identified the manage ment of the federal workforce as governmentwide highrisk area because federal agencies lacked strategic approach to workforce management that integrated those efforts with their missions and goals2 understanding the federal workforce is also important for variety of other reasons personnel costs for both current and former employees represent substantial portion of many agencies budget s and significant portion of the total federal budget some federal agencies are major employers in certain states and tens of thousands of federal employees work out side of the united states the federal workforce is also expected by some to reflect the gender racial and ethnic diversity of the country as whole in additi on

its and life insurance 2 civilian employees versus military employees and 3 current employees versus retired employees the documents also show costs specific to the us postal service and the department of defense dod and separately show costs for the legislative and judicial branch of the federal government according to the fy2009 federal budget and as shown in table 1 below total federal personnel costs ie direct compensation and be nefits in 2008 for all groups ie civilian and military current employees and retirees were estimated at more than 523 billion direct compensation costs for current civilian employees including all three branches of govern ment and the us postal service were estimated at just under 190 billion civilian compensation costs for just the executive branch were estimated at n early 144 billion with dod constituting about onethird of that total in comparison di rect compensation costs for the legislative and judicial branches were relatively small less than 5 billion combined compensation costs for employees of the us postal service are almost entirely funded by postal fees not appr opriations some fe deral regulatory agencies eg the securities and exchange commission the nuclear regulatory commission and the federal communications commission are also entirely or primar ily funded through fees rather than appropriations according to the office of personnel management opm and as shown in table 2 below there were slightly more than 27 million employees in the total federal civilian workforce all three branches plus the us postal service in september 2004 down from nearly 30 million in september 19943 from the beginning to the end of this period the number of executive branch civilian employees declined by nearly 259000 employees4 driven

observations the data provided in this report show that the size shape and character of the federal workforce varies substantially depending on how that workforce is conceived viewed broadly the federal government includes civilian and military employees all branches of government and the us postal service however most discussions of the federal workforce focus on civilian employees in the executive branch within that category while opms fedscope data indicates that nearly 90 of the workforce in march 2008 was com posed of fulltime permanent employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34685crs27 more than half of all acce ssions and separations each ear involve temporary andor other than fulltime employees therefor in discussions about the federal workforce or even more specific issues of federal recruitme nt and retention it is important to be clear which agencies nd what types of employees are included some aspects of the federal civilian executive branch workforce are however relatively unambiguous that workforce grew by more than 120000 employees between 2000 the low point during the last 10 years and 2008 with the growth concentrated in homeland securityrelated agencies and dva the civilian workforce at dod on the other nd declined betw een 1998 and 2008 by more than 40000 employees 57 and independent agencies like epa and ssa also grew smaller although federal employees work in more than 100 agencies and organizations the data indicate that nearly 60 of the federal civilian workforce was in three large cabinet departments in 2008 dod dva and dhs even in its reduced size dod was by far the largest and most ubiquitous federal department or agency in 35 states dod was the largest federal civilian em ployer often by wide margin and dod was the second largest employer in most of the other states dod also employed more than 90 of federal civ ilian employees in foreign countries not including the foreign service it is also clear from the data that certain aspects of the federal workforce have changed in recent years for example between september 1998 and march 2008 the number of bluecollar jobs declined by more than 17 and the number of clerical jobs declined by more than 27 m eanwhile the number of professional and administrative jobs increased by more than 4 and 23 respectively the percentage of the workforce that was minorities also increased during this period but the percentage that was women re mained almost constant also although women as well as minorities represented an increasing pr oportion of the growing professional and administrative groups their representation in the senior executive service lagged behind their representation in the workforce as whole the federal workforce is also noticeably older than it was 10 years ago the percentage of the workforce that was age 55 or older rose by more than 60 between 1998 and 2008 in 1998 the age grouping with the largest percentage of federal workers was age 4549 in 2008 the modal age grouping was age 5054 with larger percentage of federal workers either eligible or almost eligible to retire opm submitted legislative proposal in march 2008 that would allow agencies in all three branches of government to more easily re hire annuitants without salary offset currently unless agencies receive waiver from opm federal retirees who are reemployed by the federal government mu st have their salaries reduced the proposal is similar to hr 3579 which would cover only executive branch employees other legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress eg hr 2780 that would allow certain employees to switch to parttime schedule at the end of their career without affecting the calculation of their annuities the data also illustrate decline in the dominance of the gs pay system during the last 10 years and corresponding incr ease in the use of agencyspecific pay systems if recent trends continue into the future the gs system will cover less than half of the federal workforce within the next 15 years and the gs system will be surpassed by agencyspecific pay systems shortly thereafter several of these

report august 7 2007 p 910 and brittany ballenstedt defense to probe fairness of pay for performance system government executive august 22 2008agency pay systems are pay for performance systems however and those systems have been met with resistence from fe deral employees unions and some members of congress28 therefore to the extent that these singleagency systems are based on pay for performance and to the extent that pay for perform ance is resisted by congress and others the growth in those ag encyspecific systems could slow in the future perhaps the most surprising statistics however involve the hidden federal workforce of contractors and grantees that workforce was estimated to include more than 105 million jobs in 2005 more than more than twice as large as the combined total of all three branches of government the us postal service the intelligence agencies the armed forces and the ready reserve the number of contractor and grantee jobs was also estimated to have increased by more 50 between 1999 and 2005 if that rate of increase continued for the next six years the number of federal contractors and grantees could reach n early 16 million by the year 2011 however the growth in contracting and grants could slow considerably if the next administration is not as committed to transferring certain federal functions to the private sector as the curre nt bush
