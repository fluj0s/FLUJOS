international journal of climatology date fri 25 apr 2008 131918 0700 replyto santer1llnlgov xflowed dear folks on april 11th i received an email from prof glenn mcgregor at ijoc i am now forwarding that email together with my response to prof mcgregor prof mcgregors email asks for my opinion of an addendum to the original dcps07 ijoc paper the addendum is authored by douglass christy pearson and singer as you can see from my reply to prof mcgregor i do not think that the addendum is worthy of publication since one part of the addendum deals with issues related to the raobcore data used by dcps07 and by us leo responded to prof mcgregor on this point i will forward leos response in separate email the addendum does not reference our ijoc paper as far as i can tell the addendum represents response to discussions of the original ijoc paper on realclimateorg curiously douglass et do not give specific source for the criticism of their original paper this is rather bizarre crucially the addendum does not recognize or admit any errors in the original dcps07 paper i have not yet heard whether ijoc intends to publish the addendum ill update you as soon as i have any further information

charsetiso88591 formatflowed contenttransferencoding 7bit xflowed dear prof mcgregor thank you for your email and for your efforts to ensure rapid review of our paper leo haimberger who has led the development of the raobcore datasets and peter thorne would be best placed to comment on the first issue raised by the douglass et addendum as we show in figure 6 of our ijoc paper recentlydeveloped radiosonde datasets which do not rely on reanalysis data for correction of inhomogeneities such as the sherwood et iuk product and the haimberger et rich dataset yield vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature change that are in better agreement with model results and quite different from the profiles shown by douglass et the second issue raised in the douglass et addendum is completely spurious douglass et argue that their experimental design involves involves comparing like to like and satisfying the critical condition that the model surface temperatures match the observations if this was indeed their experimental design douglass et should have have examined amip atmospheric model intercomparison project simulations in which an atmospheric model is run with prescribed changes in observed timevarying seasurface temperatures ssts and seaice distributions use of amip simulations would allow an analyst to compare simulated and observed tropospheric temperature changes given the same underlying changes in ssts but douglass et did not consider results from amip simulations even though amip data were freely available to them amip data were in the same cmip3 archive that douglass et accessed in order to obtain the model results analyzed in their original ijoc paper instead douglass et examined results from coupled model simulations as we discuss at length in section 3 of our paper coupled model simulations are fundamentally different from amip runs coupled model is not driven by observed changes in ssts and therefore would not have except by chance the same sst changes as the real world over specific period of time stratifying the coupled model results by the observed surface temperature changes is not meaningful or useful thing to do particularly given the small ensemble sizes available here again if douglass et were truly interested in imposing the critical condition that the model surface temperatures match the observations they should have examined amip runs not coupled model results i also note that although douglass et stipulate their critical condition that the model surface temperatures match the observations they do not actually perform any stratification of the model trend results in other words douglass et do not discard simulations with surface trends that differ from the observed trend they simply note that the model average surface trend is close to the observed surface trend and state that this agreement in surface trends allows them to evaluate whether the model average upper air trend is consistent with observed upper air trends the douglass et addendum does nothing to clarify the serious statistical flaws in their paper their conclusion that modelled and observed upper air trends are inconsistent is simply wrong as we point out in our paper douglass et reach this incorrect conclusion by ignoring uncertainties in observed and modelled upper air trends arising from interannual variability and by applying completely inappropriate consistency test our figure 5 clearly shows that the douglass et consistency test yields incorrect results the addendum does not suggest that the authors are capable of recognizing or understanding the errors inherent in either their experimental method or their consistency test the douglass et ijoc paper reached radically different conclusion from the conclusions reached by santer et 2005 the 2006 ccsp report the 2007 ipcc report and thorne et 2007 it did so on the basis of essentially the same data used in previous work most scientists would have asked whether the consistency test which yielded such startlingly different conclusions was appropriate they would have applied this test to synthetic data to understand its behaviour in controlled setting they would have applied alternative tests they would have done everything they possibly could to examine the robustness of their findings douglass et did none of these things i will ask leo haimberger and peter thorne to respond to you regarding the first issue raised in the douglass et addendum best regards ben santer in their addendum douglass et erroneously refer to roabcore datasets one would hope that they would at least be able to get the name of the dataset right gmcgregoraucklandacnz wrote 10apr2008 joc080098 consistency of modelled and observed temperature trends in the tropical troposphere dear dr santer just to let you know that i am trying to secure reviews of your paper asap i have attached an addendum for the douglass et paper recently sent to by david douglass i would be interested to learn of
