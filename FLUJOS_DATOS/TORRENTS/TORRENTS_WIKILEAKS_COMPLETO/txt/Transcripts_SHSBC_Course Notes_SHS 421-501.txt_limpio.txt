type 3 idate19663 volnum1 issue276 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec276 summary of modern auditing 6306c19 shspec276 summary of modern auditing processes fall into categories according to which case conditions they handle cases deteriorate as they go down the time track one factor against which they deteriorate is confront and the other factor is duplication confront has to do with willingness and duplication has to do with ability as the pc becomes less willing to confront he becomes less able to duplicate similarly processes are allowed to deteriorate and fade out of use through failure of willingness to confront and ability to duplicate cchs for example went out for five years through getting down into the effort band there was duplication you would have very exact sort of process if you ran what are you able tounable to duplicate along with other flows you add more legs to it as the case needs more complexity highscale case not being much troubled by flows could go far on one leg only you can get different viewpoints on different flows also this can give you ta action where you might not otherwise get it you add enough brackets to get ta there is perfect way to run brackets since the number of available flows is virtually infinite the idea of flows is something that monitors all case levels and breaks its back around level 4 above level 4 any or all flows could be run person well downscale below level 4 almost at the bottom can only run one flow such person cant function on any other dynamic than the first he cant conceive of another viewpoint though he needs to run more than one flow there is problem here this is problem of the dynamics how many can person function on there are many facets of processing by which you could match up case to its ideal process you might be able to figure out the perfect process mathematically but there is the point about the need for workability that we mustnt lose sight of process should not be perfect it should be complex enough to be workable the complexity factor also goes into the number of processes you need we should not emulate modern science modern science is method of precisely determining overwhelming nonsense we also have to determine the common denominators present in all cases the processes that have survived the development of scientology are those that have broad workability they include arc the midruds buttons and common incidents on the time track the common denominators of all cases kraepelins list of psychiatric case types is ridiculous it is like saying i am auditing betty so it is betty case type or well everybody is george case type in the first case you get too many case types in the second case you get too few there is middle ground this is finite number of case types classified according to their behavior in auditing sessions and larger but still finite number of processes it is only useful to divide cases up into case types so that you can match them up to the processes the case types are based on behavior in session not in life you get finite number of them then match them up with processes that raise the pc upscale 422 you cant expect auditors to memorize more than few types of auditing processes perfectly if you expect more of auditors than this they end up mixing types and styles of auditing and you get hash repetitive processing seems easy now that you are familiar with it in fact any type of processing you have learned well presents particular problem cchs got badly learned they are kid glove type of process since cases that get cchs exclusively are low on the effect scale and cant tolerate being mauled about lrh tells an anecdote about dropping cchs because they werent getting results then giving tvd and discovering that one knew what he was doing they had utterly alterised the process it was then that he stopped just creating new processes and began to insist on perfect duplication of what had already been developed we stopped accumulating process types when lrh found out that it was variation that made processes and process types stop producing results people shifting from the original type of process would then apparently bring about need for new process type process types are dependent on how many you can keep in line how to keep processes in line and working is more important factor than you might think when process seems to have stopped working you will find that variations from the original have crept in the simpler process types tend to survive better than the more complicated ones they are also perhaps easier to keep in line in their unvaried form but even the simpler ones will drift out of line process can die when it is too simple and gets used very seldom reach and withdraw is good example of this type of process it works at level 8 and is the only type of process you could use on an animal processes that work very slowly also tend to get dropped since they are seldom run to flat point so you dont see results we dont really know how much reach and withdraw processes can do processes can vanish because of disrespect we use one diffidently arc processing disappeared for awhile because of this that they are the only workable processes for certain type of case gets lost and so those cases get lost reach and withdraw is one of these it is slow but sure and it is almost lost from lack of respect for its potential there are lots of processes in the band of reach and withdraw that are ignored book and bottle hangs right in between reach and withdraw and cchs it contains duplication like the latter but is the former type of process lots of cases wont move unless run on these processes they wont move on cchs we mustnt lose processes we have been pressing so much at the top of the scale of cases that the bottom has been neglected so these lower scale processes have dropped out the next division in processing is what the auditor knows is wrong with the case vs what can be done with the case these can be two very different things modern processes have nothing to do with what is wrong with the case the viewpoint of curing specific conditions by specific processes is an outmoded viewpoint left over from old medical practices one must run what the pc can run and not fixate on curing that is sort of q and ii case with temporary relapse into heavy problems may not be able for the moment to be run on problems repetitivetype process therefore you had better be able to undercut problems processes 423 if case is dramatizing something that something is not real to the case that is guiding rule of processing what you are guided by is not are we handling what is obviously wrong with him but does the case respond to the process that is being run on the case 1e does the case get ta when the ruds for the session are in you must of course check that 1 the session ruds are in 2 flows are in line 3 the process is not already flat or unsuitable for instance speaking of flows most of the stuff we run eg the helatrobus implants are motivators so if you had ta and it ceased after you had run several flows the flows may be getting stuck we are interested in increasing the capabilities of the case he should at least be getting easier to audit because that means that he is getting more responsive to external orders getting more capable of viewing his track and pictures getting into less trouble getting better at locating bpc the case would be getting more done per session too auditors tend not to notice that case is paining and winning because they are too close to the case and they dont observe the slow gradient the way to spot it is to notice how the case was month ago if the case is progressing well if he is interested in and happy doing what he is doing dont change it unless there is ta for long time give ta motion time to develop also it may take several sessions to establish the pcs case level run engrams using the precise system and commands given the precision of the system tends to develop the pcs precision on the track dont word the item too adventurously make it finite enough so that there is hope of reaching basic it should be something he is worried about and can reach if you run chain of being held still you are asking for lots of still points which may be hard to get to the root of what you validate you produce with the exception that getting the pc to confront what he doesnt want to lets him take over the automaticity of producing it so it stops being produced modern processes are built on and monitor the degree of withdrawal of the person into himself and those things that will lead the pc out from himself so he is longer so restricted thus reach and withdraw is the most basic action you should have some idea about types of processes how and why they work and what case level they are most effective on and you should get good at estimating where the case must lie and upgrading the case from that point always run the case little steeper than it thinks it should be run the reaction of the case in terms of protest or arc break has almost bearing on whether what you are running is the right process you look amidst the yap yap and see if the pc is running the auditing command protest is common denominator of the whole track and this universe it is how the thetan makes pictured it is more fundamental than duplicating 424 l ron hubbard type 3 idate25663 volnum1 issue278 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec278 routine 2h 6306c25 shspec278 routine 2h see hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment the use of different processes has been monitored or regulated by two things 1 the ability of the auditor to do the process 2 the efficacy of the process in advancing cases both have to be taken into account it is important that these two factors mesh otherwise auditors tend to lose what is win or lose in auditing you have to be able to define them or we wont be able to recognize them win in terms of thetan behavior is 1 intending to do something and doing it or 2 intending not to do something and not doing it lose is 1 intending to do something and not doing it or 2 intending not to do something and doing it lose gives you disagreement ridge forms between those two things ridge is bit of entrapped energy that will read on an emeter in processing intending to do something for case and not doing it is lose from the pcs side it is the basic definition for lose if the pc sets goal for the session of becoming ot and doesnt make it it is lose matter how unreal the goal was an auditors idea of win could be not to arc break the pc then he does and gets lose this is the intention and sole intention of many auditors going into session this being the case it demands of process that it work regardless of the intention of the auditor that is quite bit to demand of an automaticity but it is very safe base for process your skill as an auditor is in getting the process across and completing an auditing cycle keeping the form and running the session it does not lie in inventing process as you go along you have enough to do without having to invent processes although lrh used to do it it is feasible to dream up the process while auditing the pc but it is only necessary when you dont know what to do the way around this problem is to know the fundamentals of cases what we expect of an auditor is to be able to complete an auditing cycle hold the session form together and take care of the pcs unformness as needed that is minimal if you go lower you havent got an auditor and more randomness than order will be introduced into the session person who couldnt master repetitive process would never make an auditor because of the importance of the auditing cycle you need to be able to acknowledge this is more than just saying thank you the auditor has to understand and it is up to the auditor to minimize the possible breakdowns of the auditing cycle that results from the auditor being startled by what pcs come up with the auditor must be cured of tendency to q and since that is damaging to the pc common sort of q and is echo metering this drives the pc round the bend if this is done with dating it can ruin the pcs precious ability to estimate time any echo metering is and not q and aing is part of the auditing cycle if the pc says around 750 years you say 750 years the essence of q and is departing from the 425 auditing cycle with new doingness because the pc has added new doingness this misses pcs withhold the worst situation you can get into is the arc break caused by your taking it up when all the pc was doing was originating the pc has originated and you thought it was question or request and acted to handle it flunk you didnt acknowledge the origination you can get the pc to clarify the origination by asking the pc was that request the final test of an auditor is not is he perfect but can he unscramble mess by session end get as good as you can get but dont get upset about imperfection just be sure you can straighten it all out as an irreducible minimum let things go that are going well and straighten out things that arent r2h is new process to assist in this see below p 426 for description of the process see also hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment for more details on the process this would be predecessor of the l1c r3r is pretty rote procedure it has variations it took 13 years to arrive at it i intended auditors to run engrams and failed in the past i had lose that is why r3r came in the main difficulty in handling engrams is the complexity of the procedure these rote steps are pretty simple done one by one r3r runs engrams better and smoother than earlier engram running ever did it is quite triumph the failure in getting auditors to run engrams was enough to make lrh abandon trying for some years of all processes this is the one not to learn by doing it on the pc dont practice running engrams on pc you will tanglefoot if you dont know the fundamentals of the time track dating is an interestingly exact skill the hardest and trickiest step is getting the duration because it is hard to get the proper duration and in rote procedure duration is everything if the pc doesnt know know what the incident is all about you have the duration wrong why the later part of the incident is always knowable as to length the question is where it really begins for instance you know how long this lifetime has been but you dont know how long your track is if you get the pc just seeing one scene every time you run him through the incident then the duration is wrong he has just got the back end of the incident in terms of reality and behavior of the meter the pc could reach the last part of the engram if he cant tell you about what is happening the duration is wrong because there is obviously something more to it and that something more is always earlier so you must redo the duration the first incident wasnt wrong youve just gotten more incident this could happen more than once in one incident if the second run is still very vague if the pc still doesnt know about the incident if he has gotten only few more pictures get the duration step redone thats all you have to do you may have to redo it several times just take the pcs data the pc will always go to the beginning of that part of the incident which he can now reach luckily this is very uncomplicated and it is very important because all that is in the bank is in engrams engram running is longer barred to the black v case even gpms are specialized engrams gpm is just an engram with pattern required to run it the mind is not confused the pc looking at it and unable to find what he wants thinks that it is confused it is an idiotically orderly machine which does what you tell it to do addressed by proper technology the mind is incredibly precise and accurate the pc may think it looks confused but he is like 426 someone on his first trip to the library he will be confused until he cognites that he can just ask the librarian for what he wants and get it the auditor always gets what he asks for in r3r the mind is not ouija board just keep your commands sensible and comprehensible the biggest problems an auditor has are 1 finding the correct date and duration 2 arc breaks most auditors are somewhat afraid of arc breaks if you havent learned to assess and handle arc breaks you are licked you will shortly back off from running engrams because you will have had lose routine 2h comes in here it is arc breaks by assessment it is superior to arc break straightwire it asks the pc for an arc break dates it assesses it for bpc locates it and indicates it to the pc this puts you at cause over arc breaks and gives you practice at dating things that the pc is not very nervy about unlike engrams r2h can be run on pc at level 6 dubin of dubin case see p 415 above r3r doesnt necessarily run only engrams you can also run secondaries with it which is fine just dont call it engram running dont run chains that havent been assessed you risk having the chain try to branch into another chain you can run locks with r3r on case that is not up to running engrams getting the item to run is done by the rules of listing you could also assess the 18 buttons of the prepcheck and list what they have suppressed in this lifetime and get chain that you can run with ta if you hit one of the helatrobus implants shift to r3n if it is another sort of gpm you hit go to r3n2 watch for dates between 38 and 52 trillion years ago for helatrobus implants the approach to processing has been upgraded because its target has been upgraded we are not interested in clearing we are interested in ots the governments of the us and australia decided to get rough also the kremlin and the us are trying to form dichotomy expressed with nuclear fission we must hold the line legally concerning emeters and upgrade the auditing target to ot l ron hubbard type 2 idate26663 volnum0 issue22 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shtvd22 listing assessment for engram running part i 6306c26 shtvd22 listing assessment for engram running part i notice the simplicity of this procedure see hcob 1jul63 routine 3r bulletin 4 preliminary step for description of the procedure the difficulties with it are minimal the skills of r212 are used the rules of listing apply etc the key note of any fairly highlevel case and what makes an incident an incident is protest by protesting person shoves his face towards something he attacks it while he resists it this opposition produces heavy charge but some people arent up to protest so we will assess an 18button prepcheck list to determine the thing to assess for engrams lrh proceeds to assess an 18button prepcheck with created left out because it is goal with the prefix in this lifetime have you mainly _______ he gets huge list of items after nulling the 18 buttons down to decided lists in this lifetime what have you decided to clean needle does goals and gains havingness and ends off 427 you just keep listing until the needle is clean without doing anything to disturb the pc and put ruds out you are not looking for rss rrs or any peculiar needle phenomena the next step would be to null the list in this lifetime what have you decided to one item if this item turns out to be goal it would be run with r3n otherwise you locate an engram chain that could cause such decision in life model session was very simple and skeletal if the pc had not made goals or gains lrh would have said im sorry you didnt make your goalsgains if he had made some of them the acknowledgment would have been

idate9763 volnum1 issue281 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec281 the free being 6307c09 shspec281 the free being the shsbc is the place that you have been coming to for the last trillion trillion years it is lrhs job to make auditors who can clear up the track if we hadnt waited so long it would have been easier but two things prevented its being done sooner 1 the state of civilization 2 the previous failure to realize that the cycle was the cycle of loss of the ot being now had come to the point of believing that the only safe place to be was in meatbody civilization the fight the quality of life had been lost peculiarly enough freedom as an ot has come down almost into pi say to 500 years ago for some but they were lost too there is way to obtain and maintain stability as an ot as things stand what is peculiar about this war on ots was that it was lost by the most powerful all battles are won by combination of force and intelligence given enough force you dont need much intelligence viz nuclear bombs but then all you get is shortterm win longterm win is achieved only by balance between force and intelligence intelligence alone is never enough for instance in the communist takeover of tibet the wise men of tibet were powerless to prevent it there is an imbalance in any defeat any coordinated civilization combining technology with force and keeping force and intelligence balanced can make monkey out of an ot literally there is an implant four galaxies over that taught you that you came from apes the whole darwinian theory is implanted there in about day in fact thetans had different tastes relative to bodies for instance some liked caveman cultures and some didnt this is not evolution it is just different mockups for thetans the civilizations of treetop premen and of cavemen were just two different styles with evolution between them 428 the deterioration of matter is not nearly as rapid as scientists think it is and the earth has been here much longer than they think carbon14 dating methods the measurement of time elapsed by deterioration of atoms doesnt work because this deterioration doesnt occur as fast as scientists think suns in this area have been burning for at least 200 trillion years dark stars suns that look as though they have gone out were never lit they dont go out so society is full of misapprehensions and stupidities that themselves act as traps these stupidities are intelligently conceived as means of cohesing society ignorance is used by the intelligent as means of entrapment if everyone remains ignorant of the society nobody can get out of it so they have choice but to cooperate and keep society going so these meatbody societies operate on combination of mediocre intelligence and mediocre force they make the airplane and the space ship and progress further then they disintegrate societies repeat patterns over and over again thetans get on different kicks and make these societies but beware of societies with as much progress as there is on this planet various unusual forces are at work here this planet is evolving unusually fast because for one thing it is being used as dumping ground it is on the periphery of the galaxy sun 12 is handy to other galaxies and to the center of this galaxy it is still being used as dumping ground for that reason this planet has very heterogenous society and lots of trouble because one is guiding it most planets have some guiding thetan these dont change they are rather like little play town there is master hand guiding this planet if there were there would be far less trouble than there is when you take thetans that have been indoctrinated to have certain types of societies in bodies that have been mocked up and then they get scooped up and dumped as unwanted in one place you have lots of different impulses at work one with the other this produces lots of friction that is what our society is this society belongs nominally to the espinol united stars or the espinol united moons planets and asteroids this quarter of the universe is ours this is sun 12 there has been command post occupied for this system now since 1150 ad at the time when group on mars was finally abolished and vanished you notice that at that time there was sudden resurgence in science and learning it became an uncontrolled civilization and one has been paying any attention to the dumping that has been going on since nobody took any interest in this system and it has been running wild ever since that time probably the most basic impulse on the planet is simply the basic impulse of thetans who have been reduced to more or less meat body level which is total cooperation with one another as you see in communism we are all equal there must be personalities of any kind and the cult of personalities must be banished this is the least common denominator of implants and indoctrination the notion that they must have teammates why did you arrive on this planet in the condition you are in good reason particularly certainly not just because of the overtmotivator sequence though you will try to find the overts you did that pulled it in you are still trying to be reasonable and intelligent about it you think that there had to be reason it is true that you have overts but the only reason you were ever punished was for being you for being powerful and for not being quite intelligent enough the exact crimes were to be there and to communicate once upon time some ot came along and for fun put together civilization complete with curbstones and hairdos some other thetan came along and interfered in some way so to get even the first thetan would indoctrinate his pet society on how to trap big thetan so this became the most accomplished skill that meat body society had how to trap spirit ot was ever so out of his mind as to depend upon any of his men or troops to untrap him he never taught them to do that because at the time he was doing this it never occurred to him that he would be caught singularly unintelligent it isnt this universe that did it you were just knuckleheaded not enough intelligence was used proportional to the force tributes to god are tributes to the workings of an ot creating the entire universe seems like very intelligent action but it was knuckleheaded because one worked out how to reverse it to unbuild it to cause things to asis this lack of intelligence was recently dramatized by frankie the limpers funding the atom bomb without building defense against it ots in the past have employed too much force and too little intelligence an ot could build anything atoms molecules suns traps but he didnt bother to figure out how to turn it off when he got tired of it the problem came from an insistence on matter that was to endure forever this was not smart eventually that is what theta poles were made of thats the pole youve been on confounded things last forever its possible to be trapped for over 135 trillion trillion years the tech for trapping thetans is vast but there is nothing on how do you get him off of it here is problem how can you free thetans when there are ots left all an ot has to do is to pull the trapped thetan off and toss him out in space to cool off seems simple but it requires an ot and what if there isnt any einstein was dead wrong he only contributed to the ignorance by which you get trapped space wagons used to travel trillions of light years per day teleportation is pipe dream you just unmock body here and mock it up there its not the same atoms the skill of making matter disappear has been grievously neglected like the tech of how to free thetan the failure to teach meat body society equally to free or to trap was just unintelligent this situation is like the phenomenon of stuck or single flows in processing where if you run motivators long enough the pc will give you an overt you can always get trouble when you run only one side of flow 430 that is important to you because it says where you sit as being at this exact moment and why you are interested in the technology before you and why it is appearing at this time everyone will tell you that this technology is impossible it isnt it is only neglected they think it is impossible because they have outflowed the reverse technology the technology isnt neglected because the lack of it didnt cause societies trouble it did the galactic confederation is in trouble right now because of this lack the confederation operates on limited ot basis its hierarchy of command is that of limited level of ot and it goes down from ots at the top to the doll body as the ship captain and the post captain and down to meat bodies it is one of the few civilizations that has endured long time just because it has used these different levels they have tried to maintain nochange condition which is dangerous and impossible if you dont improve you decline the problem of the galactic confederation is that they have run out of the ots that are needed to command units that is the limiting factor on how big they could be since not once in 80 trillion years has anyone ever suggested repairing ots they have static and therefore declining society ots get peculiar they get fitful they get moody they can get keyed in and all they could do about it was to subdue the errant thetan turn sleeplight on him tell him to get more solid and take him down to the hospital i know i was there i was the guy they did it to if the technology of untrapping is so vital why hasnt someone worked on it because they are afraid of the technology governments would fear ots if they knew about them the galactic federation of course does they would worry about how you could maintain the social strata and the fixed organization if every janitor could be an ot it would be fine if you could restrict the technology to ots but it would spread to doll body and meat body beings they would fear the social and political upset that would occur if you freed thetans youd have to give them political solution which was as great as the political threat you cannot give them tech without taking responsibility for it or nobodyd listen to you people on earth dont think that scientology doesnt work but theyve been trained against the vector of it theyve been trained to destroy to entrap to set up fixed status of something and then work out destructive means of entrapment with it so people cannot leave certain social and economic strata of the society you are not up against pavlov freud etc you pose tremendous threat to the social structure of our current civilization you can tear it to pieces by rehabilitation of thetans tremendous power and force which can only be safe if there is also tremendous intelligence connected with it so that the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics will be produced for instance an ot can pull the air cover mammoths have been found in the polar regions with freshfrozen vegetables in their stomachs to explain this phenomenon it would be necessary to explain the fact that they must have been quickfrozen in sixty seconds in tropical region what natural cataclysm could have taken place in sixty seconds somebody pulled the air cover and gave the planet reverse spin because they got mad an ot who could do such thing in fit of pique would be terribly dangerous 431 an overt act doesnt just damage it damages the greater number of dynamics one can commit an overt act unintentionally by lacking data or not using sufficient intelligence to see what really is for the greatest good but really heavy overt act is one where one deliberately sets out to damage the greater number of dynamics keep this in mind during secchecking you should be looking for actions that are really harmful to greater number of dynamics not just some irresponsible actions an overt act is often realized after the fact you could have done it smarter way that wouldnt have been an overt so you get regret and hungup overts you seldom find anything in this lifetime that is real deliberate overt it has been awhile since the guy had power enough to do real overt some thetans will take on their shoulders more responsibility than is rightfully theirs however running dubbedin overts wont get them anywhere but under all that there is real overt of magnitude phase of this universe has taken place and ended the phase of the free being the free being has lost to solid unintelligent meanlevel societies another cycle opens up now this new cycle involves different kind of being one that is as strong as the old but experienced not as stupid because now you know what the score is now you have good reality on meatbody society and can see their political frailties and the impossibility of obliterating them because they start again elsewhere they can be managed handled helped or thrown on reverse vector the use of intelligence with force can maintain freedom of action without racking up new bank and new overts new war against the thetan there has never been lasting or intelligent society of free beings for asisness has dropped out as an ability and needs to be put back in but such society is needed since everyone on his own puts everyone downscale in the long run if freedom means total irresponsibility up and down the line you are not talking about freedom you are talking about catastrophe we dont need war we need balanced technology with the ability to meld force and intelligence we need knowhow and force not knowhow in the use of force we need balanced intelligence that can reverse what one does unmocking matter as well as making it freeing as well as entrapping if you know how to enslave people you should know how to free people if you are going to make up matter dont insist that it be indestructible in dealing with meat body societies dont just stir up the ant hill it will just disperse and continue to grow the era of total irresponsibility is over long cycle is over in this universe the cycle of the free being vs the meat body society is over the battle was lost and the free being doesnt exist anymore we shift gears by just putting some intelligence in with the force freedom with barriers is insupportable there is nothing in this case to be free from or to push against freedom must be worked for if you think that you will stay clear or ot just by never destroying anything again you are nuts criminals should be permitted to free themselves through compensating victims not to do things for the greatest good of the greater number of dynamics is an overt of omission one cant maintain freedom in the face of failure of such magnitude you cannot be or make an irresponsible ot we have to continue to take responsibility for our fellows not to take responsibility for others is to lose our own freedom in the end 432 l ron hubbard type 3 idate10763 volnum1 issue282 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec282 auditing skills for r3r 6307c10 shspec282 auditing skills for r3r some of the material in this tape is also to be found in hcob 9jul63 technical summary the required skills of processing and why we have the exact number of skills necessary to make an ot unfortunately they are not simple and they are numerous but they break down to about five skills which must be perfect they are 1 the ability to follow an auditing cycle 2 the ability to give it repetitively 3 the ability to read meter very well 4 the ability to read understand and follow the procedure of bulletin 5 the ability to get and keep pc in session any time an auditor cannot handle an upperlevel procedure it is because of the fact that he cannot do one of these five basic things as an auditing supervisor knowing this will enable you to get auditing done if the auditor cannot get results with process it is one of these skills not the process is awry amount of persuasion will overcome the lack of one of these skills you like to think that you are up against case level in training an auditor low case level does make it harder to teach some people but if you make that criterion of whether you can train someone you will lose there is case requirement for training you mustnt q and with the i cant of someone if you make him do it you make him right not wrong to agree with the i cant is q and aing with his aberration the d of t must never be permitted to refuse student because getting into the practice of doing so leads to limiting who can be trained to the point where auditing gets done when the instructor says yes you cant the instructor is invalidating the reactive mind and the students ability to audit deteriorates rapidly it takes some people little longer to get towards those basics and just do them but if you keep at it they will get there complex technology like r3r will show up the weak points in any of your five basics for instance given what you are handling in r3r if you q and you get major bad reactions 2 and occurs when the auditor doesnt make his intention stick in the session he tends to become the effect of the pc the level of error is always stupidly elementary and has nothing to do with what process you are running or how complicated that is r3n and r3r look very complicated they have lot of steps and lots of doingness but if you can do the basics of auditing you will have trouble it is fantastic to have process that runs engrams by rote all that can give you real trouble in r3r is wrong date and wrong duration which can result from faulty meter reading or faulty dating procedure it is difficult for an expert meter reader to get dates and durations of engrams if the auditor cant read the meter well wrong date doesnt mean minor wrongness it is something grossly wrong which rapidly snarls up the time track wrong date produces bypassed charge and grouped track the bpc is fantastic if person has his attention on date or something it will tick once on the meter even if it isnt the right date hence you can q and you might say that dubin case is just someone who has his dates mixed up you could probably cure dubin by accurate dating 433 nothing drives the pc battier than to have wrong duration say the incident is really trillion years long and you give him duration of two days the pc tries in vain to find the beginning of the incident he cant because he is looking at something that happened two days before so it stays all black and gruesome when you get that phenomenon you reduration the incident what made r3r workable is that pc has perception on any incident that is properly dated and durationed that is where perceptics lie there are only three reasons for perception 1 wrong date 2 wrong duration 3 it has gpm in it wrong assessment and overrun chain already flat give you ta but not necessarily perception the incident can get obscured if it has gpm in it because black energy goes up and obscures the engram this was caused by the pcs protest in the incident when lights go off in an incident look for gpm if that happens you have to get the pc to straighten out the gpm by taking him to the first pair of items in it get the motion out pick up another pair of items get the ta motion off that pair etc just clean it up rapidly then run it as an engram it is never very long or very difficult to run there is point where r3r and r3n cross start the case on r3r and pick up any implants that turned up while running r3r check for an implant on the duration step if you get onto the helatrobus implant clean them up get the first pair of items and discharge them with rocket reads etc then go back to r3r use r3n as the adjunct it is there are some technical details that you have to know these include 1 how to assess an arc break 2 what lists one should use 3 ability to do an accurate and thorough l and n to complete but not overlisted list the source of arc breaks on lists is incompleteness of lists you can however assess prepared arbitrary list without fear of having the incomplete list phenomena turn on because the pc never started the list so it isnt complete but in regular list in order to get the items you do have to be able to do l and n which includes metering if you are having trouble with r3r be sure that your difficulties do not stem from troubles with getting in ruds or say writing while watching the meter learn to audit by fundamentals and you will have trouble with procedure that just combines the fundamentals your main danger as an auditor is being too complicated recognize that the simplicities of the game are what make it hang together and work wrong date and wrong duration are the only things that give you trouble wrong assessment is very junior and generally just gives you ta because wrong date and wrong duration are such lies it is difficult for the pc to asis them and what happens to the track when you move to wrong date it is very hard to get the right date and duration to read even when the pc is in session and you are on the right chain date is easier than duration because the beginning of the incident is so hard for pcs to see especially at the beginning one source of wrong assessment is overrun when you try to go earlier than basic 434 case levels 5 6 and 7 see pp 414415 above all have channel through the bank on which the pc has reality where he can be run on engrams without dubin using r3r so if you find that channel and run the pc in it the pc wins and can go on up l ron hubbard type 3 idate11763 volnum1 issue283 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec283 arc breaks 6307c11 shspec283 arc breaks the trouble with arc break assessments is that you will generally have to do them on pc with dirty needle dont suppose you can or should clean up the needle first since all dirty needles are arc breaks you dont try to clean the needle and then assess for the arc break the only thing that will clean up the arc break is the list all you have to do is to follow very strictly the rule of the instant read and never miss an auditor who could do that would be pearl and that makes arc break assessment splendid training device if there were arc breaks on the persons track the fact of button going out would not cause dirty needle for instance suppress reads because it is sitting on chain of arc breaks there are two elements here 1 the thetans reaction to the experience he has bad with mest and significance 2 the mest and significance itself nothing has to be observed in order to be cf bishop berkeley and his tree falling in the middle of the forest thetans reaction to mest and significance must involve some contact with it but it can exist without being perceived the relation between the mest significance and the thetans reaction is communication to be affected by something one must communicate with it or knowingly not communicate with it this fact eliminates lot of philosophical baloney deliberate notknow of something can get thetan in trouble what gets the thetan in trouble is that he has been there and didnt communicate and he made picture of it or protested it and now he doesnt want to confront the picture either because the significance in the picture has been added to by his reaction of not wanting to communicate to it so thetans reaction becomes part of all observed or carefully not observed mest significance this then is the new significance of the thetans reaction at the time which made into mental image picture becomes the time track the past is different from the present in that the thetans picture of the past has had the thetans reaction added into it in mockups of future track hope or hopelessness is also added in so the future also has reaction added into it it is not often made up into pictures though it sometimes is it is just whole cloth dreamups not pressures against the physical universe or actual pictures however you can cause somebody to run future track so what you are auditing is thetans reactions to events gpms with their balanced masses float on the track and seem to be in pt to the pc if you want to horrify someone scatter him out of pt that the pc thinks is right there if you cant get read on dating facsimile that you know is there ask if it is tomorrow or yesterday this will shake the pc out of pt and you will get read however the pc usually arc breaks when you do this you are dealing with past that seems to be present time that requires reaction to it but has already got reaction in it so thetan takes his reaction out of the past incident and 435 wears it in present time and you have the factor of restimulation of reaction his reaction of the past becomes his reaction to the present when you have audited an engram the pcs reaction to the engram becomes part of the session time track it gives faint shadow of read if you get the pc to spot it again it is not really charged it is just the action pattern of the observed present you might even be able to get another rocket read out of helatrobus implant series at any given instant of the time track you can rekindle any given reaction the time track has reaction added to it making it different from pt pt doesnt have reaction in it except as borrowed from the track or added by the thetan you could lay out some stretch of time in which you deliberately added happiness to everything if you get someone to audit you through that time few days later you will get ridiculous amount of happiness the guy who is always looking for happiness and not finding it simply doesnt put any happiness into pt when you are supposed to react favorably or hopefully but you dont feel that way the confusion of conflicting significances can be so great that the whole situation seems very unreal and you want nothing more to do with it and it can chew on the back of your neck from then on you say i wont look at it and put it away on automatic if you dont stir it up life will you can get things to persist just by postulating it will persist otherwise you can only get persistence with lie the thetans reaction to mest significance is about the reality r and results in feeling of affinity or misaffinity this reaction is communication c and it is bridge between the thetan and the mest significance figure 11 graphics inserted the reaction is monitored by past arc or lack of it concerning similar mest significance of the past this assumes that the pc can maintain detached attitude then it is simple but say your pcs needle is nice and clean and you ask him to recall an arc break that is moment of miscommunication time when some charge was bypassed which has been restimulated the pc attributes the arc break to something other than the actual bpc which introduces lie into the situation and causes the arc break to persist time condenses as the pcs reaction to the mest significance prevents him from retaining detached attitude about it all if you are involved in the middle of the battle there is time to retain detached attitude you put it on total reaction this is caused by condensation of time what we really get the brunt of in this universe is an insufficiency of time you get that by staying on the time track 436 if you start protesting time you get too much time on your hands actually this is an unwanted location that is blamed on time you start protesting time when you have an unwanted location the basic lie on the track is to confuse time and location few trillion trillion years ago you probably didnt stick on the time track the further back you go the less you were fixed into present time you were slippery on the subject and could go yesterday and tomorrow at will as with the time machines in science fiction an ct is the only real time machine you cant change the past and future without recreating it you werent necessarily surrounded with the environment of pt this was very useful you could slip around all over the place however the drawback was that since one was fixed in time you couldnt stay in communication very easily and certain impatience was generated you got unpopular because you couldnt be fixed in one spot to be communicated with only implants could cure this there had to be major louseups to cause aberration on the subject only gpm implants could do it if you have fixed time you get fixed reaction because it is an enforced thereness you cant drift out of the incident you have very little time and it is the unwanted absence or presence of time that gives all problems you could clean up problems by running tell problem you have had what time was awry there where was there too muchtoo little time this isnt especially workable being rather limited but you could probably get some changes shred the bank bit and move him on the track time is made insufficient by economics you could also adjust problems by attack on location less effectively but you could you can actually find the spot in space and do reach and withdraw that is why spotting spots in space works if someone had an accident with car and tree you could run reach and withdraw on the car and the tree all impact is based on scarcity of time you need some very complex mechanisms to cause facsimiles to stay with person in pt bothering them all the time with them reacting against them all the time to build up tremendous lot of reactions which then becomes the personality of the individual thats the only trick that is the chief engram that is what makes engrams unrunnable but now with r3r we can run them your reaction to mest significance is couched in various ways where those reactions tend to not communicate or to obsessively communicate you rough up energy then it stays in the picture ie it is flowing at one foot per second and you get it flowing at three feet per second but it isnt really flowing that fast or you prevent it from flowing at one foot per second and make it flow at one inch per second ie the normal course of flows is interrupted because of the existence of problem or an obsession to be at it or feeling that you have got to get away from it or that it is bad the result is that you bypass charge it is former reactions that get rekindled there which then throw old pictures into restimulation since the pc doesnt spot the old pictures the present reaction is somewhat inexplicable and he misses the charge the auditor locates and indicates it and the pc feels better what has been handled is not the facsimile itself but the reaction factor part which since it is the thetans reaction is the part most intimate to him 437 it is similarity of reaction therefore that pulls in earlier similars cf getting the emotion somatic or attitude and running chains of that the only thing that caused restimulation of yesterdays charge was the fact that you reacted the same way today that you reacted yesterday the devil with the situation the reaction was the same and for that reason you pulled in yesterdays situation and didnt even know it youre not interested in running out yesterdays association as facsimile all you want is to clip out one little piece of it which is reaction reactionectomy when you indicate the charge you are actually matchedterminalling the past reaction and the present reaction and they can go bzzzt and the reaction or charge can vanish that is all you handle with an arc break assessment not the facsimile of yesterdays mest significance you dont have to know any more than that there was an earlier similar arc break the way to get pc into an incident is to ask him to find the largest object in it and tell you about it he will go right into the incident the thetans reaction to mest significance is manifested as arc your and my quarrels with many things that are wrong with the world is because our reactions are quite different from other peoples reactions to the same things hence to know everything is to forgive everything you get down past the reactions to the actual mest significance on an arc break all you handle is reactions not facsimiles in other words you dont run r3r on arc breaks you handle reactions the arc break assessment lists are just lists of bypassable charge so they vary depending on what activity you are engaged in arc breaks never rekindle until they key in an arc break is always keyin it is never the fact but the followup you can almost always get the missed withhold question to read on the arc break assessment list because that is the common denominator of arc breaks it requires missed withhold to key in an arc break there could be something far more fundamental than the missed withhold which wont read because of the pcs preoccupation with the missed withhold you can run the missed withhold and then still have to run the arc break if all you find is the keyin not the correct bypassed charge the arc break just keys in all the more the missed withhold only keyed it in on bypassed charge lists you may find the keyin and still have to run out the charge cf getting in buttons in ruds etc so missed withhold will read on almost any list it is on but there is most likely more that has to be found you should continue the list or reassess make sure that you are using the right list if nothing reads you are on the wrong list all you have to do to clear up an arc break is to locate and indicate the correct bypassed charge if it takes more than that you didnt find the correct bypassed charge if you dont know that you will give up using the system because you think that it is not invariably workable one reason for failure to cure an arc break is using the wrong list for assessment this could happen if there was little time spent on some other action which you and the pc had forgotten about 438 l ron hubbard

addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec255 tips on running r3r 6307c16 shspec255 tips on running r3r auditing engrams and gpms is new world to many auditors especially to those who learned different kind of engram handling this doesnt invalidate yesterdays techniques they have their place especially in the field of healing we can heal things although we have neglected this area of responsibility for which reason we are being attacked in the area so we will collect and publish what we can do r212 for instance can have fantastic results when done as limited process just dont do more than four oppositions on one item get one ri do two or three oppositions and be happy with it the pc has been beaten down by his experiences on the whole track he thinks nothing good can happen in the universe when one goodness occurs it is almost too much for him to have that is different zone of expectancy from making clears and ots people wouldnt be able to conceive what you meant if you said that you were making clears and ots although in fact they would believe you and feel very uneasy about it you would have restimulated bypassed charge and they will always get cross with you in all auditing dont stir up more charge than you can handle if you apply that to any process you run or to any program you formulate you will have happy pcs the worse off case is the less you stir up this goes directly in the teeth of the q and that is yesteryears mental sciences the effect scale has to be observed at low levels the person cannot receive much of an effect so you have to featherweight the effect to let the pc receive it the more desperate the case the more featherweight the cure the technology of the preliminary assessment step for r3r lowers the level on which it will be effective that bypasses the ordinary defenses of the mind so when you do such an assessment the rule of not stirring up more charge than you can handle applies in neon lights if you are auditing case at level 7 6 or 5 see pp 414415 above for description of these levels this person doesnt easily run engrams the assessment has located the only tiny channel on the time track where the pc can confront engrams and on which you will not find dubin that is the basis on which the process has been developed case at level 3 see p 414 above this is the case with partially visible time track can be run on any engram you can find and wont be particularly upset or damaged by wrong date or other error but case at level 6 dubin of dubin case has barge canal sixteenth of an inch wider than your barge and full of roots old stoves and curves on that channel there is dubin of dubin and with correct assessment the case will have perceptics this gives you the responsibility of handling the case very carefully by the rule of not stirring up more charge than you can handle because at this level there is process that will put the case back together again if it falls apart 439 the lower the case level the fewer incidents you will find per preliminary step the chain may be only one incident long test your level after you have run an incident if it doesnt read and the pc has had some sort of cognition about it dont choose this time to go backtrack if you have an incident that the pc can run it doesnt matter how long ago the incident was if he gets ta on it runs ok and that is all there is to the incident and if there are problems finding the date and duration and if there is read on asking for an earlier incident fine do another assessment things are more likely to run longer with an upperlevel case the clue to whether the chain is flat is ta action not how far back basic is to find out if you have run the ta out of the chain be sure that the ta didnt cease because of wrong date wrong duration or gpm in the incident if none of those apply leave it those are the criteria of flattened chain the helatrobus implant goes as far back as 43 trillion years ago the situation of having the ta cease is not the same as the situation of not having gotten any ta the only reason that you have trouble with running case with ta and arc breaks comes down to these factors 1 wrong assessment 2 wrong date 3 wrong duration 4 gpm in the incident that you are trying to run that you have collided with but have not found out about so you have been trying to scan the pc through the items of the gpm the worse off the case is the weirder the assessments will look to you the pc may run something well that is from the backtrack and still be lowlevel case so dont take the recentness of the incident as adjudicative of case level dating anything beyond an easily available incident becomes very difficult you are very likely to misdate and pass by incidents and the pc will know it too gpms are hard to date anyway being timeless and pc will have trouble staying in place on the time track this can also happen with upperlevel cases but they can take it lowerlevel case will plow in thoroughly the preliminary steps on level 4 see p 414 above this is dubin case or level 3 lead inevitably to gpm it is about the fastest way to find goal you ever heard of if the case is running well you can probably run the whole goals series right there any trouble you have with running case all goes back to the four factors given above wrong assessment includes running something that has not been assessed on lowerlevel case you can spend more time assessing than running the engrams test the level after you have something flat dont run over the pcs head when you have flattened the chain leave it the worse off the case is the more it moves from nonsense to murder so dont muddy the little channel you have to work in listen to what the pc tells you about what he wants to run but assess before you run it the way you make work for yourself as an auditor is by doing things that you shouldnt be doing for instance dont mix r3n and r3r dont switch from one to the other by mistake 440 there is point on the track where you can get back of and find the basic of all gpms ive hit that point i havent got it so i can hold it steady i got there by the way by keying out had an awful time recently working out the most vicious series of gpms on the track there are five pictures but the first one is invisible goal with them just opposing items in dichotomy four firing five times in row for each picture i ran into myself on the track trying to figure this out i gave up took two sessions to get it unwound and the first picture is invisible so youd always try to put picture there so basic is always missing it makes vacuum and pictures pour in thats why later gpms accumulate pictures you get in the habit this is the vacuum that holds the whole bank together when he contacted this lrh could hear gpms coming apart all the way down to pt obviously you dont try something like this on lowerlevel pc desperate conditions are hard to maintain in the face of featherweight touches but heavier measures like bypassing too many goals in r3n wont help the case it is always ok to push pc little heavier than they can go but the rougher the case the less they can take the arc break is good test if the pc arc breaks regularly dont always blame yourself except for overestimating the state of case and running the process too steep there is real excuse for running pc poorly but if you put the pc in an available channel he will run like doll buggy if you run him right do careful assessment after every flattened chain checking carefully for wrong date or duration or gpm in it pcs that dont assess easily on the standard scale can be gotten to extend it auditing is as easy to do as it is real to the pc l ron hubbard type 3 idate17763 volnum1 issue286 rev0 rdate000 addition0

intensity it took the preceding couple of years to determine that goals and related mental phenomena come down to engrams and the time track the difficulty with running engrams from 1950 on was the number of cases that couldnt run the time track years were spent on improving cases in october the time track assumed greater importance up to the point where lrh discovered that the gpm was an implant at that point we had to discover whether or not person could go clear without running the time track and engrams there had already been lot of failures with getting people to run on the time track lrh has always operated on the assumption that everyone could make it to ot few weeks ago he had to consider whether only fifty percent could go on to ot this was serious question which he had never before wondered about research since october has been very rough it has had to be done more rapidly because it was obvious that we didnt have much time left as proven by the january fda raid that was one reason that lrh decided to bypass clear and go for ot clear is an an aberrated comfortable human state which society can accept ot is something else it is like making playground supervisor vs commando with the government attack on scientology we had time margin to let us take care of clear first then go for ot so we are into research concerning how to make an ot when you accelerate research you get problems 441 because you have taken time out where you need time in the last few months the work lrh has done per unit of time exceeds anything previously attempted the fact that if you cant run the time track youll never get to ot emerged however what also emerged was that with r3r if you get the right chain with the right date and duration you can get anyone to run with sonic and visio that wasnt solution unless the pc also got ta action ta action is the key to all case progress because it measures charge blown hence improved reality and better ability to confront the track the pcs reality must improve or he cant go any earlier on the track if you process someone without ta you would be doing him more good by taking him for walk in the park ta motion tells you how much mass you are discharging off the reactive bank where ta is not moving you are not discharging mass you can tell in the records that this is happening by observing that the same goals are being set for every session and the pc is getting only lukewarm gains that coordinates with ta action that was what caused lrh to wonder if fifty percent would never make it to ot there was the thin hope that by running lower level processes you could get enough charge off so that the pc could run track with ta it was pretty frail hope doing this could produce keyedout clears but that is not good enough the world is going down fast and new solutions are appearing to handle crises we are the only new factor in the world in order to meet the present situation the scientologist in the us will have to produce at least spectacular case results or spectacular being the problem now is what is absence of ta ta action disappears off case to the degree that time is in error and there is the answer ta does not cease because you have run wrong goal or from arc breaks or failure to run gpm it is because of wrong time time is the single source of human aberration this datum now emerges as more important truth than we had realized the gpm is totally devoted to scrambling someones time so if you cant get the gpms off the case you cant unaberrate him gpms are hard to date but they must be gotten off the case gpms have characteristic sound there is slow statement of the goal in earlier gpms this was preceded by crack so they sounded like this spat ssssssssssss spat non sen si cal ly spat part of the aberrative factor is the pcs effort to speed it up to get it to run at speed that he is comfortable with he is speedy sometimes people cant get rocket reads off of items because they dont duplicate the speed of the items they go very slowly the the thetan thinks why doesnt it get over with the doublefiring principle of gpms also messed up the thetan and hung him up in time it gave positive or negative charge to two opposing sentiments it hit him from the right and from the left it made him feel as though he couldnt move but had to move to get out of the way of it he would also get into timescrambler the total purpose of the gpm was to scramble time gpm engrams are the hardest engrams to date pc cant scan through gpm you have to use repeater technique because if you try to scan through it it all goes black because the pc protested it all the way through in running it you rekindle the protest he had when he got the implant that turns the engram black then you cant see anything in it and he cant move on the track and he is all frozen up in the thing 442 the only thing that stops ta action is wrong dates wrong time and ta action equals processing the perfection of your auditing alone wont solve this so dating accurately is necessary to get ta action this doesnt mean dating down to the last microsecond your errors are the gross ones eg dating something at 945 years ago and it is really 145 trillion years ago very approximate dates back in the trillions of trillions of years ago is vastly sloppy but it is successful enough to get ta to straighten out case where the ta has ceased you clean up on time in auditing or on dating with an eighteenbutton prepcheck you should also clean wrong dates and wrong time as long as the needle is rough on the subject this could in or out of auditing you handle by 1 finding when the wrong dates were found times when things were wrongly dated you dont at first redate these things 2 when that is all cleaned up run down what was wrongly dated and clean it up with the pc even if you have to redate it you will see ta action restored to the case you want wrong dates that the pc guessed at or assumed earlier in auditing you continue to clean up the area until the needle is really clean and all the wrongness and upset has been cleared out of the way now the pc will date easily someone who is an auditor will also need the wrong dates that he has found on pcs and his anxiety on the subject all cleaned up too if you got the right date and right duration you will get perception if the incident has gpm in it the perception goes off because you have restimulated the pcs protest dubin itself is simply phenomenon of wrong dates you could produce the effect of dubin by deliberately giving the pc wrong date and wrong duration and sending him to the wrong point on the track then you will get collection of apparently dubbedin pictures and ta wrong items are tough on pc wrong line plots are result of wrong time sometimes you will flatten chain and the ta will go up this has something to do with wrong dates more deeply seated in the case than you can overcome without reassessment the pc has overstepped his own reality if the pc has trouble whenever he goes on the backtrack because it is all unreal and he cant believe it what is his wrong date it is the notion that life began at birth his error on time is on the length of the time track this is trap mechanism clean up all his considerations on the subject and his ability to run track will change look at the entrapment value of this limitedtrack business and see how much fuss current societys savants make about past lives one protests against truth unless they have vested interest in maintaining lie every pc tends to get their track tolerance extended as they find correct dates in the portion of the track that they can run fairly easily any case will hit ceiling of reality on the subject of dating but people only creak to the degree that there is wrong time wrong date can sneak in on you without your doing any dating for instance you assume that certain gpm is in the helatrobus implant when it is really goal that is much closer to pt by running it with the helatrobus line plot you have incorrectly dated it 443 never leave wrong goal or even more importantly wrong date on case if the case has been run on r3r and ta action is doubtful clean up wrong dates and all possible charge on the subject of dates dating etc if case is getting ta action dont harass the pc about it but if there are arc breaks look into wrong time always also look into wrong assessment some cases are very nervy about time and wrong dates they can hardly take it if you make small error on date getting all the dates straightened out will improve this case even if nothing is run dont invalidate the pc by checking all his dates do it periodically just checking for wrong dates every now and then in session date things in terms on years ago since the pc has been on other planets with dating systems that are different from earths ad and bc the wrong date phenomena extend to other parts of auditing for instance the pc may be doing an objective process walking through the room through facsimiles of maypoles merely in the act of doing that the pc gets reality on the room and gets the pc date which straightens out the track to that extent you could date the facsimiles whenever the pc hits one and then return the pc to walking around the room you could probably take case that couldnt remember half of this lifetime and accurately date things this would give him tremendous reality on things that he had never remembered before l ron hubbard type 3 idate18763 volnum1 issue287 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec287 errors in time 6307c18 shspec287 errors in time the insistence on having lived only once seems odd it takes more than gpm to produce such frenzy on the subject behind all aberration and illness there must be lie aberration cannot exist in the presence of truth pavlov apparently never noticed that reward was one of the stimuli that he was observing communism based on pavlov and the physiological nature of man becomes disastrous when practiced pavlov did total anatomy of punishment but left out reward capitalism works only because one analyzed it and pay is still part of the system if capitalism were earnest about fighting communism it would dig up such truths and promulgate them punishment does not uniformly control response at all it is not constant not all beings succumb to threat of punishment the reward part of existence is at least as important men will do more for reward than to avoid punishment the more that reward is taken away eg by taxation the more difficulty society gets into the lie that man is driven animal is destroying the social structure of man as long as you are trying to isolate the truth you will be 0k matter how much trouble you have in getting at the truth the trouble starts when you settle on lie and stop looking for truth you can have misconceptions and still not go nuts but when you settle on lie and say that that is the truth you have had it the lie will pervade your life it takes lie of the only lived once magnitude to continue the aberration of man to maintain such lie must take fantastic amount of duress someone must be working at it all psychosomatic healing could probably be done by finding the lie about the somatic for instance you could use the command recall lie behind the psychosomatic 444 what would be the most disastrous type of lie it would be one about time here is how to aberrate someone give him false time track implant him with false past complete with pictures and times times in the order of magnitude of thetans actual existence of trillions and trillions of years only wrong time will freeze case as reflected in frozen ta so this must be pervasive common denominator of aberration this suggests processes like recall lie about time or dating everything in the pcs lifetime hence the importance of history with this view of the subject of time lrh investigated to see if someone earlier had played around with peoples time in the past sure enough there were implanted times and areas of track where time was utterly confused and incomprehensible you could get guy fixed up with enough false pasts that he would dramatize them he would get the opinion that he should never return on the time track because it is too dangerous or too confusing you could confuse the guy further by giving him some incomprehensible dates r3r is good enough to be able to find moment when false past was installed date it and find its duration and then run it out the incident pretends to be trillions of years long when it was really two or three hours long the common denominator of these incidents is that the point where you approached is commonly repeated in the incident one moment is actual the other is picture of it in the incident so you get two beginnings as well as two departures commonly such implants also have mechanism showing troops marching to the pc the beginning and troops marching away the end with numbers running along the sides of these implanted pictures to give their times the implant will often have these pictures of beginning and end reversed it is very confusing the way you can tell false track is that it really doesnt move there is time in false track for all the details between major events and the sound is seldom included true time track is more sequitur but can have periods of anaten the reason the pc is likely to be on false track is that most of it except for the beginning and end points is safer and less uncomfortable than actual track false track is lie about time it may have dates neatly placed on the sides one thing you can say about false track is that gpm is on false track this would be pointless they may be implants but they are not on false track so if you are running gpm it is not the false time track you can find gpms and date them there are two things that you want to know when you find an incident and date it 1 does it contain oppositefiring items in which case it is gpm 2 does it contain any false past you need this data discouraging though it seems to say so on false track be especially alert for false date and duration the darwinian theory is just an implant putting out the idea that man is mud it starts with goal to persist they have you in cell so they start by showing you being in cell then they show you pictures of your arriving in the cell to be implanted then they show you complete with pictures like movie all that has happened to you this is background data that lets you know how mean you are then they show you being implanted while you are watching you are having the hell picked out of you by electronic mass stacking around your body you are hit with electronic 445 waves and the mass becomes associated with the pictures nothing at all is said there is sonic in this incident some false pasts do have sonic but beware of running things in these incidents that arent there the darwinian implant makes evolution appear true but it isnt when there are horses on planet it is because someone came along and mocked up some horses this sort of false past implant was done lot before the helatrobus implants some was also done after the helatrobus implants you have to know about this in order to get dates corrected you have to know that some are false not just wrong look for false pasts not false dates per the time track can also contain false future fortune tellers practice this to this day someone who is always trying to know the future is just dramatizing false future implant sound and motion are seldom found in false track incidents rather these incidents tend to jump from still to still more like lantern slides than movie the helatrobus dear gorilla and glade implants dont use pictures the helatrobus implant only uses pictures of railway and house in the gorilla and bear implants they have guy with pink striped shirt with monkey or sometimes gorilla that they put on the cart with you this is not the same as getting whole set of pictures that purport to be your past or future while getting electronic blasts false track can get in the way of running actual track some of it is pretty incredible but if false past doesnt read go ahead and run it run it anyway even if it is false maybe you will be able to find the real beginning however it is hard to find the beginning of falsepast incident when you run across something in session handle it but dont louse up your pc when you start correcting dates you will run into false pasts and futures so beware of redating just get in and clean up first the fact that it is false past and run it so you wont have it in the way if you locate source of wrong dates dont ask for another source of wrong dates run the one you have here is rule when you have your hands on an incident that contains false past or future run it with r3r to get it off the track get its actual duration the real beginning of the incident and also its end are hard to find since such incidents generally have two beginnings and two ends dont do anything extraordinary just be prepared to reduration it if necessary dont just redate it and leave it because thousands of dates will have been restimulated in the course of auditing and finding it again will be difficult apart from the fact that that incident is all you should run anyway until you have run it out so when you have your hands on something handle it dont leave the pc struggling with it while you try to do something else remember that your major auditing cycle is to accomplish some particular result on the pc if you get into something outside the perimeter of what you were going to do dont neglect it because it may never show up again when you have found the source of the pcs upset what else is there to find if you invalidate the source how will you accomplish you major purpose dont bypass achieving what you set out to do cognition can signal the end of your major auditing cycle 446 l ron

session is pretty short sincemidruds and pulling missed withholds is better than the previous beginning ruds an arc break assessment at end of session is much better than any endruds we had in the old model session if all lines are cleaned up as they read presession stuff is the same as always she rest of the model session goes like this 1 goals for the session 2 sincemidruds if ta up or needle dirty 3 check for and pull any missed withholds 4 body of the session use whatever is necessary to get him through b chat little before ending the body of the session 5 arc break assessment if the pc is not very happy at end of session the wording of this is still very fixed the only problem is on what to do if rud question is clean asking the pc if he agrees it is clean can cause an arc break if the pc feels that it is impossible for the question to be really clean 6 take up each goal from 1 above acknowledge the pc for each one made 7 ask for any gains made in session dont milk this question acknowledge these by saying thank you for making these gains 8 can squeeze 9 end of session the reason for rough needle on the pc is the auditors outtr2 and tr4 clean up tr2 and tr4 and youll clean up more needles than you can shake stick at it isnt the significance of it you see its the calm flow of the auditing cycle during arc break assessments you normally consider dirty needle to be withhold or something the pc has done but weak or overly heavy tr2 can do it as well there are two comm cycles in an auditing cycle 1 auditor pc 2 pc auditor these cycles can operate independently both have to be very acceptable before you get good auditing cycle the pc doesnt even have to say anything for communication to exist thus from the auditor you can get an rfactor as an independent comm cycle and from the pc you can get pc origination as an independent comm cycle from the pc as in tr4 in this case an acknowledgment is not even really necessary an artificial acknowledgment can knock an origination off its base you can handle these with head nod or facial expression the pc origination only needs ghost of an acknowledgment for the pc to know that the auditor got it if it is something that seems funny to the pc and to the auditor it is ok for the auditor just to laugh with the pc if you can project your think tank you dont need tr2 sometimes an acknowledgment can indicate understanding on the part of the auditor the pc only needs to be sure that you understand good auditor of children obeys kids auditing commands 447 in r3r you dont have to ask the pc whether he has done the command on move to the beginning of the incident he doesnt have to tell you that he has done it you will get meterflick when he is there and you can send him through from that point if the pc gives you gobbledygook do not tell the pc that you didnt understand that is powerful phrase to use furthermore by saying that all you have done essentially is to ask him to repeat what he has just said this is peculiarity of homo sapiens you just get the same words again that doesnt help you are just asking for complete arc break you want the pc to vary the statement what you want is an explanation or broader statement so you have to be able to get him to do that without invalidating him here we get the basis of the arc break there is bungedup communication cycle whatever else there is what is bunged up about it is that the communication is not fully detected and understood lacking those points there is comm cycle the intention of the pc is cause distance effect and that cycle is interfered with so that the communication is not fully detected this is the woof and warp of all arc breaks communication that is partially but not fully detected or you could detect something but not receive it for instance say the pc says that he feels fine and doesnt need to continue you say well thats fine but we will continue to fill in the time here the pc sees that the communication is not received because action is taken you said that it should be something else before it arrived at you therefore there is busted communication line you can get roaring arc break on this this is primary cause of arc breaks in this case r and c are out because u is out actually the communication is detected expectations come into this you can yell at rock since you dont expect detection you dont arc break auditing is different because the expectations are different there are other kinds of arc breaks all of them are based on the communication cycle the whole definition of bypassed charge is partially detected it had to be partially detected because it must have been stirred up comm cycle once begun must go through if it doesnt there will be trouble eventually you would think that people at cocktail parties would always be bypassing charge on each other because they are always partially detecting that someone spoke the only reason wog meat bodies dont explode during cocktail parties is that they are armored they dont expect anybody to hear them so theres never any partially detected charge comm it is very dangerous to ask for communication and then fail to acknowledge what is received as result of your request you are inviting an explosion in doing that for instance an auditor asks for the earliest incident the pc cant give it and arc breaks because the question kicks in an earlier incident than the one he can see which he cannot reach thus the pcs bank gets only partially detected and you get an arc break if the time track is like bunch of mines laid out in line and activated magnetically lets say you want mine number 4 you throw magnet to mine number 8 then you wonder why you get an explosion mine number 8 speaks but it is only partially detected one way to locate the earlier incident is to find its order of magnitude of years ago comm cycle once begun must go through or there will be an upset eg the president promises to communicate to everyone 448 but lacks the ability to carry through this gives the background for the revolution people who dont know anything about the communication cycle find this all so threatening and dangerous that they just decide to withdraw from communicating because they dont understand what is happening or how to remedy the upset desperation only enters in when communication goes out think of the sessions when you have gotten desperate your response to the pc ebbs and flows to the degree that you could put comm between yourself and the aberration thats bothering him and straighten it out and see the evidence of its discharge you dont worry about case for any other reason when you cant seem to reach the pc or the bank with your comm you get worried and upset when you are upset as an auditor see what communication you are not getting home to the pc and you as an auditor will feel better if the pc is miserable comm cycle is awry but this could happen in various ways from the pcs point of view some comm cycle has begun it hasnt been fully detected and it hasnt been understood that is the basis of low arc or arc breaks in your pcs even when the pc doesnt have an arc break realizing this point will help you understand something about your pc that you hadnt seen before keep on figuring out whether you are bypassing any charge the basis of low arc or arc breaks is 1 some comm cycle has begun 2 it hasnt been fully detected but has been slightly detected 3 it hasnt been understood actually in any pc you are going to see an out comm cycle because he isnt ot the telepathic cycle is usually out there can be the mundane result of the pc not having ever understood the command and at least faintly knowing it the reason that it is an arc break is that the nonunderstanding brings in and r it is the and r factors that tend to make the c not understood something didnt go through an incomplete comm cycle always results in bpc you should know that that simple little outness can bring the living lightning you should also know that the cause and effect always work in that direction the catastrophe that you are handling has simple little outness as its origin not complex bear the basic things that wont go through and get detected are r and c and the basic things that these three face are m s and t so you have the livingness of the person arc vs the material universe or mest or it is the individual vs time that is what keeps the k and c from completing the communication cycle there is lie in the individuals communication with time or with times communication with the individual bypassed charge originates as the beginning of comm cycle that is not wholly detected or understood charge is energy excited and channeled to go in certain direction but it never arrives because it is not wholly detected or understood so it always remains as bpc then explodes in dispersal of some sort it does not always explode sometimes it just results in downtone pc who is not feeling so well lately we know the magic of the explosive nature of interpersonal relationships knowing these things you should be able to handle session better dont be afraid that handling means always doing what the pc says just let the pc know that you got his origination and understood it and go ahead and do what you are 449 doing youve got to be an expert in the detection of communication that has begun the better you are the fewer arc breaks youll have the arc break assessment covers the number of types of comm that can be started and not detected in the activity you are doing so that you can find the correct bpc and not have to shotgun it with something like an earlier incident was restimulated deciding which list to use could be problem look in the right place if the arc break is in the session and you do an r3r arc break form you wont find it therefore use the right list if you dont get the bpc you are using the wrong list get the right one just realize that deciding which is the right list could be problem and use another list if you didnt find she arc break the main mistake you could make is not to be sure everything is fine with the pc after you have handled the arc break make sure that you are right about the bpc lists locate the type of charge bypassed the type of comm cycle that began and was never completed now its up to you to locate and indicate to the pc the charge the charge is not on the list it is in the pc the assessment is not the location even though the magic is good enough so that you can often get result just by indicating what was assessed you only actually get type of charge not the charge with the assessment you must still locate and indicate the specific charge if you tell the pc what you got on the assessment and he feels better fine let sleeping dogs lie but if he doesnt feel better or if there is still charge there find the exact charge that was bypassed you may need another list to get it so there are five steps to handling bpc with an arc break assessment 1 find out if there is an arc break 2 assess the appropriate list 3 locate the exact bpc 4 indicate it to the pc 5 check whether the indication was all right with the pc if it is wrong date check the ones you have gotten or see if it is in the first or the last half of the session l ron hubbard type 3 idate25763 volnum1 issue290 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec290 comm cycle in auditing 6307c25 shspec290 comm cycle in auditing illustrations for this lecture are contained in hcob 74aug63 lecture graphs most auditors early on get the idea that there are all kinds of pcs good and bad there are pcs who are nervier about comm breakdowns than others but practically pc can stand up against good comm cycle the difficulty an auditor has comes from his own auditing cycle and his impatience there are two comm cycles in the auditing comm cycle one with the auditor at cause one with the pc at cause they are only connected by the fact that the auditor has calculatedly restimulated something in the pc which the pc discharges on his half of the cycle that is the whole game of the auditing cycle see fig 12 450 figure 12 the basic auditing comm cycle graphics inserted some auditing breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the pc if the pc doesnt answer the auditing question he never gets rid of the restimulation if the pc alterises eg if he alterises the question or if he alterises the data from the bank then every restimulation gives rise to an alteris the cycle of acknowledgment is another little shadow cycle fadeout see fig 13 another shadow cycle is the auditor seeing that the pc has received the auditing command you can tell by locking at him that he didnt get it or that he is doing something peculiar with it so do look at the pc to find out figure 13 the full auditing comm cycle graphics inserted 451 so there are really seven comm cycles in the auditing cycle the four main ones plus three more 1 observing that the pc is ready to receive the auditing command failure to do this one can cause trouble if the pc is hung up on the previous cycle he doesnt really get the command if he wasnt ready to receive it 2 observing that the pc got the acknowledgment 3 tiny one before the acknowledgment which is seeing whether the pc has or hasnt said all he is going to say if you acknowledge him before he has said all you havent let one line flow to its end so the acknowledgment cant actually go through and the lines jam when you violate one of these comm cycles you will get trouble in which case you might need more cycles to unsnarl it so the auditing cycle can occur theres another comm cycle inside the auditing cycle which is between the pc and the bank see fig 141 you have an effect produced by the auditing command which results in cause the restimulation causing the pc to outflow it is actually two comm cycles there pc to bank and bank to pc then you get pc to auditor the latter is actually the least important of the cycles except when it isnt being done and it is the hardest to detect when it isnt being done figure 14 the expanded basic auditing comm cycle graphics inserted what is mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is that you have confused some of the comm cycles within it when you are doing complicated action like r2h if you are nervy on handling basic tool like the auditing cycle break it down and work on it while doing something simple on an easy pc then you will find out where it is jammed up 452 there is different auditing cycle inside the regular auditing cycle which occurs when the pc originates see fig 15 just handle it as its own drill it handles any origin including the pc throwing down the cans the pattern of causedistanceeffect is reversed because the pc is now being cause at the start of the cycle what the pc causes has to be understood so there can be some little comm cycles where the auditor gets it clarified what the auditor uses to clarify it mustnt just cause the pc to repeat himself tell some more about that is good approach but whatever you use isnt rote once the origination has been clarified the auditor acknowledges and can then resume the regular cycle if the pc is ready for it also at the beginning of the pcs origination cycle the auditor should observe that the pc is about to originate and shut up and make the comm cycle of im listening figure 15 the preclear origination comm cycle graphics inserted the fact that duplication is part of the comm cycle carries it over into r c and u this makes the auditing comm cycle different from the military comm cycle which doesnt require understanding military cycle causedistanceeffectcompliance auditing cycle causedistanceeffectunderstanding hence the auditing comm cycle involves and r too there has to be and r at the effect point because of duplication and there had better be and r at the cause point also so there should be arc at both the cause point and the effect point the trs handle comm cycles from one side or another full auditing cycle would need fulldress tr above what is covered in trs 04 453 and r come into tr1 it is one thing to enunciate syllables clearly and another to have an understandable communication r is involved it has to be duplicatable an accent can get in the way of duplication it is up to the auditor to be comprehensible from the point of view of accent diction and sense since if the auditor is not comprehended by the pc tr1 is out and comm cycle or auditing takes place then there is the pc who doesnt want to be audited at all here you have to establish comm cycle with some trick like tell why you shouldnt be audited or if the pc ia misemotional and the is out you can do an arc break assessment in order to pick up what is awry with the comm cycles between the pc and himself where the bpc lies repetitive auditing cycle is specialized activity it gets you in trouble if you dont realize that there is point beyond which you shouldnt be trying to complete the cycle that point is an ability regained that ep is of senior importance the major auditing cycle has as its ep ability regained junior to that is the process cycle which in turn is made up of single auditing cycles repeated as needed so the cycles that exist in auditing are 1 single auditing cycle 2 process cycle 3 major auditing cycle indications of flatness in process cycle are 1 three equal comm lags with the pc confidently doing the process 2 minor cognition win 3 ta flat 4 major cognition 5 ability regained the above eps are given in ascending order of seniority 1 and 2 are both absolute minimums the first real flat point is when all the ta has been run out of process major cognition takes precedence over the ta criterion to continue over major cognition invalidates the pc the senior ep is ability regained which is also the ep of major auditing cycle l ron hubbard type 3 idate6863 volnum1 issue291 rev0 rdate000 addition0

reason we have checksheet changes people who ask for changes in organizational structure overlook the fact that the character of this planet and its population makes it practically impossible to do anything with this planet it takes incredible stress and planning to get anything done on the backtrack one ia used to operating with ease and swiftness this planet is different this planet was part of federation and passed out of its control due to war etc this federation has been called the markab confederacy this sounds spaceoperaish but if it is true is should be stated whether it is acceptable or not the planets of the confederacy united out of fragments of earlier civilizations over the past 200000 years but it is not native to this galaxy in the past 200000 years mental implanting has been taking place that is not native to earlier track the markabians have the basic problem of how to kill thetan the best way to hide your overts is to give someone amnesia and tell 454 them that something else happened thats what is going on here their ideal is the conformist what they are conforming to is pretty scummy and lowtoned their standard choice citizen is the contented wage slave this leaves the artist the brilliant engineer the manager the criminal and the pervert all persona non grata they are afraid of all these types so they condemn them to perpetual amnesia calling it being dead forever then they ship them here so on this planet we have minimal number of workers and maximal number of artists geniuses managers criminals and perverts how do you make an organization out of these dudes they are all nonconformists therefore the difficulty you get in organizations with these people is alteris this has led to civilization on this planet that is totally different from the civilization that planted it here until recently when current western civilization started to look like the markab confederacy the fact that current western civilization has the same image as the markab confederacy makes this civilization restimulative it makes it look dangerous one of the highest crimes in the markab civilization is error in income tax that makes matters relating to income tax very restimulative here the material of the betweenlives area is contained in what to audit history of man pp 6566 the markabians have not launched big reaction to the fact that their secrets are out probably because they fear that landing in force would restore everyones memory and blow the amnesia people get mad at governments and organizations on this planet because they are really mad at the markabian government almost unbelievable force was used by the markabians to create the amnesia you can easily restimulate peoples amnesia by giving them some data about the markabians it seems very unreal to them as an auditor therefore you are handling the roughest case in the universe to rehabilitate the individual you have to rehabilitate his knowingness charge on the case represents lost knowingness as the case moves up the line you get an odd phenomenon the case remembers more one kind of memory that is restored is picture memory at an advanced state the pc can tell the difference between false and genuine picture he graduates up to simply knowing without depending on pictures up to point of knowing who and where he has been independent of crossproof knowingness is slow to increase but it does rise over the top of that identityknowingness which is still rather general comes detailed knowingness eg knowing how you got here why you are here and other details of the past without pictures that is the restoration of the beingness of the individual it returns gradually bit by bit along this gradient what does it take to bring about such total amnesia total explosion of spaceship in his face twice was enough to be little confusing to lrh it takes far more force than that to destroy someones memory to the point where he would have case the force also has to be combined with trickery scrambling dates giving balanced items etc to keep the thetans memories scrambled the amount of force it took is what the auditor has to get off the case its easier for the auditor and the pc to confront things like unknownness than to confront force but the force must be confronted eg in running ow getting off critical thoughts does nothing for the case theres something done behind 455 it which contains energy and must be gotten off it is the energy contained in done that makes it hard to confront harder to confront than some random think the mission of an auditor is the restoration of persons awareness which includes restoration of his memory his identity what holds it down is force used with trickery thus an individual gets an arc break with force and then becomes the effect of force so you are handling someone who has lots of arc breaks with beings matter energy space time location and form that is pc an auditor has to be somebody who can release this force from the pc ta movement registers relief of force in the reactive mind force is being removed from the case as long as the ta is in motion when force is aberrated by trickery the ta hangs up until the trickery eg wrong dates is handled you dont always have to run process to get the ta moving ie particular curative process if the ta is moving the pc will eventually go ot auditing in the absence of ta motion will never produce an ot if you run the right significance off the case and get ta action you will make an ot quicker but running the right significances without ta wont do it while getting ta alone on anything right or not will eventually give you an ot if might take thousands of hours if you audited person randomly ia motion indicates the blowing off of encysted force as it leaves the case when you run the right significances it speeds up the case because you are running the force off early track and you get extra charge blowing which doesnt all show up on the meter sometimes you will see repetitive blowdown as remote force area blows up the most fundamental method of making ta move is not running process it is the basic definition of an auditor listener it is up to the auditor to permit the pc to blow the mass that has been restimulated by the process which he does by listening his basic job is to listen not to restimulate we can get away with restimulating charge because we can talk to each other the only way to get rid of reactive charge is by communication line that is the only method cf axiom 51 the auditor only gets hit by the charge if he stops it from flowing across the comm line all therapies from time immemorial have consisted of listening but what makes auditing different is the ta action which the auditor produces by restimulating charge and letting the pc blow the restimulated charge the auditor gives the command it crosses the distance and hits the bank square in confrontable aberrated area the bank now causes an effect on the pc the pc now becomes cause as he tells the auditor about it answering the question the pc gains some knowingness when he observes what happens when the command reaches him additionally life is always giving commands to the pc and restimulating all sorts of charge as the pc tells you about his betweensessions activities with or without sincemidruds ta occurs as he gets that restimulation communicated to you this shows that the line from the pc to the auditor is little senior to and more important than the auditors line to the pc in the former line you will find all auditing failures providing any process at all has been run if the case was loused up by auditing we inspect the ta in judging particular process if there was ta on the process the process was ok as far as getting the causedistance effect of the pc to the auditor goes 456 when that line goes out the restimulation flows back to hit the pc where else can it go you see the first symptom of that line going out in the pcs dirty needle the auditor isnt listening he is doing something to shut the pc up the line with the pc at cause may take many times as long as the one from auditor to pc as the pc examines something undoes identification gets force off and gains knowingness the more ta action you get the more positive the pc sounds even in just one auditing cycle ta blowdown accompanies returning knowingness on the part of the pc the names of these main lines in the auditing cycle are the whatsit line from auditor to pc and the itsa line from pc to auditor the tone arm follows pattern it goes up on whatsit possibly the reverse happens on lowta case and it comes down on an itsa high ta shows you restimulated but unresolved charge when charge flows across the comm line it asises and the ta moves down knowing scientology if you were in the galactic confederation now you would be enthroned you could fix up all the messedup ots as long as you could listen in the confederation your pcs wouldnt have all the enforced amnesia you have to get rid of with an earth pc it would be like the difference between auditing an earth case and an ant the progression of events that occur when an itsa line goes out and is not restored is the following 1 dirty needle 2 stuck ta 3 arc break the itsa line is the most fruitful source of bpc charge restimulated and not allowed to flow out there are arc breaky pcs there are only auditors who dont listen the only crime you can commit by letting the pc talk is to do it without getting ta action what about the pc who is just talking motivators well they dont get ta from it besides someone who is just motivating is already in an arc break so you should find the bpc so that the itsa line which is the the same as just talk can get in again so let the pc talk as long as you are getting ta action and longer dont acknowledge just look intelligent and nod if the pc looks brighter at you this is case level 2 see p 414 above for description of this level auditing by the way if the pc is telling you all about the track lower down the case levels you have to direct the pcs attention more l ron hubbard type 3 idate7863

description of r2h see hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment and p 426 above it takes apart arc breaks by assessment however it falls apart with inexpert handling it is different from any process we have ever had in dianetics and scientology it has great power it will run engrams and secondaries and may be senior to r3r the only thing it wont run is gpm which must be run with r3m and r3n r3m gets you the patterns of wildcat engrams on r3m see p 382 for references on r3n see pp 414 and 426 above r3m is how you got the gpm patterns in the first case in r3m dont ask the crisscross question on oppose i would ask what does the next pair consist 457 of or give the oppterm of the third pair then what would oppose that r3n presupposes that you have the reliable items on some pcs if they dont random list you dont get ta random listing gets off the locks so you must still do this even if you have the item the main thing that causes the ta to rise and stick in r3n is wrong date or wrong gpm pattern cut itsa line will additionally send the ta up and stick it gpm is hard to date and floats on the track because its purpose was to foul up time the opposing items firing at each other sound like time to the pc the gpm floats in time and produces nochange situation this makes it perilously easy to misdate one also there is an implant basic to the helatrobus implants but much earlier which looks the same as the helatrobus implant it is at about trillions4 1048s years ago it is far more aberrative than the helatrobus implants that ia the one that they put on the screens in the betweenlives area see history of man pp 6566 gpms are the only things that need to be audited with special technique r2h has the potential for running wholetrack engrams and secondaries better than r3r by taking all the bpc out of them and letting them snap back to where they should be on the track we are not actually trying to erase everybodys time track in toto we are trying to take out of the time track the things that prevent the pc from having his pictures we are trying to pull the pcs havingness up to the point where he doesnt need pictures in order to know who he is if you can take the charge off of his unconfrontable pictures pictures that deny the knowledge of the track to him he can have pictures or not as he chooses the main pictures that louse things up are gpms however because the betweenlives implant has the target of invalidating all your pictures restimulating implants and wiping out identity and memory many people who are upset about auditing might think that you are trying to do this telling the pc that you are going to erase his time track will therefore cause an overwhelm lrh was thinking about outer space tactics and figured that lack of comm is the main trouble he speculated about entering societies from within with communication and wondered what would happen if we put up markab headquarters complete with flag etc they when they arrive they would think we are still loyal etc but the reaction of the earths population to the symbols could be rather wild the point is that when you tell the pc that you are going to erase his time track he goes into propitiative anaten because that is what has been done however if he had heard that you were going to return him his pictures he would feel very different pictures if inimical can be disowned the pcs real trouble is the pictures that keep him from seeing his pictures of course they are his pictures too but he disowns them you are only trying to pick out and handle pictures that bar other pictures when you have done this you will wind up with case level 2 see p 414 above with all his pictures then you can get at the automatic mechanism of picturemaking and place it under the pcs determinism whereupon you have got an ot level 1 see p 414 above there is an interesting point that can occur in auditing where the pc may disown the time track and just say well i dont know who i am but i am from there on you can have the track back with knowingness 458 you could go at this another way instead of erasing pictures bring up the pcs confront on pictures to the point where he could face the hostile ones and understand them without flinching or misowning them this is comparable to the old exteriorization approach except that it gets the pc to confront his pictures r2h well run can give the pc greater ownership of pictures and it makes the pictures better and prettier life and beingness consist of potentials and abilities not things but the ability or potential to have r and c degree of livingness is measured by arc how much arc is guy capable of and degree of arc is measured by the amount of livingness person is capable of think of it as potential for having affinity what is arc arc with with other beings usually communication with other beings goes out through mest ie it uses mest vias one usually has arc with other beings through mest one can however communicate telepathically even without high arc in some civilizations there are such things as telepathic vocotypers telepathy is hardhitting force it can pick up the thoughts or fears of thetan down the line who is also being subjected to implanting arc can also go way above telepathy below certain level arc depends on mest for its communication medium arc only really gets important after one drops away from telepathic communication because it is so present before then that one thinks of it when you introduce mest into comm lines arc becomes the measure of life so one could be in arc with thetans matter energy space time form or location those are the principal things to be in arc with see fig 16 the arc an individual has expresses the degree figure 16 life potential and the things of life graphics inserted 459 to which he can be at cause over thetans matter energy space time form and location the potential of arc of the individual gives the degree to which he can be at cause over the things of life the less life he has the less he is as thetan gets more and more solid he can have less and less arc because he must have gone out of arc with mest form and location or it wouldnt be piled on him without his choice so he must have had arc breaks with these things but how could he without having arc breaks with other thetans it is probable that he did have arc breaks with other thetans and it was having arc breaks with other thetans that led him normally to have arc breaks with mest form and location not necessarily but normally the more the arc the more direct the communication the less the arc the more you need mest to get across communication so as the thetan rises up the line he rises back up to direct communication direct reality and direct affinity with other beings when you drop away from telepathy you enter mest into the line and arc becomes subordinate to mest the less the arc the more you need mest to get across communication then you get very low where thetan communicates to mest not just through it man is not mud but man who wasnt alive at all would think muddily and reach mudlike confused conclusions that is the condition of other mental sciences today their adherents are so far away from other beings that they are talking to mest not through it this is like the kid beating his red wagon or cussing mest objects this situation is different from investing mest with life and otherdetermining it which is on another harmonic you are perfectly capable of mocking up living being or investing matter with life and then otherdetermining it and having it walk around and talk this is potential discussed in dianetics the evolution of science apparently in the form of discussion of installing demon circuits in the mind see pp 32 60617 but what if you felt that another living being is more capable than shoe what if you divested living being of life that is how far south people have gone arc breaks with thetans matter energy space time form and location bring about the dwindling spiral of decreased arc one believes that it is deteriorated but it never really deteriorates r2h forecasts that by clearing up persons arc breaks the auditor returns to the pc his arc potential by cleaning up arc breaks with mest things you can clean up arc breaks with pictures of those things in the reactive mind hence the reactive mind becomes more accessible and confrontable since thetans matter energy space time form and location are what the pictures in the bank are images of thus in auditing one clears up arc breaks with things in pictures that the pc cannot confront in his reactive mind therefore the bank becomes more confrontable and it opens up the basic concept of r2h is that the reactive mind is reservoir of arc breaks space space is the cure for noconfront the button of the bank is space so that it is right on top of you time you get an apparent absence of time in the reactive bank in the presence of totality of time you get nothing where something is and something where nothing is thats what makes the bank reactive instantaneous response regardless of when the response was laid in 460 form this relates to aesthetic taste the pcs reactive mind has closeup stockpile of those forms that the pc has detested the most location an example is running an australian incident as being in england or you are poking around planets that are lightyears away without knowing it when you run such things they may spring back to their proper locations the problem is identification or disassociation disassociation is the reverse of identification two things which should be seen to be similar are seen to be madly different r2h helps the pc to differentiate all the identifications of thetans mest forms and locations that he is afflicted with you could also run into disassociation if you really put in the itsa line the pc will be giving you all the disassociations he runs into as he looks over whatever it takes to answer your question he should see similarity between your question and his answer but he doesnt at first so you will get nonsequitur responses these are things that are on the pcs mind as he tries to answer the question hence to get them off his mind he says them the thing to do here is to wait until the disassociation is run out eventually the pc will answer the question disassociation is an inversion of identification which also gives an inversion of arc you get restimulation factor that works this way 1 the pc knew girl with pink hair 2 therefore girls with pink hair arent to be trusted 3 therefore nothing pink must be trusted 4 the pc knows fellow named pink who brushes his teeth so he had better not brush his teeth any more below disassociation you go into an inversion and you get more identifications at lower levels good comm is shooting people arc doesnt just decline it inverts and then inverts again there is bottom but odd things happen on the way down beingnesses forms and memory can die but not the individual there is some method of communication all the way down because arc never ceases you can get into weird versions of reach and withdraw for instance you have to go through the anger band so if you can improve c r or you can keep raising the triangle by running arc breaks as in r2h the main limit of the process is the limit of communication of the command recall an arc break but that can be communicated with little work if need be furthermore it is therapeutic to someone just to comprehend the definition of arc break you dont care what the pc is arc broken with in gpms you may get arc breaks with mest for obeying implanters and with implanters for debasing mest to this use it is an upscale case that recognizes real arc break with mest it all works out if you just follow the formal structure of r2h 1 ask for an arc break 2 get what it was 3 get where it was 4 get when it was 5 do an assessment cleaning every line as it reads 6 work the arc break over until the pc feels fine about it and it longer reads 461 take what the pc gives you dont probe the pc may get into trouble getting when you use your meter to help out only when the pc is in despair about the time and has utterly given up then just tell him what you have seen reading that is your meterdating you can watch the meter while the pc gives possible dates repair of r2h 1 when the ta is hung up you have wrong date and you had better find it 2 you can also get in big midruds on the session or the process because the pc has recalled arc breaks that he has suppressed and that he hasnt told the auditor 3 the pc can arc break in the session because of an arc break in the past 4 you may have missed read on the assessment so you dont have the right bpc when you get read on line of the r2h assessment be sure to take it up with the pc by getting the pc to tell you more specific data about the reading line eg on had some emotion been rejected you must find out what emotion was rejected dont just indicate the generality to the pc since that wont handle the arc break it is not the correct bpc if this doesnt work then one of the factors listed above under repairs is out if the pc protests line fine dont shove it down his throat but come back to it later it just wasnt ready to be answered you should get bds on finding the correct bpc if you dont get bds with running arc breaks you are going to have trouble with future arc breaks you must find the bpc getting one doesnt necessarily mean the arc break is fully cleaned up so check with the pc and notice the meter after you have gotten one bd you ask the pc how he feels about the arc break and watch the meter like hawk if the meter is clean and the pc ia ok now dont go on or you will be after withhold of nothing and you will create an arc break do not keep cleaning clean if the arc break isnt clean continue running it it doesnt matter how many arc breaks you handle per session what matters is how much ta you get dont leave an arc break until it reads smooth as glass if an arc break doesnt blow down you are asking for future trouble because you have bypassed some charge without cleaning it up the mechanism that you are operating on is that the incident will blow if the misaligned or bypassed charge is knocked out and that arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge if you find the bpc there wont be an arc break and the pcs bank will straighten out clearing an arc break depends on itsa the slippiness of the process of running an arc break depends on knowing when to leave it and letting the pc get charge off with itsa you could theoretically get the pc all the way to ot with this just by getting the charge off 462 l ron hubbard type 3 idate8863 volnum1 issue293 rev0

just headed at ot but it would give you free needles as clear waystop in many cases you would get keyout phenomena that would give you the straightenedout track that would look very like case level 2 it is really only keyout but it would have the attributes of clear if you combined it with r3n when necessary to get gpms out of the way it would take you to case level 1 recent policy letter 30jul63

the various levels compare with the classifications of auditors which is convenient it puts more order into the subject and its materials class 1 he can listen class 2 he can do cchs run repetitive processes or cure something class 3 he can make better human being class 4 he can make an ot class 5 he can make sane universe r2h can be used at scientology levels 2 3 and 4 it is phenomenal to have process that can be used at so many levels it would be putting lot of stress on the theory of arc to ask of r2h that it reach into level 4 and some holes in what we knew of arc showed up r2h turns out to be inadequate for certain kinds of work the only frailty of r2h given an auditor who listens and meter that reacts is in the list used if one specific type of charge was missing from list and you used that list on all arc breaks that specific type of charge would tend to charge up on the case it would be restimulated and encysted eventually it would gum up the track and overwhelm the pc so the weak point of r2h is the embraciveness of the list used lrh cooked up all sorts of fancy systems and finally hit on the formula that would give an embracive list it is very simple like the itsa line see fig 17 the full derivation formula is as follows the cdei scale has an upper and lower band which were previously missing known and unknown go above cdei you never get curious about something you know about so knowingness must have disintegrated down to unknownesses therefore things must be unknown before you enter cdei at all in the logics we have had the datum an unknown can cause confusion so that is how it fits in actually this is not in the logics dianetic axioms 105 an unknown datum can produce data of plus or minus randomity and 107 data of plus or minus randomity depends for its confusion on former plus or minus randomity or absent data may be relevant here the know 463 at the top of this expanded cdei scale is below notknow the first postulatesee p 14 above the know on this expanded cdei scale is evidently equivalent to know about the second postulate unknow on this scale then is evidently equivalent to forget the third postulate unknow is not the same as notknow you never get curious about something you know about so unknow would have to intervene between know and curious about on this scale below cdei there is lower band nothing an absence nothing to inhibit that is the black panther mechanism of ignore it man routinely does nothing about things figure 17 the expanded cdei assessment scale graphics inserted below that there is one more level falsify falsifying puts something else there so that now you can get the whole scale again on an inversion the false at the bottom of one scale becomes the known at the top of the lower inversion scale so there is known falseness then unknown falseness then curious about the falseness etc all the way down so you get perversions of perversions falsifications of falsifications as you descend into lower and lower inversions of the scale so in this universe one probably never sees know but always form of false finally you get modern science based on the false premise that man is mud 464 the pure cdei scale wouldnt handle engrams because it was incomplete and didnt invert the way the full scale does the pure cdei scale still shows only one band say 2010 of the tone scale whereas every time you go through one cycle of this expanded cdei scale you drop 70 on the tone scale now you can look at arc for an incident and arc for an earlier incident to each level of the expanded cdei scale we also add missed withhold and all this dives you the list 1 see fig 17 p 463 above containing the totality of all possible combinations of charge on an arc break all possible levels that will have all possible reactions for everybody so combining them youve got attitude reality communication and missed withhold on each of the eight questions plus all these on earlier incidents giving you total list 1 with 64 questions that is how you would evolve list 1 if you were off in the boondocks you could use this schema by assessing the cdei scale on the incident first then assessing the level with r c and missed withhold the current list 1 is really the inhibit scale you wouldnt have to put in kucdeiof on missed withhold on lower level cases some on the levels of the expanded cdei scale are null anyway you can eliminate k u c d and 0 leaving you with i and f as the most potent sources of arc breaks because of the low case level with which you are dealing so for beginning cases this would leave 16 question list as you go upscale you find after awhile that your list falls short so that you have to add as too much someone at case level 2 see p 414 above would need still more expanded list dont have anything missing on list 1 the dale carnegie course is course in the creation of and maintenance of false realities psychiatry isnt even up to this lower case levels probably need emotion on the scale as well as attitude representing affinity in order for it to communicate to the pc after all the whole knowtomystery scale can go under affinity you might wonder why we dont expand this schema to include overt the answer is that ow mushes engrams and ruins pictures overts and prepcheck buttons ruin the energy structure of an engram because of gpms etc the buttons are too powerful and fundamental it takes certain amount of aberration to hold the picture together ao that you can run it but the buttons of arc and cdei only strip charge out of the engrams and make pictures better big midruds are ok for use on the physical universe as in ruds because the physical universe wont unmock easily at lower case levels however perhaps when the pc gets up the line into case level 1 using big midruds on the physical universe would be dangerous too we dont want the list to be too beefed up so that it mushes things up too much that would defeat the purposes of r2h the heaviest button on the list turns out to be falsity that is what the thetan objects to most and it is also what he feels guiltiest about falsity aberrates because it destroys trust it is part of every theta trap and it accounts for lots of arc breaks with mest the way to get the most ta out of list would be to go down the list preassessing it then take the biggest read and have the pc explain and itsa about it method 5 sometimes when you use this method some pcs will drag the bpc that got restimulated on an earlier part of the assessment on through the rest of the list with him such pcs would do better being cleaned up level by level 465 as you go along method 3 but if you do it that way the major charge that would give you bd has been bled of charge to the point that this major charge wont read much on the list you should therefore take any change of characteristic as read you get that difficulty in exchange for dirty needle the best solution might be preassessment that narrows the search too abbreviated list leaves you with bpc and high ta charge moves the time wrong in an incident the incident is charged say because of something that happened in 1912 but the incident is in 1920 you could miss this leaving bpc and eventually getting stuck high ta from the wrong date process that would be ta pump would be recall worry what was it about from this you get ta pump consisting of an alternating whatsit and itsa this is not particularly therapeutic one other point what if you had pc who got ta but got better his failure to get better would be an apparency eventually he would go ot but it could take thousands of years however you also have to run the right significances you also have to complete cycles case change may result from shifting processes on the pc that you were getting ta on with this happening the case could still get better but uncomfortably also you can restimulate things on case that dont get handled for some time for instance you could early on get screenrestimulated engrams that could not be run out right away this would be an unnecessary restimulation of charge getting better is not how the pc feels but whether he is getting more knowingness and more ability also current state is not measure of getting better for instance person may have had good memory and awareness level and had it knocked out in the last betweenlives this then would be temporary condition you have to review case over at least thirty days to know what the true state of affairs is l ron hubbard type 3 idate14863 volnum1 issue294 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0

significance brings about faster clearing 5 the right significance and ta action equals case gain 6 keep the itsa line in 7 get ta action 8 when training an auditor get him to figure out how many ways you can cut an itsa line the smoothest auditing is the auditing which least cuts the itsa line auditor means listener 9 it takes lie to hold aberration in place 10 serious aberration surrenders easily its the mediocretype aberration that takes the long haul 11 the primary difference between scientology and psychiatry is that psychiatry is authoritarian and tells the person what is wrong with him often introducing new lie scientology finds out what is wrong with the person from the person and then knows more about it than the person but listens anyway 12 listening is the badge of superior knowledge he who has privileged to listen only he who has superior knowledge talks all the time with this data you could evolve all of scientology 466 dont discount the knowledge of scientology even though you dont use it to evaluate for the pc if pc feels unreal about having lived for say 30 trillion years let him go through the unreality and run it out he will natter about how unreal it is he has never talked about an unreality before but in the process of talking about it he is raising his arc with whatever it is albeit slowly pc has two kinds of talk theta talk and entheta talk auditing consists of two actions corresponding to these two kinds of talk 1 listening with ta action this is getting theta talk out of the pc keeping the itsa line in it is theta the pc is generating that is blowing his bank apart 2 locating eg by assessment trapped charge entheta talk is handled by locating the impeded charge of theta which is barriered in the bank bpc this is the first step of putting in the itsa line find what trapped charge is trying to get loose the pc is talking up out of the bank he has been protesting cut communication lines unrealities and lack of affinity charge has been ticked and missed and the pc will go on nattering unless the auditor locates and indicates the charge what about talking havingness down this only occurs when it is entheta talk the whole phenomenon of havingness is raising arc with the environment if the pc is cutting his arc with the environment his havingness will drop how many ways can you cut an itsa line it would be beneficial to an auditor in training to give you all the ways he can think of it with an example of each and how to prevent or remedy it there are three parts to successful session 1 get the pc in session ie interested in his own case and talking about it 2 keep the itsa line in so that you get maximal ta action 3 knock out the significances necessary to resolve the case fastest the above would define the superskilled auditor you would get lower classes of auditors as you cut out parts of this until you end up at the bottom with book auditor whose skill is just to listen to the pc talk about his case with idea of ta or right significance when training auditors pound one significance home at time dont get complicated and you will win for instance on coaudit just keep the pc talking about himself dont worry about repeating the command or acknowledging etc all you want is the pc telling the auditor about his troubles you can see improvements if the pc looks brighter and talks better ie if he shows increased arc as you move the auditors skill up to using meter you want to get ta motion keeping the ta moving is the deepest problem in auditing at present this can get complex the reason ta stops is time the type of incident that is the most tastopping is the gpm especially after it has been redated crossdated or grouped in one of the betweenlives screens and after it has been mislocated if there were gpm probably nobody could group bank the gpm gets pinned down in the betweenlives screens and ta stops it is timestopper because it floats in 467 time and appears instantaneous the auditing action that stops ta motion is wrong date it tends to group incidents if the incident is 3d visio and stays in the same place as you run it the date is ok if person is running different incidents at once he has wrong date if you wrongdate gym it is grim ta stops as if hit by truck it is possible to date gpm but the reads on dates are tiny because it is gpm and it is very rough to date it after you have dated gpm the date is as valid as you get ta if ta packs up the gpm is very likely to have been misdated you could find that you have to redate gpm when the pc gets off enough charge to spot that the first date was screen date your new date could still be only temporarily right you could go for seven sessions getting it dated which could be very fine if you kept the itsa line in and let the pc help you most of the track you see is real track but it is often invalidated false track is nothing because there really is false track there are false pictures but false track is just the dubin someone has put over his actual pictures if you invalidate someones track hard enough and hit him hard enough he puts dubin over the top of the picture which looks like the original except that it has little film over it as you audit it the film comes off and he sees the original picture the dubin is not very different from his own track actually the unreality the pc gets about the picture is the force and invalidation that has been laid in if you hit someone hard enough things get unreal down to unconsciousness unconsciousness is just total unreality so there are also arc break phenomena which prevent the meter from reading well that is one reason why the meter reads so little on gpms they are full of arc brokenness but if you just keep trying to date the gpm and dont cut the itsa line you will get ta having the itsa line in and blowing charge will increase the pcs reality on the incident to the point where the date is more and more real bundles of facsimiles will start to come apart if you just keep chewing at gpm in this way chewing at its date its pattern etc it will suddenly be there so clearly that you will wonder how you ever missed it you are getting enough charge off so that he can see it keeping the itsa line in while dating is very helpful but hard to do at times let the pc give you anything he can tell you about the date get all the ta out of it first and only go to the meter when the pc throws in the sponge then work it over and when it is all hopeless with the meter talk from the pc takes over keep at it persevere and relax it might take up to seven sessions to get the date the stable datum is that if you keep chewing away and trying to find it suddenly enough charge will disappear so it all folds up and you get it just keep him talking and he will come up with it but the more you ask the meter for the data the less you will win you can kill ta by evaluating because the itsa line is being put in for him dont put in the itsa line for the pc the meter gives you preview of coming attractions meter reads at deeper level of awareness than the pc when some charge is blown the pc will now see what the meter saw awhile earlier you say whatsit and the pc says itsa this is auditing but if the pc says whatsit and you use the meter to say itsa the ta folds up this will occur if you create meterdependency it is better if you must tell the pc what the meter says to present it as question if you put in the whatsit and get itsa from the meter you will get ta action if you have pc demanding 468 information you can help him out it is more desirable to use the meter than to have the pc quit sometimes you have to snap in the itsa line try to get the pc certain before using the meter then you may use the meter but get the pcs agreement first as an itsa eg concerning the date you can work back and forth with the pc and the meter using the meter to jog the whatsit eg to get the order of magnitude then ask the pc if he gets anything let him find it if he asks does that read see if you can get him to say itsa eg by asking does it seem right to you then when he has said itsa you can confirm it with that reads one way to cut an itsa line is by continually asking for more than the pc can give for instance the pc says proudly ive got picture of some mountains the auditor says what kind of mountains are there any people or when the pc says i just cant find the date i dont have clue the auditor says well come on what is it this stretches an itsa line beyond its ability to stretch the situation is that you have bled off all the restimulation that was available so stir up little more by using the meter on one step or so of dating the pc easily invalidates his own reality and ability to know date dont above all use the meter to invalidate him it is better to leave the charge on something than to arc break the pc about it if he gives you date and asks for meter confirmation and there is read make it as ok as possible for instance you could say well i didnt see one there it doesnt say anything right now on that use your meter to give him the whatsit line and coax the itsa line at last resort all you have is your meter like when there is howling arc break and the pc isnt talking or thinking that applies to sessions where the pc is out of comm you can cut an itsa line to ribbons with arc break assessments as the drop of hat the value of the assessment is when all else has failed because the most operating thing you have around you is the pc the problem of how you discharge gpm without cutting the itsa line is tricky one what if he is going over one pair of items and the next pair comes up and he wants to go on if you leave bypassed charge on the items you are doing he will arc break one solution is to write down the new pair acknowledge them and then clean up the old pair the whatsit line raises ta the itsa lowers it the solution of mystery is the resolution of the case and the restoration of ta motion the pc is stuck on whatsit for which he has itsa when the ta quits the pc sometimes has his own whatsits he forgets the whatsit you gave him and never gives the itsa so you get high ta pcs do this all the time especially during break hence you could ask is there anything your attention is on or did you speculate about anything during the break the funny thing is that asising whatsits doesnt give you auditing you cant asis whatsits you could ask get the idea of questioning things repetitively this would give you high ta the bank is composed of cure to the problem or puzzle the reason that the puzzle is hung up is that there is something in it that was cure cures brought about problems to asis problems you have to pick up the cure which is the itsa the problem was the whatsit the cure is the itsa so you announce the confusion the pc gives you the stable datum and you get restoration of balance it blows off twoway comm blows all the locks off of 469 engrams for instance if the pc says that he has big ptp you could ask when he became aware of it what solutions he has had for it etc so you need to find the whatsit and the itsa problem is in microcosm gpm you could ask what have you been puzzled about what answers might there have been to it auditing questions must balance between announcing the puzzle and asking for the cure l ron hubbard type 3

keep the tone arm moving it should have the same numbers it should probably also have onehanded electrode it should be very small and rugged ideally it should be able to go through the bottom with stop you could hang it on the pc with belt and keep him on it for cchs it would show discharge of charge the minimum ta you should get is 025 divisions per twenty minutes 075divisions per hour small amount of ta is enough for healing needle blowoff is enough r3t or r2t consist of putting in the itsa line and dating even 01 division per twenty minutes is enough to blow somatic that is enough for healing but not enough to make the pc feel better as result of auditing this explains the oddity that dianetics heals chronic somatics with the pc not realizing that auditing had done anything you would heal the illness but the person still doesnt believe in dianetics you havent helped the person that was what drove us out of healing not the medicos auditors found it frustrating without understanding the ta it is doubtful if the auditor will ever be able to predict his result if you know about the ta you will know that if the pc got ta in session 1 he is liable to throw the auditor curve at the end of the session 2 he is liable to have some sort of upset within twentyfour hours 3 you have restimulated charge because all auditing restimulates charge these phenomena are not inevitable the reason 0w is not being stressed is that not all auditors seem able to restimulate overts they accept critical thoughts and motivators and miss all the pcs withholds any auditing that requires extraordinary targeting and restimulation becomes more difficult to do difficult part of auditing is in selecting the significances of restimulation which the auditor must engage in with the pc the degree of restimulation restimulated in the significance becomes an even greater level of skill eg the question of how much gpm you have to restimulate to get the gpm run the skillful auditor restimulates only the number of items he wants to run the less skilled the auditor the more items and gpms he restimulates in order to get one pair to run the whatsit line regulates restimulation on the whatsit line you should 1 know what you are going for 2 know what you have to get to 3 have heart and dont overrestimulate 4 avoid q and 470 auditing works by restimulation and blowing of charge you can blow charge on an early incident of chain and have the later charge blow off without registering on the meter that speeds things up if you dont put in the itsa line and let the charge blow off the pc stacks it up and arc breaks etc etc not restimulating charge at all or restimulating too little charge equally result in noauditing this will give an arc break because the expectation of auditing not fulfilled will itself bleed charge which is then bypassed and will blow up restimulating too little charge or charge is worse than restimulating too much charge for instance you will get in bad trouble if you fail to run the pc through an engram twice because he is in pain incidently thetan in good shape probably enjoyed pain you can pick this up by asking the pc to waste some pain repetitively he will cognite that he can have it sadism isnt peculiar it is lower harmonic of an actual fact any sensation is better than sensation anything is better than nothing that is different from only being able to enjoy pain as thetan goes upscale he can stand more effect most newspaper reporters are unauditable if you try to audit them all you get is lot of missed withholds the reporters attention is all out there he has attention on his case this guy has lot of arc breaks he is dramatizing overts indicating bpc gives the pc control over his charge when you run circuit with charge on it it gets spongelike character then it starts picking up charge whether you want it to or not out of the intention that auditing will occur it will still bleed charge out of the bank and the pc will still arc break ta measures the adequacy of restimulation it shows that an adequate amount of charge is being restimulated and that it is adequately dispelled with the itsa line there is really miles of margin for error on either side of the ideal amount of restimulation where you will still get ta and case gain you can have the pc swamped and still get ta or you can be running the pc pretty shallow and still get ta there is lot of tolerance too much or too little restimulation beyond this margin of error causes cessation of ta the meter doesnt tell you if you are getting too much or too little restimulation most standard processing is strong enough that you are not restimulating too little charge auditors therefore dont worry much as long as there is some ta motion just doing any auditing at all guarantees some restimulation what you are auditing regulates how much charge you are restimulating using upperlevel processes you are only going to err by getting overrestimulation since niagaras of charge are available if you are going through gpms without getting ta it is not because there is too little restimulation it is overrestimulation if there is too much charge the pc shuts it down and the ta locks up you can say that it is unreal to the pc but unreality consists of 1 force uncoordinated raw force 2 invalidation 3 disagreement on the thought level so to say that something is too unreal to the pc is to say that there is too much charge on it the auditors problem is delicately to put the whatsit line in the right place so as to 471 bleed off charge where the pc can confront it if the discharge line gets overloaded the pc will explode in an arc break the problem of the auditor therefore is not how to restimulate more charge it is not the problem of how to empty the atlantic ocean but how to bleed few drops off of it the pc may beg you for oneshot clear process here you see the working of the effect scale what the pc needs is some small effect some line to bleed charge that is small enough not to be dangerous he is very careful because everything is live wire if you run any pc at too high level it can become too much for his body while still being ok for continuing to get ta eg person with cancer is in an almost continuous arc break however if you go above the charge tolerance then thats it for the ta lrh comments on wilhelm reichs character armor wilhelm reich had an esoteric form of charge that he called orgone this sort of charge was thought to be involved in the buildup of arthritic deposits charge is also what caused things to break around jung and it is what gives people odd somatics acute or chronic acute charge destimulates in three to ten days if it keeps on being restimulated with opportunity to be destimulated or bled off one gets chronic somatics even then it takes periodic restimulation at the end of each lifetime to keep thetan as unaware and charged up as he is there is preparation series of gpms that have thirty to forty wrong dates apiece with command to return sandwiched between each of about eighty gpms the goals make life the opposite terminal they are all derogatory goals like to be wrong or to get caught your first indication that the pc is nearing his limit of restimulation is lessening of ta action by this time the pc is already past the point of comfortable charge level audit as delicately as possible at this point as you go on be sure the itsa line is very in and dont let any more charge get restimulated until you have cleaned up what you have do not let the pc dive into earlier track matter how eager he may be to do so that is how you get stuck tas haul out of there start getting thorough you can ordinarily trace back any ceased ta to some action that stirred up more charge than got handled for instance say we run the center goal out of the bear implant then we start running the rest of the goals suddenly we lose ta action we have just restimulated three or four out of five goals ie we have three or four gpms on restimulation that amount of charge stirred up eliminated ta motion the overcharged case is always the high ta case it is the whatsit line that is responsible for this overrestimulation with resultant high or low ta even if it is life or the pc that put the whatsit line in the wrong thing to do is to get wore whatsit tell something you have been worried about is therefore not good process it is all whatsits for the pc to look at if you want to cure the overcharged case you could assess his problems to central one and ask what solutions have you had for this problem this allows the pc to itsa and thus permits the ta to come down the cures give you the itsa line get all the whatsits already in restimulation and get the solutions off that will give you itsa bring the ta down and get the ta into action when you finish one whatsit with itsas find another whatsit that is already there and finish it etc this is guaranteed to fix the ta find something small enough for the pc to let go of knowingness and reality dont increase unless you get charge off the case so the case knows that nothing has happened unless you increase his knowingness 472 l ron hubbard type 3 idate20863 volnum1 issue296 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec296 the itsa line 6308c20 shspec296 the itsa line the itsa line is the pcs comm line to the auditor it is not always pursuant to the auditors whatsit sometimes it is pursuant to the pcs whatsit the auditing cycle is made up of concatenation of comm lines comm line can be very faint as with the attention line there may be lines preceding the attention line as the auditor gets the pc to put his attention on the auditor having an attention line already extant you convert it to an itsa line theres the situation where the pcs attention line is on something other than the auditor if the auditor is adroit he can flick it over to where he wants it for instance the pc says i cant stand wild parties blah blah it takes skill to flick the attention over to what you want the pc to talk about this is getting the itsa line in pc will always follow the leastcharged aberrative line with his ta action ta exists on the leastcharged aberrative line at any moment the mind is so regulated that it will not release charges that the pc considers too dangerous ta action ceases when you have too much charge you could bleed it off but you have gotten into too much charge and ta action equals case advance even if you get somatics off you can make it even worse by running the pc with ta action you can make the needle action cease too the longer you run case with ta action the more the case freezes up and the harder it will be to produce ta action the most likely way to get ta action on case is to get in the itsa line routine1c routine1comm is the process that does this it is soft touch way of getting in the itsa line this is the workhorse it requires deftness but it gets in the itsa line on jammed overcharged case and it will restore ta action per btb 4dec71r i r1c r1c consists of 1 finding something that moves the ta 2 running the ta out of that subject to fn cog vgis the usual method of finding what to run in general r1c is by assessment of dynamics assessment by dynamics gives series of questions covering each of the dynamics this is assessed by tone arm as given in emeter drill 23 take up the reading question by use of further questions on that same subject the best way to restore ta action to case that has become overcharged is to cleverly get in and handle the itsa line cleverness is required you could ask the pc who comes into session talking about something else did our last session have anything to do with this this puts his attention back into session gently without putting it on the auditor this is preferable to the psychoanalytic practice of letting the pc run on and on about irrelevancies getting your job done and having your pc like you all the time conflict and are sometimes diametrically opposed the crudest way to get the itsa line in is tell about it this is functional however what you want to do is to move the itsa line around enough to relieve his problem to the point where you can put the attention line on significance that will give him case advance it is about as skilled as building watch very adroit to the point of invisibility you duplicate what he has been talking about and pull his itsa line bit further and put it on something you want it to be on you can even reuse the pcs 473 origination later when you have run out of ta or itsa for instance the pc complains of headaches you get him to examine how they are affected by what you are auditing then several sessions later you can bring the headaches up again as needed unless you can handle the attention line smoothly you cant get the itsa line established you are split between wanting the pc to think well of you and getting your job done in the end they come to the same thing but for the moment it is matter of making forward progress despite unavoidable or avoidable upsets be as clever and as adroit as you can plus little there are thousands of ways to shift the pcs attention say his attention is on something you ask what have you learned about _______ you get ta parallel what the mind is doing and you can control it find what the pcs attention is on and if you can get ta motion by having the pc locate things about what his attention is on he will recover from any obsessive or compulsive tendencies about it or toward it it is the ta motion that takes off the compulsion not the significance of what he digs up the pc way be talking about his grandmas jammaking but if he is getting ta motion he is getting gains the fastest recovery comes with combination of significance and ta motion the least charged aberrated area of the case is where you will get ta motion sometimes direct approach to highlycharged area may fail until it is unburdened by getting ta off some other area first when you work with that area the latter area the pc will know that processing works for him pcs always make gains if they are getting ta motion ta motion only occurs when the itsa line is in why do we call it the itsa line the itsa line is more than just comm line it is seeing something to describe and describing it person in jail cant go to anywhere to see if itsa he cant say itsa beach or itsa brighton etc nightmare is the inability to itsa followed by mocking up something that can be itsaed that is wrong itsa is the way the thetan orients himself itsa ceiling itsa floor itsa wall etc itsa therefore ima cf descartes with i think therefore i am hide somebody and the itsa line is cut on himself one else can say itsa disassociate somebody from his identity and he wont be able to itsa himself he wont be able to say itsa joe jones this is the basic aberration inability to orient identify declare or recognize it is not just the inability to solve if itsa is so important to ability memory identity and power then we would expect the major trick on the track to be that of cutting the itsa line one way or the other and so it is implanters give you all sorts of false data you get killed one way and they convince you that you died another way or that you didnt die at all they disrupt your itsa line this can go on to the point where people believe that they live only once the reportback mechanism is even used by doctors when they have insane people report back for shocks etc people think that what we are doing is unreal but we know the substance of their unreality we know where their itsa line is out the notion man is an animal at death there is cessation of cellular commotion makes nothing of everyone the itsa line can be out of arc and on kucdeiof the whole scale for r2h tell someone that something that is isnt and his itsa line will go out give someone chalk for candy he bites into it his itsa line is out this is the false level nothing say that nothing haunts this planet its all natural and anyone who 474 thinks otherwise must be paranoid say something isnt that is or that something is that isnt like the darwinian theory inhibited tell someone not to examine something because it is dangerous enforced know this or be shot desired wanttoknow itsa curious curiosity itsa not just curious about then theres unknown itsa you have reality on the unreality of people on this planet the itsa is their unknowingness thetans tolerance rises to where he can confront an unknown comfortably without doing anything about it x in algebra would be an example of this mathematician has gone overboard on the subject of unknownnesses and having to solve it all some auditors likewise cant stand the pcs being in an unknown as he is working on an itsa and have to leap in and get the itsa line in themselves with the meter known an itsa line can be too known for instance some crimes are unsolvable because they are committed in too known fashion the obviousness of the postman makes him the ideal murderer in mystery he is too known sometimes things are too obvious that also includes the everyone knows that never gets examined itsa identifies either individually or if that is not possible by classification by type you get comfortable feeling from this which every now and then gets betrayed eg when you find out that you are in stage set not room this gives you an arc break from the false itsa gpms are full of such false itsas the subject of itsa has to do with straightening out ones arc with the universe it is an interesting question why there should be this passion for itsa getting the itsa line in has nothing to do with getting the pc to auditor comm line in the latter is more likely to be related to the pcs attention line to the auditor getting the itsa line in is getting the pc to identify inspect decide about and differentiate things in his bank or in the physical universe eg in objective processing the room you could probably get ta by running whats that and pointing at things this is not always workable itsa is familiarization eg with car or typewriter that is why familiarization processes like touch that _______ work person who is really itsaing is blowing off encysted charge caused by former confusion about an area that is the mass aspect the force aspect of it when you have itsad on area the area never comes up again until then the area keeps coming up in the future ten years in the past two trillion years in the past as this as that etc while the pc is looking for the itsa what drives some auditors nuts is the extra itsas he puts in and takes out this that lot of apparent itsas come off before you get the final itsa but you could almost say that all the running of case on through to the final cognition the final itsa consists of conditional itsas an auditor should never expect only permanent itsas it is adroit of the auditor to use the pcs attention line to get the itsa line in by steering it to areas that can be itsad put the pcs attention on things he can identify letting the itsa line exist is the lowest level of auditing putting the itsa line in is more active the universe is full of whatsit lines so concentrate on the itsa line the itsa line will suffer from being too known as in everyone knows the itsa line is the pcs line to the auditor 475 l ron hubbard type 3 idate21863 volnum1 issue297 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec297 the itsa line continued 6308c21 shspec297 the itsa line continued things look more complex than they actually are sitting somewhere in back of every thetans bank is tremendous insecurity in which the thetan believes implicitly that the universe is dangerous or that he is in danger or that he cannot live or survive as powerful being the itsa line could look to you like simple communication line on which if you let anyone talk enough he will get better this is not so if you understand the itsa line you will see the pc go through cycle of fishing for an itsa if the auditor tells the pc what is there by putting in the itsa with the meter it leaves the pc in zone or area of insecurity as will any interruption of the pcs itsa the pc has to be responsible for putting in the itsa line if the auditor does it too much eg saying the meter reads that it is before 1850 etc you have created psychiatric potentially hypnotic evaluative setup it is ok to give little help but not to put in the whole itsa line for the pc when you tell person that there is hope for his case you are putting in an itsa line the hope factor but what about the line plot for instance this puts in an itsa line for the pc to some degree the line plot for the gpm is the lesser of two evils it allows the pc to identify it to his own reality and it is less undesirable than letting the pc wrap himself around telephone pole it was an otherdetermined thing in the first place and the most important thing is to get the charge off of it similarly if the pc is trying to date something and bogs utterly you should help him with the meter enough to increase his ability to see what he is after by narrowing his search even if you get down to the hour and minute and the pc never spotted it at least youve got it dated but it is still bit of lose the only time you totally lose is when you have to put the whole itsa line in aberration is means of perverting the itsa line pure evil is denial of the itsa line and aberration of it perversion of the itsa line has to be very direct in order to be very aberrative given the slightest chance the pc will put in his itsa line but the question is will he put it in on anything aberrative he wont unless directed to it psychoanalysis directs the itsa line to something nonaberrative lets him itsa and then evaluates putting the itsa line in totally analyzing it for him putting in hope factor by saying that something can be done to change conditions puts in the itsa line to small degree even start of session puts in an itsa line with the intent of putting the pc in position to itsa the intention makes the difference where one puts in the itsa line for another an evil intention in this respect is one that is devoted to decreasing the persons ability to itsa that is the way to make slaves good intention is an intention to improve someones itsa get the person to identify spot and point out and he will be in better shape than he is this corner of the universe is suffering from surplus of lousy civilization it was recently conquered but it was set up to be conquered by the use of degrading mental technology the civilization in this area implanted their own soldiers to be loyal to be brave etc such civilization has power because for an implant to stick it has to have two items one positive and one 476 negative eg to be loyal soldier and to be disloyal soldier so fifty percent of the implant is in the negative also the fact that the implant was done at all destroys loyalty the galactic confederacy with implanting lasted eighty trillion years the espinol confederacy with implants lasted few hundred thousand years rome died at the hands of her slaves not at those of barbarians being free man didnt pay so who wanted to fight for rome slavery produced civil war the first families of boston made their money from slaves and so we got civil war too it is not just matter of sentiment statistically slavery never pays off it is dangerous russia is having trouble because of the slave economy which is hangover from prerevolutionary russia probably the white russian nobility came back from the betweenlives area as communists slavery always produces backlash because thetan never really gives up he can hold the postulate that he was right all the way down to the bottom of unconsciousness the effort to dominate and to deny power of choice to others is the road that this universe walked towards the hell it became fear stands ahead of that the nonsense behind it is that thetan cant do anything but survive so for him to fear nonsurvival is foolish how to kill thetan is the biggest problem in this universe how can being who cannot cease to survive get into state of mind where he is afraid that he wont it takes lot of trickery usually it is on an extension of self into possession like making minion mocking up mockup endowing it with life and protecting it when someone attacks it it can be body state etc the thetan must have confused himself with it to the point where he thinks his survival can be affected that is the first step into aberration the next step is elementary one is worried about survival so one solves the problem of survival by domination this solution is not successful in the long run that which is not admired tends to persist that is one reason why domination stays around domination is not admired thetan to protect something dominates thetan b in so doing he sets himself up to be dominated in turn having set up causeeffect line the line can reverse it is comm line with duplication which makes it easy to reverse any custom on this planet has this reverse duplication element you can count on its having been the reverse at some time the duplication factor easily makes cause look like effect on this comm line and it leads to the overtmotivator sequence one commits overts then one day one slips into effect and gets what one caused running ow frees up vicious comm line and cures some misidentifications thus undoing aberration for instance waiters wear black tuxedos any custom was reverse custom at an earlier date if communication is so dangerous why does thetan communicate at all it is because he wants to be oriented once oriented thetan uses his best tool communication to dominate to do people in and to mess up things that he tries to identify with he misuses his comm line it is there because he is lost and feels the need of orientation hence his desire for communication there is insecurity behind this desire the reason for which we dont know yet in using the itsa line were using the obsession to identify which lies back of the communication line we are using principle higher than communication coupled with communication in order to orient and rehabilitate the thetan 476a all we are missing is what lies behind the insecurity that caused him to start the whole cycle originally the thetan was not insecure was not reaching not protecting anything and he was not communicating how and why did anyone get to him originally to the point where he felt that he needed to be oriented to be comfortable it is hard to figure this out because there was communication at the time but you show the problem and very shortly later ill show you the answer just as it took only one step to start down that road so it takes only step at the other end to go back up the pc gradiently comes up to ot then breaks through with shock that may scare him processing is the cure for having to be familiarized with things to itsa we are undoing the tendency to itsa by using it once thetan is free of those things he will snap back to his original lost power at least until he rights some wrongs and slips briefly selfdeterminism pandeterminism and personal power is restored to the individual along the line of minimal help and maximal recovery of selfdeterminism of selfability to itsa on the part of the pc as the case goes along its progress is measured directly by the degree to which selfdeterminism is returned into the pcs hands thus you could get fantastic number of engrams and gpms run and have foggy pc by dating everything in the bank for him or by invalidating some datum of the pcs matter how slightly an auditor has the same problem mother has to give enough help but not too much the amount of help required is not constant from one pc to the next because pcs are at such different levels of independence and aberration both could be high the problem is to determine how much help the pc needs in order to know what you want to do is to take whatever ability you find and reduce any dependency you find give the pc all the help he needs to get along and then reduce it added into all this is your flubs you will never reduce them to zero so dont try you will get caught in crosscurrents of communication and purposes since the pcs comm line is so often fogged up in session the auditors ability to handle it perfectly is nil so the auditor shouldnt be afraid of mishandling the pc because an occasional mishandling is inevitable so when this happens you have to get slippy and handle the intention line if possible dont put the pcs attention on the auditor this can happen by mistake but watch out eg dont say do you want to tell about it this inadvertently diverts attention to the auditor the pcs itsa line will get better to the degree that it is permitted to exist dont just let the pc talk but direct his attention to things in the bank that he can identify dont tell him what he is looking at if you can avoid it but if you do have to tell him let him itsa it if you dont his ability to identify will deteriorate and his ability to know whether he is right will decrease that is the effect of confirming his itsa line with the meter if you look on what you are doing as improving the pcs ability to know that he is right to be positive you will make minimal mistakes that is the chief ability that is there to be improved on case if you look on case as something from which significances have to be removed regardless of the pcs ability to be certain the pc will still make it but it will take much longer the pcs case improves by removal of charge but is impeded by the auditor cutting back his ability to itsa 477 an arc breaky pc is probably one with high degree of independence perhaps swamped by charge you can create dependency by telling him everything there is also the point to be considered that if you dont tell the pc when an item is finally discharged early in running gpms the pc will leave items charged and the mechanism of the bank will cause him to bounce and arc break so you put in the itsa line itsa discharged sooner or later the pc will start to tell you that it is at that point stop telling him that it is clean dont stop if he still cant tell to do so would leave him with live ris and postulates wean him off from the meter slowly validating his knowingness as it develops give the pc all the help he needs if pc cant tell what is in his bank he cant live with it there is certain minimal help that pc needs to get started he cant do it all on his own on the other hand you could get pc who hasnt been here long who cognites on the axioms knocks out the bank does change of space processing between the auditing room and the next building see the creation of human ability pp 3739 171173 this is the grand tour process the object of which is to get all areas into present time by directing the pc to be in variety of places and says goodby and thank you fine you audited him arc breaky pcs sometimes get into the situation of having their concept of their own independence cut up by people putting in itsa lines for them they dramatize pc who is routinely arc breaky undoubtedly has something wrong with the itsa line and not from auditing he could benefit from an 18button prepcheck on the itsa line those eighteen buttons are the most powerful itsas there are or ever have been in the universe another approach would be to handle the fact that the pc is using the arc break to solve problem but the prepcheck normally gets it cleaned up cut itsa line is the most colossal ptp there is persons itsa line to the rest of the universe is cut just by the fact of his being on earth if he tries to leave earth he goes to the betweenlives area the only missing piece is why does thetan have compulsion to itsa l ron hubbard type 3 idate22863 volnum1 issue298 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec298 project 80 6308c22 shspec298 project 80 80 is mathematical trick to say oo and 0 it embraces all project 80 has to do with organizational targets dissemination and technical planning 1964 will be the year of scientology for everyone organizations suffer from loss of personnel one would be rich if one just lived and persisted long enough if you are persistent you yourself become sort of institution to solve problem is mest universe way of looking at things the right way is to find out how did it become problem lrh operates on the basis that if he conceives of problem he is about fortyeight hours away from seeing what made it problem an organizations problem of losing all its people is one that we have licked with all the shifts and changes we the people are the stability in the development of the tech we have the material for scientology 4 research towards ot see p 462 above making ots wrapped up as far as research is concerned in view is wrapping up of the betweenlives area so as to strip out the reportback mechanism it is bit tougher than lrh thought it would be there are in addition to gpms screentype incidents and postulationtype incidents the gpms are all negative on the beginning 478 end of the screen and positive on the leaving end so the dichotomy makes them tend to collapse some rules for cleaning up charge faster have developed but it is all just auditing keeping the pcs attention directed to those areas of the track where he gets ta action that is the highest level of professional skill drills for thetan exterior is all wrapped up not everyone will reach the technical level of those who are at st hill who have been through all the developments and changes that is too much to expect auditors elsewhere are operating at different levels of reality which establish different levels of arc for them the gap between our r and theirs has been getting wider and wider so we are in an informed ivory tower with bridge behind us that is rather important this planet is in slightly different circumstances then others it has chance not to get tilted things put here tend to stay other nearby planets are more tightly governed and are harder to enter to salvage them they are invasionary planets this area used to be controlled by the espinol confederacy but their return platforms are closed off that spells defeat for them is there some other implantive system that is deeper into the heart of this galaxy system that is going to backfire against this one probably so it is probably coming up soon but conquerers almost always spare the jails we cant bet on the preservation of earth but we can bet on this planet having better chance of becoming rehabilitation center than other planets but what if we have left bridge in the rehabilitation center so that everybody flounders around with way to improve if you dont leave bridge you will wind up with group of people who are very angry at those who might assist them that would be very undesirable weve got to leave bridge however at present our feeder lines into the public are weak not organizationally but technically project 80 is the bridge it requires that we find what the public agrees with and use that to improve their arc up to another level and that we keep doing that in order to bring them up gradiently we are not necessarily improving their arc with us we are just improving their arc to point where we can hit another level of agreement the dynamics various scales the arc triangle and the dynamic principle of existence all of these are too hightoned for scientology 1 so they comprise scientology 2 see p 462 above for description of the scientology levels so we are back to 3060 day hcahpa training this is only possible because of the discovery of the itsa line some of you as auditors overlook what is win for pc knowing that your goal is to run out gpms etc you miss the fact that the pc has had win in being able to talk to an auditor when he couldnt talk to anyone before the feeling that one is getting case advance and real case advance lies in the fact that the itsa line is in and the ta is moving get the itsa line in and the ta moving and you will get level of improvement and result never before achieved this has nothing to do with significances if you get somebody talking about his health or his lumbosis you find out that the cures solutions decisions discoveries cognitions comments reiterations and hopes about that lumbosis in their aggregate caused the individual to have lumbosis if you get them off with ta action you get recovered lumbosis the condition could well vanish just from getting the pc to itsa about these cures etc this does not apply to broken legs yet someone who has been trained in getting an itsa line in and not cutting it given also some basic training in the auditors code 479 the axioms the arc triangle the cdei scale etc would have good results and wins scientology 1 operates at the level of it is possible to have happy marriage or if you want to get along with children better listen to what they say and let them know you heard it dont just ignore them or employeeboss relations are mainly problems of communication in fact you should make communication the stable datum how you design this line is all regulated by what people can go into arc with you have to talk to people at level where they can have arc r1c is list of questions that you can use to get in an itsa line specific questions from this list could be used by book auditor to run on someones lumbosis this could be done on coaudit basis and would get fine results that is the auditing level of scientology 1 lower grade scientology 2 hpahca can get fabulous results with r2c r2c is r1c preceded by an assessment on the expanded cdei scale plus the eight dynamics see hcotf 17oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics as well as hcob 17oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics directions for use of hco technical form 17oct63 and hcob 31oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics continued the tone arm is used the pc first looks over the cdei scale to see which level best characterizes his life it might take ten minutes and it might take fifty hours the pc has to see which levels applied at which times in his life and where and how and which they are and how they relate etc you can get lot of ta on examining the scale eventually the pc comes out with level x now give him the eight dynamics expanded ie broken down into subparts he has to find out which ones he has been most concerned about this lifetime this could also take ten minutes or fifty hours eventually the pc comes out with dynamic therefore the question becomes x the pc gets asked about the combined assessments eg curious about children the question could have third component considerations solutions decisions about concern for so you have matched up the arc triangle with mest form and location the pc will start off with arc vs arc then when he can confront mest he will get into the sixth and seventh dynamics so as you repeat this operation the pc will go up the dynamics to the sixth and seventh this would be way of clearing this lifetime uppergrade scientology 2 would use r2h arc break dating and any other process like prepchecking that uses needle action as well as ta it is retread level for hpahcas so the lineup for scientology 1 and 2 is scn 1 nonauditing pelevel scientology b auditing book auditing on coaudit basis scn 2 lower level hpahca level uses r2c tone arm used only not needle action b upper level hpahca retread level processes using needle action and ta another element enters the scene the arc break assessment this would be specialized activity it can be done by central orgs or auditors in private practice to patch up field auditors pcs and at the same time the field auditor whose pc needs this action can be nudged about following the auditors code eg about keeping his mouth shut try to bring it home that arc break 480 assessments need to be done we can use them both on pcs and on auditors you can keep lot of coauditors straightened out by having someone around to do arc break assessments you could have course in which you can give classification of hba hubbard book auditor the student gets gen on 1 the itsa line 2 the auditors code this course would also include testing and coaudits the whole secret of our communication is that it is up to us to establish the level of the communication that we engage in we have considered it somewhat dishonest to put our communication at level of anything less than everything we know but it isnt really dishonest to say less then we know there is reason to overwhelm people with all the data it would just be outreality there will be snags in the program there will always be people who are uncomfortable with motion and change these people will try overtly or covertly to stop it all they will be the people who despair of getting result by doing the usual because they wont do it they will be the ones who keep applying unusual solutions dont get your attention pinned on one bad apple and forget that everywhere else it is going fine to do this would be to embark on crusade in an illadvised direction probably all evil generates from too great concentration on evil if you concentrate on how the show isnt getting on the road when it is in fact on the road you will contribute to keeping it from being on the road you should take care of such matters on routine rather than an emergency basis when we have auditing at lower levels totally shaped around the definition of an auditor as listener we will have trouble getting the whole project well done l ron hubbard type 3 idate27863 volnum1 issue299 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec299 rightness and wrongness 6308c27 shspec299 rightness and wrongness people use mental technology the way they do in this universe because they dont know what they are doing the purpose of mental technology must be one of survival with consequent necessity to dominate so it must consist of being right and making others wrong survival rightness and wrongness and domination fit together apparent contrasurvival actions are the thetans effort to be right this is the lowest ebb of aberration because the thetan cant do anything else but survive in order to survive you have to be more right than wrong so you get obsessed with being right the beginning of succumb is the recognition that you are wrong this is not sensible but it is the way thetan behaves therefore if an individual is surviving at all he must be right even if it is only an insistence on being right if an individual is undertaking an action and is surviving then it must be right action thetan has to enter basic lie on the scene to worry about his survival this is idiocy because there is reason for thetan to worry about survival thetan first worries about the survival of something else something that can be threatened with nonsurvival then the thetan identifies himself with that thing this is the first lie when he starts worrying about his own survival because he has taken the idiotic step of identifying himself with his creations he enters into the necessity to dominate to ensure his own survival there is reason why if you are protecting sand castles you have to take the idiot step of becoming sand castle and you can go on 481 protecting them indefinitely without doing this but once you have identified yourself with sandcastle and are worried about your own survival you enter into the necessity to dominate to continue your own survival to be tougher than the other tough boys on the beach you dont even have to become sandcastle to start the game of domination if that is what you want to do the game of domination consists of being right and making the other fellow wrong that is all there is to it its silly game really for instance russia and the us are each devoting so much of their production capacity to defend themselves from each other that they are failing economically people justify all sorts of insanity on the basis of rightness and wrongness even skidrow bum is being bum in order to be right everyone has tried to make him wrong for what he does so he has to continue to be right if he admits he is wrong he feels he will die you may be confused just watching what is being done because some of it could have good results but the basis can still be nutty rightness people assert nutty rightness because everyone is always making then wrong for the nuttiness if someone agrees that he has been doing something wrong he is liable to collapse since he has identified wrongness with succumbing behavior doesnt necessarily have everything to do with the whole track behavior is behavior people have tried to aberrate it one way or another they have tried to make people behave some other way but the science of life still remains the science of life the factors of life still remain the factors of life and if you were to delete all the gpms and incidents and everything else you would not have removed the basic laws on which scientology is built gpms etc merely use the existing laws of life to enslave people they simply enforce exaggerate and destroy freedom of choice over the exercise of the ability to be happy powerful etc they destroy the ability to be self or pandetermined they make people onesided about everything they use basic laws unwittingly to exaggerate certain things which then lead person to enslave himself the basic mechanism of enslavement is 1 insistence upon surviving followed by 2 the necessity to dominate followed by 3 the necessity to be right or wrong 4 which then becomes as irrational as the original postulate to survive and then 5 the person becomes more and more degraded the postulates made by the individual go downhill to the point where you would be amazed at what the individual is doing to be right when you get down to very aberrated rightness you are dealing with death because at that level cessation of survival is so imminent that it gets dramatized before it happens in that way the individual is still right by succumbing currently there are three organizations under attack 1 scientology 2 buddhism 3 theosophy the us government is supporting the vietnamese government in its attacks on buddhists it has attacked the theosophists recently and it launched raid via the fda on the fcdc in washington but these are the only three groups that believe in reincarnation ie they are the only groups that dont believe in death forever in attacking them the us government is asserting rightness about death 482 to get some sort of aberrated behavior of this kind straightened out with someone you would have to get him to tell you how the behavior makes him right you would get an automaticity for starters which would finally run out then you could see how it makes someone else wrong when that is all run out the individual will have far less inclination to do the behavior that he previously had to do to be right the strongest intention in the universe is the intention to be right the diagnosis of how you could make person wrong depends on what that person most insists upon that is what you can make him wrong on this would be getting persons goat behavior doesnt consist of an aberration that someone is dramatizing it consists of an aberration that person dredges up in order to make someone else wrong thats behavior it works too making someone wrong all the time does worry him furthermore one can be made wrong to the point where one inverts goes into agreement with what is being said by the person who is making him wrong and now makes the former wrongness an obsessive rightness the right label gets identified with the wrong action government may be made wrong about bringing in law and order to the point where it now exercises criminality using the label of law and order the issue of rightness and wrongness has been further boobytrapped by guys on the whole track who implanted people with gpms that contain the words right and wrong however when making himself right and others wrong an individual is not acting because of the gpm that just intensifies the action if you try just simply to run someone on right and wrong for very long you run into the gpm and cant keep on in that line ordinarily getting in an itsa line on the aberration will deintensify its power however if guy has accidents frequently 1 find out what he is having wrecks accidents injuries etc this doesnt take very long you have to isolate what it is that the guy is doing the obvious action may not be his intention maybe it is not his automobile accidents that are making him right maybe it is getting injured when you have the right thing he will run easily 2 ask the pc how an auto accident makes him right you will get an easy itsa line 3 ask him how an auto accident would make them or another wrong you will get another avalanche 4 ask 2 again then 3 etc keep it balanced and you will avoid bumping the gpm as hard this process is below the level of recognition or cognition it undermines neurosis neurosis is defined as an antisurvival action that is compulsively undertaken by the individual the only qualification to this process is that we have to be capable of communicating with the person and listening to him and we have to get our hands on him first but on coldbloodedly practical basis service fac processes are more practical mental technology than the alternatives implants drugs electric shock treatments etc just because of the backlash from angry thetans who want revenge on implanters the hole in implanter tech is that the survival of the implanter can in the future be threatened implants can be undone many implant setups have been destroyed implanters do implanting because they are trying to be right and to make others wrong thats all it is mere dramatization when 483 you see someone acting simply to be right and to make others wrong you will see worsening condition you are looking at the last dregs of domination the person who is being right is in fact getting worse as are the people in his vicinity implanting works only over shortterm period eg 100000 years which is shortterm on galactic scale implanting worsens not only the people implanted but also the implanter and everyone in the vicinity of these people what is true of neurosis is also true of psychosis psychosis has the same mechanism at lower level and it gets treatment from psychiatrists at the same low level of makewrong and q and the overtmotivator sequence also fits into this effort to dominate and be right when you get two people each insisting on his own rightness their ideas eventually commingle and they cant tell who is doing what this is because both are saying im right and youre wrong if science is dramatizing an unknown one of its parts it is not complete technology it is impossible to have science of life under these circumstances because you cant fully understand something that you are dramatizing part of science of life should be complete understanding and since one is dramatizing at least part of living one cant have total understanding of it in other words being right should be one of the parts of mental technology however if being right is being dramatized by the practitioners of mental technology then clearly they dont have full understanding of the mind this is particular problem with the science of life hence there is tendency to withdraw from life total cessation of the dramatization of the game called life would put one in confused state of thinking that the way to do it is to separate oneself from life by going off to cave and meditating but person that cant experience easily has to experience compulsively the final challenge of science of life is does it produce life not does it produce death if you know all the answers you can live it is remarkable to be in situation where this can be sorted out as one goes along getting more understanding one doesnt have to work so hard to experience existence one doesnt have to be convinced that one is surviving being right dominating etc when person is longer able to select his own behavior he must obsessively be right by doing something wrong it is ok to be right if you are being analytical however there is level at which rightness and wrongness cease to be analytical and become obsessive it is below that level that we speak of aberration you can find what the person is doing that he doesnt like to do then ask the person how that makes him right everyone has few of these actions they generally arise from some overwhelm of the persons selfdeterminism where he has accepted anothers rightness the person is out of valence and dramatizing someone elses aberrations you could perhaps pick this up on flow one of level 4 triples but we arent interested in other peoples aberrations the dwindling spiral is really entered where the person accepts inability weakness stupidity etc as way to be right any dramatization of mental science that brings about further disability is wrong for the civilization that uses it anything that brings about more life livingness and beingness is right for that person or society 484 anything that is crazy in person was ok at some higher level all madness is an exaggeration of some ability or capability for instance sexual misbehavior is lowerscale dramatization of the ability to create it becomes aberrated in the following way 1 it was really right 2 it was method of survival 3 it was method of domination 4 it was method of being right in order to make others wrong 5 then one got enough overts such that the communication line switched around what was right about it is now wrong about it and vice versa the sexual misbehavior or other aberrated behavior is practically unrecognizable from its original state as far as the persons behavior is concerned when you understand this you understand much of the nonsense that you previously only protested against the explanation for the behavior that is offered by the individual so obscures what he is really doing that it gets confusing the main line of human behavior is along the lines of 1 survival 2 domination 3 rightness and wrongness however when an auditor invalidates anothers assertion of rightness it only drives the pc downscale and cuts the only communication line that can help the pc dramatization of rightness and wrongness is not the answer to dramatization of rightness and wrongness l ron hubbard type 3 idate29863 volnum1 issue300 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec300 the ta and the service facsimile 6308c29 shspec300 the ta and the service facsimile if you cannot make keyedout clear with prepcheck in 25 hours or less the pc is operating on service facsimile this is startling but elementary prepcheck fits in with the itsa line very closely the 18 buttons are hot they give the key itsas of the case if they are not working you have service facsimile on your hands in doing prepcheck it is assumed that you are using timelimiter in order to keep the amount of restimulation under control if you dont control the itsa line the pc will restimulate more charge than you can get asised the time limiter you use can be by subject or location as well as by date pc answering prepcheck questions is giving you key itsas if prepcheck is done for this lifetime you should get keyedout clear per the book 1 definition of clear see dmsmh pp 817 77017 clearing in this way is destimulation by knocking out the points where restimulation took place making incidents inert an inert incident can be restimulated however degree of restimulation is not important to state of case neither is the condition of being restimulated but there is state of case with respect to restimulation all cases are restimulated to some degree but some are overrestimulated case that is overrestimulated will not discharge the restimulation by ordinary means because discharge has somehow been prevented this condition is important it is getting ahold of too much and not discharging it uncontrolled itsa line can cause overrestimulation an incident that is discharged has been relieved of charge so that it can longer be restimulated restimulation can be let off without the incident that was restimulated being 485 discharged it can simply be destimulated so with bank you can either destimulate it by knocking out the keyins of the original charge or you can discharge it by running it discharge is flowing off of charge when an incident is discharged it is gone and it is longer capable of being restimulated let us assume that the reactive mind consists mainly of inert incidents if they would just stay quiet you would never have to clear anybody however the pcs attention can be directed at the incident by life auditing or the pc himself at which point the incident converts the pcs attention to restimulation over which he has control if the pcs attention goes to the incident so as to have understanding and confront you will see ta motion and the incident can be discharged or erased on the other hand if the pcs attention flicks over the incident giving keyin you can knock out the moment of keyin by having him look at it and it will destimulate again ie it will key out bank is inert until life or auditing causes the pcs attention to go onto portion of it the pcs attention is the actual source of charge an 18button prepcheck should key out anything that keyed in it can destimulate somebody to the state of clear so you dont have to make clear to make an ot you only have to make keyout clear the state of case of the pc is directly represented and analyzed by the tone arm and the free needle the eight levels of case compare with eight states of the tone arm and needle see pp 414415 for description of the eight levels of case case level 8 stage 4 needle 7 continuous rock slam 6 stuck needle at clear read dead thetan 5 low ta 4 high ta 3 ta moving in the high range 2 good ta through and past clear read 1 fn at clear read when lrh tried to go from destimulated clear to discharged clear he found that there was waystop short of ot the condition youve got to have to take anyone to ot is ta moving through clear read with good ta without that there is too much restimulation present for you to get the pc to discharge material from the backtrack or to get into gpms if you tried to do this anyway the pcs ta would tend to stick then to go high then to go low then eventually to stick at clear read if you then did prepcheck which would now be harder you could send him back to all those states of ta as you destimulated the case you wouldnt have to go all the way to fn to go to the backtrack now the subject isnt how you discharge the incident it is when the ta should be moving around preferably through 30 before you try to go backtrack so you can make clear by prepchecking few prepared subjects the case will feel wonderful sometimes for years until he starts wondering whether he still has any worries about what used to bother him then he starts restimulating himself and gets keyed in mere keyout clear cant be ot because when he tries to turn on the power it kicks in the inert incidents the only way to make clear completely stable would be to discharge everything in the bank from fning the meter goes blank because youve got nothing to measure thats ot 486 overrestimulation is the cause of amnesia edgy and bad body feelings etc if you gave the pc three sessions in row without getting any ta he would feel rather bad because just the auditing would have restimulated charge and you would have an overrestimulated case when this happens memory gets bad facsimiles get harder to see incidents get jammed together the bank gets to be mess all this is due to overrestimulation if the pc now gets prepchecked and destimulated he can approach the track but this can be done with good ta only if the auditing is done gradiently with good cleanup of everything contacted discharging it as you go dont fail to pay attention to the ta and go backtrack hoping to get the incident responsible for the restimulation you will restimulate more than you discharge in the process of looking for the incident cheerful pc equals the itsa line in and the ta moving it almost doesnt matter what the ta is moving on case level relates to overrestimulation not to the amount of bank the pc has the auditing target is always the restimulated charge not the inert material in the bank see fig 18 the pc can always restimulate more once he has discharged what was available figure 20 destimulation graphics inserted 488 clear means nothing in the restimulation chamber if too much gets restimulated by life auditing or the pc the auditor can destimulate it with prepchecks and arc break assessments see fig 20 p 487 above it is not possible to audit someone without doing one of three things 1 restimulating see fig 18 p 486 2 destimulating see fig 20 p 487 this is the same as keying something out or 3 discharging see fig 19 p 487 this is the same as erasing auditing is always doing at least one of these three things when case is already confused and is not confronting well naturally the amount of destimulation and discharge are minimal so restimulation takes over you will get ta motion when you dont destimulate or discharge anything you will restimulate more and you will get ta lack of ta is danger signal the auditor should find out why there are two possible actions 1 the auditor may do something that can discharge or destimulate the restimulated charge eg prepchecking or flattening what has been left unflat prepchecking or r2h would be safest 2 he can look for something that is preventing discharge eg by doing an arc break assessment to find the correct bpc if the ta is not restored immediately only one thing is wrong the case is sitting in service facsimile and will only worsen until the service facsimile is cleared if small amount of auditing doesnt restore the case to clear state the pc has service facsimile if he is sitting in one it must be run or he will not improve prepchecks turn on mass in the presence of service facsimile because the pc has intention of getting rid of it the pc wont let go of the service fac and the service fac wont surrender to the prepcheck this also includes hidden standards now that we know that the anatomy of service fac is rightnesswrongness computation we can do something about it we knew of their existence before as can be seen in advanced procedures and axioms pp 711 the 18button prepcheck should key out the pc if it doesnt the pc has service fac prepcheck is just series of types of decisions that thetan makes about things if it turns on mass it must be in conflict with rightness and wrongness so in the pcs eyes the auditor is trying to make the pc wrong with the prepcheck and the pc moves the facsimile forward as defense increasing mass the only reason for high ta is overrestimulation the two things that prevent its cure are 1 the cases overrestimulated condition 2 service facsimile that the case isnt about to give up to some degree most cases fall into the service fac category but most dont have the service fac directly in the road of auditing only service facs that lie across the road of auditing interfere with clearing if the service fac has to do with the pcs spiritual condition with his case itself then you have to handle it so that he can get case gain the more pc is trying to be right by having wrong case the less progress the auditor will make with this case pc says if i didnt have bank theyd give one so having bank is right 489 dont let the pc itsa beyond the answer to the auditing question it is far better for the pc to feel that his comm has been cut than for him to pull in restimulation by being permitted to overrun an answer an 18button prepcheck on an assessed this lifetime subject or subjects should give you keyout clear but service fac wont surrender to prepcheck l ron hubbard type 3 idate29863 volnum1 issue301 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec301 the service facsimile 6308c29 shspec301 the service facsimile although we call it service facsimile there is more to be known about it than was in earlier definitions in the past it has been said that service facsimile is what person uses to explain his condition or get his way in the world it is called service facsimile because it was of service to the pc the service fac manifestation is blood brother to the ow mechanism it is how you make people guilty the current definition of service fac is that it is that condition which the individual uses to make himself right and others wrong using this definition we can crack cases the only hazard is the use of rightwrong in gpms but the use of time limitation to in this lifetime obviates any danger of restimulating the gpm the gpm is not the reason for the service fac there is an upperscale rationale survival for instance the darwinian implant see pp 444445 above has to persist at the beginning of it all by itself but this is rare however when the goal to survive occurs it is couched in the word persist there is gpm known to date that contains the word survive this concept is therefore not motivated by bank therefore you can use survive in processing pretty easily implanters used the words live and alive lot but survive is the top scale of all this it is ok for us to go back to healing now since doctors the ama havent appreciated the fact that we ever stopped healing people b they will be socialized in five years anyway they are convinced that curing is impossible however 22 12 of people eg patients pcs or whatever get well with any or or fraudulent treatment they are apparently in an hypnotic state and respond to suggestion so any healing profession should get at least 22 12 cure rate unless it is doing something to depress the patient and to prevent healing from occurring if you get less than 22 12 you are actually impeding the cure only two things prevent the scientologist from healing pcs 1 inability to get in communication with the pc eg because he is dead 2 the service facsimile if we allow for the fact that it takes relatively short time to train an auditor into using thislifetime techniques if you take such an auditor and dont worry about making him into an auditor who can make an ot if you turn him loose with only an understanding of the service facsimile the itsa line and repetitive prepchecking limited to this lifetime if you let him rely on the tone arm there he would be practically sweeping the boards as far as illness is concerned 490 for person to have bad back he must have more than facsimile of an experience involving bad back causing it he must have had it restimulated by something and to have real bad back something must be keeping it in restimulation something has to kick the facsimile in and hold it in you must add to the restimulation factor mental aberration factor it is not just what is restimulated it is what the pc feels might become restimulated what he himself opposes what he becomes afraid of when he is restimulated so the individual is added to the equation the experiential pattern of an individual regardless of incidents containing pain etc might be aberrative for instance say person has lived all his life in very cold environment he gets knowingness in the process if you throw him out in the 40below cold either he has confidence that he can withstand the cold or he doesnt accordingly he either freezes to death or lives respectively this is true even though person is conditioned and trained to handle the cold people may react differently to the same engram there is guarantee that someone will respond one way or the other to their stimulusresponse conditioning one person will be terrified by some danger another person will ignore it another will look and say oh what makes the difference we come back to the service fac for the answer how could you use facsimile to make people wrong so there are three reactions to an engram 1 the guy who is terrified of the facsimile has in back of this lots of ways to be right and to make others wrong by having this facsimile 2 the guy who ignores it has use for it at all one way or the other 3 the guy who confronts it has another method of making others wrong being competent with regard to this type of facsimile the rightnesswrongness possibility is present to some degree in everyone and in every bank to the healer this represents barrier because someone who is using an illness or disability to make someone else wrong wont respond to treatment or if you cure one thing he will pick up something else to do the job of making himself right and others wrong symptomsubstitution see also haley on oneupsmanship games aberrated behavior is service facsimile in at least goodly percentage of cases when you do mimicry processing and the pc persists in crazy behavior he has vested interest in acting crazy this makes it hard to tell how good deaberrative technique is however if it works on lot more than 22 12 of cases it is probably good technique that is rendered ineffective in some cases by service fac the tone arm turned out to be reliable measure of case progress if you dont get destimulation or discharge you will get restimulation because something is happening if you dont get any ta action you know that you are not getting any destimulation or discharge and that therefore restimulation is all that is occurring therefore dont audit without ta action the margin of time during which you can audit pc without ta action before he starts feeling horrible is only about three sessions if pc is upset about auditing is having trouble handling life etc it is only because of overrestimulation from whatever source gpms arc breaks or whatever 491 what about medium or acceptable amount of ta action fifteen to twenty downward divisions per 2 12 hour session excellent ta would be about thirty divisions per session acceptable is 1520 below that level more restimulation than discharge is occurring these are just approximate figures great deal of addingup has not yet been done to tabulate the figures exactly so there is point where there is an apparency of ta motion yet the pc is not getting better and only restimulation is occurring auditing pc on and on with ta will overrestimulate him all the way up the ta dial backwards through 7 all the way to dead thetan lrh introduces here the idea of ta counter why does ta go up and stick only because of the pressure of overrestimulation if you have ta action or if you are getting rising ta without discharge you get overrestimulation because you are overwhelming the pcs power of choice you are trying to get discharge and the pc wont let go of it and he becomes more and more arc breaky if the ta is going up even when you are not auditing backtrack you must still be overwhelming the pcs power of choice between not getting ta and getting high ta we move into service facs when you are doing prepcheck and it turns on mass you have bumped into something that shouldnt be there service facsimile has moved in to assert whatever you are prepchecking and trying to get rid of any mass for thetan is an assertion that something is wrong and there is something weird about it the mass comes from the complete disagreement that you and the pc have concerning whatever it is that turned mass on you want to get rid of it but the pc does not intend to get better because he has to hang onto bank to make someone wrong with it it stands to reason that any thetan that has been hit hard and continuously that has had continued loses and that is trying to get back at and attack some area will be unable to put the itsa line in on that area he cant say if the area is bad or good he cant say what it is he doesnt feel that he can be at cause over that comm line so his final method of staying at cause is to be right and for the other person to be wrong this goes down to the point where he merely has to hold the concept of being right and the other person being wrong this way in sense he is still being cause this mechanism persists therefore because the pc cant asis it because he cant observe it anymore one can be haunted by nonexistent thing if one doesnt have the comm lines to observe it the pc never knows when it goes away if you cant inspect something you cant inspect its cessation therefore for survival the best thing to do is to assume that the thing is still there that is the safest course life teaches you that it is dangerous to go look and see you operate on the principle that if you cant ascertain that something has ended you had better assume that it is continuing something that the pc cant cure with processing must be service fac you can ask the pc how he is making others wrong then when you get it you can ask him how he is being right with it aberrated survival mechanisms all sit around on buttons of rightnesswrongness survival and domination the ow system is connected with this through the makeguilty mechanism these are survival mechanisms buy they are not sensible unfortunately the words rightness wrongness survive and dominate are also in the bank so you have to indulge in some brokenfield running to handle these buttons 492 the more force there is and the less one can stand it and be cause over the user of the force the more one goes into forms of aberrated rightness and wrongness against the holder of force hence people break minor laws to be right about the government since it is so overwhelming this is quite irrational to find service fac you could use the original listing steps of r2 or the preliminary assessment of r3r or you could ask the pc what have you been trying to resolve about your case in processing taking anything that didnt resolve with processing as service facsimile what would be method of making others wrong could also get it be prepared for the service fac not to be very sensible but dont reject it even if it does seem reasonable as long as it is something that hasnt yielded to auditing l ron hubbard type 3 idate4963 volnum1 issue302 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec302 how to find service facsimile 6309c04 shspec302 how to find service facsimile apparently there is more to know about service facs than has been relayed probably because it is so simple pcs dont defend their service facs against discovery if you point the pc in the right direction he will go right to the service fac unless you prevent it so dont prevent it in assessing for service facs there is substitute for knowing what service fac is service fac is first tremendous solution always aberrated in pt as part of the pcs environment which the pc believes would result in his survival being threatened if it were disturbed it is something which others keep telling the pc is wrong causing him to assert that it is right this assertion of rightness is very integral and important to the service fac it makes the pc unauditable to the degree that he is getting auditing only to prove that it is right it sticks out like sore thumb one could have more trouble labeling it than finding it the human body is service fac but if we used that we would be going for ot and we arent shooting for that we are just using the service fac on this lifetime to get the pc auditable so the body isnt the service fac that we are trying to target having found service fac we dont use it to make an ot we are only trying to get someone auditable and to get the constantly restimulated solutions out of the way to clear this lifetime on the whole track obviously having bank is service facsimile that accounts for the reluctance to go clear noticed earlier while finding goals being incapable could still be service fac at an ot level if say the ot couldnt tilt planet but attacking this kind of service fac directly is too steep gradient you could run service facs at all different levels the concept of service fac is based on confusion and stable datum theory in running service fac we are attacking solution that is barrier to getting rid of confusion you can pluck the stable datum out of the center of confusion and thus get discharge of the energy of the confusion stable datum holds confusion in place this is the reverse of using stable datum to handle confusion charge is an electrical confusion as long as stable datum holds confusion in place the confusion will not discharge 493 confusions are tolerable and are not always aberrative most have aberrative value eg in card game life is not in itself an aberrative action there has to be some force and violence involved in the confusion or at least fairly real threat to survival for it to be aberrative the thetan knows that if he ceases to dramatize service fac he will die the immediate thing someone is worried about may not be the service facsimile itself it could be the consequence of something else that is service fac the consequence could be very hidden the two things could have at best faint connection as you take off service facs the central one on which they all lean eventually comes off as you audit the case you could get off several before the central one comes to view the apparent service facs lean on the main service fac rote procedure to apply to this would be logical solution to very illogical area but it is better to understand what you are doing if the case has been audited you could collect list of things that have been found on the pc eg old lists r212 assessments etc by discussing them with the pc and following the pcs interest you could find some service facs you might have to reword some of the things you come up with the rightwrong bracket is always the same the question is how would the condition or thing found make you right and make others wrong the service fac is the pc it is something he has it is not like an oppterm it is something he has to make him right and others wrong the pc will slop on the auditing command eg the pc may misduplicate the auditing command as what would be made wrong by it you dont worry about this let the automaticity run out then reask your original question and get it answered service facsimile is not an action an action would be the result of service fac the service fac turns on automaticities because it is an automatic unanalyzed solution for this reason you dont run it as repetitive process automaticity means that more answers than the pc can articulate are arriving from the bank when this happens when words are coming too fast you know that you are getting the service fac throw the question in and let the lions tear at it for awhile let the automaticity run out let er buck when the pc starts to run then when he runs out of answers turn it around and run it the other way if he hasnt already done it himself you are trying to get rid of the avalanche of automaticity and get ta also dont overrun by insisting on more answers than the pc has or you can get stuck flow run it permissively it is sometimes difficult to keep the pc answering the question just because he is in dissociated area the solution is holding back tremendous amount of aberration which wont asis as long as the solution is there the solution just keeps accumulating mass the solution is always below 20 on the tone scale because it is perforce substitute for an itsa line the pc felt that he could not itsa the object that he was trying to make wrong so he dreamed up this solution as final solution and that is substitute for an itsa line then there is asisness or itsa on the environment since there is asisness you get an accumulation of mass since it is substitute for an itsa line the service fac is referred to whenever the pc refers to anything when the solution is below 20 it propounds the idea that to survive it is necessary to succumb that is what it boils down to aberrated though that is for instance the solution may be not eating as in anorexia nervosa 494 the service fac doesnt even have to fit in with the guys environment it is often totally hidden you cant necessarily spot the service fac by what the person is doing it often goes underground especially the very hidden ones some are very obvious too sometimes so obvious that you miss them you could ask as an l and h question what do you think your service fac is interest is the keynote the service fac is not deliberate solution it is subawareness automatic solution which the person is on the verge of all the time that is what makes service facs easy to spot if youve got the service fac the pc cant stay out of it it has to be specific enough you can use represent on something that is too general you can assess the list according to interest the pc tends to fall into the whirlpool of the service fac if the pc has fragile tone arm easily stuck then youve got service fac solution there that is preventing the charge from running off the pc doesnt have to look at things hes got it solved once you have the service fac get the pc to tell you how in this lifetime it would make him right etc dont go for the backtrack this improves the pcs ability to get ta action the peculiarity of the action you are looking for is not particularly great compared with the peculiarity of social mores but it is posing as survival when it clearly isnt prosurvival the pc will be interested in it and it will get ta because it is fixed solution your main interest is ta action just get the mass flowing that was hanging up service fac is fixed contrasurvival solution which the person hasnt inspected it could even be fixed survival solution but then that wouldnt interfere with auditing however using conduct as criterion makes anyone liable to be put away service fac is batty when compared not to the mores of society but to actual survival so you could say the following about service fac 1 it is contrasurvival but poses as survival 2 it has the pcs interest 3 it sticks the tone arm 4 it is always protruded into pt thus any constant ptp can contain service fac for instance you could ask what did you come into scientology to resolve that is one reason that service fac processing is beneficial however it is dangerous to list too many problems on pc because you are giving the pc too much whatsit while an incomplete list will arc break the pc so you had better twoway comm it use friendly discussion so you can move out of it if it gets sticky dont list it when you find an appropriate problem find the solution in back of it and that fixed solution will give you the service fac if the discussion does get sticky you could free up the ta again by asking for solution that the pc has had to each problem he mentions getting fixed solution means that youve got the service fac notice that r1c and r2c are designed to strip away solutions and stable data therefore they are not likely to freeze up the ta find out if the pc has run r1c and r2c you can use this for data you can ask what the pc found interesting dont ask what problems would that solve that sticks the ta assess it then you can get the service fac the r3r preliminary assessment is almost deadcenter pitch at the service fac providing it winds 495 up with statable solution this solution should be something that makes sense to you and the pc getting the item with the pcs interest will give you the service fac the level assessed will be too broad the service fac is magnet you are asking for right answers and the pc is giving you the rightest answer of all you can even get the service fac as nonsequitur item on list so watch for service facs on any list the fact that the item that is service fac is dissociated gives you clue the pc will handle your session with his service fac eventually it downs on you what he has been doing keep running service facs until you get change in the pc and free needle and good ta the service fac is the source of the ptp that the pc keeps coming to session with so getting it saves you all sorts of time and trouble when you get it out of the way get rid of the service fac and overrestimulation of the case ends this would reduce by 50 the total restimulation on the case so cases wouldnt keep dropping between sessions because of environmental restimulation having the pcs attention on disabilities keeps his attention off the bank thus good handling of service facs increases by hundred to one the runability of the case so you can now run him on steeper gradient l ron hubbard type 3 idate3963 volnum1 issue302 rev0 rdate000

reason person doesnt recover under auditing has been subject of investigation off and on since 1949 it was most recently looked at with regard to r212 it has now come up again with the discovery that to get case gain pc had to have ta motion the fact that you are getting ta action doesnt guarantee that the pc will feel better but ta action does guarantee that the pc will feel worse pc could feel better despite getting ta action because he is getting somewhat overrestimulated while still getting some charge off by classes of auditors here is what should happen with ta motion class i he may or may not be able to get ta its mostly chance that determines it class ii the auditor has to be able to direct attention enough to be able to get ta action while he listens it is very light attentiondirecting class iii the auditor directs the pcs attention towards service facs and clearing the itsa line is controlled more firmly to limit the pcs attention to this lifetime and to what you are trying to run using midruds etc to do it class iv at this level you are dealing with living lightning backtrack stuff gpms slippery track etc if you see the various classes of auditors arranged in order of increasing control of the pcs attention rather than by degree of complexity of material studied it is all quite clear 496 by overwhumping the pc by restimulating more on the backtrack than you can discharge and by not controlling the pcs attention and letting him skid around restimulating things you get get the pc into condition where restimulation is too great even to permit the discharge of the keyin this is quite problem the resolution of this problem comes with running the service facsimile service facsimile is solution that the person himself has so restimulated that it wont discharge and nothing will discharge past it it is so valuable as solution that the pc feels he would perish if he got rid of it its an overcharged solution which the pc himself is keeping charged up it sits there and charge is permitted to flow by it unfortunately for the being it has weird sort of workability it is nonsurvival solution that has become survival it appears to make sense until it is inspected it has lots of in it when you start to run service fac by running engrams of the thing it will grind and it wont erase this is another odd datum the service fac is mainly diagnosed by the fact that the ta hangs up not by how the person acts in life the low ta or dead thetan case always has service fac the dead thetan case is sometimes hard to spot sometimes he is just sitting in something and when you ask question you get an fn high ta case probably has service fac although it is questionable case whose ta is between 35 and 375 with responsive needle has good chance of having service fac but doesnt necessarily have one person who tends to be out of control on the backtrack is overrestimulated you might even try to find service fac on him when pc has service fac the normal river of discharge is blocked by stable datum that the pc feels is vital to his survival the service fac the hallmark of service fac is that sometimes when it is being run out or between sessions the pc questions the wisdom of getting rid of it service fac is present where life has done so much overwhelming and the pc has done so much overwhelming that life makes more sense he has abandoned it and in lieu of it he has erected this insane stable datum the service fac it might be better to call the service fac service computation or survival computation since it isnt actually single facsimile at all it is the person himself keeping the facsimile in restimulation because he knows it is best there are also third dynamic service facs such as the current prison system penologists know very well that the current prison system does nothing to handle crime it only increases crime this system which was adopted in 1835 was intended not to rehabilitate criminals but to dramatize making criminals wrong prisons are actually universities of crime maintained at public expense similarly the fdas actions are the result of basically good idea namely that the public should be protected against noxious food and drug products but this idea has gone bonkers it was good solution that has been plowed in so that it appears lower and lower of the tone scale and becomes an aberration the legal system of precedent is based on the same principle as the service fac in that it involves maintaining old solutions without necessarily inspecting them 497 it is not true that every solution becomes service fac service fac is solution that is insisted upon but wont itsa solution to be real solution leads to further ability to itsa if solution reduces the ability to itsa it is potential service fac the fda is taking over the publics ability to inspect goodness of food and denying the public an analytical attitude towards products thereby reducing the publics itsa the public longer inspects and decides the fda can now go in and can pass stuff as good that isnt because of politics corruption etc the public can now be caved in by it you would never look to travel agencies as source of social aberration because their business is to increase itsa it can occasionally occur that they do though there can sometimes be problems associated with this eg british west indies immigrants flooding the uk however it is reducing itsa that has bad effect on society generally those things that result in or produce solution without inspection that is too broadly applied generate service facs the service fac prevents itsa of charge that comes up thus causing the accumulation of mass this mass gets restimulated when you prepcheck something that nicks the area lack of itsa also causes lack of ta action since without itsa outflowed there is discharge of charge families can get into noitsa of their individual members lack of itsa results in failure to handle situation in its own zone of reality which is all that aberration is service fac makes it apparently unnecessary to cope with anything in its own sphere of reality that is the service that service fac performs the resultant accumulated mass causes ta in the area result in prepchecking or other processing the more service facs the pc has the harder it is for you to get ta action on him in some cases there are definite advantages to getting service facs out of the way before proceeding to running back track you can save time and stabilize clears by destimulating what could key in r3sc is very workable process just inspect the folder past assessments etc looking especially for periods when the ta shut down ie where ta motion stopped for awhile whatever ta motion stopped on will be likely candidate for r3sc dont overrun it if the pc has trouble answering it come off that particular subject the right subject gives very good action the faster you get the real service fac the sooner ta action is restored so this makes r212type processes unnecessary it solves the problem of rockslammers chronic ptps hidden standards and body masses mainly it restores ta action r3sc run on few service facs advances the case to clear it is level iii process because it is clearing process current routine threes that actually produce ots eg r3n will be renumbered as level iv processes 498 l ron

around the edges of the field of psychotherapy for some time there is third dynamic service fac in this field in that medical doctors who have training for and have business in the field of mental healing are attempting to take dominance over this field they have understanding of the mind only an understanding of the brain all you would have to to is to get legislatures to pass laws that would only allow those trained in the field of the mind to practice in that field and you would have secured the field there are only 272 mental practitioners in england so we have mocked up our own opposition our own extra item so people qualified at level iii will soon have certificate as psychiatric consultant there is legal patent on the name level iii is expected to be able to clear it also incidentally takes in the ability to treat insanity neurosis and psychosis these are just different degree of what is wrong with the mind the person who cant even manage himself and the environment we call insane what is wrong with him is that he has got the final solution some solution that is so allpervading that he doesnt have to itsa anything after that he never has to look so he just disappears in mound of unasised mass in processing certain amount of introversion takes place for the purpose of bringing about extroversion the only time introversion and erasure do not bring about greater reach and greater arc is when overrestimulation is brought about that factor still exists in class iv but there it is whole track that is most likely to get pc into an overrestimulated condition not just itsa on this lifetime at level iii you could overrestimulate someone who was already batty the worse off case is the more careful you have to be of overrestimulation for instance someone who had been running on conceptual basis who did not have much reach and not much arc with the environment might get overrestimulated if you got them to contact the pain in the thing that they are running to clear somebody you will stay in this lifetime only at level iv do you leave this lifetime and that is when someone has an active ta that doesnt go high or low with any pc on this planet it is environmental restimulation that is the straw that breaks the pcs back you can go backtrack but it is rough it can make the pc unauditable an hgc operating with raw public or even with scientologists has to battle with environmental restimulation not with the bank neurotic and psychotic states are caused by environmental restimulation the two factors involved are 1 the amount of environmental restimulation 2 the inherent susceptibility of the individual therefore if all you did was to try to reduce environmental restimulation some people would go sane and others would go mad with boredom it is question of acceptable randomity dogooders end up reducing randomity and things can get pretty boring an acceptable level of randomity equals the amount of environmental restimulation divided by the amount of restimulation the individual can withstand this being equal to some constant pcs usually audit only what they consider safe the mind starts to shut off any restimulation that would overwhelm it cf the 499 minds protection the pcs ability to resist restimulation is too low for him to face up to track so how are you going to get anything done there are three types of cases 1 normal confront of bank those which audit easily 2 confront of bank those who refuse to approach the bank 3 suicidal confront those whose eyes are bigger than their stomachs so that they go in over their heads all the time we want to convert the two latter sorts of cases into the former all cases tend towards the safe solution some cases also adopt vengeful solution like getting even with people by dying even dangerous solution seems like the safe solution to the pc all cases when they become more auditable do so along the channel of the safe solution safe solution is safe decision safe environment safe assumption etc all human rights disappear down the channel of the safe solution that is the hole in the bathtub it is actually very dangerous to have safe solution it inhibits observation and anything that inhibits observation destroys someone who is very neurotic or psychotic is so to the degree that they have adopted safe solution this datum underlies mental healing as sweepingly as the datum that survival is the common denominator it is another way of saying the same thing people adopt survival solutions when then become so safe that they become contrasurvival the safe solution makes the person right and others wrong enhancing the persons survival by putting him in position of dominance and letting him escape domination by others it lets him survive and causes others to succumb he thinks this reaches extremes of craziness eg the miser who starves in household of 100 bills his method of survival is to have lots of money it is very safe solution but in his obsession with this safe solution he has neglected to spend any of it to live so his attention becomes more and more concentrated and less and less sensible for someone to be wise he must be able to observe his environment he must be able to reach it is not good enough to have maxims tucked away to which you can refer in times of stress philosophy becomes not wisdom but study of safe solutions the safe solution is the service facsimile there are times when you will have to be very clever to find just what it is in the pc it is complicated alterised and not believable there could be thousands of them you want to get the one the test is did it resolve the case in the first ones you find the most you can hope for is to find something that moves the ta and brings you closer to resolving the pcs case when you have found the service fac on the case the needle will be looser and the ta will be in more reasonable state acting better when something you have found doesnt run on the rightwrong bracket you prepcheck this is an invariable rule you could fix the pc up by taking anything that has been found charged on old assessments and prepchecking it that which you couldnt prepcheck with ta you could run on rightwrong if it goes nowhere on that ok there is harm done all this will eventually reveal the service fac 500 one way in which you could be too clever with this would be to get overambitious and throw the pc in over his head as follows you are pulling the stable datum out of the confusion therefore the pc may be thrown into the confusion which makes him feel weird if you run r3sc on the stable datum until it is flat it will make it all right for the pc one of the tests of the service fac is that the pc is likely to say or at least think that he is not sure that it is wise to get rid of it be very sure if you are working with someone who is already shaky that you unburden the case gradiently even though he is standing there saying his service fac environmental restimulation has to be reduced on such case before you add any processing restimulation the better the assessment and the less gradient there had been the greater the shock to the person remember the pc adopted the safe solution because he couldnt stand the environmental restimulation so you dont necessarily want to get the big stable data first it is better to start off with r1c or 2wc on solutions that he has had to his problems the more solutions he has had to problem the more it will stick how do you raise someones ability to withstand environmental restimulation you pull his service fac since that is what reduces his ability to see his environment the more safe solutions he has adopted the more environmental restimulation he isnt asising the less he is confronting etc oddly enough or not so oddly the thing that reduces his ability to handle his environment is the thing that he has adopted to handle his environment for him when you remove that thing he can now confront and inspect the environment and handle it when you get the environmental restimulation out of the way the pc can confront the backtrack we have gone into this line because we want faster run to ot i dont care anything much about clearing or whether he gets clear or not we are not trying to make happy persons we are trying to make an able person you can make clear by getting off enough service facs it makes better human being but the point is to cut down the time spent at level iv which is already sizable amount at level iii then we can handle environmental restimulation by knocking out the service facsimile which is what encourages environmental restimulation we have enough attention free so that we can go wholetrack and erase things faster and we are not held up by low tas and high tas so we dont have this situation w started to do gpm we got little bit mixed up we got into the bear goals then we got into the helatrobus didnt realize it but we were into the invisible picture goals all the time by knocking out the service fac session restimulation also drops because the session is part of the environment the assessment for r3sc is simple one it is l and n the lists dont have to be superlong in fact they should not be longer than eight to ten pages with twenty items per page unless it is just safe to keep on listing list should be only as long as it has to be to keep the pc from arc breaking because it is incomplete 501 here is the r3sc procedure 1 you do parts of existence list and null it down to some one item that the pc doesnt object to say peanuts it doesnt matter if the item is right so long as the pc doesnt argue about it if say four items are left in and the list isnt complete we will just do step 2 to all four of the levels left in as long as the pc isnt protesting pcs dramatize doing only what is safe ss they move in towards the service fac so you may need to do this assessment several times 2 take the item found and list safe solutions to it safe assumptions about it or safe decisions about it whatever clears with the pc the item you get eg not eat them is probably either as close as you can get to the service fac at this time or the service fac itself 3 take the item and work it over until it is solution to more than just that one dynamic eg solution to more than just peanuts you could ask how could that apply to other dynamics etc we want broader version of the safe assumption to get closer to the real service fac 4 in any case take whatever you get from 3 and run r3sc brackets or prepcheck on it 5 repeat the entire procedure starting with new parts of existence list 6 run it to free needle if you run something and you still have some charge on it list for safe assumptions about that topic look for identifications pcs will mention assumptions that dont make sense such an identification is cousin to one or more service facs note them when you find them this whole operation does take some genius l
