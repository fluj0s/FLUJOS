transportation housing and urban development and related agencies thud fy2009 appropriations summary the fy2009 transportation housing and urban development and related agencies appropriations bill thud provides funding for the department of transportation dot the department of housing and urban development hud and five independent agencies related to those two departments the bush administration requested net budgetary authority of 1025 billion after scorekeeping adjustments for fy2009 cut of 36 million less than 1 from the comparable fy2008 level dot would receive net total of 635 billion cut of 1 billion from the comparable fy2008 level hud would receive 391 billion an increase of 4 14 billion over the comparable fy2008 level however the requested increase in net budget authority for hud is largely attributable to decline in the amount available to offset new funding in the hud budget the presidents budget request would actually result in an overall decline in nonemergency appropriations for huds programs and activities of just over 1 from the fy2008 level the house committee on appropriations subcommittee on thud reportedly marked up draft fy2009 thud appropriations bill on june 20 2008 the details of that draft have not been made public the full committee has not yet marked up the bill and it is not clear that it will do so the senate committee on appropriations marked up an fy2009 thud bill s 3261 on july 10 2008 the senate committee recommended 1094 billion 66 billion more than the administration requested congressional leaders have been quoted in press reports indicating that they will not try to enact most of the fy2009 appropriations bills including the thud bill until sometime after the next administration has taken office in 2009 in the meantime they reportedly intend to provide fy2009 funding for most federal agencies including those in the thud bill through one or more continuing resolutions among the thud appropriation issues facing congress is the impending deficit in the highway trust fund the portion of the fund that provides money for federal highway programs has long been projected to have 3 billion deficit by the end of fy2009 the portion that provides money for transit projects is projected to run deficit in fy2011 the house passed separate legislation hr 6532 to transfer 8 billion from the general fund to the highway trust fund to prevent the fy2009 shortfall this legislation was opposed by the administration however on september 5 2008 the administration announced that revenues to the fund had declined more than expected in recent months resulting in the fund facing shortfall as early as october 2008 the administration is now urging congress to immediately pass the legislation transferring

appropriations approved s 3261 the fy2009 thud appropriations bill and ordered it to be reported the committee recommended 1094 billion in funding 66 billion more than the amount requested by the

airports1 on february 5 2008 the administration submitted its budget request for fy2009 to congress the budget request for both dot and hud represented reduction in funding compared to the nonemergency funding enacted for those agencies in fy2008 overview congress faces difficult challenge in the fy2009 appropriations process the nation is facing variety of economic challenges including general slowdown 1 summary table published on the website of the house committee on appropriations provides selected figures from the markedup version of the draft bill httpappropriations housegovpdf09thudtablesubmarkuppdf crs2 in the economy record high oil prices and decline in housing values the budget deficit for fy2008 is expected to be around 400 billion2 the president presented constrained budget to congress the thud request represented net increase over the fy2008 level excluding fy2008 emergency appropriations and threatened to veto any appropriations bills that exceed the requested level of funding citing last years appropriations experience when some in congress contended that the president refused to negotiate with congress over the final level of fy2008 appropriations congressional leaders have been cited in press reports indicating that congress may not pass many if any regular appropriations bills before the end of the 2008 calendar year instead reports indicate that congress will pass one or more continuing resolutions to keep the government operating after the end of fy2008 and complete the fy2009 appropriations process in calendar year 2009 when it will be dealing with new administration the presidents budget request the presidents net fy2009 request for the programs covered by this appropriations bill is 1025 billion after scorekeeping adjustments this is 36 million less than 1 below the comparable total enacted for fy2008 the dot request was 635 billion 12 billion 2 below the amount provided for fy2008 it provided 7 increase for transit funding 644 million though that is less than the authorized funding level the presidents fy2009 budget requests 391 billion less than 4 increase in total regular nonemergency budget authority for hud following recent trends the requested increase in budget authority is largely driven by declines in the amount available for rescission 88 decline from fy2008 and projected to be available in offsetting receipts 23 decline from fy2008 the fy2009 request for regular nonemergency appropriations which is the amount available for huds programs and activities represents slight decline 14 from fy2008 the administrations fy2009 budget request included funding reductions that had also been proposed by the administration in previous budget requests without success among the

and senate committees on appropriations have reorganized their subcommittee structure three times in 2003 new subcommittee homeland security was added in order to maintain the existing number of subcommittees at 13 the transportation appropriations subcommittees were combined with the treasury postal service and general government appropriations subcommittees becoming the subcommittees on transportation treasury and independent agencies in early 2005 the house and senate committees on appropriations again reorganized their subcommittee structures the house committee on appropriations crs4 reduced its number of subcommittees from 13 to 10 this change included combining the transportation treasury and independent agencies subcommittee with the district of columbia subcommittee to the resulting subcommittee in addition jurisdiction over appropriations for the department of housing and urban development and the judiciary as well as several additional independent agencies was added the subcommittee was then known as the subcommittee on transportation treasury housing and urban development the judiciary district of columbia and independent agencies or tthud the senate committee on appropriations reduced its number of subcommittees to 12 the senate also added jurisdiction over appropriations for the departments of housing and urban development and the judiciary to the transportation treasury and independent agencies subcommittee the senate retained separate district of columbia appropriations subcommittee as result the areas of coverage of the house and senate subcommittees with jurisdiction over this appropriations bill were almost but not quite identical the major difference being that in the senate the appropriations for the district of columbia originate in separate bill at the beginning of the 110th congress in 2007 the house and senate committees on appropriations again reorganized their subcommittee structures the house and senate committees divided the responsibilities of the tthud subcommittees between two subcommittees transportation housing and urban development and related agencies thud and financial services and general government whose jurisdiction included the treasury department the judiciary the executive office of the president the district of columbia and many of the independent agencies formerly under the jurisdiction of the tthud subcommittees these changes make yeartoyear comparisons of transportation and housing and urban development appropriation bills complex as their appropriations appear in different bills in combination with various other agencies other factors such as supplemental appropriations for response to disasters such as the damage caused by the gulf coast hurricanes in the fall of 2005 and changes in the makeup of the department of transportation portions of which were transferred to the department of homeland security in 2004 also complicate comparisons of yeartoyear funding table 3 shows funding trends over the fiveyear period fy2004fy2008 and the amounts requested for fy2009 for the departments of transportation and housing and urban development the purpose of

subtraction of 35 billion rescission of previously provided contract authority and the transfer of 121 million to nhtsa the house and senate committees recommended 410 billion for fhwa for fy2008 rescissions of contract authority resulted in those proposals being scored as 376 billion and 379 billion respectively the economic and political context within which the fy2009 transportation appropriations process is taking place is tumultuous the significant rise in the price of fuel for cars trucks and commercial jets is having major impact on components of the transportation industry the commercial passenger aviation industry is projecting loss of several billion dollars and is cutting the number of flights offered and even eliminating some routes reducing and in some cases eliminating air crs7 connections to some communities legislation reauthorizing the faas programs and activities continues to be debated in congress the authorization of the taxes and fees that support the airport and airway trust fund the primary source of funding for federal aviation programs was scheduled to lapse at the end of fy2007 these taxes and fees have been kept in force through series of shortterm authorization extensions at the same time there is widespread concern about the condition of the nations infrastructure significant component of which is transportation infrastructure the collapse of an interstate highway bridge in minnesota in august 2007 created concern over the conditions of the nations bridges portions of the interstate highway system are reaching the end of their projected 50year lifespan these factors combined with concern over growing levels of traffic congestion have led to calls for significant increases in spending on transportation infrastructure the national surface transportation policy and revenue study commission has recommended that the federal surface transportation program be extensively restructured and that surface transportation investment from all sources be more than doubled from its present level to 225 billion annually3 while some in congress are calling for greater levels of federal spending on transportation infrastructure the primary source of federal highway funding the highway account of the highway trust fund is projected to run short of money before the end of fy2009 this was foreseen in safetealu which called for multibillion dollar rescission of contract authority at the end of september 2009 to balance the account but rising gas prices have led consumers to reduce their consumption of fuel4 which is reducing the revenues coming in to the highway account congress is considering legislation that would provide money from the general fund to the highway account in order to forestall the highway account deficit in fy2009 department of transportation budget and key policy issues the presidents fy2009 budget requested total of 645 billion for the department of transportation dot5 that was 12 billion 2 below the level provided for fy2008 the major funding changes requested from the fy2008 enacted levels were an increase of 644 million 7 for transit decrease of 18 billion 4 in highway funding 3 transportation for tomorrow report of the national surface transportation policy and revenue study commission december 2007 available at httpwwwtransportation fortomorroworgfinal_report 4 according to the fhwa yearly cumulative vehicle miles traveled vmt through april 2008 has decreased 21 more than 20 billion vmt compared to 2007 and the total figure of vmt in april 2008 marks the sixth consecutive month that driving has declined compared to the prior year 5 this total represents 681 billion in new appropriations and 39 billion in rescissions crs8 decrease of 525 million 40 in amtrak funding similar to requested decreases in fy2007 and fy2008 that were rejected by congress decrease of 765 million 22 in the federal aviation administrations airport improvement program similar to requested decreases in fy2007 and fy2008 that were rejected by congress and decrease of 60 million 54 in funding for the essential air service program similar to requested decreases in fy2007 and fy2008 that were rejected by congress the administration request also proposed restructuring the faa budget reflecting the administrations reauthorization proposal for the faa the administrations request including as it does over 3 billion in cuts that have been repeatedly requested and repeatedly rejected by congress creates difficulty for appropriators if the appropriators restore the funding for those programs even to just the level provided in fy2008 the resulting bill will likely exceed the presidents request meanwhile the president has threatened to veto fy2009 appropriations bills that provide more than the requested level of spending highway trust fund status the highway trust fund is the funding source for most federal surface transportation programs the fund receives around 38 billion annually about 90 of which comes from federal taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel the fund has two accounts the highway account and the mass transit account the highway account receives about 87 of the revenues to the fund the highway account provides funds for federal highway programs the mass transit account provides funds for federal transit programs the highway account was expected to run short on money before the end of fy2009 nor was this temporary dip the highway account deficit is projected to increase in subsequent years this was foreseen in 2005 at the passage of safetealu which authorized more highway funding during the authorization period than projected revenues could support safetealu provided for rescission of highway funding at the end of fy2009 to prevent the highway account from going into the red however on september 5 2008 dot secretary mary peters announced that the highway account was expected to run short of funding as early as october 20086 since passage of safetealu in 2005 expenditures from the highway account have exceeded the levels initially authorized and the revenues to the account have not kept pace with the revenues forecast with sharp drop in revenues during 2008 6 mary peters secretary department of transportation trust fund solvency media briefing september 5 2008 available at httpwwwdotgovaffairshighwaytrustfund secretarysremarkshtm crs9 as recordhigh gas prices have led motorists to reduce their amount of driving these events have exacerbated the extent of the deficit projected in 2005 the highway account will still be receiving revenues in 2009 but the expenditures from the account will exceed the level of revenues received the administration has announced that beginning in september it will slow the rate at which highway funds are transferred to the states to level that the highway account can sustain on july 14 2008 the senate committee on appropriations reported out an fy2009 thud appropriations bill which included recommendation that 8 billion be transferred from the general fund of the treasury to the highway trust fund to cover the shortfall7 the house passed separate legislation hr 6532 on july 23 2008 to do the same the administration threatened to veto the house bill on the grounds that it unnecessarily increases the federal deficit alters the userfee principle of the highway trust fund and jeopardizes any hope of constraining future federal highway spending8 however in the face of the immediate shortfall in funding the administration has now called on congress to pass legislation transferring funds to the highway account as soon as possible federal aviation administration faa the faa budget provides both capital and operating funding for the nations air traffic control system and also provides federal grants to airports for airport planning development and expansion of the capacity of the nations air traffic infrastructure the presidents budget requests 146 billion in new funding for fy2009 this is 152 million 1 less than the amount of new funding provided in fy20089 the senate committee on appropriations recommended 154 billion for fy2009 an increase of 788 million over the amount requested most of that increase is for the airport improvement grant program it is difficult to compare the requested funding level for operations the largest faa account and facilities equipment with the previous years funding because the budget request categorizes the faa funding differently than the fy2008 appropriation reflecting the administrations faa reauthorization proposal the administration request does include cut to the airport improvement grant program 7 the 8 billion figure comes from an arrangement reached in 1998 when highway authorizers agreed to transfer 8 billion in highway trust fund monies derived from interest received on the balance in the fund to the general fund in exchange for the creation of budget firewall and other mechanisms that made possible higher levels of highway spending ten questions and answers on the highway trust fund default transportation weekly v 9 26 july 10

govomblegislativesap1102saphr6532hpdf 9 the net new funding for fy2008 appears to be 118 million less than the fy2009 request due to rescission of contract authority in the fy2008 appropriation however that rescission did not actually reduce the amount of new funding provided in fy2008 crs10 airport improvement program aip the presidents budget proposed cut of 764 million to aip funding from 351 billion in fy2008 to 275 billion for fy2008 similar cut was proposed by the administration for fy2007 and for fy2008 neither cut was supported by congress aip funds are used to provide grants for airport planning and development and for projects to increase airport capacity such as construction of new runways and other facility improvements the senate committee on appropriations rejected the proposed cut recommending 35 billion the same amount as provided in fy2008 essential air service the presidents budget requested 50 million for the essential air service program 60 million 54 reduction from the 110 million provided for fy2008 similar decrease was proposed by the administration for fy2007 and fy2008 both were rejected by congress the senate committee on appropriations recommended 110 million the same amount provided for fy2008 this program seeks to preserve air service to small airports in rural communities by subsidizing the cost of that service supporters of the essential air service program contend that preserving airline service to rural communities was part of the deal congress made in exchange for deregulating airline service in 1978 which was expected to reduce air service to rural areas some members of congress have expressed concern that the proposed cut in funding for the essential air service program could lead to reduction in the transportation connections of rural communities previous budget requests from the current administration as well as budget requests from previous administrations have proposed reducing funding to this program federal highway administration fhwa the presidents budget requested 401 billion in new funding for federal highway programs for fy2009 cut of 18 billion 4 below the comparable level of 420 billion provided in fy200810 this is also 800 million below the 412 billion authorized funding level for fy2009 that is guaranteed by safetealu pl 10959 the 18 billion proposed reduction is made up of two components first safetealu provides mechanism known as raba revenue aligned budget authority for adjusting the authorized highway funding level up or down to reflect the level of income received by the highway trust account in fy2008 the authorized level was increased by 631 million as result of the raba adjustment the administration estimates that raba calls for 10 billion reduction in the authorized level for fy2009 reflecting declining receipts to the account second based on the fhwa administrators overview it appears that 800 million of the difference was fhwas share of 1 billion reduction to adjust for the extra 1 billion in highway bridge program obligations provided by appropriators in 10 the fy2008 enacted figure and fy2009 request were reduced for accounting purposes by rescissions of contract authority resulting in net budgetary totals of 381 billion for fy2008 and 363 billion for the fy2009 request an additional 195 million in emergency funding was provided in fy2008 crs11 fy200811 the overview argues that without the reduction the total obligation level provided over the full life of safetealu would have exceeded the 2864 billion grand total of guaranteed funding provided for in the act and agreed to by the administration the senate committee on appropriations rejected both the 10 billion called for by the raba mechanism in safetea and the 800 million cut requested by the administration recommending 421 billion for fy2009 the committee also rejected the administration proposal to cover the projected fy2009 highway account deficit by transferring funds from the mass transit account instead the committee recommended 8 billion from the general fund to the highway account12 federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa the administration requested the authorized level of funding for fmcsa 541 million this is 11 million 2 over the amount provided for fy200813 307 million of the request is for grants to states to enforce commercial truck and bus safety regulations the senate committee on appropriations recommended the same level the fy2008 thud appropriations act included provision section 136 that prohibited any funds in the act from being used to establish crossborder trucking demonstration program allowing mexican trucking companies to operate beyond the commercial zone zone extending 20 miles into the united states from the us mexico border the dot had implemented such program on september 7 2007 shortly before the beginning of the 2008 fiscal year dot continued to operate the program after passage of the fy2008 act contending that fy2008 funding used for the program would not be used to establish the program but to continue its operation the sierra club and the teamsters union have sued to stop the pilot program the case is under consideration congress has reiterated its opposition to the program the senate committee on appropriations recommended language that would terminate funding for the program the dot has announced that so far mexican trucks and drivers participating in the program have safety compliance rates equal to or better than us commercial truckers and that it intends to continue the program for two more years as allowed under law14 the dot notes that participation in the program has been less than expected due to the reluctance of trucking companies to make the necessary investments in the face of uncertainty about the pilot programs length and expects that the extension will encourage more companies to participate 11 the remaining 200 million of the reduction is to be taken from the proposed federal transit administration funding for fy2009 12 the 8 billion figure reflects the amount that was transferred from the highway account to the general fund in 1998 as part of an agreement that created the guaranteed funding structure of the highway program and established the raba mechanism 13 the net total for fy2008 was reduced for budgetary purposes to 479

appear to be on track to achieve its goal of reducing the rate of highway fatalities to 10 fatality per 100 million vmt by 2011 the rate has gone down from 151 fatalities per 100 million vmt in 2001 to 141 in 2006 but remains above nhtsas target for each year one category of highway fatality motorcycle fatalities has been increasing rather than decreasing since 2001 the most effective motorcycle safety policy is requiring that all motorcyclists wear helmets meeting safety standards some motorcyclists are strongly opposed to being required to wear helmets at times congress has penalized states that did not have mandatory helmet laws by withholding or restricting the use of some of their federal highway funding which resulted in nearuniversal adoption of mandatory helmet laws by states congress repealed such provision in 1995 now about twenty states have universal mandatory helmet laws16 in 1998 congress also forbade dot from lobbying states to adopt traffic safety laws17 the senate committee on appropriations recommended that an exception be made to this prohibition for the purpose of reducing motorcycle fatalities section 104 federal railroad administration fra the administration requested 1091 billion for fra for fy2009 this is cut of 471 million 30 from the 1561 billion provided for fy2008 the senate committee on appropriations recommended 1816 billion the largest portion of fras budget goes to support amtrak amtrak funding was also the source of almost all the variance in the administrations proposal and the senate committees recommendation the administration requested 800 million for amtrak cut of 40 525 million from fy2008 the senate committee recommended 15 billion for amtrak plus another 100 million for an incentive grant program to encourage states to make investments in improving 15 the 838 million in new funding for fy2008 was reduced for budgetary purposes to 815 million by rescissions of contract authority 16 universal mandatory helmet laws require all motorcyclists to wear helmet most of the other states require minors to wear helmet when riding motorcycle 17 pl 105178 section 7104 restrictions on lobbying activities crs13 passenger rail service congress provided 30 million for this program in fy2008 its first year of funding the administration did not request any funding for this program for fy2009 congress is also considering reauthorization of amtrak reauthorization legislation has been passed by both the house and the senate both bills would authorize considerably more funding for amtrak and intercity passenger rail activities than congress has provided in recent years between 2 and 3 billion annually compared to 13 billion authorizing funding is not the same as appropriating the money however and it is not clear that additional funding on that scale would be available most dot funding comes from the aviation and highway trust funds within the thud bill amtrak has to compete with few other transportation programs and with the hud programs for general funds and these programs are also seeking increased funding the next largest portion of fras budget is for safety programs intended to reduce railroad accidents the administration requested 157 million 7 million 4 more than provided for in fy2008 the senate committee recommended 159 million the other component of the fra budget is research and development of rail safety improvements the administration requested 34 million for this 2 million 6 less than the 36 million provided for in fy2008 the senate committee also recommended 34 million in fy2008 congress also provided 20 million for rail line relocation and improvement program established in safetealu that had not previously been funded the administration did not request any money for this program in fy2008 or in fy2009 the senate committee recommended 25 million for fy2009 federal transit administration fta the administration requested 10135 billion for fta for fy2009 this is an increase of 644 million 7 over the amount provided for fy200818 but is 203 million below the authorized fy2009 funding level of 10338 billion the senate committee on appropriations recommended 10226 billion virtually all of ftas funding goes to state and local transportation authorities to support bus commuter rail subway and light rail transit services most of this goes out through formula grant programs the senate committee recommended 100 million less than the requested level for the formula grant programs and the bus grant program the largest transit discretionary grant program and 188 million more than requested for the new starts program which funds new fixedguideway transit systems and extensions to existing systems maritime administration marad the administration requested 313 million for marad for fy2009 7 million 2 above the 307 million enacted for fy2008 the senate committee on appropriations recommended 345 million 18 the net fy2008 total was reduced for budgetary purposes to 94 billion by 133 million rescission of contract authority crs14 the primary change from the requested level was the senate committees recommendation of 20 million for assistance to small shipyards congress provided 10 million for this in fy2008 its first year of funding after being authorized in 2006 and the administration did not request any funding for this program for fy2009 the program provides grants and loans to small shipyards for capital improvements marad supports the maritime transportation sector the largest components of its budget are the maritime security program and operations and training the administration requested 174 million for the maritime security program an 18 million 12 increase over fy2008 this program provides payments of roughly 26 million per ship to retain fleet of 60 active militarily useful privately owned vessels to be available to the federal government in the event they are needed for security purposes total of 118 million was requested for operations and training 4 million 3 less than provided for fy2008 this program funds the us merchant marine academy state maritime schools and marads operations housing and urban development appropriations most of the funding for the activities of the department of housing and urban development hud comes from discretionary appropriations provided each year in the annual appropriations acts enacted by congress huds programs are primarily designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs these include several programs of rental assistance for the poor elderly andor disabled three rental assistance programs public housing section 8 vouchers and section 8 projectbased rental assistance account for the majority of the departments nonemergency funding more than 75 in fy2008 two flexible block grant programs home and community development block grants help communities finance variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve lowincome families other more specialized block grants help communities meet the needs of homeless persons including those with aids in recent years hud has also focused more attention on efforts to increase the homeownership rates for lowerincome and minority households with programs providing funding for downpayment assistance and housing counseling huds federal housing administration fha insures mortgages made by lenders to lowerincome home buyers many with belowaverage credit records and to developers of multifamily rental buildings containing relatively affordable units fha collects fees from insured borrowers which are used to sustain the insurance fund and offset its administrative costs surplus fha fees have been used to offset the cost of the hud budget huds budget is comprised of several types of funding regular annual appropriations fund the activities of the department offsetting collections and receipts such as those from fha and rescissions of unobligated balances from prior years funding offset the cost to congress of the appropriations in some years congress

the report provides summary of key issues in huds fy2009 budget for more detailed examination readers should see crs report rl34504 the department of housing and urban development fy2009 appropriations tenantbased rental assistance renewal funding the tenantbased rental assistance account funds the section 8 housing choice voucher program the section 8 voucher program funds rental assistance for low income families that they can use to reduce their housing costs in the private market the program is funded by hud but administered at the local level by quasi governmental local public housing authorities phas this account funds the annual renewal of the roughly 2 million vouchers authorized by congress as well as their associated administrative costs and in some years new vouchers for more information on the section 8 voucher program see crs report rl32284 an overview of the section 8 housing programs and crs report rl34002 section 8 housing choice voucher program issues and reform proposals in the 110th congress by maggie mccarty libby perl bruce foote eugene boyd and oscar r gonzales the tenantbased rental assistance account is the largest in huds budget in recent years it has also been the source of the most contention in huds budget primarily attention has been focused on whether the amount of funding provided for voucher renewals is sufficient to fund all of the vouchers authorized by congress andor in use by families and how that renewal funding is to be allocated to phas while there is statutory formula for allocating voucher funds to phas it has been overridden in recent years by formulas adopted by congress in the appropriations acts the amount available for voucher renewals each year is made up of two parts current year appropriations and advance appropriations provided in the prior year that become available in the current year for fy2009 the president requested 11881 million in current year funding for voucher renewals as well as 4000 million in advance appropriations for use in fy2010 this request represents decrease from the 12233 million in current year funding provided in fy2008 and decrease from the 4158 million in advance appropriations provided in fy2008 for use in fy2009 crs19 combined the presidents request would result in 16039 million in available budget authority for fy2009 current year funding plus prior year advance and 15881 million in budget authority provided for fy2009 current year funding plus advance for subsequent year this represents an increase from the 15703 million available in fy2008 but decrease from the 16391 million provided in fy2008 huds fy2009 budget documents estimate that the amount of funding requested would be sufficient to renew all of the vouchers in use for more detailed discussion see crs report rl34504 the department of housing and urban development fy2009 appropriations the presidents fy2009 budget also requested that congress change the way that it provides renewal funding to phas specifically it requested that phas be provided funding based on the amount of funding they received in the previous year this would be change from the fy2008 funding formula which funded phas based on their costs and voucher usage referred to as utilization over the prior year this debate over whether to fund phas based on the budget they received in the prior year or based on their expenses has gone back and forth since fy2003 for detailed discussion of this issue see crs report rl33929 recent changes to the section 8 voucher renewal funding formula finally the presidents budget requested 39 million to fund new incremental vouchers for elderly and disabled families who were displaced by the 2005 hurricanes and whose femafunded rental assistance will be ending in march 2009 the budget also requested 75 million for new incremental vouchers for homeless veterans the combined total for new vouchers 114 million would be less than the amount provided in fy2008 125 million s 3261 as reported by the senate appropriations committee would provide 12503 million in current year funding for the tenantbased rental assistance account and 4200 million in advance appropriations for use in fy2010 s 3261 would also rescind 800 million from the advance appropriation provided in fy2008 for use in fy2009 combined the senate bill would result in 15861 million in available budget authority for fy2009 current year funding plus prior year advance less rescission and 16703 million in budget authority provided for fy2009 current year funding plus advance for subsequent year this represents an increase from the 15703 million available in fy2008 and an increase from the 16391 million provided in fy2008 it represents decrease from the 16309 million in available budget authority requested by the president for fy2009 but an increase from the 15881 billion in budget authority that would be provided by the presidents fy2009 budget request s 3261 would allocate renewal funding using formula similar to the one in place in fy2008 rather than the formula requested by the president it also includes 134 million in funding for new incremental vouchers more than requested by the president and provided in fy2008 crs20 projectbased rental assistance renewal funding the projectbased rental assistance account provides funding to renew amend and cover administrative expenses for the more than one million rental assistance contracts between private property owners and hud these contracts allow low income tenants that live in the assisted properties to pay reduced rents the program under which these contracts are authorized is commonly referred to as projectbased section 8 in july 2007 hud stopped making payments to property owners with project based contracts due to change in interpretation regarding how hud was to provide renewal funding hud determined it did not have sufficient funding to meet its contractual obligations negotiation with the office of management and budget and revisions to the contract language between hud and property owners allowed hud to resume payments including retroactive payments however this shortfall raised concerns among some members of congress several committees held hearings on the topic and industry groups representing property owners for fy2009 the presidents budget requested 7000 million for the project based rental assistance account an increase from the 6382 million provided in fy2008 further the budget requested 400 million in advance appropriations to be provided in fy2009 for use in fy2010 if approved it would be the first time an advance appropriation was to be used in this account huds budget documents indicate that the department believes that its request 7400 million would be sufficient to meet the departments contractual obligations industry groups contend that in order to fully fund its contractual obligations hud would need another roughly 2000 million in fy2009 s 3261 as reported by the senate appropriations committee included 6700 million in current year appropriations for the projectbased rental assistance account less than the presidents request more than fy2008 and 1750 million in advance appropriations to become available in fy2010 more than four times the amount requested by the president the senate committee report srept 110415 noted that the increased funding would not be sufficient to fund all contracts for 12 months but would restore some stability to the program by allowing the department to enter into longerterm contracts with owners for an expanded discussion of this issue see crs report rl34504 the department of housing and urban development fy2009 appropriations hope vi new funding each year since fy2003 the president has requested new funding for the hope vi public housing revitalization program in response each year congress has continued to fund the program up until fy2003 the program was generally funded at just under 600 million although in recent years its funding level has generally been around 100 million huds congressional budget justifications criticize the program for slow expenditure of grant funds and also note that phas are able to use their capital fund grants to leverage resources in much the same way hope vi grants are used to leverage additional resources making hope vi less crs21 necessary proponents of hope vi cite the programs transformative effects on severely distressed communities s 3261 as reported by the senate appropriations committee rejects the presidents proposal to eliminate funding and would provide 100 million for hope vi in fy2009 the bill would also extend the statutory authorization for the program through the end of fy2009 it is currently slated to sunset at the end of fy2008 for additional information see crs report rl32236 hope vi public housing revitalization program background funding and issues community development and the community development block grant funding reductions the community development fund cdf account funds the community development block grant cdbg program formula grant to states and localities that funds community development activities in addition the cdf has funded other community developmentrelated programs in past years including the economic development initiatives and neighborhood initiative demonstrations the presidents fy2009 budget recommendation of 2927 million for the formula portion of cdbg is 659 million 184 less than the 3586 million appropriated for distribution to communities and states in fy2008 in addition the presidents fy2009 budget request stated that the administration would seek to reform the cdbg program during the 110th congress by again offering congress proposal that was first unveiled during the 109th congress namely the community development block grant reform act s 3261 as reported by the senate appropriations committee would provide 3586 million for cdbg formula grants more than the presidents request and the same as the fy2008 funding level in addition to requesting reduced funding for cdbg formula grants the administrations fy2009 budget proposed eliminating funding for several other community development related programs including rural housing and economic development grants community development block grant section 108 loan guarantees and brownfields economic development initiatives the budget characterized these programs as duplicative of the activities funded by the cdbg formula grant program the presidents budget also requested new funding for the economic development initiatives edis and neighborhood initiatives nis demonstration programs which congress has used to fund congressionally directed projects in recent years and asked that congress rescind the funding provided to these projects in fy2008 s 3261 as reported by the senate appropriations committee would reject most of the presidents proposals to eliminate funding for community and economic development programs it would fund rural housing and economic development grants section 108 loan guarantees and edi and earmarks however s 3261 would not provide any new funding for the brownfields economic development initiatives program crs22 increased funding for home the home investment partnerships program provides formulabased block grant funding to states units of local government indian tribes and insular areas to fund affordable housing initiatives the presidents fy2009 budget requested 275 million increase in funding for home formula grants huds congressional budget justifications identify the home program as key to the presidents goal of increasing homeownership opportunities especially for minorities they also cite the programs relatively strong rating from the office of management and budgets omb program assessment and rating tool evaluation according to huds congressional budget justifications omb found that the program has clear purpose strong management and can demonstrate results s 3261 as reported by the senate appropriations committee would provide 34 million more for home formula grants than the presidents request housing for the elderly and disabled funding reductions formerly known together as housing for special populations the section 202 housing for the elderly program and the section 811 housing for persons with disabilities program provide capital grants and ongoing project rental assistance contracts prac to developers of new subsidized housing for these populations in fy2009 the administrations budget recommended reducing the overall funding level for the programs that provide housing and services for elderly households defined by hud as those with head of household or spouse age 62 or older the presidents request would cut funding for these programs by nearly 200 million from 735 million in fy2008 to 540 million in fy2009 the presidents budget also proposed to reduce funding for the section 811 housing for persons with disabilities program in fy2009 to 160 million down from 237 million in fy2008 s 3261 as reported by the senate appropriations committee rejected the presidents proposed funding cuts and would provide 765 million for section 202 and 250 million for section 811 federal housing administration fha declining receipts the fha administers variety of mortgage insurance programs that insure lenders against loss from loan defaults by borrowers through fha insurance lenders make loans that otherwise may not be available and enable borrowers to obtain loans for home purchase and home improvement as well as for the purchase repair or construction of apartments hospitals and nursing homes the programs are administered through two program accounts the mutual mortgage insurancecooperative management housing insurance fund account mmicmhi and the general insurancespecial risk insurance fund account gisri the mmicmhi fund provides insurance for home mortgages the gisri fund provides insurance for more risky home mortgages for multifamily rental housing and for an assortment of specialpurpose loans such as hospitals and nursing homes for more information see crs report rs20530 fha loan insurance program an overview crs23 in past years receipts to the mmi fund have exceeded expenses so the mmi fund did not need appropriations for credit subsidy and had excess receipts that were used to offset the cost of the hud budget the fy2009 budget estimates that if programmatic changes are made the mmi fund would need either credit subsidy or increases in insurance premiums to continue operation the budget proposes to permit fha to set insurance premiums based on the risk that the borrowers pose to the insurance fund and it proposes to set the rate at level that would avoid the need for subsidy appropriations barring the authority to establish riskbased premiums the presidents budget proposed that fha would use its existing authority to increase the insurance premiums charged to borrowers the budget assumes that the increased premiums coupled with legislative and programmatic changes would avoid the need for credit subsidy
