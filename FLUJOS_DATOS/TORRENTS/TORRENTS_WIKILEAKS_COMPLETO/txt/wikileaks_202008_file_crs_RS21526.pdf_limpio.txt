employer contributions used to repay loan made from an esop as previously noted esops also serve corporate financial objectives that other employee benefit plan s cannot such as the ability to take out loans from the plan prior to 1981 some corporati ons were leveraging esops by combining them with money purchase pension plan this had the effect of raising the deductible limits on employer contributions from 15 to 25 passage of erta eliminated the need for this strategy in the mid1980s the 1984 tax reform act created new and substantial tax incentives for employers maintaining esops for employees18notably employers were allowed deductions for dividends paid in cash under qualifying esop19also irc 133 was created to permit qualified financial institutions to exclude 50 of the interest on loans to esops20two years later the 1986 tax reform act emphasized the retirement objective of esops by imposing 10 penalty tax on withdrawals made prior to age 595 discouraging premature withdrawals21the year 1988 brought certain technical corrections to the 1986 act articul ating what transacti ons qualify for deferral of recognition of gain clarifying that the nonallocation period

deduction for certain employer securities sales to esops26 the small business job protection act sbjpa of 1996 widened the availab ility of esops by allowing s corporatio n shareholders to participate27s corporations are type of corporation possessing more than 75 shareholders that is accorded tax treatment different than trad itional c corporations28congressional motivation for this provision was to encourage employee wnership of closelyheld businesses29this act also repealed irc 133 eliminating the ab ility of lenders to exclude from their gross income 50 of the interest earned on loan to an esop or to an employer sponsoring an esop30one motivation for repealing the interest exclusion was that the joint committee on taxation estimated that 505 million additiona l tax dollars would be added to revenues for the ensuing five fiscal years31other revenue motivated provisions incorporated in this 1996 act include applying the unrelated business income tax ubit to an esops share of scorporation earnings32 the application of the ubit tax did not last long as it was repealed as part of the taxpayer relief act of 199733congress was concerned about possible double taxation of s corporation esops conceivable since l s corporation income is subject to taxation at the shareholder level in addition to the shortlived ubit tax34to address these concerns the 1997 act allowed s

requirements of esops in 2001 the econo mic growth and tax re lief reconciliation act addressed the congressional concern of i nappropriate tax defe rral opportunities for s corporation esops and instances wher s corporation esops were primarily benefitting only the highly compensated employees36consequently this 2001 act initiated 50 excise tax on prohibited allocations by s corporation esops similarly individuals who own 10 of the shares or deemed part of 20 shareholder group individual and family members together will be considered disqualified person and merit 50 excise tax on any

act of 2002 made certain technical revisions to the 2001 act such as amending provisions for catchup contributions and vesting standards39 conclusion since formal recognition of esops congress has continually examined and modified the tax treatment of esops and adjusted the qualification requirements from initially seeking to recognize new method of retirement savings that businesses had gotten behind today congress strives to balance tax policy objectives the need for corporate support revenue concerns abuse pre vention and longterm fiscal security for employees
