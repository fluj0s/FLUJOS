help all soldiers collect information through tactical questioning and epwdetainee and document handling in offensive defensive stability and support operations however most of the handbook was developed specific to small unit patrols traffic control points tcps roadblocks and other interaction with the local population in the middle east this handbook is not intended to train soldiers as human intelligence collectors or even make the soldier an expert on tactical questioning it is only designed to introduce the basics of questioning and to provide some tools the proponent of this handbook is the us army intelligence center this handbook was quickly developed to try to immediately fill gap in existing documentation on tactical questioning it was developed based on the agreement

not reflect authoritative us army doctrine or ttp every soldier as part of small unit is potential information collector and an essential component to help reach situational understanding every soldier develops special level of situational awareness simply due to exposure to events occurring in the area of operations ao and has the opportunity to collect information by observation and interaction with the population this task is critical because the environment we operate in is characterized by violence uncertainty complexity and asymmetric methods by the threat the increased situational awareness that soldiers develop through personal contact and observation is critical element of the brigades and battalions ability to more fully understand the operational environment the concept that every soldier is an information collector cannot be overstated however you are not an intelligence collector this handbook is not meant to turn you into human intelligence humint collector and will not make you an expert on tactical questioning it is only designed to provide guidance for how to deal with and handle the local population you may come in contact with and to introduce the basics of tactical questioning tactical questioning is critical element of small unit operations you the soldier must maintain high level of situational awareness at all times through tactical questioning handling epwsdetainees and handling captured documents soldiers serve as the commanders eyes and ears whether on patrol manning tcproadblock occupying an observation post for official use only 6 passing thro ugh areas in convoys doing anything that involves observing and reporting elements of the environment and activities in the ao the soldier conducts ta ctical qu

l value traffic trol point tcp army place at which traffic is controlled ei ther by military police or by mechanical means 9for official use only 10chapter 3 tactical questioning of noncombatants note for specific examples see chapter 5 and for tactical questioning smartcard see chapter 9 collecting information information collection can and should occur at any time in an operational environment collection of combat information consists of becoming familiar with the surrounding environment to include the people infrastructure and terrain and recognizing change like police officer walking the beat in neighborhood day after day soldiers at all ranks and echelons must be able to recognize that something has changed and if possible why even if you cannot determine why something changed simply reporting that there has been change may help military intelligence personnel soldiers should train themselves to become constantly aware of conditions such as armed elements location of factional forces minefields and potential threats homes and buildings what is the condition of the roofs doors windows lights power lines water sanitation roads bridges crops and livestock infrastructure the presence of functioning stores service stations etc people numbers sex age residence or displaced persons refugees and evacuees dpre status visible health clothing daily activities and leaders contrast has anything changed if everyone is involved in the collection of combat information then everyone must be aware of the information requirements all soldiers who have contact with the local population routinely travel within the area or frequently attend meetings with local for official use only 11organizations must know the information requirements and their responsibility to observe and report key considerations for talking know the threat level and force protection measures in your ao be knowledgeable of local customs and courtesies be careful of your body language approach people in normal surroundings to avoid suspicion be friendly and polite remove sunglasses when speaking to those people with whom you are trying to create favorable impression know as much about the local culture and few phrases in the local language understand local customs male soldiers speaking to women female soldiers speaking to men etc if security conditions permit position your weapon in the least intimidating position as possible questions using questions is the best way of opening and maintaining conversation you should try to use open questions that cannot be answered yes or an open question is basic question normally beginning with an interrogative who what where when how or why and requires narrative answer they are brief and simply worded to avoid confusion characteristics of open questions are broad in nature result in the individual answering being allowed freedom in answering serve as an invitation to talk encourage discussion allow the individual to talk and the soldier to listen and observe for official use only 12 pose or little threat to the individual allow people to become involved reveal what the person thinks is important create conversational tone be subtle throughout the conversation remember to be sociable yet reserved at all times rattling off series of questions and writing down the responses will not gain the trust of the individual with whom you are speaking maintaining the conversation once conversation is established you can use some common techniques to maintain the conversation avoid use of military jargon especially with civilians be prepared to discuss your personal interests hobbies books travel etc be sensitive to your body language smile as long as it is appropriate avoid sitting with your arms crossed do not show the bottom of your feet keep your hands away from your mouth lean forward and nod make frequent eye contact if culturally appropriate some more tips use the persons name position title rank andor other verbal expressions of respect avoid judging the person by age gender appearance etc keep your body posture relaxed but alert remember persons favorite topic is himself or herself use humor carefully understand and take into account the significance of holidays and religious days or times of the day or week for official use only 13using interpreters the use of interpreters is an integral part of the information collection effort use of an interpreter is time consuming and potentially confusing proper use and control of an interpreter is skill that must be learned and practiced to maximize the potential of collection perhaps the most important guideline to remember is that an interpreter is essentially your mouthpiece he or she says what you say but in different language this sounds simple but for those who have never worked with interpreters problems can quickly develop upon meeting your interpreter it is important that you assess their proficiency in english you need an interpreter with firm grasp of english and the terminology you may encounter the following are several tips on working with an interpreter that should prove useful placement when standing the interpreter should stand just behind you and to the side when sitting the interpreter should sit right beside you but not between you and the individual body language and tone have the interpreter translate your message in the tone you are speaking ensure the interpreter avoids making gestures for official use only 14delivery talk directly to the person with whom you are speaking not the interpreter speak as you would in normal conversation not the third person for example do not say tell him that rather say i understand that you and instruct the interpreter to translate as such speak clearly avoid acronyms or slang and break sentences uniformly to facilitate translation some interpreters will begin to translate while you are still speaking this is frustrating for some people if so discuss the preference of translation with the interpreter the most important principle to obey while using an interpreter is to remember that you control the conversation not the interpreter security work on the premise that the interpreter is being debriefed by threat intelligence service always assume the worst avoid careless talk avoid giving away personal details do not become emotionally involved interpreter checklist for patrolling tell the interpreter exactly what you want translated the interpreter should translate all conversation between you and the individual do not discuss ccirs ffirs pirs or irs with the interpreter brief the interpreter on actions to take in the event of actions at the halt or contact tell the interpreter what you expect of him and how you want him to do it for official use only 15 chapter 4 tactical questioning and ndling of epwsdetainees note for specific examples see chapter 5 and for tactical questioning smartcard see chapter 9 treat all epwsdetainees in accordance with the geneva conventions the five ss the first step in handling epwsdetainees is to implement the 5 ss the 5 ss is common military term usually associated with the handling of epwsdetainees the 5 ss are not just another acronym the term implies the legal obligation that each soldier has to treat an individual in custody of or under the protection of us soldiers humanely search this indicates thorough search of the person for weapons and documents you must search and record their equipment and documents separately record the description of weapons special equipment documents identification cards and personal affects on the capture tag see chapters 8 and 9 for samples of document handling tools silence do not allow them to communicate with one another either verbally or with gestures keep an eye open for potential troublemakers and be prepared to separate them segregate keep civilians and military separate and then further divide them by rank gender and nationality ethnicityreligion safeguard provide security for and protect the epwsdetainees get them out of immediate danger and for official use only 16 if they have it allow them to keep their personal chemical protective gear and identification cards speed information is time sensitive and it is very important to move personnel to the rear as quickly as possible the other thing to consider is resistance grows as time goes on the initial shock of being captured or detained wears off and they begin to think of escape questioning to fill out the capture tag if you are the first us soldier to question the epwdetainee you must complete capture tag as such your ability to gather initial information that facilitates further detailed questioning by personnel is extremely important the acronym jumps gives basis of the types of questions you need to ask this can be used with any person being questioned civ ilian or military you simply modify the questions to fit the situation the tactical force protection smartcard in chapter 9 contains jump screening techniques any additional information provided by the individual that cannot be included on the capture tag must be reported to the unit s2 in salute report format see chapters 6 8 and 9 for examples of the capture tag and salute format j job what is your jobwhat do you do if military also ask what is your rank u unit what is your unitname of the company you work for ask about their chain of commandcommand structure who is your bosssupervisor if civilian ask the name of the business and employer m mission what is your job within your unitcompany what is the mission of your unitcompany what is the mission of your next higher unitelement what missionjob were you performing when you were for official use only 17 captureddetained what is the current mission of your unit what is the future mission of your unit p priority intelligence requirements pirs ask questions based on your small units tasking as briefed before your patroltcproadblocketc which is based on the battalionsbrigades pir ensure you ask the questions during natural conversation so you do not give away your mission or the purpose of why you are asking these questions s supporting information anything that does not fit in the above this is the catch all and initial quality control check examples of supporting information situation person had map on them ask him to explain the map symbols date it was made who made it etc person had photograph of person or area ask him to identify the personlocation and ask why he has the photograph person is carrying identification documents for other persons sex or age does not match etc ask who they are for why do they have them etc for official

example questions the following are basic list of questions that you can modify to ask the local population both noncombatants and epwsdetainees originally these questions were created specific to tcpsroadblocks keep in mind these questions are only examples and you may need to modify them based on the mission unit guidance and the situation what is your name verify this with identification papers etc and check the detainof interestprotect lists what is your home address former residence if dp what is your occupation where were you going get specifics why are you going there get specifics what route did you travel to arrive here what obstacles or hardships did you encounter on your way here what unusual activity did you notice on your way here what route will you take to get to your final destination who do you personally know that actively opposes the us or coalition follow this up with who else if they know of anyone ask what antius coalition activities they know of where they happened etc why do you believe we uscoalition are here what do you think of our uscoalition presence here these questions may seem broad when in fact they are pointed and specific they are form of direct questioning that does not allow the person being questioned lot of room for misinterpretation or the chance to give vague or misleading answer for official use only 23always keep the questions pertinent to your mission and report the answers per unit guidance information of critical tactical value does good if it remains in one place or if it arrives after the battle or the event chapter 10 also contained some dos and donts relating to cultural awareness the donts of questioning tactical questioning of noncombatants dont attempt to force or scare information from noncombatants attempt to task someone to go seek out information pay money or compensate for information seek out the same individuals from the local population for repeated questioning unless approved by your unit s2 chance encounters are fine however routine patterns can be exploited by threat intelligence services or cause you to become target of threat action ask questions of noncombatants in an area where the questioning ask leading questions leading questions are questions that are constructed as to require yes or answer rather than narrative answer leading questions allow the individual to answer with response he or she thinks you want to hear not necessarily the facts for example is group xyz responsible ask negative questions negative questions are questions that contain negative word in the question itself such as didnt you go to the warehouse ask compound questions compound questions consist of two questions asked at the same time for example where were you going after work and who were you to meet there for official use only 24 ask vague questions vague questions do not have enough information for the person to understand exactly what you are asking they may be incomplete general or otherwise nonspecific and create doubt in the sources mind ask questions to that make your units mission or intelligence requirements obvious take notes right away in front of the person after asking the question tactical questioning of epwsdetainees dont give comfort items to epwsdetainees they are not your guests attempt to force or scare information out of them you must comply with the geneva conventions ask only basic questions as outlined in this handbook do move epwsdetainees to detention facility as quickly as possible pay money for information mention that they may be interrogated later or try any other scare tactic you must comply with the geneva conventions inform them of their rights someone else will handle that task for official use only chapter 6 reporting all activity and information is reporte d through your chain of command to your unit s2 the s2 is responsible for transmitting the information to the ap propriate elements like tactica l humi nt team tht the most common report format to accurately d ocument information gathered is the salute re port salute report format is shown be low and for convenience appears also in the s2 smartcard in chapter 9 for tactica l questioning there are two levels of r eporting 25 normal repo rting prepar ed before th battalion s2 section performs the debriefing immediate reporting of information of critica l tactical value based either on predetermined criteria or commo n sense for official use only 26salute report format to unit you are reporting to dtg time report is submitted from your unit report number selfexplanatory 1 size who this applies to both civilians and military describe as civilian or group of civilians co mpanytroopbatterybattalionbrigade etc be specific if the details are available 2 activity what clearly indicate what has transpired and indicate the pir being answered ie iraqi border crossing unusualsuspicious activity which may threaten force protection pending hostilities rallies etc 3 location where give an 8digit grid coordinate whenever possible spell town names followed by 4digit grid of town center mass if civilian gather inform ation such as name of business residence and any other data that will help tac humint team recontact the individual 4 unit who unit designation from lowest to highest echelon known ie 2d platoon hq company 5th lt inf bn 22d lt inf

anning pons on animals ents ates etc s an individual in vulnerable position and in greater proximity to potential threat than under normal circumstances the threat has is and will use many nonstandard combat tactics the following list is an example of only some of those actions for force protection the bottom line is to never drop your guard andto be prepared for the unexpected car bomb near checkpoint civilian asking for medic p guard when his back is turned demonstrations and rallies can using colored flares to notify an ambush site of an incoming vehicle using car horns or attacking

it is further divided into two belief sects sunni and shia both sects adhere to basic islam beliefs the major difference in their ideology is their belief in who should be their spiritual leader the majority sunni believe that there is lineage requirement to be the spiritual leader the shia however believe that only descendents of the original royal line can be the spiritual leader the islamic way of life is very different from our own and must be viewed that way to judge them by american standards would be disservice to them and potential force protection issue for an individual or unit their religion family and honor dominate their customs and beliefs the three are rarely separated an insult to ones family is generally an insult to their honor and subsequently to their religion they are more conservative with their opinions and actions than most americans this is an important element of daily activity and must be remembered when dealing with them they do not deal well with criticism even constructive criticism so keep opinions to oneself the best rule of thumb is that while some thing or action may seem unusual it may be common to an islam person our actions probably appear to be very unusual to them following are few examples of islamic behavior that may seem out of the ordinary to foreigner they will not remove their headdress in public they never eat with or shake hands with their left hand as it is used for toilet hygiene they will rarely if ever say it is sign of disrespect to the person asking and sign of incompetence on their part for official use only 47one significant social difference is the view on women middle east women tend to be subservient to men and never hold managerial positions their opinions are generally ignored and public displays of affection are almost unheard of it is inappropriate to ask an arab about his wife or daughter instead one asks about the family as whole bottom line if one is male do not try to pickup arab women if one is female conduct oneself in nothing but professional manner the average arab male already has loose opinions of western women do what is best to shatter this illusion these are not americans that one will deal with this is country geographic area and religion with rich and long history their customs and traditions may seem strange to westerners just as our customs are strange to
