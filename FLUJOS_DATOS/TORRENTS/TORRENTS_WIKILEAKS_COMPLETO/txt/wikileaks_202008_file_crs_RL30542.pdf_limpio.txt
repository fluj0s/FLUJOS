overtime pay calculation under the fair labor standards act summary for covered employees overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in single week is calculated under the fair labor standards act flsa upon the basis of 1½ times workers regular rate of pay where the worker receives straight cash wage the calculation is relatively simple but compensation may also include noncash benefits such as gifts bona fide profit sharing etc and section 7e of the act explains how such elements are to be treated for regular rate calculation how stock options and related items of value are to be treated may be less clear on february 12 1999 in response to specific inquiry the wage and hour division of the department of labor dispatched an opinion letter explaining that under the circumstances set forth in the inquiry the value of stock options would not be exempt from inclusion in the flsa regular rate calculation the letter was precise and limited to single case but it provoked concerns in the employer community would the denial of exemption apply more broadly and if so might employers be subject to suit for back wages earned through overtime work the issue was taken up by the labor policy association lpa an industry oriented interest group based in washington dc there followed series of conferences and exchanges of letters and ultimately hearing before the house subcommittee on workforce protections march 2 2000 after negotiations between the interested parties legislation was introduced both in the house and senate on march 29 hr 4109 ballenger and s 2323 mcconnell on april

the treatment of stock options for regular rate calculations if the treatment of stock options and related instruments for regular rate purposes is not clarified industry spokesmen have indicated the granting of such options to hourlypaid workers is likely to cease or at least to be severely diminished the exemption created under the pending legislation would remove one impediment to the

labor standards act of 1938 flsa as amended is the basic federal statute dealing with minimum wages overtime pay and related issues it requires that covered workers employed for more than 40 hours in single week be paid at rate of 1½ times their regular rate of pay since not all compensation is in cash exceptions are made in the statute under section 7e for various types of noncash benefits ie gifts bona fide profit sharing plans bona fide thrift or savings plans etc that need not be included in the regular rate calculation how stock options and related noncash compensation are to be treated for regular rate purposes may not be entirely clear in early 1999 the department of labor dol issued an opinion letter suggesting that stock options might under certain circumstances be included as part of the regular rate calculation1 by implication the opinion letter also raised the specter of potential retroactive liability for employers who had made stock options available to their employees the result was measure of concern among employers and call for clarification on march 2 2000 the house subcommittee on workforce protections conducted hearing on the general issue of stock options and overtime pay calculation subsequently on march 29 senator mitch mcconnell rky introduced legislation to amend the flsa to provide clearer definition of regular rate where stock

proposed stock option plan does not qualify for any of the exclusions from the regular rate as defined in section 7e1 of the flsa3 the advisory letter then responded to questions concerning stock option plans and the regular rate ie questions dealing with calculation of value terms of the option when it must be exercised etc and the letter closed by noting that this opinion is based exclusively on the facts and circumstances set forth in the inquiry existence of any other factual or historical background not contained in your request might require different conclusion than the one expressed herein4 industry reaction when the opinion letter of february 12 came to the attention of the labor policy association lpa an industryoriented interest group based in washington dc it provoked various concerns following consultation with member firms lpa president jeffrey mcguiness wrote to secretary of labor alexis herman asserting that this new dol policy will make it very difficult for companies to offer stock options to nonexempt employees that is those employees not exempt from the overtime pay provisions of the flsa mcguiness stated the problem as follows under the ruling employers must undertake an excessively complicated series of calculations to pay overtime on the profit earned by the hourly employees for example if company were to give options to 10000 nonexempt employees all of whom worked some overtime the company would have to do the following determine the exercise date for each share of stock exercised by each employee determine the profit each employee made on the stock as of the exercise date determine the overtime hours worked by each employee during the weeks the employee held the options calculate the additional overtime owed to each employee and cut check for the additional overtime because employees can exercise options at any time during the life of the program many of which allow employees to hold options for up to ten years the overtime calculations will become excessively cumbersome5 some days later representative william c goodling rpa chairman of the committee on education and the workforce wrote to secretary herman

that following that policy could subject employers to unanticipated overtime expense s7 unless the ambiguities raised by the opinion letter were clarified it was suggested employers would likely cease offering their hourlypaid employees stock options dol responded that it had not ruled that stock option plans must always be reflected in overtime payments nor affirmed wage and hour administrator t michael kerr have we ruled that stock option plans cannot be structured to meet the requirements of section 7e of the act 8 at that point dol sought to develop better understanding of how the law does or should apply to the broad variety of stock option plans and undertook extensive discussions with broad range of groups to identify the factors relevant to whether stock option plan should or should not be included in the regular rate9 meanwhile interest groups similarly began to organize the employment policy foundation educational arm of the lpa suggested that the dol position on stock options could penalize millions of workers10 the coalition to promote employee stock ownership organized in january 2000 in response to the dol opinion letter urged congress to develop legislation that allows

presented several industry spokespersons were among the witnesses randall macdonald vice president of gte and member of the board of directors of the lpa outlined how stock option plans work and pointed to certain legal liabilities in the wake of the opinion letter even if the department of labor decides not to enforce the policy outlines in the advisory opinion the fair labor standards act provides private right of action courts often view advisory opinion letters as indicative of how the wage and hour division which is the expert agency with regard to federal wage and hour matters interprets the law and the regulations it enforces consequently courts could still consider the letter as primary guidance in interpreting the flsa this means that employers who have tried to narrow the gap and give similar benefits to exempt and nonexempt employees could find themselves the subject of huge class action lawsuits based on this policy13 under questioning by the subcommittee administrator kerr acknowledged the need to resolve the current conflict promptly and expressed willingness to cooperate with the subcommittee in developing an appropriate amendment to the flsa14

human services and education and as recounted in the daily labor report restating her commitment to resolving the matter in way that is advantageous to american workers16 week later on march 29 secretary herman joined with bipartisan group of house and senate members to announce introduction of corrective legislation s 2323 mcconnell and hr 4109 ballenger the daily labor report noted that the legislation the worker economic opportunity act appears to be on fast track it added introduction of the measure was greeted with great fanfare particularly from groups representing high tech employers such as those in the information technology sector that increasingly are relying on stock options to attract and retain employees17 the senate would act first bypassing the hearings process s 2323 was called up for floor consideration on april 12 senator mcconnell opened discussion of the bill by declaring that everybody wins with this proposal he pointed to our 1930s vintage labor laws and stated it would be travesty for us to let old laws steal this chance for the average employee to share in his or her companys economic growth he urged passage of the legislation so that our new deal labor laws will not strangle the benefits our new economy offers to american workers senator mcconnell placed in the record an endorsement from the us chamber of commerce for s 2323 and noted this legislation includes broad safe harbor that specifies that employers have liability because of any stock options or similar programs that they have given to employees in the past18 various senators spoke in support of the legislation none in opposition and questions critical of the proposal were raised senator christopher dodd dct advised that the clintongore administration is strong backer of the legislation senator james jeffords rvt pointed out that stock option programs aid employers as key tool for employee recruitment motivation and retention senator mike enzi rwy envisioned secretaries factory workers janitors mailroom clerks everybody with stock options and argued that the line is dimming on who is the employer and who is the employee senator edward kennedy dma spoke in support of the flsa noting the fundamental role it has played in ensuring fairer standard of living for all american workers and he warned congress to ensure that any changes in this important law do not undermine the wage and hour protections guaranteed to workers under the act he would support s 2323 he said because it helps ensure that employers cannot misuse the act as an excuse to exclude

the amendments set forth in the legislation finally the entire package of amendments will become effective 90 days after the date of enactment comment from the hearing of the subcommittee on workforce protections and from statemen ts of proponents of the legislation it seems clear that in the wake of the dol opinion letter of february 12 1999 clarification was deemed necessary whether clarification could be achieved through the rulemaking process with greater flexibility than through legislation may be less clear nor is it clear that the pending legislative approach is necessarily the only possible option the labor department endorsed narrow targeted legislative fix confined to the particular issue raised in the opinion letter observed the daily labor report while business groups pushed for broad flsa exemption that would recognize that stock ownership programs are fashioned in numerous different ways26 but both the department and the authors of the pending legislation appear to have opted for legislation the immediate issue of the pending legislation is not whether or not employers should institute stock option programs for their employees or whether such initiatives are wise public policy the legislation would merely clarify the treatment of stock options for regular rate purposes under the flsa however in the absence of such clarification industry witnesses have argued that such stock option programs would likely be curtailed with adoption of the legislation an institutional impediment to these programs is removed
