pending cases by jeanne j grimmettmeasure whether violative of the gatt or not has caused it trade injury because the gatt does not set out dispute procedure with great specificity gatt parties over time developed more deta iled process including ad hoc pa nels and other practices the procedure was perceived to have certain deficiencies however among them lack of deadlines the use of consensus decisionma king thus allowing party to block the establishment of panels and adoption of panel reports and laxity in surveillance and implementation of dispute settlement results congress made reform of the gatt dispute process principal us goal in the ur uguay round of multilatera l trade negotiations wto dispute settlem ent understanding the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of dis putes dsu negotiated during the uruguay round and effective as of january 1 1995 tinues past gatt disput practice but also contains features aimed at strengthening the prior system1 dispute settlement body dsb consisting of representatives of all wto members administers dispute proceedings while the dsb ordinarily opera tes by consensus ie without objection the dsu reverses past consensu s practice at fundamental stages of the process thus unless it decides by consensus not to do so the dsb will estab lish panels adopt panel and appellate reports and where wto rulings have not been implemented and if so requested by prevailing party authorize the party to impose retaliatory measure the dsu also sets forth deadlines for various stages of the proceedings nd improves multilateral monitoring of the implementation of adopted rulings given that panel reports would otherwise be adopted automati cally wto members have righ t to appeal panel report on legal issues the dsu creates standing appellate body to carry out this added appellate function the body has seven members three of whom serve on any one case the dsu provides for integrat ed dispute settlement under wh ich the same rules apply to disputes under virtually all wto agreements unless an agreement provides otherwise if dispute reaches the reta liatory stage member may under certain circumstances impose countermeasure in s ector or under an agreement other than the one at issue the preferred outcome of the dispute mechanism is solution mutually acceptable to the parties and consistent with the covered agreements absent this the primary objective of the process is withdrawal of violative m easure with compensation and retaliation being avenues of last resort to date 373 complaints have been filed under the dsu slightly more than half involve the united states as complaining party or defendant the united states trade representative ustr repres ents the united states in wto disputes the dsu was scrutinized by wto memb ers under uruguay round declaration which called for completion of review within four years after the wto agreement entered into force ie by january 1999 mbers did not agree on any revisions in the initial review and have continued to negotiate on dispute settlement issues during the doha round doing so on separate track pe rmitting an agreement to be adopted

which the request appears as an agenda item unless it decides by consensus not to do so the panel is generally composed of three persons the secretariat proposes the names of panelists to the

where there is disagreement as to whether member has complied complia nce panel may be convened art 215 compensation and suspension of concessions art 22 if the defending party fails to comply with the wto decision within the established period the prevailing party may request that the defending party negotiate compensation agreement if agreement is not reached within 20 days afte r the compliance deadline expires or where negotiations have not been requested the prevailing party may request authorization from the dsb to retaliate the dsb is to grant any such request within 30 days after the compliance deadline expires unless it decides by consensus not to do so or the defending member requests that the reta liation proposal be arbitrated most often on the ground that it exceeds the level of trade injury in the dispute arbitration is to be completed within 60 days after the compliance period ends once decision is issued the prevailing party may request that the dsb approve its proposal subject to any modification by the arbitrator if imposed retaliation may remain in effect only until the offending measure is removed or the disputing parties ot herwise resolve the dispute art 228 resort to the multilateral system art 23 article 23 of the dsu requires wto members to use dsu procedures in dis putes involving wto ag reements and to act in accord with the dsu ie not unilaterally when determining if member has violated wto agreement determining period for compliance and taking any retaliatory action compliance issues although many wto rulings have been satisfactorily implemented difficult cases have tested dsu implementation articles highlighting deficiencies in the system and prompting ggestions for reform for example gaps in the dsu have resulted in the problem of s equencing which first manifested itself in 19981999 during the compliance phase of the ccessful us challenge of the european unions banana import regime article 22 allows prevailing party to request authorization to retaliate w ithin 30 days after complian ce period ends while article 215 provides that disagreements over the existence or adequacy of compliance measures are to be decided using wto dispute procedures including panels compliance panels report is due within 90 days after the dispute is referred to it and ma be appealed the dsu does not integrate an article 215 proce dure into the 30day article 22 deadline nor does it expressly state how compliance is to be determined so that prevailing party may pursue action under article 22 absent the adoption of multilatera l rules on the matter disputing parties have entered into ad hoc procedural ag reements in individual disputeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20088crs5 5 panel report united states continued

terminated in the event defending member believes that it has complied in case an issue that is currently the subject of dispute brought by the european communities ec against the united states and canada for continuing to maintain increased tariffs on ec goods first imposed in 1999 in retaliation for the ecs failure to comply with the adverse wto ruling on the eus ban on hormonetreated beef claimin g that 2003 eu directive rendered it wto compliant the ec argued that the defendants are violating the gatt mostfavorednation article the gatt prohibition on tariff surcha rges and various dsu provisions including article 23 precl uding unilateral actions in trade disputes and article 228 permitting sanctions to be imposed only until wtoinconsistent measures have been removed in report issued march 31 2008 the wto panel f ound that the ec is maintaining bans on certain hormones without suffi cient scientific basis in vi olation of wto obligations and that the united states and canada breached article 23 by 1 not initiating wto proceeding to resolve the ec compliance issue and 2 determining unilaterally that the ec was still in violation it also found how ever that the two members had not violated article 2285 the panel appeared to call on the united states and canada to comply with their dsu obligations by initiating complia nce panel proceeding against the ec and stated that it had performed functions similar to those of compliance panel only to make its article 228 finding the disputants have until the end of may 2008 to appeal wto dispute settlement and us law the adoption by the wto dispute settlement body of panel or appellate report finding that us measure violates wto agreement does not give the report direct legal effect in this country thus federal law would not be affected until congress or the executive branch as the case may be changed the law or administrative measure at issue6 procedures for executive branch compliance with adverse decisions are set out in 123 and 129 of the uruguay round agreements act pl 103465 only the federal governme nt may bring suit against state or locality to declare law invalid because of inconsistency with wto agreement private remedies based on wto obligations are also precluded pl 103465 102bc sections 301310 of the trade act of 1974 section 301 19 usc 2411 et seq provide means for private parties to petition the ustr to take action regarding harmful foreign trade practices if the ustr deci des to initiate an investigation whether by petition or on its own motion regarding an llegedly wtoinconsiste nt measure he or she must invoke the wto dispute process to seek resolution of the problem section 301 authorizes the ustr to impose retaliatory measures to remedy an uncorrected foreign practice some of which may involve suspe nding wto obligation eg imposing tariffhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20088crs6 increase in excess of negotia ted rates the ustr may terminate section 301 case if the dispute is settled but under 306 of the act must monitor foreign compliance and may take further retaliatory action if complian ce measures are unsatisfactory carousel provision added to 306 in 2000 directs the ustr periodically to revise the list of imports subject to retaliation unless the ustr finds that implementation of wto obligations is imminent or the ustr and the petitioner agree that revision is unnecessary as noted earlier article 23 of the dsu precludes certain unilateral actions in trade disputes involving wto agreements sec tion 301 may generally be used consistently with the dsu though some us trading partne rs have complained that the statute allows unilateral action and forces negotiations th rough its threat of sanctions the ec challenged the wtolegality of section 301 in 1998 the dispute panel finding that the language of 304 which requires the ustr to determine the legality of foreign practice by given date is prima facie inconsistent with article 23 because in some cases it mandates ustr determination and statutorily reserves right for the ustr to determine that practice is wtoinconsistent before dsu procedures are completed the panel also found however that the serious threat of violative determinations and consequently the prima facie inconsistency was removed b ecause of us undertakings as set forth in the uruguay round statem ent of administrativ action hdoc 103316 and made before the panel th at the ustr would use its st atutory discretion to implement section 301 in conformity with wto obligations moreover the panel could not find that the dsu was violated by 306 which direct s ustr to make determination as to imposing retaliatory measures by given da given differing g ood faith interpretations of the sequencing ambiguities in the dsu
