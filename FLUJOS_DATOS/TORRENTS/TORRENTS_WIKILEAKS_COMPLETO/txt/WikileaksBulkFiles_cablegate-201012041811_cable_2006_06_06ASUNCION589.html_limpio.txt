10 2 u summary the usd 155k that post received in fy2004 has played an important role in helping paraguay combat its tip problem particularly in the areas of prevention and protection however post anticipates these funds running out by the end of 2006 working closely with us experts and gop officials we have identified concrete requirements to strengthen paraguays ability to combat trafficking in the coming year as part of bilateral assistance project between the embassy of the united states in asuncion and the government of paraguay gop the usg conducted study of paraguays system of immigration and border controls between july 23 through august 5 2005 with view to offering recommendations to the gop that would assist it in combating the problem of trafficking in persons tip by improving border controls team of department of homeland security dhs officials led the assessment the dhs team included agents from immigration and customs enforcement ice and customs and border protection cbp post requests an allocation of usd 310000 in fy2006 inl funds consistent with the dhs teams recommendations and consultation with gop officials to continue assisting the gop in combating tip end summary the assessment 3 u paraguay is source country for trafficked women and children many of whom are smuggled across paraguays borders into the neighboring countries of brazil and argentina paraguays department of immigration is aware of the tip problem and acknowledges the gop must improve its border controls in order to prevent traffickers from transporting victims across its borders 4 u during the assessment the team spoke with several ministry and secretariat officials in asuncion including the ministries of foreign affairs customs and interior immigration department the secretariats of women repatriations and children and adolescents they also spoke to the interamerican development bank and nongovernmental organizations ngos such as grupo luna nueva local recovery center for victims the team visited several land border inspection stations including ciudad encarnacion pedro juan caballero and puerto falcon they also inspected the silvio pettirossi international airport in asuncion more money fewer problems 5 u the assessment report has been reviewed by all the stakeholders within amembassy asuncion and was translated into spanish and provided to our gop counterparts the next phase of this project is to take action on the recommendations made by the team 6 u in order to build on advances made by the gop post has identified several areas that will assist the gop better in its efforts to combat tip our focus in the coming year is to expand training for officials investigators prosecutors and judges assist the gop to expand rehabilitation center services in government run shelters enhance border controls and establish and maintain victim database to provide better services to the victims of tip and prosecute perpetrators however the gop will require outside funds to meet essential program requirements prevention 7u prevention represents the weakest link in gop efforts to combat trafficking the gop has taken some positive steps that we have supported information pamphlets and radio spots along with hotline but funding and prevention programs remain weak post recommends continued funding support for the ministry of womens affairs outreach programs to prevent trafficking as well as the following the dhs team recommends holding an annual border control symposium in asuncion with the participation of all border control agencies symposium will provide the opportunity for agency administrators to clearly communicate the mission of the individual border control agencies establish national strategy as well as coordinate unified border enforcement effort in addition this symposium would address the concerns heard by the dhs officers of many border control front line officials regarding concern relating to disconnect between asuncion and frontline border crossing offices post would fund the first border patrol symposium the dhs team recommends that supervisory level us customs and border protection officer be detailed to paraguay for 3060 day period to provide advisory assistance at the various ports of entry to assist paraguayan officials in implementing administrative and procedural changes the team feels that paraguayan border control officials are capable of performing their duties but lack the proper training and guidance shortterm advisor could assist in teaching them to conduct interviews searches observation techniques etc the dhs team recommends that selected paraguayan officials with direct supervisory responsibilities at paraguayan ports of entry be given the opportunity to travel to the us and observe firsthand us border management techniques and functions at specific us ports of entry protection 8 u the gop has made some strides in providing support and protection to victims but resources are few the ministry of repatriations seeks corporate funds to repatriate victims because the gop cannot support adequately the ministries operations in addition the ministry of womens affairs has ambitious plans to establish shelter to provide victims place to reside while in asuncion once they are repatriated again the lack of gop resources has prevented the ministry from establishing 50 bed facility at this time catholic monastry is providing beds to the ministry of womens affairs usually the victims remain in asuncion for approximately 2 or 3 months while they are receiving legal medical psychological and rehabilitative services once the women leave asuncion there is followup or support program to assist victims in returning to their home town last year post provided funds to assist the womens ministry in creating rehabilitation center that provides trafficked women with services including psychological and job counseling post recommends identifying funds to support the establishment of more permanent shelter to protect victims and assist them in making the transition to stability as well as efforts to expand gop support for victims in the interior of the country
