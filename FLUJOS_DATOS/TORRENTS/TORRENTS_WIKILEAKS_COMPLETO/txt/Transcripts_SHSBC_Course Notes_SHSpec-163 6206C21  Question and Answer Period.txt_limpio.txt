6206c21 shspec163 question and answer period professional auditor is harder to put into session than raw meat pc he knows more and is more critical not in bad sense actually the raw meat pc is just as critical but he wont say so if professional auditor is almost impossible to get into session he has been audited with ruds out professional can be audited to outofsessionness faster than anyone else because he knows when something is being done wrong you can pick up and fish out pc cognitions by tone of voice or some irrelevant remark by the pc which is an appreciation of something it is not vital to do this in fact you probably shouldnt even do it it can boomerang an irrelevant remark would be when the pc is sailing along and you suddenly say wow that needle fell half dial this distracts the pc but if you can appreciate what thy pc is doing he feels more acknowledged its tr2 trick if the pc starts crying and you go in with hard boiled or crisp nononsense tone of voice the pc feels unacknowledged he needs to have certain feeling that the auditor is with him this is why you will sometimes hear lrh sounding bit sympathetic your voice should reflect some comprehension of the mood of the pc so that he will feel that you are with him dont fail to respond to what the pc is doing hut dont let the pc put you at effect either there is fine line between the two when in doubt keep it simple and by the book people have trouble with tr4 because they dont understand what the pc is saying lrh is perfectly willing to be at the effect of the pc to the degree of properly acknowledging the pc but further thus when you acknowledge the pc by responding to him he knows that he is having an effect on you and he will stop trying to produce an effect you can make mistake on this you can intend to show agreement and the pc can take it as derogatory if he is so inclined simple acknowledgement avoids this situation it is just when you know your tools and know what is happening so well that now an top of it you are free to be appreciative if the pc should get upset and start blathering entheta lrh would tend to ignore it he would not even tr4 it he would just give the next command the above degree of relaxation only extends to tr2 not to entering chitchat into the session to the degree that you dont use 2wc in model session you will succeed better 2wc slows down the progress of the session when used in model session or any part of ruds if the pc is all jumped up at the beginning of session you could instead of letting the session handle it say what has gotten into you as part of your rfactor that way you would get him talking to you at least then start the session and put some order into his confusion some pcs waste session time with conversation you need to establish control with good solid acknowledgement pcs will try to take session control away from you on ruds question if the pc says and the meter says yes you should acknowledge the meter where the pc and meter disagree forget the pc and trust the meter dont worry about this making the pc wrong because hell hes wrong anyhow there is trick in this you are not contradicting him when you say that reads just pay attention to the pcs yes or in ruds only answer the meter and you will never give the pc the feeling that you are countering what he has just said if pc were to ask lrh have you run cchs on the instructors too he would say thank you for asking we will now go into end ruds get them in give the pc break and do beginning rudiments this would be terrible symptom of outofsessionness the pc is not interested in his own case if the pc gives you an irrelevant question acknowledge it and handle it but realize that it shows something is out midruds at least so get him in session if he is in session and asks question it is generally fine to answer it if you did something wrong never think that you will lose session control by admitting it you actually only lose control by demanding to be right it is not unusual for the pcs havingness to be up at session start but down by the end of session though this doesnt always happen this is symptom of rough auditing unconfidence arc breaks and low havingness are interchangeable havingness goes down in the presence of arc breaks when havingness is up arc breaks disappear if the auditing is at all rough you will get dwindling of havingness confidence in the auditor is proportional to smoothness of the auditing you want to be predictable to the pc early in pcs auditing he tends to be more critical of his auditor than he will be later this is symptomatic of nervous pc who has been roughly handled in life and earlier auditing as your pc continues to be wellhandled in auditing this factor drops out and the pcs havingness will stay up also as the auditor improves his skill the pcs havingness will stay up the auditors tone of voice is not important it is irrelevant remarks that matter you can make remark without saying anything for instance you may have surprised tone at seeing clean needle that is bad thing to do it all comes under the heading of putting the pcs attention on the auditor instead of on his bank sounding robotic will do the same thing sudden yank of the pcs attention off the bank onto the auditor environment or meter will cause those masses that the pc has been holding away from him to hit him in the face you will have devil of time digging him out you can yank the pcs attention by getting the pc absorbed in question 1 and then before he answers asking him question no2 it is an irrelevant action you should neither inform the pc about the meter when he doesnt want to be so informed nor withhold information when he wants the information the question will come up do you ever use middle rudiments while doing beginning or end rudiments there are situations where it might happen but if the auditor has the pc well under control it shouldnt have to come up it is great relief to pc who has had q and prone auditors to get an auditor who just smoothly carries on when he the pc arc breaks and screams and spatters he finds that he can trust the auditor to audit him predictability alone will hold someone in session regardless of what other actions you take on the other hand any unusual solution you adopt makes auditing seem unpredictable and becomes curse to you predictability breeds pc confidence and relaxation and it makes him able to go into session when you add the powerful buttons of the beginning middle and end ruds you can really get somewhere strive for predictability the more nervous they are the more dispersed they are the more predictable and steady you should be
