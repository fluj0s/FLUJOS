solominayandexru xflowed dear all i would like to respond to some of the items in the attached text on issues etc in particular to the statement in the section 311 sections 3 drivers of required change in the future there is now greater demand for higher level of policy relevance in the work of ipcc which could provide policymakers robust scientific basis for action 1 while it is true that vast majority of the public and the policymakers have accepted the reality of human influence on climate change in fact many of us were arguing for stronger language with higher level of confidence at the last meetings of the how confident are we about the projected regional climate changes i would like to submit that the current climate models have such large errors in simulating the statistics of regional climate that we are not ready to provide policymakers robust scientific basis for action at regional scale i am not referring to mitigation i am strictly referring to science based adaptation for example we can not advise the policymakers about rebuilding the city of new orleans or more generally about the habitability of the gulfcoast using climate models which have serious deficiencies in simulating the strength frequency and tracks of hurricanes we will serve society better by enhancing our efforts on improving our models so that they can simulate the statistics of regional climate fluctuations for example tropical monsoon depressions easterly waves hurricanes typhoons maddenjulian oscillations and extratropical storms blocking systems in the atmosphere tropical instability waves energetic eddies upwelling zones in the oceans floods and droughts on the land and various manifestations enso monsoons decadal variations etc of the coupled oceanlandatmosphere processes it is inconceivable that policymakers will be willing to make billionand trilliondollar decisions for adaptation to the projected regional climate change based on models that do not even describe and simulate the processes that are the building blocks of climate variability of course even hypothetical perfect model does not guarantee accurate prediction of the future regional climate but at the very least our suggestion for action will be based on the best possible science it is urgently required that the climate modeling community arrive at consensus on the required accuracy of the climate models to meet the greater demand for higher level of policy relevance 2 is model democracy valid scientific method the i in the ipcc desires that all models submitted by all governments be considered equally probable this should be thoroughly discussed because it may have serious implications for regional adaptation strategies ar4 has shown that model fidelity and model sensitivity are related the models used for ipcc assessments should be evaluated using consensus metric 3 does dynamical downscaling for regional climate change provide robust scientific basis for action is there consensus in the climate modeling community on the validity of regional climate prediction by dynamical downscaling large number of dynamical downscaling efforts are underway worldwide this is not necessarily because it is meaningful to do it but simply because it is possible to do it it is not without precedent that quite deficient climate models are used by large communities simply because it is convenient to use them it is selfevident that if coarse resolution ipcc model does not correctly capture the largescale mean and transient response highresolution regional model forced by the lateral boundary conditions from the coarse model can not improve the response considering the important role of multiscale interactions and feedbacks in the climate system it is essential that the ipccclass global models themselves be run at sufficiently high resolution regards shukla ipccsec wrote dear clas please find attached letter and issues related to the future of the ipcc with kind regards annie
