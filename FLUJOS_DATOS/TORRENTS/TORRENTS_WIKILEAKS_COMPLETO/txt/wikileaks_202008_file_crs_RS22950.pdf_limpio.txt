are governmentsponsored enterprises gsesshareholderowned corporations with government chartersthat play central role in mortgage finance they buy home mortgages from the original lenders repackage them as mortgagebacked securities mbss and either sell them or hold them in their own investment portfolios in 2008 fannie and freddie have purchased about 80 of all new home mortgages in the united states their combined investment portfolios held mortgage assets loans and mbss valued at 15 trillion as of june 30 2008 over the years the gses have provided strong support to the housing market when bank or other lender sells mortgage loan to the gses it receives cash to make new loans and avoids the risks of holding longterm asset without this secondary or resale market in which private firms participate as well as the gses lenders would have to keep loans on their own books and mortgage credit would become more expensive and difficult to obtain the turmoil in housing and credit markets that began in 2007 has put extreme financial pressure on the gses the value of their mortgage assets has fallen but the debt they took on to purchase those assets remains to maintain positive net worth in the face of falling asset values financial firms have several options to raise capital but none of these were readily available to fannie or freddie if they sold assets they would depre ss the prices of mortgage loans and mbss still further worsening both their own balance sheet problems and those of many other financial firms they cannot use retained earnings to bolster capital because their operations have not turned profit since 2006 finally rapidly falling share prices made it difficult to impossible to raise capital by selling new equity or common stock if fannie and freddie were purely private firms rather than gses some observers assert that they would have failed by mid2008 1 gse status however has enabled them to continue to fund their operations by selling debt securities because the market has long believed that fannie and freddie debt was implicitly guaranteed by the government even though by law gse obligations are not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states in july 2008 however the firms share prices plunged sharply2 and the possibility emerged that market participants might refuse to extend credit to fannie and freddie under any terms this kind of nonbank run destroyed the investment bank bear stear ns in march 2008 since then every auction of new fannie or freddie debt normally routine ev ent has been followed closely by the press and the markets even though fannie and freddie maintained access to the debt markets albeit at higherthan usual interest rates their inability to raise new capital cast doubts on their longterm viability if their interest costs continued to rise and the value of and their income from mortgage assets kept falling they were doomed to fail against this backdrop the federal regulator concluded that 1 see eg too political to fail wall street journal apr 21 2008 p a16 the gses arent held to the same standards of accountability as everyone else in american business 2 in july 2007 both fannie and freddie shares traded above 60 between july 8 and 15 2008 fannie mae shares fell by 60 from 1751 to 702 freddie mac shares fell from 1346 to 526 losing 61 of their value on july 15 the securities and exchange commission issued an emergency order restricting short selling in the two gses shares httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22950g8g138g151g151g146g142g561g15 g138g142g561g138g151g141

housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 enacted july 30 2008 provides the authority for the governments takeover of the gses the act created new gse regulator the federal housing finance agency fhfa with the authority to take control of either gse to restore it to sound financial cond ition the new law sets out process for placing financially troubled gse in conservatorship or receivership this process is generally similar to the federal bank regulators handling of insolven t depository institutions but the fhfa is not bound by the bank regulators mandate that failing institutions be resolved at the lowest possible cost section 1117 of the act gives the treasury emergency authority expiring on december 31 2009 to purchase an unlimited amount of gse debt or equity securities if necessary to provide stability to the financial markets prevent disruptions in the availability of mortgage finance and protect the taxpayer on september 7 2008 the fhfa established conservatorship for fannie and freddie 4 as conservator the fhfa has taken over the assets and assumed all the powers of the shareholders directors and officers it may take any necessary action to restore the firms to sound and solvent condition stockholders voting rights are suspended during the conservatorship and both firms ceos have been replaced dividends on common and preferred stock have been suspended although the shares continue to trade gse business operations will continue as before the conservator will delegate authority to the companies new management to move forward the conservatorship will end when the fhfa finds that safe and solvent condition has been restored key element of the plan calls for the government to provide financing to fannie and freddie 5 there are three funding mechanisms senior preferred stock purchase agreement treasury will buy preferred stock as needed to ensure that each gse maintains positive net worth the capacity of the agreement is set at 100 billion for each gse in return the government has received warrants to buy up to 799 of gse common stock for 000001 per share this means that if the gses emerge from conservatorship as stock corporations the government will be the majority owner and will have the option of selling its shares at profit according to the treasury holders of senior debt subordinated debt and mbss issued or guaranteed by the gses are protected by the agreement 6 3 federal housing finance agency statement of fhfa director james b lockhart press release sep 7 2008 p 5 4 see federal housing finance agency

the firms obligations to debt holders exposes the government to potentially large financial risk debt issued or guaranteed by the gses totals more than 5 trillion the ultimate value of the firms assets is uncertain and the treasuryby stating that it will maintain positive net worth in each gsehas in effect agreed to cover all losses to the gses combined 15 trillion portfolios during the current crisis international commercial and investment banks have reported losses or write downs of asset values totaling over 500 billion 8 much of this stems from markingto market or revaluing mbss at estimated current market prices which are often sharply below face value by comparison fannie and freddies write downs have been modest from the second quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2008 fannie reported 53 billion in credit losses while freddie reported 22 billion 9 the contrast between the private banks write downs25 individual institutions have reported losses on much smaller holdings of mortgage related assets exceeding fannies 53 billion10and those of the gses may suggest that fannie and freddies portfolios contain substantial unrecognized losses as any such losses are recognized and any remaining capital is exhausted treasury will have to commit new capital by purchasing preferred stock to prevent the firms net worth from falling below zero continued 1131 sep 11

g346g561the risks of not acting however clearly appeared intolerable to the government failure or default by fannie or freddie would have severely disrupted financial markets around the world if the gse portfolios of mortgage loans and mbss had to be liquidated prices would plunge the secondary market for mortgages would be deci mated and the supply of new mortgage credit might be severely restricted these market disruptions would have negative impacts on the economy as whole postponing intervention in the hopes that the mortgage market would right itself and return the gses to financial health carried the risk of raising the ultimate cost to the taxpayers had the financial deterioration continued much of the current stress in housing and credit markets is based on uncertainty about the true values of mortgagerelated financial instruments and of course of houses themselves as long as further declines are considered likely market participants will be uncertain about each others financial condition and lending markets will remain tight by intervening and in effect stating that it will bear any further losses to the gses which hold significant share of all home mortgage assets the treasury hopes to reduce that uncertainty and create conditions under which markets can return to normal if housing and financial market stability returns soon the intervention may actually earn profit for the treasury as part of the funding agreement treasury will acquire preferred stock paying 10 annual dividend and also has the option to acquire 799 of the firms common stock for nominal price if however housing values continue to fall for an extended period the taxpayer may be required to make good on substantial losses to fannies and freddies
