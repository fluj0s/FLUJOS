administrations request includes funding to complete design of 22 proposed projects while deferring work on all other design efforts pl 108137 provided less than th requested amount for seven of the eight priority projects the final legislation spread the constructi on appropriations across broader set of construction activities than the presidents request the presidents request would have provided funds for studies and environmental infrastruct ure projects in the following nontraditional mission areas wastewater treatment irrigation wa ter supply and municipal and industrial water supply treatment and di stribution by not seeking funding for these activities the administration was reinforcing its intere st in focusing available federal funding on navigation flood control storm dama ge reduction and ecosystem restoration projects the final legislation provi ded funding for seve ral environmental infrastructure projects the administrations 70 million request for the flood control and coastal emergencies account was significantly hi gher than the fy2003 appropriation of 15 million and the fy2003 request for 20 million the actual expenditure for activities under this account in previous years has averaged 70 million with much of the funding being provided through supplementa l appropriations this account finances response and recovery activities for flood nd storm events preparedness for these events and the corps support of the federal emergency management agency fema through the federal response pl an because this is an emergency management program annual costs vary significantly based on actual events andor changing missions pl 108137 contained funding for this account the conference report language hrept 108357 cited the recent replenishment of the depleted account with 60 million through pl 10883 as the reason the conference report also directed the secretary of the army to consider changes to the management of the account and to report to the appropriations committees of the house and senate within 180 days of enactment key policy issues corps of engineers funding level funding for the corps civil works program has often been contentious issue between the administration and congress with final appropriations typically provi ding more funding than re quested regardless of which political party controls the white hous and congress for fy2001 for example congress added 480 million 12 to the 408 b illion requested by the clinton administration similarly the fy2002 hous bill funded the corps at almost 15 more than requested by the bush admin istration and the fi nal act appropriated slightly more than that the fy2003 appropriation followe d suit it was 466 million 11 above the requested amount the fy2004 budget request proposed

available at httpwwwusacearmymilpublicationsengregser112201entirepdffrom the initial appropriation amount acted for fy2003 pl 108137 restored appropriations to an amount closer to the corps fy2003 budget savings and slippage and reprogramming since all work will not be accomplished as planned appropriations for the corps include reduction for saving and s lippage ss to account for the slip of spending on projects due to delays caused by weather nonfederal sponsor fina ncing or decision not to proceed or to account for savings from project costing less than estimated the administration proposes an ss rate for the various accounts in the corps budget in its budget estimate congress can maintain or modify the ss rate during the appropriations process congress has since fy2002 increased the ss rates from the rates proposed by the administration for the gene ral investigations and the construction accounts for example the enacted ss rate for fy2004 was 14 for the construction account compared to the adminis trations requested rate of 8 the enacted ss rates are normally applied across the board to all projects in an account except for those activities specifically set forth in act language over the course of the fiscal year the corps reprograms f unds within an account from the projects that are not proceeding as planned to those that are moving forward ss rates that exceed the actual saving and slippage experienced could contribute to appropriations constraints on the progress of projects there is statutory language permitting or prohibiting reprogramming of funds however congress has provided specifi c guidance in the past with regard to reprogramming of the cons truction account in report language the conference report for the enacted appropriations for fy2004 identified numerous areas of dissatisfaction with the corps reprogramming procedures2 trust fund proposals the administration included in its request legislative proposals to fund more activities from seve ral trust funds the administration proposed that for fy2004 these changes be made through the ppropriations process the two trust funds the inland waterway trust fund iwtf and the harbor maintenance trust fund hmtf have built up substantial unused balances in recent years causing concern about why th funds were not being put to use and leading to interest in expanding their use to decrease the federal monies spent on inland waterways and harbors the enacted legislation dismissed the administrations propos als related to the hmtf and the iwtf proposed reforms of corps processes and procedures during the 107th congress the corps came under criticism for the way it evaluates and undertakes projects although the issue r eceived media attenti on it was

directed the bureau of reclamation to expedite modifications to the yuma desalting plant on the colorado river near the usmexico border and to accelerate the permitting and environmental compliance ac tivities needed for its operation the bureau of reclamation was also directed to report to the house and senate committee on appropriations on the status of those activities within 180 days the yuma desalting plant was built in order to treat saline agriculture water before it entered the colorado river th plant has not been operated since its completion in the early 1990s because of technical problems and high operational costs interest in operating the plant and using the treated water toward the us treaty obligations has increased recently due to the regions drought condition which has reduced storage levels in colorado river reservoirs and the growing competition for limited water resources preparing the yuma desalting plant is c ontroversial because of its expense and the possible environmental consequences the modification to the plant are expected to take 36 to 48 months to complete at cost of 24 to 28 million operating the plant is estimated to cost between 26 and 34 million annually maintaining the plant on standby status also has its cost 5 million annually httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31807crs13 preparing the plant for full operational capacity has some environmental advocacy groups in the united states and xico concerned they are worried about the impact on wetland in mexico as result of plant operations the saline agricultural water that is currently diverted around th desalting plant b ecause it is not operating is discharged into the cienega santa clara wetlands in mexico this diverted water supports 11000 acres of wetlands that are protected biosphere by the mexican government and provide habitat for species designated as threatened and endangered by the us and mexican g overnments the water diverted to these wetlands does not currently c ount toward the colorado river water that the united states is required to deliver to mexico under 1944 treaty if the plant were to become operational the treated water would likely be discharged into the colorado river and the saline effluent stream discharged into the cienega the water reaching the cienega would likely be 4 to 5 times mo re saline and the quantity reaching the cienega would be 30 of the current flow environmental groups support alternatives to plant operation such as shortterm leases of water rights while supporters of plant operations argue that the demand for the water in the united states is too high to allow for the water to continue flowing to the cienega without it counting toward the treaty requirements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31807crs14 title iii department of

still an increase of 122 million over the fy2003 budget the committee praised nnsa and alamos national laboratory for turning around this campaign but urged nnsa to reduce costs it stated that the current plan would aggressively pursue multibillion dollar modern pit fac ility before the first production pit has even been successfully certified for use in the stockpile in reducing mpf to 108 million from the requested 228 million it recommended that nnsa should look hard at better ways to use the pit produc tion facility at alamos for nearterm requirements and take less ggressive planning approach to mpf it felt that it was premature to spend 197 million to deve lop technologies for manufacturing pits other than for the w88 when mpf was at least 15 years from operating and so recommended reducing this part of the re quest pit manufacturin g capability to 47 million the senate appr opriations committee recomme nded the amount requested for this campaign the feinstein ame

of nuclear weapons during the cold war has been long standing issue since the beginning of the us atomic energy program doe and its predecessors have been responsible for administering the production of nuclear wea pons and managing radioactive and other hazardous waste in later years doe expanded its efforts to include the environmental restoration of radioactive sites and those with other hazardous contamination in buildings soil and water to ensure their safety for future uses in 1989 the george h w bush administr ation established an environmental management program within doe to consolidate the agencys efforts in cleaning up contamination from defense nuclear waste as well as waste from civilian nuclear energy research doe is responsible for complying with numerous federal environmental laws and regulations in admin istering the program and is subject to fines and penalties for violations of these requirements consequently doe has signed numerous legally binding complian ce agreements with the environmentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31807crs34 protection agency epa and the states to perform cleanup activities and dispose of waste according to specific deadlines doe reports that there are 114 geographic sites in 31 states and one us territory where the production of nuclear weapons and civilian nuclear energy research and development activities re sulted in radioactiv and other hazardous contamination together these sites ccupy approximately 2 million acres which is equivalent to the land area of rhode island and delaware co mbined doe reports that all response actions were complete at 75 sites as of the end of fy2002 at cost of over 60 billion and expected that clea nup would be complete at two additional sites by the end of fy2003 however the sites that have been cleaned up are relatively small and are among the leas t hazardous and the sites where cleanup remains underway contain some of the most severely contaminated areas doe has estimated that if program re forms are not initiated clea nup at the remaining sites may take 70 years to complete and th at total cleanup costs may range from 220 billion to as high as 300 billion doe has been working on cleanup re form initiative that would accelerate cleanup and lower costs the department estimates that its initiative could save between 50 billion and 100 billion in total cleanup costs over the long term and that the time frame for total site clea nup could be moved from 2070 to 2035 these goals would be accomplished by assessing the risk of exposure to determine which cleanup remedies are selected risk is currently one of many factors that doe uses to select cleanup remedies altering the current process to use risk as the primary factor could result in decisions to contain waste on site as means of preventing exposure rather than removing it while containment can often be accomplished more quickly and at less cost the possibility of future exposure remains if the method of containment fails over time while there has been widespread cern about the amount of time and money needed to clean up nuclear waste sites questions have been raised as to how doe would use riskbased approach to accomplish its goals of faster and less costly cleanups without weakening environmental protection some ve drawn attention to the possibility that basing the selec tion of cleanup remedies on risk alone might result in more contamination being left on site rather than it being removed because of the substantial amount of time required for radioactive d ecay to occur arguments have been raised that contamination left in place may migrate in unexpected ways over the long term and re sult in pathways of exposure that could not have been predicted when the remedy was originally select ed others counter that completely removing radioactive contamination from all sites to permit unrestricted future land use and eliminate all future pathways of exposure would not be economically feasible and in some cases would be beyond the capabilities of current cleanup technologies doe first proposed riskb ased cleanup reform strategy as part of its fy2003 budget request in

the funds under the existing account structure rather than under separate cleanup reform account that doe had proposed some mbers expressed concern about how the funds would have been distributed am ong the sites if doe had been given an unallocated lump sum under new account for fy2004 doe requested total of 724 billion for its environmental management program 290 million more than the fy2003 enacted level of 695 billion the budget request proposed new appropriations account structure for the program in order to focus funding on doe s reform initiative to accelerate cleanup schedules and lower costs the proposed accounts were structured according to the purposes of site acceleration completion and environmental services and there were separate defense and nondefense accounts for each category the site acceleration completion acc ounts represented nearly 60 billion of the total request and focused funding on efforts to comple cleanup and close c ontaminated facilities at faster pace than previously schedul ed the environmental services accounts focused funding on activities that indir ectly support the mission of accelerated cleanup and closure such as policy development and c oordination and the integration of mission activities across the co mplex of sites the budget request also proposed uranium decontamination and decommissioning fund account to support the cleanup of uranium and thorium processing sites for which there had been similar account entitled uranium f acilities maintenance and remediation the conference agreement on hr 2754 approved the administrations proposed account structure however it provided 130 million less than requested for the program overall reducing the presidents budget from 724 billion to 711 billion however f unding wa s not reduced for all activities the reduction was directed at defense sites for which the conference agreement provided 664 billion 168 million less than the request of 681 billion whereas th request for non defense sites was increased by 40 million from 463 million to 503 million conference report language indicated th at less funding was appropriated than requested for defense sites primarily due to concern that doe had not made sufficient progress in negotia ting all of its cleanup agreem ents to the satisfaction of epa and the states which had been expressed in the house bill negotiations to revise these agreements would be necessary to allow the selection of cleanup remedies to be altered according to riskbased approach the conference report also reiterated concerns expressed by the house and senate about inaccurate estima tes of cleanup costs and sche duling of certain projects particularly the hanford waste treatment and immobilization plant doe had recently understated the estimate d cost of this project by 33 the house and senate had expressed concerns that this sharp increase may be an indicator that cost estimates of cleanup acceleration projects at other sites also c ould be understated in response the conference agreemen t directed doe to transfer 25 million of its environmental management funds to the office of management budget and evaluation for increased overs ight of accelerated cleanup pr ojects the senate had recommended 5 million for this purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31807crs36 another issue noted in the conference agreement is the possible need for amendments to existing law to allow certa in cleanup acceleration projects to proceed to examine this need doe is directed to prepare report to congress within 60 days of enactment on potential statutory restric tions that may dela or prohibit cleanup acceleration projects that are currently planned the conference agreement also directs doe to submit legislative proposal requesting these changes as part of the administrations fy2005 budget submission to congress in addition to the conference report lang uage discussed above the house raised questions about longterm stewardship need s once cleanup is complete at each site and directed doe to consider these n eeds when implementing accelerated cleanup plans to ensure that longterm stewardship is not used as substitute for complete and effective site cleanup as discussed earlier some have expressed concern that does cleanup acceleration strategy may result in more waste being left on site than would be allowed under original cleanup agr eements if more waste were permitted to remain rather than being removed the st ewardship costs at such sites would likely rise as result of the need for additional m easures to ensure that the waste continues to be safely contained in fu ture years to prevent exposure in response to this issue the house report indicated that the performance management plan for each cleanup site should identify the resources that would be necessary for fulfilling does responsibilities to manage the legacy of c ontained waste that is left behind after cleanup response actions are complete civilian nuclear waste the bush administration requested 591 million for the doe civilian nuclear waste dis posal program for fy2004 30 boost over fy2003 the increased budget was intende d primarily to pay for preparing construction permit application for national nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain nevada the additional funds are also needed for detailed repository design work repository performance studies and transportation planning according to doe the department contended that it could not meet its 2010 target date for shipping nuclear waste to yucca mount ain without receiving its entire fy2004 budget request for the program the house appropriations committee contending that the nuclear waste program had suffered chronic funding shortf alls voted to provide an additional 174 million for the program in fy2004 for total of 765 million to which the house concurred the appropriations committee report stressed that the additional funding should ensure that doe could sub mit license application for the repository to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc by december 31 2004 the committee also directed doe to prepare any plans and legislation necessary to allow shipments of spent nuclear fuel to yu cca mountain to begin in 2007 three years before the repository is scheduled to open however house energy and water subcommittee chairman hobson promised in floor colloquy to remove the report language about early shipments to yu cca mountain and that provision was not included in the conference agreement the senate voted to cut the adminis trations request to 425 million setting up difficult confrontation with the house over the controversia l program after months of deliberation on the issue the conference committee agreed to providehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31807crs37 580 million for the nuclear waste prog ram 11 million below the request but 123 million above the fy2003 level between fy2005 and fy2010 nuclear wast funding will have to further increase to an average of 13 billion per year to keep the repository on schedule according to the doe budget justifica tion the administration proposed that discretionary spending caps be adjusted to accommodate higher future funding for the program although specific legislation was not submitted the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa pl 97425 as amended names yucca mountain as the sole candidate site for national geologic repository following the recommendation of energy secretary abraham president bush on february 15 2002 recommended to congress that doe submit an application to nrc to construct the yucca mountain repos itory nevada governor guinn then exercised his right under nwpa to submit notice of disapproval or state veto to congress under nwpa the state disapproval would have blocked the yucca mountain site if congressi onal approval resolu tion had not been signed into law within 90 days of continuous session th approval resolution was signed july

million would ve been provided from the nuclear waste fund which consists of fees pa id by nuclear utilities and 4300 million from the defense nuclear waste di sposal account which pays fo r disposing of highlevel waste from the nuclear weapons program in the planned civilian repository the house boosted the nuclear waste fund tion of the request to 335 million the senate cut the waste fund portion to 140 million and the defense portion to 285 million while the conference committee pr ovided 190 million from the waste fund and 390 million in the defense account the 2010 target for opening permanent repository is 12 years later than the nuclear waste policy act deadline of january 31 1998 for doe to begin taking waste from nuclear plant sites nuclear utilities and state uti lity regula
