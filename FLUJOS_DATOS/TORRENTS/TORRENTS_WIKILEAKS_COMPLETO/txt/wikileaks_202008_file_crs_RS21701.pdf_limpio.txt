protected communication is most often implicit the privilege covers an individuals actions rather than his speech or writing yet many incriminating actions such as providing blood sample or handw

protects the act of producing existing documents which by themselves are not protected because they were originally prepared vol untarily fourth the privilege protects not only intrinsically incriminating communications but also those that form link in the chain of incrimination some of the uncertainty can be dissipated by close examination of the facts and views of the court in the cases

bright line divides communications that are testimonial from those that are not third the privilege so metimes protects the act of producing existing documents which by themselves are not protected because they were originally prepared voluntarily fourth the privilege prot ects not only intrinsically incriminating communications but also those th at form link in the chain of incrimination some of the uncertainty can be dissipated by close exa mination of the facts and views of the court in the cases where the issue has arisen the act of production first comes into focus in two cases in which the court rejected its application schmerber v california 384 us 757 1966 and fisher v united states 425 us 391 1976 schmerber is blood alcohol case schmerber had claimed privilege against selfincriminati on in an effort to bar the results of his blood alcohol test conducted over his objections followi ng serious traffic accident the court was unconvinced it repeated justice holmes reminder that the prohibition of compelling man in criminal court to be witness against himself is prohibition of the use of physical or mora l compulsion to extort communications from him not an exclusion of his body as evid ence when it is material 384 us at 763 quoting holt v united states 218 us 245 25253 1910 schmerbers claim was fatally defective since the blood test ev idence although an incriminating product of compulsion was neither sch merbers testimony nor evidence relating to some communicative act or writing by him 384 us at 765 emphasis added although more beneficial to its claima nts the act of production doctrine became clearer with fisher fisher invoked the privilege in response to an internal revenue service demand served on his attorney for documents prepared by fishers accountant the accountants papers had been prepared voluntarily and consequently lacked the element of government coerci on required for application of the privilege the content of the papers aside the act of producing evid ence in response to subpoena nevertheless has communicative aspects of its own the court pointed out compliance with the subpoena tacitly concedes the existence of the papers demanded and their possession or control by the taxpayer it also would indicate the taxpayers belief that the papers are those described in the subpoena 425 us at 410 unfortunately for fisher his act of pr oduction came up short on two other elements it was neither incriminating nor testimonial implicit assertions of the existence and control of an accountants papers relating to ones taxes are by themselves hardly self criminating for surely it is not illegal to seek accounting help in connection with ones tax returns or for the accountant to prepare wo rkpapers and deliver to the taxpayer 425 us at 412 neither did the court consider fisher criminally imp erilled by any implicit authentication of the papers for produc tion would express nothing more than thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21701crs3 taxpayers belief that the papers are those scribed in the subpoena the taxpayer did not prepare the papers and could not vouch for their accuracy the documents would not be admissible against the taxp ayer without authenticating testimony 425 us at 41213 in fisher and elsewhere the testimonial elem ent turns on whether production asserts the existence control or authentication of an item and on the extent to which an individuals implicit evidentiary assertion relieves the prosecuti on of burden it might otherwise find difficult to bear in fisher the court considered it doubtful that implicitly admitting the existence and possession of the papers rises to the level of testimony within the protection of the fifth amendment surely the government is in way relying on the truthtelling of the taxp ayer to prove the existence of or his access to the documents 8 wigmore 2264 p380 the ex istence and location of the papers are foregone conclusion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the governments information by conceding that he in fact has the papers 425 us at 412 13 fishers authentication argument proved more robust as the court observed in the context of the incrimination element fisher did not prepare the papers and could not vouch for their accuracy the documents woul d not be admissible against him without independent authenticating testimony 425 us at 413 finally in united states v doe doe i 465 us 605 1984 the court encountered case where the act of production was appr opriately claimed federal grand jury investigating possible corruption relating to municipal contracts served sweeping series of five subpoenas upon doe demanding busine ss records of five sole proprietorships under which doe apparently did business th lower courts held that does privilege against selfincrimination sh ielded him from punishment for failure to produce the subpoenaed documents the trial court declar ed that with few ex ceptions enforcement of the subpoenas would compel doe to admit that the records exist that they are in his possession and that they are authentic these communications if made under compulsion of court decree would violate does fifth amendment rights the government argues that the existence possession and authenticity of the documents can be proved without does testimonial comm unication but it cannot satisfy this court as to how that representation can be implemented to protect the witness in subsequent proceedings 465 us at 613 quoting in re grand jury empanelled march 19 1980 541 fsupp1 3 dnj 1981 the court of appeals concurred adding th at we find nothing in the record that would indicate that the united states knows as certainty that each of the myriad documents demanded by the five subpoenas in fact is in the appellees possession or subject to his control the most plausible inference to be drawn from the broadsweeping subpoenas is that the government unable to prove that the subpoenaed documents exist or that the appellee even is somehow connected to the business entities under investigation is attempting to compensate for its lack of knowledge by requiring the appellee to become in effect the primary informant against himself 465 us at 613 quoting in re grand jury empanelled march 19 1980 680 f2d 327 335 3d cir 1982 the supreme court agreed in fact it d eclined to conduct an independent analysis of whether doe had established the testimonial and incrimination elements of his claimhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21701crs4 it simply deferred to the district courts finding affirmed by the third circuit that compliance with the subpoenas would involve testimonial selfi ncrimination 465 us at 613 there followed in fairly rapid succession three cases in which the court confirmed the vitality of the action of production doctrine but found its benefits beyond the reach of the claimants before it in braswell v united states 487 us 99 1988 the court held that the president and sole shareholder of co rporation could not interpose the act of production to avoid the commands of grand jury subpoena fo r corporate records even if their contents would incriminate him 487 us at 102 cor porations and other co llective entities like partnerships or labor organi zations enjoy privilege against selfincrimination 487 us at 1078 the privilege stands as impedime nt to demands for tity records addressed to their custodial representatives although the act of production may afford the custodial individual protection in doe v united states doe ii 487 us 201 1988 the court encountered situation akin to schmerber when does signature was taken from him over his objections doe contested court order that di rected him to sign form authorizing any bank in the cayman islands or bermuda to disclose to the grand jury information concerning any accounts doe might have in an of the banks using the words once again of dean wigmore the court declared that unless some attempt is made to secure communication written oral or otherwise upon which reliance is to be placed as involving the accuseds consciousness of the facts and the operations of his mind in expressing it the demand made upon him is not tes timonial one and consequently outside the privilege 487 us at 211 quoting 8 w igmore on evidence 2265 at 386 1961 edat 375 1940 ed in doe ii the execution of the form is analog ous to the production of handwriting sample or voice exemplar it is nontestimonial act in neither case is the suspects action compelled to obtain any knowledge he might ve at 217 moreover by signing the form doe makes statement explicit or implicit regarding the existence of foreign bank account or his control over such account nor would his execution of the form admit the authenticity of any records produced by the bank 21516 in baltimore city dept of social services v bouknight 493 us 549 1990 bouknight had maintained custody of her child subject to supervisory restrictions imposed as consequence of serious child abuse but wa s held in contempt for failure to produce the child at custody hearing the supreme c ourt denied her claim of the act of production as defense confirming that the act of pr oduction does not excuse otherwise required compliance with regulatory scheme 493 us at 55556 although it may curtail the governments ability to use compliance for prosecutorial purposes most recently the court found the act of production applicable notwithstanding the fact the witness had been granted immunity united states v hubbell 530 us 27 2000 in doe i the court took special note of the gove rnments failure to secure statutory immunity in the face of an act of production claim in hubbell the government secured statutory immunity order that required h ubbell to surrender the subpoenaed documentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21701crs5 but that necessarily guaranteed that thei r production would not be used directly or indirectly to incriminate him hubbell had entered plea agreement under wh ich he pled guilty to tax evasion and fraud and promised to fully cooperate with the indepe ndent counsels whitewater investigation concerned th at hubbell was not being comp letely candid the independent counsel served him with far reaching grand jury subpoena hubbell res ponded by asserting his privilege against selfincrimination and was made the subject of statutory use immunity order the documents he subsequently supplied and evidence derived from them resu lted in his prosecution for crimes apparently unrelated to either his first conviction or wh itewater the district court described the governments effort as quintessentia l fishing expedition and dismissed the indictment 530 us at 32 quoting united states v hubbell 11 fsupp2d 25 37 ddc 1998 the supreme c ourt essentially agreed content aside the mental ex ercise required for hubbell to gather sort and organize the thousands of pages of documents which he then testified fully complied with the subpoenas demand other than for documen ts privileged on other grounds handed the prosecution road map to crimes bout which until then it was clueless in doing so the court felt hubbell had become an essential or at least valuable witness against himself within the unders tanding of the fifth amendment what the district court characterized as fishing expedition did produce fish but not the one that the independent counsel expected to hook it is abundantly clear that the testimonial aspect of hubbells act of producing subpoenaed documents was the first step in chain of evidence that led to his prosecution the documents did not magically appear in the prosecutors office like manna from heaven they arrived there only after hubbell asserted his constitution privilege received grant of immunity and took th mental and physical steps necessary to provide the prosecutor with an accurate inventory of the many sources of potentially incriminating evidence sought by the s ubpoena it was only through hubbells truthful reply to the subpoena that th government received the incriminating documents of which it made substantial use in the investigation that led to the indictment it was unquestionably necessary for hubbell to make extensive use of the contents of his own mind in identifying the hundreds of documents responsive to the request in the subpoena the assembly of those documents was like telling an inquisitor the combination to wall safe not like being forced to surrender the key to strongbox the governments anemic view of hubbells act of production as mere physical act that is principally nont estimonial in character and can be entirely divorced from its implicit testimonial aspect so as to constitute legitimate wholly independent source for the documents pr oduced simply fails to account for these realities 530 us at 423 the independent counsel argued to avail that like the fisher tax records the existence of the hubbell business and tax documents s hould be considered foregone conclusion and therefore the act of revealing their existence lacked testimonial weighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21701crs6 the court simply considered doe i with its sweeping minimally particularized commands more apt comparison
