ual physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual record of such impairment or being regarded as having such an impairment special needs visual disabilities 1 one of the most difficult issues facing people in need who are blind or vision impaired is identifying police officia ls employees should offer detailed information in identifying themselves as members of the department if needed badges may be offered to the individua l to verify the officers identity 2 knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do to

individual will take the officers arm for guidance b mental emotional and psychological disabilities 1 the terms mental illness emotional illness and psychological illness describe varying levels of group of disa bilities in thinking feeling and relating 2 providing accessibility to police services for people with mental emotional and psychological disabilities usually involv providing only

selfinjury 5 frequently family member or friend is of great value in calming an individual exhibiting unusual behavior as result of mental or emotional impairment if needed steps should be taken to gain placement for the individual in an appropriate emergency medical he alth care or shelter facility 6 officers must become familiar with ppropriate government agencies nonprofit agencies volunteer organizations and emergency medical services available to provide assistance to people with mental emotional and psychological disabilities 7 officers must remain familiar with appropriate emergency

have mental retardation have varied degrees of limited intellectual f unctioning in all situations employees should ask short questions be patient when waiting for answers repeat questions and answers if necessary have individuals repeat the question in their own words and provide reassurance in many situations and particularly when dealing with someone who is lost or has run away the employee may gain improved response by accompanying the person through building or neighborhood to seek visual clues 3 in responding to the needs of people with severe or profound mental retardation the aid of family frie nds and teachers is invaluable d mobility impairment 1 among the disabilities that are the most visibly identifiable are mobility impairments people with mobilityrela ted impairments

have reactions from either too little insulin or too mu ch insulin low blood sugar reactions are common and are usually treated by ingesting sugar detaining someone and preventing them from getting sugar could have serious health implications for the individual and liability consequenc for the officer and department 2 officers should realize that involuntar behavior associated with some invisible disabilities may resemble behavior characte ristically exhibited by intoxicated or less frequently combative individuals for example person experiencing mild seizure may appear incoherent and physically imbalanced the response is temporary 3 an officers patience and understanding of the characteristics commonly associated with invisible disabilities w ill lead to successful outcome an inaccurate assessment may lead to unnecessary confrontation injury and denial of needed medication andor medical treatment 4 as with all types of disabilities an employees first obligation is to protect the individual from unnecessary harm when aiding person experiencing seizure protection from obstacles calm reassu ring manner and patience are important responses family members and friends should be sought to provide information and assistance their presence may prove invaluable in understanding the needs of the person with the disability and guiding the officers actions f speech and hearing disabilities 1 like other invisible disabilities offic ers may confuse the behavior of individuals with hearing and speech disabilities with those of people who intentionally refuse to cooperate or those who abuse illegal substances officers should be aware that an individuals failure to comply with or respond to verbal orders does not always constitute defiance but may be th result of that individuals inability to hear the officer or respond verbally before committing themselves to course of action officers should attemp t to identify whether or not they are dealing with person who has communicationrelated disability 2 it is essential that officers take extra measures to protect the rights of suspects who are deaf and hard of hearing as well as others who may not have educational or communications compre hension levels sufficient to fully understand the basic miranda rights simply reading the rights to someone with hearing disability and having the individual acknowledge that they are understood is insufficient aspen police departmentpolicy and procedure manual revised 2007082753 officer responsibility in providing police service to the public it is

arresting and incarcerating all people whether or not they have disability officers should follow all policies and standard techniques for arrest and incarceration when taking person with disabilities into custody b consideration should be given to the special needs of some people with disabilities in an arrest situation response in these situations requires discretion and will be based in great part on the officers knowledge of charac teristics and severity of the disability the level of resistance exhibited by the suspect and immediacy of the situation in arrest and incarceration situations employees may encounter the following 1 person whose disability affects the mu scular andor skeletal system may not be able to be restrained using hand cuffs or other standard techniques alternative methods transport vans seat belts should be sought aspen police departmentpolicy and procedure manual revised 2007082754 2 some people with disabilities require physical aids canes wheelchairs leg braces to maintain their mobility once the immediate presence of danger has diminished and the suspect is safety incarcerated every effort should be made to return the device if mobility aids must be withheld the prisoner must be closely monitored to ensure that his or her needs are met 3 prescribed medication may be required at regular intervals by people with disabilities diabetes epile psy medical personnel the suspects physician on call medical staff emergency room dical staff should be contacted immediately to determine the importance of administering the medication potential for overdose etc 4 some people with disabilities ma not have achieved communications comprehension levels sufficient to understan d their individual rights in an arrest situation for people who are deaf there is sign language for the term waive in regard to the miranda rights yet in an effort to be cooperative suspect who is deaf may acknowledge that he or she is willing to give up his or her rights officers must take extra care to ensure that the rights of the accused are protected 5 the booking officer shall be notified of an arrestees disability and medicine or aids shall be given to the

the policy of the aspen police department to ensu re that searches conducted by department employees are in accordance with the constitutions and statutes of the united states of america and the state of colorado although this policy addres ses exceptions to the search warrant requirement and absent consent to search it is department policy that an officer ob tains search warrant when heshe has probable cause to conduct search where another person has reasonable expectation of privacy purpose this policy identifies the circumstances in which an officer can conduct search and seizure with and without warrant and describes the pr ocedures for those searches advantages of obtaining search warrant every officer should understand and know the advantages in obtaining search warrant even when an exception applies search warrants usually permit more extensive sear ch than search permitted as an exception to suppress evidence seized under search warrant the defendant has the burden of proving lack of probable cause when evidence is seized without warrant the prosecuting attorney has the burden of proving probable cause obtaining search warrant helps provide the officer with goodfaith defense against civil litigation related to the search exception categories the only exceptions to the normal search warrant requirement are consent searches motor vehicle searches plain view searches searches incident to an arrest interview room searches vehicle inventories exigent circumstances prisoner searches aspen police departmentpolicy and procedure manual revised 2007082759consent searches 1 an officer may conduct search without warrant if the officer receives prior voluntary consent from person who reasonably appears to have authority to give consent note consent searches are often subject to question after the fact 2 in major cases if the officer has sufficient probable cause to get search warrant it is preferable to search with warrant rather than by consent 3 consent should be in writing if not possible ve rbal consent may fulfill legal requirements if verbal consent is given the officer should try to have an other officer or another person witness the consent 4 the person who gives consent may limit consent to sp ecific items areas or times consent may be given to include home property person or vehicle 5 the consent is invalid if it is given in the presence of person who objects to the search and who has higher priority in the property for example subjec t consents to search of her boyfriends residence even though he is present and objects to the search 6 person may withdraw consent at any time in that event the officer must immediately stop searching search warrant may be needed to continue the arch but the search warrant application can include information on items seized before consent was with drawn exception consent search of vehicle may continue after consent has been withdrawn if probable cause has been established motor vehicle searches 1 an officer may stop and search vehicle without search warrant if there is probable cause to believe that evidence of crime is in the vehicle and b the vehicle is capable of being moved c the officer may conduct search whether or not an arrest has been made the officer may search any part of the vehicle in which the items sought might reasonably be found 2 the rule does not apply to crimes that have evidence for example mo st traffic offenses 3 when motor vehicle occupant is taken into full cu stodial arrest the officer may search the vehicle passenger compartment incident to arrest and prior to transporting the arrested person the search includes glove boxes receptacles luggage clothing or other closed containers 4 an officer searches the transport vehicle directly prior to and directly after transporting an arrested person plain view searches 1 an officer who is lawfully on premise may make plain view seizure of property if it is immediately apparent to the officer that the property constitutes criminal evidence 2 the rule does not apply if the item must be moved or examined more closely search warrant is required to move the item 3 except in exigent circumstances or in motor vehicles plain view observation of evidence does not justify an officers warrantless entry into consti tutionally protected area to seize the item aspen police departmentpolicy and procedure manual revised 2007082760 searches incident to arrest 1 an officer is permitted to conduct sear ch subsequent to full custody arrest to collect and preserve evidence b protect the safety of the arresting officer and others c prevent escape d prevent weapons and contraband from entering custodial facility 2 the search incident to arrest is limited to the person the persons clothing and the area and articles within the persons immediate reach including purse or wallet 3 the area within the persons reach is defined at the time of arrest and not at the time of search the officer should conduct the search immediately at the rrest location with the arrested person present if possible the officer may not make the arrest transport the arrested person and then return to the arrest location to conduct search incident to arrest 4 the officer may also conduct search incident to arrest at the place of detention after prompt transportation of the arrested person 5 if the officer reasonably believes based on specific and articulable facts that there is an individual present who poses danger to persons at the rrest location the officer may conduct limited protective sweep of the premises incident to an arrest 6 because full custody arrest is ba sed upon probable cause search incident to that arrest is reasonable intrusion under the 4th amendment to the us constitution interview room searches an officer will always check the interview room for weapons contraband and dama ge before and after an arrested person occupies it report any findings to the onduty supervisor as soon as possible exigent searches an officer is permitted to search and arrest wi thout warrant in certain exigent circumstances 1 hot pursuit of suspect should only be used to ju stify warrantless search or entry in connection with felonies and serious misdemeanors hot pursuit means that the officer is in continuous and uninterrupted pursuit but not necessarily contin uous visual contact the officer should not unnecessarily delay conducting the search 2 immediate crisis in which police assistance woul d probably be helpful examples are medical emergencies suicides drug overdoses an officer re sponding to such calls may search for the immediate cause of the crisis for example drug vials 3 to prevent the destruction of evidence the officer must have articulable facts to suspect that the evidence is about to be destroyed or disposed the presence of drugs does not automatically justify warrantless search aspen police departmentpolicy and procedure manual revised
