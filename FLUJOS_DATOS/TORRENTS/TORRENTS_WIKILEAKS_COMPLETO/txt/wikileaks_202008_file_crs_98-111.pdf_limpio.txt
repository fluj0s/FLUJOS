that this initiative would not involve any new regulatory requireme nts or federal funding in response to this proposal sponsors in 46 states and the district of columbia submitted 126 nominations by

initiative since it has not been authorized by congress this report will be updated as events warrant program history president clinton based his american heritage rivers initiative on 6 principles

of different types of communities httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98111crs2 will integrate federal state local and private expertise and resources to achieve communityidentified goals will make information and services accessible to all river communities will encourage partnerships and investment in river communities and will support efforts to improve river h ealth and revitalize local communities shortly thereafter the administration announced the appointment of federal interagency task force coor dinated at the council on envi ronmental quality ceq to implement the initiative ceq issued an implementing proposal with request for comments on may 19 in the federal register then reissued the request on june 20 with some clarifications and re vised schedule for implementa tion the proposal was based in part on input gathered during 12 mee tings in april and may around the country attended by approximate ly 700 people the proposal emphasized that nomination must demonstrate broad local suppor t for participation and incl ude mechanism for comment on the nomination and that community could terminate designation at any time in the future it also stated that this is domestic program

federal employees and their appointment would be limited to 5 years an interagency task force would pay particular ttention to designated rivers as it works to reduce duplication and increase coordination and efficiency of fede ral programs agencies in the task force would assist designated communities with pl anning and technical assistance and supply field staff and resources to support impleme ntation federal agencies would commit to good neighbor policy under which they would help ensure that their actions have positive effect on local resources the administration would encourage the search for other opportunities to develop nd expand partnerships to rest ore protect and revitalize the designated rivers in the july 30 1998 press release accompanying the announcement of the designated rivers the administrati on summarized its view of the benefits of participation stating that federal assi stance could include economic development or pollution cleanup funds and will be provi ded only at communitys request nominating criteria were spelled out in the federal register notice the proposal noted that the criteria were intended to be broad flexible and credible all nominations must demonstrate broad community support the presence of notable resource qualities the presence and expansion of cal and regional partnerships the inclusion of strategy that will lead to action and an ability to achieve measurable results more than 1700 comments on the proposal were submitted they were considered before the final design of the initiative wa s announced on septem ber 11 1997 the administration responded to many of the concerns about prope rty rights and local control by more thoroughly spelling out what the program would not be such as more explicit statement that private property ri ghts would not be affected httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98111crs3 the materials the administration subsequently provided to communities considering participation reflected the final design of the initiative and stated that the primary basis for evaluating nominations would be the communitys plan of action and the demonstration of support for the nominati on the deadline for nominations was december 10 1997 nominations which totaled 126 were submitted from groups in 46 states and the district of columbia nominations we re received from alaska maine mississippi and nevada the submissions varied widely some sites were urban others rural nominations included long segments of the largest rivers in the country and short segments or small rivers as well these nominations were reviewed by panel of 12 members appointed by the administration in april 1998 members ranged widely in backgrounds fro m local civic activists and public officials to business leaders and academics the panel recommended 10 rivers to the president in june the president officially announced the design ated rivers in press conf erence along the new river in north carolina on july 30 1998 the first 10 in the list below were recommended by the panel and the final 4 we re added subsequently by the administration the administrations press release characterized the selected rivers as reflecting the extraordinary diversity and splendor of amer icas rivers some flow through pristine forests others the inner city although some have been largely restored there are still those that remain polluted the final list and states where the river segments are located includes connecticut river ct ma nh and vt detroit river hanalei river hi hudson river ny upper mississippi river il ia

and upper susquehanna and l ackawanna rivers pa representative from the ceq stated that future nomination and designation opportunities are anticipated alt hough it may be some time before this process is repeated so that the initial designations can be observed and adjustments to the program can be made based on these observations public response sharply contrasting views have been ex pressed about this initiative and are displayed in the 1700 comments that were s ubmitted in response to the proposal on one side are many expressions of support includi ng some support for the general concept andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98111crs4 some support for the potential benefits that may accrue to specific location one measure of broad support is the 126 nomina tions from 46 states each sponsored by at least one but almost always many local groups elected officials and others for example the nomination of the upper mississippi rive r was reportedly sponsored by 53 mayors in the july 30 1998 press release that accompanied the announcement of the designations the administr ation reported that written s upport for the initiative had been received from 21 governors more than 200 members of congress and 500 mayors other supporters include organizations that deal with local governance and numerous environmental organizations concerned with river c onservation water pollution or watershed management for example the conference of mayors passed resolution of support during its june 1997 annua l meeting and american ri vers and the national trust for historic preservation released letter of support signed by 220 member groups before september 24 1997 house resources committee hear ing just as this initiative appears to be able to take many forms so too do the reasons behind the support on the other side are expressions of opposition from individuals and organizations who fear that this initiative is new effort to enable the federal government to infringe on the prerogatives of local government and on the rights of private property owners to manage the use of their land perhaps the most visible opposition has come from texas based organization liberty matte rs and from some state chap ters of the american farm bureau federation concern is also raised when general suspicions by those skeptical about more government programs are combin ed with what critics view as vague and undefined descriptions of what will actually occur in designated places many of the groups speaking in opposition fear the potential fo r the federal agencies to go beyond the stated objectives of the program or for initially voluntary processes to become mandatory some have cited the presiden tial use of the antiquities act of 1906 to establish the grand staircaseescalante nationa l monument in southern utah during the 1996 election campaign as an example of federal highhande dness that has fueled suspicion resentment and determination not to be bypassed again congressional response some members of congress have expressed opposition to this initiative in several ways at july 15 1997 house resources committee hearing to learn more about how the administration justified and defined this initiative views were largely split along party lines with democrats generally in support and republicans in opposition four members representa tives chenoweth of idaho young of alaska pombo of california and schaffer of colorado filed lawsuit in december to halt implementation the mountain states legal foundation is representing the members in this suit the basis of the suit is that the initiative viol ates the separation of powers between the congress and the executive branch because the administration is implementing program that has not been authorized by congress the lawsuit also argues that this initiative will allow the federal government to become involved with the control of local land use planning and zoning which are reserved to the states under the constitution the us district court for the district of columb ia has requested more information before proceeding with the case httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98111crs5 1 the support for the initiative by some northeastern republicans was reported in may 9 1998 article in the national journal titled choppy start for heritage rivers and the debate over inclusion of the willamette river was reported in the june 23 1998 issue of the land letter publication of the environment and energy study institute legislation to halt funding for this initia tive was considered both in freestanding legislation and within vari ous fy1998 and fy1999 appropriati ons bills bill sponsored by representative chenoweth hr 1842 th at would eliminate funding passed house resources subcommittee on october 22 1997 and the full committee on november 5 1997 the bill has about 50 cosponsors the most recent hearing on this initiative was held by the forests and forest health subcommittee of the house resources committee on june 9 1998 testimony was offered at th is hearing by representatives from rural communities at september 22 1997 house resources committee hearing ceq chair kathleen mcginty asked any members who did not want the administration to consider designating rivers nominated in their districts or states to contact her more than two dozen members reportedly res ponded to her call and close to two dozen nominations were not considered as result included in this group are the entire idaho congressional delegation eight members from texas and members primarily from other western states but this does not seem to be partisan stion as number of republicans in the east including senator damato of new rk and representative nancy johnson of connecticut supported nominations in their stat or districts at least one nomination the willamette river in oreg on was chosen even though one member of the delegation senator gordon smith objected but ce senator ron wyden and the affected representatives supported the nomination ceq decided to continue to consider it1 an amendment offered by senator t im hutchinson to block funding for the initiative during senate consid eration of fy1998 interior appr opriations was defeated when senators voted 5742 to table the amendm ent in the house fy1998 agriculture appropriations as reported by the committee in cluded language that prohibited funds for unauthorized initiatives such as this one until the appropriations committees of both chambers are notified of justifications and proposals for reprogramming of funds language making this point was included in 727 of the general provisions of pl 105 86 the fy1998 agriculture appropriations neither the initiative nor ceq were mentioned by name but the depa rtment of agriculture was to be an important participant in implementation of the amer ican heritage rivers progra m support for the initiative reportedly proceeded after the required notif ication to the appropriations committees was provided similar language is being considered in the fy1999 appropriations for some of the key federal agencies that would be invol ved in
