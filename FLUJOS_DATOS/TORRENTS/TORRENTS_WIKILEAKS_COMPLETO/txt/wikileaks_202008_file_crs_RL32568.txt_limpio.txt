therapies act of 2004 introduced by senator gregg on june 2 2004 the gregg bill by continuing the major legal obstacle to importation the requirement that the secretary of health and human services first certify that imports are safe and offer cost savings to us consumers something secretary has been willing to do the mma effectively does not allow the commercial or personaluse importation of prescription drugs this report briefly discusses major differences among current law and the bills introduced in april and june 2004 and presents sidebyside comparison of the provisions although all three bills seek to make lowerpriced prescription drugs available to us consumers by allowing importation while also ensuring that the drugs are safe and effective they take different approaches the three senate bills use extensive registration licensing facility inspection and records requirements to document an imported shipments chainofcustody requirements rather than the mmas mandated laboratory testing of imported drugs to verify their content potency and labeling current law and the bills each have different lists of countries from which imports could be imported and they provide the secretary with different time frames and criteria for determining whether to permit commercial or personaluse importation secretarial reporting requirements vary as do mechanisms to fund the import activities the mma relies on appropriations and the senate bills each create specific user fee provisions only the gregg bill requires the regulation of internet pharmacies the grassley and dorgan bills propose links to antitrust patent and internal revenue titles of the us code to influence industry behavior the mma does not specify when importation could begin for commercial imports from canada the grassley and dorgan bills start 90 days from enactment later for other countries the gregg bill allows imports from canada only beginning one year from enactment the grassley and gregg bills allow personaluse imports from canada upon enactment with the grassley bills allowing other countries later the dorgan bill allows personaluse imports from canada only beginning 90 days after

current law s 2307 s 2328 and s 2493 6 senate prescription drug importation legislation sidebyside comparison of current law s 2307 s 2328 and s 2493 introduction this report compares the provisions of three senate prescription drug importation bills with current law provisions on the subject1 the law on the importation of prescription drugs was recently amended by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act mma pl 108173 the three bills2 with provisions compared to current law are s 2307 introduced by senator grassley on april 8 2004 the grassley bill s 2328 introduced by senator dorgan3 on april 21 2004 the dorgan bill and s 2493 introduced by senator gregg4 on june 2 2004 the gregg bill the new law and the three bills all seek to balance the availability of imported prescription drugs both for commercial and personal use and the assurance that those imports would be safe and effective the underlying goal is to reduce or restrain the growth of the financial burden that prescription drugs place on us consumers they all would act primarily by replacing or amending section 804 of 1 this report replaces the crs congressional distribution memorandum senate prescription drug importation legislation updated by susan thaul and donna u vogt dated june 25 2004 for detailed comparison of changes in section 804 made by the mma to the preexisting law as established by the 2000 meds act see crs report rl32271 importation of prescription drugs provisions in pl 108173 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 by susan thaul and donna u vogt for an analysis of the issues involved in drug importation see crs report rl32511 importing prescription drugs objectives options and outlook by susan thaul and donna u vogt 2 the house passed hr 2427 introduced by rep gil gutknecht on july 25 2003 before passage of the mma the conferees did not however include its provisions in their final agreement senate version was introduced 3 cosponsors of s 2328 at its introduction were sens snowe kennedy mccain daschle lott stabenow chafee johnson pryor and feingold by sept 1 2004 it had 30 co sponsors 4 cosponsors of s 2493 at its introduction were sens smith collins coleman sessions lott and enzi by sept 1 2004 sen voinovich had joined as cosponsor crs2 the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca that had been initially added to the ffdca by the medicine equity and drug safety meds act of 2000 individual bills would amend other laws impetus for developing new importation legislation so soon after enactment of the mma is the result of the new laws retaining the meds act provision that importation not be allowed unless the secretary of health and human services hhs certifies that imports are safe and offer cost savings to us consumers the three bills each eliminate this requirement and instead include other potential safeguards regarding drug safety and effectiveness differences among the bills some of the major areas of difference among the bills are the following monitoring while the mma relies on laboratory testing of samples of every shipment of imported drugs to verify their content potency and labeling the three proposed senate bills focus on documentation of monitored uninterrupted chain of custody from manufacturing facility to importer the mma requires canadian exporters to register with the secretary the grassley and dorgan bills specify extensive requirements for that registration and the dorgan bill extends similar registration requirements to importers as well as exporters to do so they require ongoing and onsite physical monitoring of the facilities of drugs manufacturer registered exporter and registered importer including inspection if the secretary determines it necessary of any facility that handles the product along the chain of custody the gregg bill has extensive registration requirements for importers and dispensers of imported prescription drugs including providing to the commercial purchaser identifying information on all preceding transactions that transferred the drug since it left the manufacturers control fda approval the mma and the gregg bill explicitly require that an imported drug be approved for us sale by the food and drug administration fda the grassley and dorgan bills allow different administrative requirements for importation while maintaining the substantive elements of fda approval the grassley bill also requires that the imported drug be manufactured in the same facility as the equivalent fdaapproved drug crs3 permitted countries the three senate bills5 and current law vary in the countries from which they would permit drug importation the grassley bill includes australia canada japan new zealand switzerland members of the european union iceland liechtenstein and norway it also allows the secretary to designate additional countries that have equivalent regulatory requirements regarding safety and effectiveness for commercial imports the dorgan bill differs in that it excludes iceland liechtenstein and norway and specifies european union countries as of january 2003 thereby excluding the 10 admitted to membership in may 2004 the dorgan bill alone distinguishes between commercial and personaluse imports regarding permitted countries allowing only canada for the latter the gregg bill includes canada and allows the secretary three years after enactment to designate as eligible any members of the european union as of december 2003 current law the mma includes only canada although it allows the secretary to grant waivers permitting personaluse importation from other countries logistics the grassley bill would allow the manufacturer of an fdaapproved drug distributed in the united states to petition the secretary to stop the importation of that drug when it has been manufactured in or exported to another country the petition would have to assert that the imported drug differs from the us drug enough that it would require supplemental application to fda if the manufacturer wanted to introduce it to the us market the manufacturer would through fees similar to those established for supplemental applications under the prescription drug user fee act pdufa pl 102571 pay the expense of the secretarys review the dorgan bill would require the manufacturer of any drug that may be imported to submit notice with extensive documentation of the differences if any between drug it produces for commercial marketing in permitted country and the drug it produces for the us market here too the manufacturer would pay for the review of these materials with fees similar to those required for supplemental or new drug applications under pdufa the gregg bill does not require the manufacturer to document differences between its usmarketed and foreignmarketed products reports the mma and the grassley bills require the hhs secretary to submit reports to congress the mma also requires report from the commerce secretary and others the dorgan bill requires report the gregg bill requires three reports to congress covering which countries the secretary has designated as permitted for imports and the reasons why the implementation of registration fees and the use of those fees and the commissioning of federal and state officials to conduct inspections 5 the most inclusive list is in hr 2427 not included in this reports table the gutknecht bill which follows the language in the meds act of 2000 permitted countries would be australia canada israel japan new zealand south africa switzerland members of the european union iceland liechtenstein and norway crs4 funding the mma includes explicit funding mechanism other than authorizing appropriations of such sums as necessary to implement the provisions the grassley bill calls for exporter fees that in the aggregate would cover the cost of administering the import provisions the dorgan bill includes exporter and importer fees based on the share of volume of imports adjusted annually to not exceed 1 of the price of drug imports the gregg bill sets 5000 firsttime registration fee and requires the secretary to set annually fee based on anticipated costs to enforce the act without further appropriation incentives implementation of the mma is restricted by the requirement that the secretary certify safety and cost savings criticism of the mma cites anticipated manufacturer resistance the grassley and dorgan bills propose links to antitrust patent and internal revenue titles of the us code to influence industry behavior the grassley bill includes tax incentives and penalties to minimize manufacturer interference the dorgan bill creates an antitrust provision to compel manufacturer participation and amends patent law to remove obstacles to importation the gregg bill includes neither positive nor negative incentives to influence manufacturer behavior internet pharmacies neither current law the mma nor the grassley and dorgan bills as introduced address internet sales6 the gregg bill presents an extensive statutory and regulatory structure for internet pharmacies placing it in the ffdca although set apart from the importation sections in addition to registration the bill requires that internet pharmacies provide specific professional services including confidential patient medication profiles interactive and meaningful consultation by licensed pharmacist and verification of prescription validity it requires advance notice of commercial shipments of prescription drug shipments and includes licensing fee providers of interactive computer services are liable if they accept advertising for prescription drug from an unlicensed internet pharmacy or accept advertising stating physicians prescription is not needed to obtain prescription drug the bill requires policies and procedures to prevent payments for unlawful internet pharmacy requests 6 pending bills in the 108th congress that address internet pharmacies include hr 4598 hr 4612 hr 3880 hr 3870 hr 2652 hr 725 s 2464 and s 2288 the july 21 2004 online newsletter inside health policy reported that the dorgan bill sponsors have added an internet sales provision that covers us internet pharmacies the report adds that the addition is based on bill that sens feinstein and coleman introduced s 2464 as companion bill to hr 3880 introduced by reps davis and waxman dorgan rx import bill guards against fake us internet pharmacies july 21 2004 at httpinsidehealthpolicycom crs5 effective dates the mma does not specify when importation could begin other than linking it to the required safety and cost certification by the secretary the three senate bills stipulate various time frames for commercial and personaluse importation with varying times for different countries commercial imports the grassley bill requires that the secretary promulgate and make effective an interim final rule not later than 90 days after enactment for commercial imports from canada it allows imports from other countries approximately two years later if the secretary designates them based on report required by the bill the dorgan bill would allow registered importers to import from canada beginning when the secretary promulgates an interim rule which is required within 90 days of enactment the secretary could add other countries one year later the gregg bill would allow pharmacy and wholesaler importation from canada one year after enactment even if the secretary has not issued regulations the secretary could allow imports from pre2004 members of the european union in three years following required study personaluse imports the grassley bill would allow 90day supply from canada immediately until 45days after promulgation of an interim final rule which is required within 90 days of enactment following report to congress due 18 months after enactment the secretary may designate other countries from which to allow personaluse imports the dorgan bill allows personaluse imports from canada beginning when the interim rule is promulgated which is 90 days after enactment it does not provide for personaluse imports from any other country the gregg bill allows personaluse imports from enactment even if the secretary has not issued regulations it also requires the secretary to promulgate interim final regulations regarding internet pharmacy certification within one year of enactment with licensing to take effect 90 days after that promulgation sidebyside comparison the
