weapons of mass struction wmd the bush administration began military acti on against iraq on march 19 2003 and the regime of saddam hussein fell on april 9 since then us teams have been attempting to

the duelfer report has concl uded that prewar us assessments of iraqs wmd capabilities were mostly incorrect but that analysis of saddams wmd intentions was probably accurate part of the prewar deba over us policy centered on whether iraqs wmd programs could be ended through weapons inspections during 19911998 special commission on iraq unscom made considerable progress in dismantling and monitoring iraqs wmd but was unable to verify iraqs claim that it had destroyed all its wmd and related equipment iraqs refusal of full cooperation with unscom eventua lly prompted usbritish m ilitary

possessed wmd and had active ties to terrorist groups including qaeda formed the core of the administration case for invading iraq however in several speeches senior administration officials including the president maintained that regime change would end horrific regime human rights abuses and pave the way fo r democracy in iraq that would spread throughout the region and deprive terrorist groups

from taking hostile acts against an country upholding resolutions provision that appeared to cover iraqs defiance of the fly zones and 7 provided for the security council to consider how to respond to iraqi non compliance this was interpreted by fr ance and some other c ountries as requiring second resolution to authorize force although the united states disputed that interpretation iraq accepted

thereafter that there were material omissions that constituted further material breach of ir aqs obligations blix criticized the declaration as offering little new inform ation but he did not call it material breach in briefings on the inspections to the security council on january 27 february 14 and march 7 2003 blix and ia ea head mohammad baradei said that iraq had not fully complied with

the search effort focused on investigating and exploiting about 1000 prev iously suspected wmd sites process that yielded few results after that time the isg focused on identifying and interviewing iraqis who could provide information on previously unknown sites and documents or who had direct knowledge of iraqs wmd programs on october 2 2003 kay visited washington to present to members and

an increasingly active and sophisticated resistance kay has said this shift of resources contributed to his decision to resign before completing the wmd search3 in congressional testimony senate armed services on january 28 2004 kay referred to the failure to find actual wmd weapons saying us prewar intelligence on iraqs wmd was almost all wrong and adding that it is highly unlikely that there were large stockpiles of deployed militarized chemical and biological weapons in iraq he also testified that iraq concealed information and activities and therefore clearly violated resolution 1441 nd that iraq certainly had the intentions at point to resume their programs on march 30 2004 duelfer briefed the senate intelligence committee and the senate armed services committee on the continuing wmd search effort he told members that the isg had made ne w breakthroughs but that some new information suggested that iraq might have been developing capability to make wmd on short notice he also said

stockpiles and production efforts but retained the inten tion to erode and evade international sanctions to position itself to eventually resume wmd production according to the report saddam believe that iran remained vital threat to iraqs national survival and that wmd could deter iran and that the us perception that iraq retained wmd could deter potential us attack on iraq the report detailed saddam regime efforts to use loopholes in the unr oilforfood program and other trade agreements to buy political support around th world for the lifting of sanctions and to procure dual use items that

the apparent discrepanc between prewar assertions and ontheground wmd findings prompted number of inquiri shortly after the fall of saddam hussein then cia director george tenet said the cia had begun to compare its prewar intelligence to actual ontheground wmd findings on wmd to determine the quality of the pre war assessments the us intelligence communitys assessment of iraqs prewar wmd was

committee report by the senate intelligence committee product of that committees inquiry was released ju ly 9 2004 it was highly critical of the intelligence communitys prewar assessments6 citing the community for misinterpreting ambiguous evidence to fit preconceived presumption about iraqs wmd group think p18 the report said the committee did not find evidence that administration officials pressured cia analysts to skew their judgments and the report did not examine how senior policymakers portrayed or used the intelligence assessments the report also asserted that the intelligence community suffered from lack of sources close to the regime and relied too heavily on information from iraqi exiles who had an interest in whether the united states took military action against saddam hussein some senior officials including secretary of state powell and then cia director george tenet in speech given at ge orgetown university february 5 2004 available online at httpwwwciagovci apublic_affairsspeech have cited information from the isgs october 2003 interim report to assert that wmd programs were present in prewar iraq and that us prewar intelligence was not necessarily completely wide of the mark late october 2003 press report quoted general james clapper head of the national imagery and mapping agency as expressing his own view that iraq might have moved some wmd materiel to syria prior to the march 2003 start of the war although other us officials have presented evidence to credit that theory7 some believe that the few chemical munitions found in iraq since may 2004 discussed further below might yet demonstrate that iraq had more substan tial wmd stockpiles although the duelfer report casts doubt on that possibility the failure to find substantial wmd in ir aq has led to rene wed debate over the justification for the 2003 invasion secret ary of state powell told journalists on february 2 2004 that he does not know whether he would have recommended invasion of iraq had he known what he now knows about the state of iraqs wmd programs8 and he has since pressed the cia to account for why the information given him for his february 5 2003 pr esentation has proved wide of the mark most other senior officials including the president say that the duelfer reports findings that saddam retained intenti ons to restart wmd programs provides justification for the war the following summarizes outstanding issues on iraqs wmd us assessments and us postwar findings httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32379crs8 nuclear program from 19922003 successive

march 7 2003 that the iaea believed the tubes were for use in conventional rocket programs although their importation was not legal under the international sancti ons regime then cia di rector tenet asserted in february 2004 that the issue of aluminum tube procurement is still open because the tubes found thus far do not match precise iraqi specifications another allegation contained in president bushs january 2003 state of the union speech but not in the white paper said iraq had tried to buy large quantities of uranium from africa niger but the iaea said in march 2003 report that documents alleging this procurement of uranium from niger were not authentic the white house stated in july 2003 that the allegation should not ve been included in the state of the union speech because of cia doubts about that information although some british officials maintain that the allegation may still be valid the iaea said on january 27 2003 that it had found evidence iraq had restarted nuclear

report findings the september 30 2004 duelfer report largely reiterated but so expanded on early findings released by the isg the duelfer report said the isg had discovered further evidence of the maturity and significance of the pre1991 iraq i nuclear program but found that iraqs ability to reconstitute nuclear weapons program progressively decay ed after that date and that the isg found evidence to suggest c oncerted efforts to restart the program the report adds that the isg found limited number of post1995 activities that would have aided the rec onstitution of the nuclear w eapons program once sanctions were lifted the report referred specifica lly to regime efforts to retain nuclear scientific talent in their jobs there were some unconfirmed press reports in october 2004 that
