extensive revision of the dc code incl uding parts of the district of columbia home rule act in addition the report c onsiders to what extent congress would be required to legislate to implement this reorganization it would appear likely that the dc council has sufficient authority to reorganize an independent agency such as the board of education including defining the boards powers duties and responsib ilities however th council may not have the necessary budgetary authority to allocat funds to individual schools nor may it delegate such authority to the mayor thus although it would appear that the council could engage in significant reor ganization of the board under the proposed bill congressional implementa tion would appear to be needed to address the public school budget

note 1 district of columbia school reform proposal authority of the dc council to implement introduction this report addresses the authority of the district of columbia council to implement proposed reorganization of the di strict of columbia board of education specifically the report addresses the aut hority of the council to implement the proposed district of columbia public education reform amendment act of 2007 hereinafter education reform bill1 bill currently being considered by the council2 in addition the report considers to what extent congress would be required to legislate to implement this reorganization the education reform bill is comprehensive proposal to change the governing structure of the district of columbia school system and to delegate significant authority over the public schools to the mayor it involves extensive revision of the dc code including parts of the district of columbia home rule act home rule act3 although the home rule ac t provides the dc council with extensive legislative authority it also includes certain limitations consequently the question arises as to whether these limitations would apply to the education reform bill necessitating congressional action to implement the bill power of dc council under the home rule act background the home rule act provides the dc council with broad power over district affairs in that the legislative power of the district shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation within the district consistent with the constitution of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33912crs2 4 home rule act

at 495 the makeup of the board has since been modified see supra note 14united states and the provisions of this chapter4 however this power is subject to variety of limitations and congress retains ultimate authority to legislate in way that may limit this power5 one of the primary limitations is that the dc council may not amend the home rule act unless it is pursuant to power granted elsewhere in that act6 this limitation would appear to be the one most significant to the instant legislation7 as passed by congress the home rule act provided that the districts of columbia public schools were to be cont rolled by the district of columbia board of education and that the board was to consist of members elected by the citizens of the district8 the education reform bill provides that the control of board of education over thedistrict of columbia public schools w ould be significantly limited thus the question arises as to whethe r the district of columbia council has the authority to amend this portion of the home rule act authority to reorganize the school board the home rule act does provide the c ouncil with significant authority for governmental reorganization specifically 404b of the home rule act provides that the council shall have authority to cr eate abolish or organize any office agency department or instrumentality of the government of the district and to define the powers duties and responsibilities of any such office agency department or instrumentality the education reform bill specifically not this language as support for the reorganization of the public

16 id at 401 495separate cabinetlevel agency subordinate to the mayor to be known as the district of columbia public schools9 it should be noted that 404b does not specifically grant the district of columbia council authority over the board of education or over boards generally the district of columbia board of educa tion however is characterized in the home rule act as an independent agency10 thus the question arises as to whether an independent agency in the district of colu mbia is an office agency department or instrumentality of the government and is thus amenable to such reorganization the district of columbia board of ducation was created by congress in 1906 and its nine members were appointed by the judges of the supreme court of the district of columbia the board of education was given control including determination of gene ral educational policy appointment of teach ers and selection and supervision of the superintendent11 in 1968 congress changed the method of selecting the board of education to election by district citizens five years later the home rule act established the board of education as one of five independent agencies operating independently of the executive or legislative branches of the district government12 under the home rule act the board of education retained all authority previously granted to it by congress including control of the public schools more recently however the board of education has undergone significant reorganization in 2000 the dc counc il passed the school governance charter amendment act of 200013 this act authorized referendum in the district of columbia as to whether to change the current size and authority of the board of education by amending the district of columbia home rule act14 the referendum was authorized under the ch arter amendment process15 an alternative to directly amending the home rule act which authorizes the council to provide for referendums to amend any part of title iv of the home rule act16 such as the organization of the board of educationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33912crs4 17 id at 303dcodified at 120303 the ame nding procedure provided in this section may not be used to enact any law or affect any law with respect to which the council may not enact any act resolution or rule under the limitations specified in 120601 to 120603 18 pl 106226 2000 see hr rep 106664 2000 19 132 f3d 775 dc cir 1998 20 pl 1048 1995her einafter frmaa 21 frmaa 207dthe power to amend the home rule act by referendum is subject to the same limitations as the power of the dc council17 it should also be noted that although congress did pass legislation regarding the school governance charter amendment act of 2000 the legislation merely addressed the imple mentation date and did not purport to authorize the reorganization18 thus with the tac it approval of congress the current procedures used to elect and appoint the board of education follow the referenduma dopted sc hool governance charter amendment act of 2000 not the original procedure set out in the home rule act thus to the extent that the current reorganization of the board of education is legally valid it would appear that future reorganizations such as under the educa tion reform bill would also be valid although there does not appear to be cas law addressing the issue of whether the dc council has the authority to re organize the board of education under 404b of the home rule act there is rela ted case law that may be relevant to this discussion in shook v district of columb ia financial responsibility and management assistance authority 19 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia considered whether the district of columbia financial responsibility and management assistance authority the control board which temporarily controlled the governance of the district of columbia had the authority to significantly reduce the authority of the board of education in 1995 congress found that the district government was in the midst of fiscal emergency in response it passe d the district of columbia financial responsibility and mana gement assistance act of 1995 frmaa20 which established fivemember c ontrol board with widerang ing powers to improve the district governments operations in 1996 congress amended the act so that the control board could issue such orders rules or regulations as it considers appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act and the amendments made by this act to the extent that the issuance of such an order rule or regu lation is within the authority of the mayor or the head of any department or agency of the district government and any such order rule or regulation shall be legally binding to the same extent as if issued by the mayor or the head of any such department or agency21 under this section the control bo ard issued an order reorganizing administration of the districts public sc hools they established ninemember emergency transitional education board of trustees to assume responsibility for the operation and management of the district of columbia public school system andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33912crs5 22 132 f3d at 777 23 see eg frmaa 207a3 empowering the c ontrol board to make recommendations relating to the structural relationship of depa rtments agencies and independent agencies 24 see acron inv v federal sav loan in s corp 363 f2d 236 239 9th cir 1966 an independent agency is less an agency in the ordinary sense of the word 25 see frmaa 301a1c the districts budg et is defined to include appropriations or loan or spending authority for all activities of all departments or agencies of the district of columbia id at 302c11 the chie f financial officer is assigned the duty of maintaining custody of all pub lic funds of the district government or any department or agency of the district government 26 frmaa 2a2 27 132 f3d at 779781delegated all the authority powers functions duties responsibilities exemptions and immunities of the board of education the board of education was left with the authority only to license charter school s and to provide advice to the board of trustees although its president was made member of the board of trustees22 this order by the control board was ch allenged by school board members who argued among other things that the board s power to issue legally binding orders to the same extent as if issued by the mayor or the head of any such department or agency did not apply to the board of ducation because the board was designated under the home rule act as an independent agency ju st as the question can be posed whether the dc councils authority to create abolish or organize any agency includes the board of education so the question was posed whether the control boards power over agencies extende d to the board thus the resolution of the shook case may inform the instant question in the shook case the school board members noted that in other places in the frmaa congress differentiated between agencies and independent agencies23 the control board on the other hand argued th at the plain meanin g of any agency would include any independent agency because the greater includes the lesser24 the control board also noted places in frmaa such as provisions regarding thedc budget where the single word agen cy was understood to include the board of education 25 the dc circuit in turn noted that the preamble to the frmaa suggested broader interpretation of the rm agency as it included finding that the district of columbia government fails to provide its citizens with effective and efficient services in ar eas such as education26 finally the court noted that the legislative history did not indicate that congress inte nded to exclude independent agencies like the board of education fro m the control boards power under the act ultimately the court concluded that the term agency as used in the relevant portion of the frmaa should in clude independent agencies27 although this statutory interpretation was done in the context of the frmaa not the home rule act there are certain parallels to the instant question for instance as with frmaa the home rule act uses the term agency in other places such as in provisions regarding the budget and the term in those placeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33912crs6 28 for instance the term budget under the home rule act is broadly defined to mean the entire request for appropriations and loan or spending authority for all activities of all agencies of the district financed from all exis ting or proposed resources and shall include both operating and capital expenditures home rule act 10315 emphasis added other provisions of the home rule act appear to confirm that the board of education while maintaining some budget autonomy was intended to be part of the district of columbia budget with respect to the annual budget fo r the board of educati on in the district of columbia the mayor and the council may establish the minimum amount of funds which will be allocated to the board but may not specify the purposes for which such funds may expended home rule act 452 dc code 120452 see generally barry v bush 581 a2d 308 1990 29 while independent agencies appear to be age ncies of the district they are presumed to have some level of autonomy from the mayor see hazel v barry 580 a2d 110 114 1990 dc public library is independent of the mayor in terms of policy choices personnel choices and other areas arguably this is indicated not by excluding them from the term agency but by otherwise distinguishing them see eg home rule act 422 the mayors power to reorganize offices agencies and other entities is limited to those entities within the executive branch of the government of the district 30 the term agency includes both subordinate agency and independent agency dc 11502 31 hr rep 93219 1973 appears to include independent agencies28 further there is indication in the home rule act that the term agency does not include independent agencies and some indication that such distinctions as do occur between inde pendent agencies and other agencies would be made by using other terminology29 finally the term agency is used in other places in the district of columbia code to include independent agencies30 in some ways council argument that the board of education is amenable to its power may be even stronger than it was for the control board although the control boards power was limited to departments or agencies the dc councils power extends to any office agency department or inst rumentality of the government which appears to be br oad and potentially comprehensive phrase further the legislative history for the home rule act appears to specifically consider independent agencies as amenable to the authority of the district of columbia council the senate report for the ho rule act provides that the functions now vested in the di strict public service commission zoning commission zoning advisory council boar d of zoning adjustment office of the recorder of deeds and armory board may be transferred to the new council however these boards and commission shall continue to function until such time as the council shall make ch changes in function as it deems appropriate31 thus three of the five independent agen cies established by the home rule act the public service commission the z oning commission and the armory board were specifically noted as ag encies that the dc council would have reorganizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33912crs7 32 home rule act 719 providing for the continuation of the bo ard of education 33 see education reform bill 203204 the bill provides that amendments to the home rule act regarding the function of the school board and the dc councils budget authority will only become applicable upon the passage of legislation by congress 34 dc code 120452a these provisions woul d be amended to eliminate this disability see education reform bill at 202authority over why the board of educati on already in existence at the time of the home rule act32 and the election board are not ntioned in this sentence is not clear there does not however appear to be an obvious distinction between the board of education and these other independent entities so as to suggest that congress intended to exclude the board of education from this council authority authority over budget for the public schools there does appear however to be provision of the education reform bill that may require cong ressional action33 title ii of the education reform bill provides for the amendment of the budget authority for the district of columbia schools specifically it would amend the provision of the home rule act that provides the following role of mayor and council with respect to the annual budget for the board of education in the dist rict of columbia the mayor and the council may establish the maximum amount of funds which will be allocated to the board but may not specify the purposes for which such funds may be expended or the amount of such funds which may be expended for the various programs under the jurisdiction of the board of education34 as noted above the dc council has b een granted the power to reorganize independent agencies arguably including the board of education so the question arises as to whether the apparent disa bility imposed on the council and the mayor to direct how board of education funds are used could be evaded by such reorganization or whether as contemplated by the education reform bill the above disability must be removed by congress one might make the argument that the dc council could limit the powers of the boar d of education while still submitting separate budget request for th at entity under this theory as long as the council did not specify how the funds allocated to th newly organized board of education were spent then the proposed reorganization c ould go forward without congress removing the budgetary restrictions impos ed on the council and the mayor there is however further provision of the home rule act that implies that this budgetary restriction could not be evad ed at the same time that the daytoday supervision of the individual public schools is delegated to an entity besides the school board this provision provides that the board of education budget plan submitted under this subsection shall include detailed presentation of how much money will be allocated to each school including specific descri ption of the amount of funds available to the school for which spending decisi ons are under the control of the schoolhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33912crs8 35 home rule act 452 dc code 120452b2and b specific description of other responsibility center funds which will be spent in manner directly benefitting the school including funds which will be spent for personnel equipment and supplies property maintenance and student services35 this quoted language would indicate th at the congress clearly intended that neither the dc council nor the mayor w ould have the authority to direct the allocation of funds to indi vidual public schools as noted earlier the councils authority to reorganize agencies would appear to apply even to entities that were established under the home rule such as the school board however because congress has imposed specific disability on the dc councils ability to direct how funds are to be allocated among the different schools this language appears to be an exception to those powers to reorganize fu rther it is unlikely that the council could delegate such authority to the mayor b ecause he is similarly precluded by the quoted language from allocating these funds conclusion in conclusion it would appear likely that the dc council has sufficient authority to create abolish or organize or define the powers duties and responsibilities of i ndependent agencies including the board of education however the council may not have the n ecessary budgetary authority to allocate funds to individual schools nor may it delegate such author ity to the mayor thus although it would appear that the council c ould engage in significant reorganization of the board under the education reform bill congressional imp lementation would appear to be needed to address the pub lic schools budget restri ctions provided for under the home rule act
