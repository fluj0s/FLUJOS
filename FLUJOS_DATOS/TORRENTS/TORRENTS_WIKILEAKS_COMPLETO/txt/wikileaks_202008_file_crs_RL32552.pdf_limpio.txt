income and employment ove rsight on recommendations of the 1979 social security advisory council statement of he nry aaron chairman of the advisory council on social security comm pub 96230 march 11 and 13 1980 p 13history of taxing social security benefits until 1984 social security benefits were exempt from the federal income tax the exclusion was based on rulings made in 1938 and 1941 by the department of the treasury bureau of internal revenue the predecessor of the internal revenue service the 1941 bureau ruling on oasdi pa yments viewed benefits as being for general welfare and reasoned that subjecting the payments to income taxation would be contrary to the purposes of social security14 under these rules the treatment of social security benefits was similar to that of certain types of government transfer payments such as aid to families with dependent children supplementa l security income and black lung benefits this was in sharp contrast to thencurrent rules for retirement be nefits under private pension plans the federal civil servi ce retirement system csrs and other government pension systems benefits from these other pension plans were fully taxable except for the portion of total lifetime benefits using projected life expectancy attributable to the employee s own contributions to the system and on which he or she had alr eady paid income tax currently and as in 1941 under social security the workers contribution to the system is his or her share onehalf 50 of the payroll tax officially known as the federal insurance contributions act f ica tax the amount the worker pays into the social security system in fica taxes is not subtracted to determine income subject to the federal income tax and is therefore taxed the employers contributions to the system are not consid ered part of the employees gross income and are deductible from the employers business income as business expense consequently neither the employee or th employer pays taxes on the employers contribution the 1979 advisory council on social secu rity concluded that the 1941 ruling was wrong and that the tax treatment of private pensions wa s more appropriate model for tax treatment of social security benefits15 the council estimated that the most anyone who entered the workforce in 1979 would pay in payroll taxes during his or her lifetime would equal 17 of the so cial security benefits he or she would ultimately receive this was the most an individual would pay in the aggregate workers would make payroll tax payments amounting to substantially less than 17 of their ultimate benefits because of the administrative difficulties involved in determining the taxable amount of each i ndividual benefit th council recommended instead that half of everyones benefit be taxed they justified this ratio as matter of rough justice and noted that it coincided with the portion of the tax the employers share on which income taxes had not been paid this position to tax social security benefits was in contrast to the position of the national commissionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32552crs12 16 social security administration report of the

established by congress in the social security amendments of 1977 pl 95216 the co mmission did not in its 1981 final report include recommendation to tax social security benefits the national commission on social security reform often referred to as the greenspan commission appointed by president reagan in 1981 recommended in its 1983 report16 that beginning in 1984 onehalf 50 of social security cash benefits and tier i benefits payable under the railroa d retirement act be taxable for individuals whose adjusted gross income excluding social security cash benefits exceeded certain thresholds 20000 for si ngle taxpayer and 25000 for married couple with the proceeds of such taxation credited to the social security trust funds the commission did not incl ude any provisions for indexing the threshold amounts the commission estimated that 10 of oasdi recipients would be subject to taxation of benefits the commission acknowledged that the proposal had notch problem in that the extra do llar of income that would put one over the threshold would have had the effect of subjecting fully onehalf 50 of social security benefits to taxa tion but trusted that it woul d be rectified during the legislative process in enacting the 1983 social security amendments pl 9821 congress adopted the commissions recommendation to ta x social security benefits but with formula for determining taxable benefits that gradually increased as persons income rose above the thresholds up to maximum of onehalf 50 of benefits the formula calculated taxable benefits as the lesser of onehal f 50 of benefits or onehalf 50 of the excess of the ta xpayers provisional income over thresholds of 25000 single and 32000 married coupl provisional in come was defined as total income plus certain taxexempt income taxexempt interest plus certain income exclusions plus onehalf 50 of social security benefits at the same time the tax credit for the elderly and disabled was expanded to provide additional tax relief for lower income elderly taxpayers17 in 1993 the social security administra tions office of the actuary estimated that if pension tax rules were applied to social security the ratio of total employee social security payroll taxes to expected benefits for current recipients in 1993 would be approximately 4 or 5 the actuarial estimates were that for workers just entering the workforce18 the ratio would be on average about 7 because social security benefits replaced higher pr oportion of earnings of workers who were lower paid and had dependents and because women had longer life expectancies the workers with the highest ratio of taxes to benefits would be singlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32552crs13 highly paid males the estimated ratio for these workers highly paid malesentering the workforce in 1993 was 15 applying the tax rules for private nd public pensions presents practical administrative problems determining th proper exclusion would be complex for several reasons including calculating the ratio of contributions to benefits for each individual workers account when unlike private pensions several people may receive benefits on the basis of the same workers account president clinton proposed as part of his fy1994 budget proposal that the portion of social security benefits subject to taxation be increased from 50 to 85 effective in tax year 1994 as under thencu rrent law only social security recipients whose provisional income exceeded the thresholds of 25000 single and 32000 married couple were to pay taxes on their benefits also as under thencurrent law the first step was to add onehalf 50 not 85 of benefits to total income because the thresholds and definition of provisional income did not change the measure would only affect recipients alread paying taxes on bene fits however the ratio used to compute the amount of ta xable benefits was increased from 50 to 85 taxing more than 85 of social security benefits t he portion

incomeappendix special considerations under taxation of benefits lump sum distributions social security beneficiary may receive lump sum distribution of benefits for one or more prior years19 in this situation beneficiary has the option of choosing between two methods for calculating the taxable portion of the benefits for prior years 1 the taxpayer may include all of the benefits for prior years in calculating the taxable benefits for the current year or 2 the taxpayer may re calculate the prior year taxable benefits using prior year income and take the difference between the recalculated taxable benefits and the taxable benefits reported in each prior year in computing the taxable portion of benefits in prior years the provisional income for the prior years is adjusted gross income plus tax exempt interest plus the excluded income as deta iled earlier plus the addition or addback of the adjustment for student loan intere st plus onehalf 50 of social security benefits repayments sometimes social security beneficiary must repay prior overpayment of benefits in this case the calculation of taxable social security benefits is based on the net benefits gross benefits less the repayment married taxpayers filing joint tax return would use the total of the net social security benefits for the tax year received by each party taxpayer plus spous if however the repayment results in negative net social security benefits there are two consequences for taxes 1 there are taxable social security benefits and 2 the taxpayer may take miscellaneous deduction20 as part of itemized deductions or credit for the negative net social security benefits if the negative net so cial security benefits are less than 3000 the taxpayer must include negative net social security benefits in miscellaneous deductions for computing itemized deductions if the negative net social security benefits are greater than 3000 the taxpay er must compute the current year tax liability two ways 1 using the negative balance as miscellaneous deduction for computing itemized deductions and 2 recomputing the taxes without the overpayment income for the prior years in which an overpayment was received and subtracting these amounts from the prior year taxes paid and then subtracting this result the sum of the differences in prio r year taxes from the current year tax liability if the tax liability computed using the negative balance as miscellaneous deduction is lower the taxpayer claims the deduction if the tax liability from re computing prior years taxes is lower the taxpayer claims tax credit equal to the sum of the prior year tax differenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32552crs16 21 internal revenue service publication 915 provides lists of the countries whose citizens as nonresident
