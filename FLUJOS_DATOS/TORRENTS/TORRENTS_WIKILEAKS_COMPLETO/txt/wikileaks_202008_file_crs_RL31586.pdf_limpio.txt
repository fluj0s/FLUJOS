summary the german parliamentary electi ons of september 22 2002 returned chancellor gerhard schroede r and his redgreen coalition by the narrowest of margins the chancellor begins his second term weakened by the slimness of his coalitions majority in parliament and th lack of clear mandate from the voters he must deal with serious economic problem s left over from his first term he also faces the challenge of overcoming tensions with the united states brought on by his sharp campaign statements condemning us iraq policy that may have won him the election many now wonder whether schroeder will exercise fiscal discipline and take unpopular steps needed to rest ructure the economy the eu is at critical stage in its further evolution and needs germanys very active leadership to meet the challenges of enlargement and continued progress as an economic and political entity here germanys economic stagna tion and domestic preoccupations could hurt eu efforts to move forward on th european security and defense policy esdp are also affected by need for germanys action germany supports esdp but unless it increases its defense spe nding substantially serious european defense capability is likely germany is primary supporter of the eus further enlargement for eu enlargement to move forward some very difficult agreements need to be concluded on thorny issues such as the common agricultural policy cap the most serious immediate fallout from the election may be to usgerman relations some observers are confident that these incidents represent relatively minor tiff that will soon blow over othe rs are less certain about the impact noting that this episode may reflect deeper unde rlying differences that have accumulated over time germany remains one of the most important us allies but differences on policy and principle pushed aside by the events of september 11 2001 and germanys immediate offer of unprecedente d support for the united states have resurfaced if differences continue to m ount some are concerned that they could begin to erode the foundations of the relationship the cons equences of such trend could be serious for bilatera l relations the

decide the makeup of the next government depending on which major party it agreed to join in coalition german elections of 2002 aftermath and implications for the united states introduction the german parliamentary electi ons of september 22 2002 returning chancellor gerhard schroeder and his redgreen coalition by the narrowest of margins ended an election campaign that saw several lead changes for the first time unaffiliated swing voters were the largest single group year earlier the popular chancellor had seemed invincible subsequently the christian democratic union cduchristian social union csu ca ndidate bavarian csu leader edmund stoiber focusing on the economy was ab to overtake schroeder and build sizeable lead in the polls by the summer of 2002 based on results of state elections and national polls resurgent free democratic party fdp liberal party in the classic european sense was thought inco rrectly to be poised to assume the king maker role1 as the green party seemed to be fa ding in the days leading up to the election chancellor schroede r boosted in eastern germany by his quick handling of postflood recovery there and the per ceived ineffectiveness of the stoiber campaign pulled even with his main rival analysts had predicted that foreign policy would play little role in the outcome of the elections chancellor schroeders strong stance of unlimited solidarity with the united states after the terrorist atta cks of 911 had wide public support his decision to commit german military forces to the war on terrorism an unprecedented and politically risky move so had popular approval the election campaign centered on domestic issues until the final days when the social democratic party spd leader made iraq central campaign focus the election outcome with 79 percent of the eligible popula tion voting the final outcome of the election was extremely close returning the centerleft social democrats and environmentalist greens to power with very narrow majority in the bundestag the spd and the centerright christian democrats cdu in alliance with their sister party in bavaria the chris tian social union csu each got 385 percent of the vote close to what the final polls had shown the surprise shift in the final results was the stronger than expected showing of the greens with 86 percent of the vote and the weaker performance of the fdp at 74 percent as expected the party of democratic socialism pds the successor party to the former communist party of easthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31586crs2 germany with 42 percent did not make the 5 percent threshold although two pds candidates did get seats in the bundestag by virtue of their direct election as result the majority coalition gained 306 seats in the bundestag 251 seats for the spd and 55 for the greens the cducsu won 248 seats the fdp gained 47 seats and the pds gained 2 seats far right candidates won election to the bundestag coalition talks between the spd and greens began days after the elections the new bundestag is required to convene by october 22 2002 its first task will be to elect the new bundestag president the current president wolfgang thierse is expected to be reelected the formal vote for chancellor will follow chancellor schroeder and the spd are be lieved to have been helped by the power of incumbency and the general germ an preference for continuity over change he was able to showcase his political skills and more dynamic style in the first ever direct tv debates between candidates for chancellor his quick and effective leadership in responding to the emergenc caused by severe flooding helped him especially among east germans in the end though the iraq issue may have been decisive in the outcome especially since it diverted public attention from the economic issues on which mr schroeder was most vulne rable the chancellor played to widespread antiwar sentiment in germany especially core spdgreen voters and voters in east germany declar ing that he would not support us led military action against iraq even if it d security council approval his position echoed the sentiments of majority of germans but his decision to use attacks on us policy as campaign tool was seen as highly unusual he may have been hurt among some voters by what they saw as rhetorical excesses over iraq that went beyond the criticism from other eu partne rs particular embarrassment was his justice minister herta daeublergmelins reported statement making comparisons between president bush and adolf hitler for which her resignation was accepted the day after the election the spd was also tarnished by scandals over payments received from lobbyists that led to the firi ng of defense minister rudolf scharping and party financing scandal in the state of northrhinewestphalia similar to those that had earlier undone the cdu the greens and the governing coalition were helped by the energetic campaign waged by green party leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer who personally has the highest approval rating among german politicians as the traditionally pacifist leaning party the greens may have picked up much of the last minute antiwar vote the outcome reversed steady decline in green party fortunes that had led many observers to write off any possibility that it would be returned to government matter which party won the most votes the practical realities and tradeoffs of being in the governing coalition led green officials to support government decisions that were alien to their environmenta list and pacifist base the greens also had to face scandal with the forced resignation of their domestic affairs spokesman cem ozdemir pr ominent politician of turkish decent in selecting bavarian leader stoiber as their candidate for chancellor the cducsu bypassed angela merkel the cu rrent cdu chairperson she would have been the first woman and the first east ge rman nominated for the position in light of the election outcome especially the partys weak showing in eastern germany the decision to go with stoiber may be s econd guessed by some edmund stoibershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31586crs3 appeal was tied to his strong record on ec onomic and education policy as csu leader of bavaria germanys most prosperous st ate his effort to defeat chancellor schroeder on the issue of his economic record for time seemed to be working but in the end did not succeed several reasons have been suggested including schroeders success at changing the subj ect away from the economy stoibers own timid and unclear campaign approach to ec onomic reform the widespread belief that the cost of german reunification rather th an bad government policies is the cause of the countrys economic problems and th reality that most germans are still relatively welloff and riskaverse to radical change he tried also to capitalize on reports showing the steep decline in the level of german education compared to other industrialized countries and compared to ba varia in germany education policy is determined by the states he made immigra tion central issue opposing more liberal policies and recommendations he presented himself as th law and order candidate calling for more aggressive efforts to root out extremists and terrorists in the aftermath of the qaeda attacks on the united states stoiber also criticized chancellor schroe der for not offering stronger support to america in fighting terrorism and fo r the vehemence of his opposition to the united states on iraq however once it became clear how well schroeders antiwar message was playing with voters stoiber appeared to flipflop stressing that he too would not support german particip ation in an iraq war stoiber faced an uphill battle from the star t it was not clear whether germans outside southern germany would be ready to accept bavarian as leader given the strong regional differences among germany s protestant north eastern germany and the roman catholic south by comparison to the more dynamic schroeder stoiber was seen by many as plodding and oldfashioned still the election outcome virtual tie between stoiber nd schroeder was not seen as complete defeat stoiber was able to bring the cducsu back from ruin in the 1998 elections following the financial scandal that led to the departure of chancellor helmut kohl the drop in support for the fdp after the partys steady gains may have been the biggest factor in stoibers defeat for ch ancellor although even if the fdp had done much better it might have sided either with the cdu or spd state election results and public opinion polls showed solid gains for the fdp in the year leading up to the elections fdp leaders defined their goal as winning 18 percent of the vote the fdp ran as the liberal free market reform party pressing for structural changes in the german economy cuts in industry subsidie s lower taxes changes to the german collective bargaining system cuts in non wage worker benefits reform of the education system and more proamer ican foreign policy the partys unexpectedly weak showing in the election may have resulted in part from the decision not to signal whom they would join in coalition in advance of the vote the fdp likely was also hurt by the controve rsy over remarks by its deputy chairman jurgen mölleman attacking israeli policie s toward the pales tinians under arial sharon in way that some construed as antisemitic as he engaged in public dispute with german jewish leaders although fdp chairman guido westerwelle condemned such remarks and asked möllema n to apologize the issue did not go away and proved to be an embarrassment for the party following the election mölleman was forced to resignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31586crs4 the pds probably lost votes to the spd as result of chancellor schroeders quick help to victims of the flooding in eas t germany it was also weakened by the forced resignation of its most prominent leader gregor gysi over his illegal personal use of frequent flyer miles earned while on official duty charge that has ensnared number of politicians election aftermath and implications gerhard schroeder begins his second term as chancellor weakened by the slimness of his coalitions majority in parliament and the lack of clear mandate from the voters he faces series of problems left over from his first term especially high unemployment and economic stagnati on to right the economy he is expected to have to make difficult and painful choices he also faces the challenge of overcoming or managing the tensions with the united states that could affect not only transatlantic relations but european relations and german domestic politics as well chancellor schroeder has identified himself as new type of german leader and new social democrat in the tony blai r mold who is not wedded to traditional pro labor socialist policies in his first term he introduced large income tax cuts eliminated some capital gains taxes and won passage of an immigration law however facing the likelihood of election feat he returned to traditional spd pro labor union positions in the campaign many now wonder whether he will be willing to exercise fiscal discipline and take unpopular steps needed to restructure the economy the new government is promising to restrict federal spending cut the deficit and achieve balanced budget by 2006 he needs to balance germanys need for greater labor mobility and flexibility with the spd commitment to worker security the chancellor has accepted the recommendations of the hartz commission to partially deregulate the labor market in order to create jobs and reduce unemployment experts think germany will have to bring down labor costs which are among the highest in the world such steps would have the support of business leaders who have long called for similar changes it is not clear whether he will have broader s upport especially among his spd base he has already had to postpone the next round of proposed tax cuts because of the costs of recovery from recent flooding chancellor schr oeder will be under strong pr essure to meet his thus far unfulfilled promise to reduce unemployment sharply from its level of almost 10 percent in foreign policy chancellor schroeder prides himself with having returned germany to normalcy among nations c ountry like others that acts and speaks out in its own national selfinterest and is less hesitant to seek influence commensurate with its size and economic strength as the worlds third largest economy in pursuing distinctly german interests in bilateral relations in the european union and on broader international i ssues and sometimes talking about distinct german way some worry that schroeder may be deemphasizing the two traditional pillars of german foreign policy transatlantic ties and an eu policy centered on the francogerman relationship such concerns may be overstated as german officials emphasize that the country will not go it alone however the challenges of reunification have absorbed much of germ anys attention and resources over the pasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31586crs5 2 the international institute for strategic studies the military balance 20012002 p299decade arguably this has made germany more inwardly focused and kept it from exercising stronger leadersh ip in europe and the world germany has traditionally been the engine of eu economic growth and further political development germany still views the eu as central to its political and economic future other eu members account for almost 50 of germanys trade germany is key actor in setting eu policy and the largest net contributor to the eu budget the eu is at critical stage in its further evolution and needs germanys very active leadership by persuasion and example to meet the challenges of enlargement and continued progress as an economic and political entity this is where germanys economic stagnation nd domestic preoccupations could hurt germanys economic growth continues to lag behind the other twelve members of the eurozone germany has been unable to meet some of its eu commitments the german budget deficit this year could exceed the 3 percent limit allowed under the eu stability and growth pact eu efforts to move forward on the european security and defense policy esdp are also affected by germanys failure to do its part germany supports esdp but unless it increases its defense spe nding substantially and grapples seriously with reforming its armed forces robus t european defense capability is unlikely german defense spending remains at rough ly 16 of gdp as compared with the united states at over 3 france at 26 and britain at 242 germany is primary supporter of the eu s further enlargement as means to ensure political and economic stability on ge rmanys eastern border germany sees its prosperity as tied to the fortunes of candidate countries germany is the major western trading partner of every country in central and eastern europe and leading source of foreign direct investment for enlargement to move forward some very difficult agreements need to be concluded on thorny issues such as the common agricultural policy cap and several other eu issues also chancellor schroeders strained relations with french president chirac add to the difficulty of finding common ground by contrast chancellor schr oeder and prime minster tony blair have very good working relationship th at has brought germany and britain closer in the eu usgerman relations the most serious immediate fallout from the election may be to usgerman relations gerhard schroeders decision to make us policy in iraq central campaign theme and the perceived excesses of his antius rhetoric touched raw nerve in the white house administra tion spokesmen called schroeders remarks poisonous and over the top unbefitting an ally they were particularly incensed by his justice ministers comparison of president bush to adolf hitler and schroeders failure to fire her immediately although she was forced to resign the day after the election schroeder did not get the customary us message of congratulations following his election victory and his initial steps to make amends were brushed asidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31586crs6 3 william drozdiak in the washington post september 8 2002 4 environmental concerns are big issue in germany especially with the greens in government germans are still very upset over us opposition to the kyoto protocol on climate change they do not understand the us opposition to and wanting to exempt its continuedsome observers are confident that these incidents represent relatively minor tiff brought on by the heat of battle in the german elections since relations are too important for either side to allow to deteriorate they are confident that the tensions will soon blow over they argue that ch ancellor schroeder in his election bid was playing to antiwar rather than antiamerican sentiment however others are less certain about the impact noting that this episode may represent deeper underlying differences that have accumulated over time and that could end up fundamentally altering the relationship in terms of the immediate issue of iraq the us administration probably never expected that germany would or could play direct role in any military action the german government is unlikely to change its views on iraq but may mute its criticism particularly if saddam hussein balks at inspections the security council gives its approval fo r military action and if othe r major european countries decide to participate germany might offe r indirect help such as increasing its role in the balkans and assuming command of the international force in afghanistan if the german government were to refuse th use of us bases on its soil for operations in iraq that could present serious pr oblems for military planners although some german politicians have called for such stance the government has given indication that it would take the step germany remains one of the most important us allies the german government plays constructive role in nato and is supportive of the united states in the european union the united stat continues to station some 70000 troops in germany germany is key tradin g partner and major source of foreign investment in the united states as is the united states for germany membership in the north atlantic alliance and close relationship with the united states have also been the basis of german foreign policy since the foundation of the federal republic regardless of who formed the ge rman government and largely unaffected by partisan politics fundame ntally the schroeder gove rnment policy toward the united states has been consistent with previous governments despite initial uncertainty about some leaders in the spd green coalition like green party foreign minister joschka fischer who played an active part in the 1968 student protests which were often directed against us policies germany is principal us military partner in the balkans and afghanistan nd number of its forces is second only to those of the united states in the latter germans have generally positive attitude toward the united states and share us mocratic values americans and germans at least the general publics are not even too far apart on major issues such as the threat posed by terrorism and saddam hu ssein according to recent poll sponsored by the german marshall fund and the chicago council on foreign relations3 differences on policy and principle have been apparent in number of areas since the bush administration took office4 to some extent these were pushed asidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31586crs7 4 continued citizens from the creation of an international cr iminal court they continue to support arms control and are critical of us withdrawal from the antiballistic missile treaty and the us emphasis on missile defense by the events of september 11 2001 when there was strong outpouring of german sympathy and solidarity with americans chancellor schroeder showed courage and resolve by getting the bundestag to agree to deploy troops for the first time on combat mission outside of europe to af ghanistan and elsewhere narrowly winning vote of noconfidence however with the passage of time since the events of september 11 differences have resurfaced the german government is still very supportive in the fight against terrorism but german experts and the media have been increasingly critical of the us approach germans see terrorism as just one of many problems facing them rather than an allconsuming struggle over the past three decades germany has experienced numerous terrorist attacks at home and against its citizens abroad many germans also feel that the united states is relying too heavily on military instruments and solutions as the war has expanded beyond af ghanistan germans have become increasingly worried about next steps pres ident bushs axis of evil remarks in his state of the union speech linking iraq iran and north korea received very negative response in germany german offi cials did not agree with the assessments and many germans began to question underlying us motives since 2000 germany has sought to improve its relations with iran and recently signed new trade agreement the united states on the other hand sees german and other european approaches to dealing with countries such as iran and iraq as not facing up to the longer term proliferation threat such regimes pose while pursuing short term commercial interests the us administration receives critic ism from germany nd other allies over what are seen as narrowly selfserving u s policies and us tendency increasingly to decide and act on its own or consult pa rtners only after deci sions are made when their assistance is needed without taking their views seriously into account german observers recognize this as consequence of the growing gap in us and allied military power and capabilities nevertheless they see contributions of allies as being underappreciated and the permanent us alliances as being undervalued while the administration draws on shor tterm coalitions of the willing several key factors color german views first germans are extremely sensitive about issues of war and killing given the historical context most have viewed this as positive aspect of germanys evoluti on but it explains the german reluctance to support the use of force in most circum stances the deep concern over the collateral damage to civilians and the puzzlement over the us readiness to go to war it may also explain the passion of german opposition to the death penalty the schroeder government has s hown in kosovo and afghanis tan that it can take military action and even win public support when the need is clearly articulated and recognized although it is telling that th germans do not use the term war to describe the campaign against terrorism regarding iraq german officials like manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31586crs8 europeans are not convinced of an imminent thr eat or that war is necessary to control saddam hussein second historical experien ce has also raised sensitivities about compromising the application of the rule of law and civil liberties even for the sake of security german officials are at odds with the united states concerning the status of prisoners particularly the qaeda and taliban detainees in guantanamo bay foreign minister joschka fisc her has argued that all detainees should be granted formal status as prisoners of war germans have also criticized us plans to use military tribunals to try at l east some of the terrorist spects cooperation regarding captured terrorists has been complicated by german laws and regulations on the us side there has been some impatience with the slow pace of german arrests of suspected terrorists german law does not allow extradition of person wanted by another country if there is possib ility that person might be executed as result germany has interpreted its laws to forbid even provision of evidence relating to such case if that information might lead to the imposition of death sentence the united states has been seeking to obtain documents from germany related to the case of 20th hijacker z acarias mou ssaoui thus far unsuccessfully the german government has indicated that it would provide the information sought if it received assurances that moussaoui would not receive the death sentence based on that information given the evidence that key terro rist cells were based in germany this issue could be continuing irritant the united states in turn is critical of german approaches to some problems us and even some german experts blame the german government for downplaying the threat posed by terrorists and rog ue states that possess weapons of mass destruction us officials continue to call on the german government to commit more resources to strengthening and adapting german defense capabilities in order to meet the emerging security challenges they have been frustrated by the slow progress of german military restructur ing and reform on the books since 2000 due to budget cuts germanys limited lift capab ility to move its forces beyond german territory was demonstrated by the dela ys in deploying troops to afghanistan the concern among some observers is th at as differences continue to mount they could begin to erode the foundations of the relationship since the end of the cold war there is mutually recognized clear and present danger that dictates that the two countries must stand together at any cost increasingly there are voices on both sides questioning the continued relevance of the alliance some in germany see the threats faced by the united states as reaction to us policies and therefore not equally facing them or facing them only because of their association with the us on the us side some goitalone advocates see allies primarily as an impediment to us freedom of action while not contributing much to us strength at present these are decidedly minority views most still see the alliance as very relevant to the continued we llbeing of both countries ho wever if the united states and germany were to drift apart the c onsequences could be very serious beyond bilateral relations further european inte gration could be set back as individual eu and nato countries tried to position th emselves in the new environment alternately to maintain its cohesion europe as w hole could distance itself from the united states making use u relations far more difficult
