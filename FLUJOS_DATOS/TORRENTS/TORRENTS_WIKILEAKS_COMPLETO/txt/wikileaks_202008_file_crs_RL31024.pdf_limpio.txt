of 1998 fair pl 105270 and office of management and budget omb circular a76 are intertwined given the bush administrations emphasis on competitive sourcing which is one of the elements of the presidents management agenda congress may wish to revisit fair and circular a76 fair is in some respects an extension of circular a76 and it was implemented through 1999 revision to the circular fair levies statutory requirement on agencies to provide inventories of commercial activities provides challenge and appeal process and statutorily defines inherently governmental activities ie functions unsuitable for contracting out fair does not require agencies to compete or convert directly any of the activities listed on their inventories although the initial implementation of fair was successful with regard to compiling annual inventories it revealed areas needing improvement omb responded in 2000 2002 and 2003 with additional guidance initially issued in 1966 omb circular a76 rests on policy of subjecting commercial activities to publicprivate competition circular a76 requi res agencies to submit annual inventories of their commercial activities and inherently governmental activities to the federal budget agency and provides guidance for agencies to use in determining whether to make or buy particular commercial service commercial activity is good or service that could be obtained from the private sector and that is not inherently governmental the essence of an inherently governmental activity is that it involves the discretionary exercise of government authority or monetary commitments early in 2001 two initiatives related to circular a76 and fair began the bush administration initially directed agencies to compete certain percentage of the fulltime equivalents listed on their commercial inventories in summer 2003 the administration eliminated these targets and instead encouraged agencies to develop their own competitive sourcing goals additionally congress directed the thengeneral accounting office to establish panel to examine circular 76 and fair the commercial activities panel cap which was convened by gao issued its report on april 30 2002 following the release of this report and as part of the administrations competitive sourcing initiative omb issued revised circular in may 2003 this report begins with brief history of circ ular a76 review of the its key components and an assessment of the implementation of the circular the section on fair describes how it emerged from series of compromises explains the statutes key provisions and reviews the implementation process including guidance issued by omb the final section addresses recent initiatives notably the presidents competitive sourcing initiative and the commercial activities panel this report will be updated as additional information about the initiative becomes available

government does not have to consider whether it should make or buy goods and services private companies build tanks and buildings manufacture pens and copy machines and make tools and military uniforms because the government does not produce these items and has neither the capability nor the interest to do so it procures them from private industry but in those cases where both government and indust ry are capable of providing the same or comparable commercial goods and services1 government is faced with the make or buy decision guidance for agencies on how to resolve the make or buy question is found in office of management budget omb circular a76 the circular was issued initially in 1966 and has since been revised several times2 the 1999 revision was used to implement the federal activities inventory reform act of 19983 fair fair requires agencies to compile inventories of their functions that could be performed by government or the private sector while circular a76 required for number of years that agencies submit inventories it was not until the enactment of fair that inventories became statutory requirement and that agency participation became widespread the 2003 revision among other things required agencies to submit inventories of their inherently governmental activities eliminated direct conversions that is functions that met certain requirements could be converted to the private sector without the agency having to hold publicprivate competition for each function and established specific time frames for the completion of standard and streamlined competitions 1 commercial activity is good or service that could be obtained from the private sector and that is not inherently governmental photography data processing and management support services are examples of categories of commercial activities an inherently governmental activity is function that is so intimately related to the public interest as to mandate performance by government empl oyees these functions include those activities that require either the exercise of discretion in applying government authority or the making of value judgments in making decisions for the government governmental functions normally fall into two categories 1 the act of governing ie the discretionary exercise of government authority and 2 monetary transactions and entitlements us office of management and budget policy letter on inherently governmental functions federal register vol 57 190 sept 30 1992 p 45100 while the policy letter includes list of activities considered to be inherently governmental appendix and list of activities not considered to be inherently governmental appendix b it also provides guidelines for determining whether function is inherently governmental or not first not every exercise of discretion is evidence that function is inherently governmental second several factors s hould be considered in determining whether transfer of official responsibility would take place with the contracting out of particular function ibid p 45101 while the policy letter distills the essence of the term inherently governmental this concept is still broad enough to be open to interpretation and controversy 2 the federal register entries for major revisions to circular a76 andor the supplemental handbook are vol 44 67 apr 5 1979 pp 2055820566 vol

create in the 1930s committee on government competition with private enterprise 5 in the house of representatives were followed in the 1950s by initiatives with similar focus6 in 1953 the intergovernmental relations subcommittee of the house committee on government operations reported that the number of commercial and industrial activities conducted by government agencies posed real threat to private industry and imperiled the tax structure and recommended that permanent vigorous preventive and corrective program be inaugurated 7 according to the commission on govern ment procurement the commissions on organization of the executive branch of gove rnment in both the 1949 report first hoover commission and 1955 report second hoover commi ssion addressed the issue of competition between the government and private businesses8 the second hoover commission developed 22 recommendations aimed at moderating government competition with the private sector9 between 1953 and 1960 the senate select committee on small business held several hearings on government activities that competed with business10 president dwight d eisenhowers administration issued several policy statements supporting the notion that the federal government should rely on the private sector to provide needed goods and services the bureau of the budget predecesso r of omb issued in 1955 bulletin number 554 4 competitive sourcing refers to selecting sourcegovern ment agency or private s ector contractorthrough competitive process such as the one established by circular a76 outsourcing or contr acting out refers specifically to awarding contract to private sector source this distinction has not always been acknowledged or noticed references to a76 may characterize it as vehicle for outsourcing or alternatively as means for conducting public private competitions the different ways in which a76 is portrayed may result from conflation of the terms outsourcing and competitive outsourcing or may reflect different goals that people have for the program the term privatization is not used in this report because for some it applies specifically and exclusively to the government divestiture of function or agency 5 commission on government procurement report vol 1 washington gpo 1972 p 57 6 in this context government competes with private sector sources in traditional fashion in the marketplace government competition with the private sector also occurs der the auspices of circular a76 which is referred to as competitive process or publicprivate competition for the provision of services to the government itself 7 commission on government procurement report vol 1 washington gpo 1972 p 58 8 ibid 9 commission on organization of the executive branch of the

the federal government will not start or carry on any commercial activity to provide service or product for its own use if such product or service can be procured from private enterprise through ordinary business channels11 two subsequent bulletins numbers 577 feb ruary 5 1957 and 602 september 21 1959 reiterated this policy of governmental reliance on the private sector government policymakers interest in reducing competition between government and the private sector might have been tempered somewhat in the years following the issuance of the three bureau of the budget bulletins by contractingrelated problems or issues that surfaced in the 1960s the problems or issues included concern fo r how government employees were affected by the contracting out of government functions study of contract personnel at an air force base that revealed the contract was more costly than using government employees an opinion from the general counsel of the civil service commission that stated it was illegal for government employees to directly supervise contract employees and department of defense dod study that found that many service contracts were in conflict with civil service laws and were also more costly than inhouse performance 12 mindful of the promise of relying on the private sector to provide goods and services and perhaps the potential pitfalls as well president lyndon b johnsons administration continued what the eisenhower administration had begun and developed the first permanent directive dealing with the issue of governmental reliance on the private sector published in 1966 bureau of the budget circular a76 provided guidance designed to aid agencies in determining whether to make or buy needed goods and services president johnson explained in memorandum to departments and agencies that uniform guidelines and principles were needed to conduct the affairs of the government on an orderly basis to limit budgetary costs and to maintain the governments policy of reliance upon private enterprise 13 in issuing circular a76 the administration came to grips with longsmoldering controversy over federal competition with private industry14 g13g142g162g561g5g152g150g153g152g151g142g151g157g156g561 although circular a76 has been revised many times its chief components except where noted otherwise have remained stable they are

circular a76 has included an explanation of its origins and in doing so reiterated the policy presented initially in the three bureau of the budget bulletins issued in the 1950s as stated in the 1979 revision to the circular the policy was in democratic free enterprise economic syst em the government should not compete with its citizens the private enterprise system characterized by individual freedom and initiative is the primary source of national economic strength in recognition of this principle it has been and continues to be the general policy of the government to rely on competitive private enterprise to supply the products and services it needs 15 substantively the policy of circular a76 remained the same through the 1999 revision in this revision to the circular only few words were changed in the process of governing the government should not compete with its citizens the competitive enterprise system characterized by individual freedom and initiative is the primary source of national economic strength in recognition of this principle it has been and continues to be the general policy of the government to rely on commercial sources to supply the products and services the government needs 16 arguably the policy statement found in the 2003 revision retained the basic thrust of earlier policy statements but is worded differently it reads in part the longstanding policy of the federal government has been to rely on the private sector for needed commercial services to ensure that the american people receive maximum value for their tax dollars commercial activities should be subject to the forces of competition 17 as of 1979 the circular also stated that it is the policy of the federal government to retain governmental functions inhouse and to consider comparative costs18 in discussing this proposed revision an entry in the federal register in 1978 stated the current circular a76 states the governments general policy of relying on the private sector to supply its needs the draft revision expands this policy statement to recognize that governmental functions must be performed by government personnel and that the taxpayer is entitled to economy in government which requires appropriate emphasis on comparative cost 19 the expanded policy statement was incorporated in the 1979 revision of the circular and remained unchanged through the 1999 circular it is the policy of the united states government to achieve economy and enhance productivity retain governmental functions inhouse and rely 15 us office of management and budget

commercial activities was established by the original circular under the heading of administering the policy the bureau of the budget wrote in 1966 each agency will compile and maintain an inventory of its commercial or industrial activ ities having an annual output of products or services costing 50000 or more or capital investment of 25000 or more in addition to such general descriptive information as may be appropriate the inventory should include for each activity the amount of the governments capital investment the amount paid annually for the products or services involved and the basis upon which the activity is being continued under the provisions of this 1966 circular the general descriptive information needed for identifying each activity should be included in the inventory by june 30 1966 22 significant change to this requirement occurred with the issuance of the 2003 revision to the circular which requires agencies to also submit inventories of their inherently

tilts the playing field in favor of the private sector25 the fact that agencies are not required by statute to conduct cost comparison studies is another source of dispute for agency heads and managers this fact means they have latitude to decide how to manage their agencies activities workload and personnel the maintenance and exercise of agency discretion means on the other hand that the private sector is not assured of access to new contracting opportunities g11g150g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 implementation of circular a76 has not always pr oceeded smoothly in the early days of the 76 program implementation was hampered and deemed inequitable because of procedural problems gao reported in 1972 that with few exceptions there were explanations supporting local recommendations that inhouse performance of activities be continued recommendations often were based on the reviewers personal knowledge and there was evidence of the factors that had been considered 26 this problem was acknowledged several years later in written comments accompanying proposed revision agency implementation of omb circular a76 has been heavily criticized as inconsistent and frequently inequitable27 remedy was offered in 1979 with the publication of the supplemental handbook its purpose was to effect changes intended to promote more effective and consistent implementation28 implementation problems reportedly were the catalyst for another revision four years later in announcing proposed change to circular a76 in 1983 omb noted this proposed revision greatly simplifies and shortens the cost comparison procedures and clarifies and strengthens other procedures in the circular that unnecessarily impede its implementation 29 continuing with the same theme 1995 federal register entry explained the need for revision to circular a76 the proposed revision improves upon existing guidance that may have made the cost comparison process unnecessarily difficult or lead sic to less than optimal outcomes 30 another implementation issue has been the degree of agency participation in the a76 program participation rates particularly among civilian agencies have been somewhat low prior to the enactment of fair which made the submission of inventories statutory requirement some agencies failed to submit inventories or failed to submit them on time in 1971 omb gathered data on the status of a76 efforts and discovered that 16 of agency activities had not been reviewed despite the fact that the deadline had been june 30 1968 31 the number of cost comparison studies declined during the 1990s in june 1996 omb requested that agencies submit 25 brian friel study promotes fairness in a76 competitions govexeccom daily briefing dec 23 1999

agencies had not submitted their inventories as of april 199832 gao reported in 1998 that there has been minimal a76 activity among many agencies since the late 1980s with some major civilian agencies such as the departments of education housing and urban development and justice reporting that they have not studied any positions under a76 in the past 11 years moreover despite ombs intention that the march 1996 revision to the a76 supplemental handbook would make a76 more attractive vehicle for agencies to use significant increase in efforts under a76 among civilian agencies are readily evident 33 1987 executive order that levied cost comparison quota on agencies apparently had little effect either on agency participation34 several factors may have contributed to the relatively low participation rate including legislative opposition members of congress hold diverse views on competitive sourcing and outsourcing in addition to voicing their concerns congressional opponents have sponsored successful legislation that levied restrictions on the application of circular a76 these included prohibitions on contractingout specific activities and requirements to maintain minimum staffing levels in certain functions 35 for example pl 102555 prohibited th sale or commercialization of any portion of the weather satellite systems operated by the department of commerce 10 usc 114a2 prohibited the contracting out of department of defense research and development activities and 43 usc 1707204a required that the bureau of land management be managed directly by federal employees 36 although circular a76 promised increased efficiency and cost savings which made it appealing on conceptual level in practice its appeal apparently was diminished by litany of problems experienced by agencies 37 anticipated benefits were overshadowed by agency managers experiences they found the program to be timeconsuming difficult to implement disruptive and threatening to both managers and employees38 as well as expensive and complicated39 the expense to agencies includes study costs and may include transition costs within the department of defense estimates of study costs

estimated to reach 1288000 for fy1997 through fy200542 according to gao the inability of government to calculate accurately the cost of its functions and to verify the savings realized from cost comparisons has undermined major selling point of circular a76 in turn this could have been disincentive to agency participation in 1998 gao reported that the government did not have complete cost data without this data it was difficult to calculate accurately the cost of government function one result was an increased difficulty in carrying out the a76 competitive process 43 with regard to savings gao was unable to verify that the results of federal agencies contracting out decisions have been beneficial and costeffective in the aggregate44 one specific problem was that claims about savings usually were based on initial estimates instead of updated or actual figures45 omb took several steps to encourage agencies to use circular a76 though some judged ombs actions as insufficient omb asserted that the pur pose of the circular was not to convert work from one source to another rather omb saw it as one of many tools46 and means for agencies to develop the most efficient organization at least some agencies shared ombs perspective that the a76 program was one tool among many available to them the availability of an array of management tools coupled with real or perceived a76 implementation problems might have affected agencies participation in the a76 program at congressional hearing w scott gould chief financial officer and assistant secretary for administration us department of commerce described some of the tools available to his agency a76 is one valuable tool among many for achieving our cost efficiency and management performance goals i wish to emphasize that over the past 6 years we have added many such tools to our toolbox as we collectively explore ways to make government more efficient and effective throughout the first clinton

publicprivate competition such as that provided for by circular a76 unions have been vocal and persistent in objecting to outsourcing while testifying at joint congressional hearing robert m tobias former national president of the national treasury employees union offered this assessment contracting out is not panacea it is not even an end in itself it is process one that in fact has been used with alarming frequency in recent years as evidenced by the vast sums of money the federal government spends on contract services each year it has led to documented waste fraud and abuse and has more often than not been accomplished absent the most basic checks and balances 48 the annals of contracting out are replete with examples of contracting out being done to avoid unions to undermine pay and benefits of employees and generally shortchange workers49 in charging that government contracts are too costly the national federation of federal employees argued that contractors often are not prepared to do the job and then the government has to pay for training for them government employees sometimes have to redo work contractor did and contractors omit some costs from their bids50 unions also have challenged some of the claims and assumptions made by and about the private sector in portion of his testimony before subcommittee of the senate committee on governmental affairs the former national president of afge argued just because contractors are hardworking taxpayers does not mean that they have some entitlement to funds in the public purse after all federal employees are also hardworking taxpayers and just because agencies with managers and rankandfile employees often working together in partnership are more successful competitors in the a76 process does not necessarily mean that the system has suddenly become defective and just because contractors are not winning as many a76 competitions now as they had in years past does not necessarily mean that they are being

introduced by senator craig thomas on february 12 1997 during the first session of the 105th congress s 314 was an effort to enact freedom from government competition statute as introduced s 314 would have prohibited ag encies from beginning or carrying out any activity to provide any products or services that can be provided by the private sector and it also would have prohibited agencies from obtaining ny goods or services from or providing any goods or services to any other governmental entity exceptions would have been allowed for inherently governmental goods and services goods or services having to do with national security when it was determined that the federal government was the best value source for the goods or services or when private sector sources were unable to meet the agencys requirements s 314 was reported to the senate by the committee on governmental affairs on july 28 1998 when s 314 emerged from the committee it was very different from the bill that senator thomas had introduced nearly 18 months earlier s 314 reported to the senate with an amendment to the title and an amendment in the nature of substitute that represented an agreement reached among members of the committee 53 the federal activities inventory reform act represented compromise between at least two different points of view federal employee unions were happy that the bill did not mandate contracting out while the business coalition considered the act step toward more outsourcing of government business54 s 314 as amended was passed by the senate on july 30 1998 by unanimous consent senator thomas and senator fred thompson were the only members to comment on the bill senator thomas offered brief history of s 314 and the rationale for the measure 55 while senator thompson noted that the bill as introduced has had long and contentious past but the measure that passed represented consensus56 on july 31 1998 the engrossed senate bill was sent to the house of representatives where it was referred to the committee on government reform and oversight the measure was called up considered and passed by the house on october 5 1998 discussion about the relative

significant feature of fair is that it statutorily defines inherently governmental the fair definition states that an inherently governmental function is one that is so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by federal government employees the definition includes passage that identifies the circumstances under which the interpretation and execution of the laws of the united states are considered inherently governmental list of functions normally not considered to be inherently governmental and two categories into which inherently governmental activities

these inventories along with their commercial activities inventories each year as with commercial activities inventories inherently governmental activities inventories are made available to congress and the public and furthermore agencies must prepare written justifications for activities designated as inherently governmental 67 initially businesses and trade and professional associations were disappointed and frustrated that not as many activities had been identified as eligible for competition as they had expected or would have liked the number of potential contracting opportunities was reduced by agencies actions first agencies identified their inherently government activities thus removing those activities from consideration as potential candidates for competitive sourcing about

assigning reason codes to commercial activities agencies exempted some of these functions from consideration for cost study or direct conversion comparison between the total number of commercial activities reported and the number eligible for the a76 program showed that many activities were declared exempt industry representatives argued that reason codes were used to shield commercial functions from a7669 the executive director of the management association for private photogrammetric surveys argued after the 1999 lists had been released that too many positions on the lists were untouchable and added that was never in the law its either commercial or inherently governmental omb has far overstepped its legislative authority by allowing agencies to classify over 600000 positions as commercial that the agencies also say are out of bounds 70 as noted above beginning in 2001 omb requires agencies to prepare and submit lists of their inherently governmental activities and ombs refinement of this policy over the years may have helped to alleviate concerns about the completeness and availability of agencies inventories initially the only requirement regarding inherently governmental functions was for agencies to submit their inventories of these functions to omb as result of subsequent policy changes by omb notably changes effected by the 2003 revision to circular a76 inherently governmental inventories are made available to the public interested parties may challenge activities that are included on or omitted from such lists and designated agency official must prepare written justifications for activities designated as inherently governmental 71 ombs policy on commercial activities that carry reason code also may help to alleviate concerns about how agencies use their inventories each commercial activity is assigned one of six reason codes which in short indicate whether an activity is available or is not available for publicprivate competition the six reason codes are as follows athe commercial activity is not appropriate for private sector performance pursuant to written determination by the cso the agencys competitive sourcing official bthe commercial activity is suitable for streamlined or standard competition cthe commercial activity is the subject of an inprogress streamlined or standard competition dthe commercial activity is performed by government personnel as the result of standard or streamlined competition within the past five years ethe commercial activity is pending an agency approved restructuring

may request that agencies refine previously submitted justifications for reason code functions if there are questions74 unions also have been unhappy with fair testifying before subcommittee of the house committee on government reform in 1999 an officer of the american federation of government employees expressed his concern that the private sector was likely to use fair inventories as shopping catalogues75 part of the concern was that eventually fair could lead to an increase in contracting out76 comments by industry representatives probably have helped to fuel this concern as the first commercial activities inventories were being released in fall 1999 representative of the us chamber of commerce after praising fair for its role in generating the inventories added information is dangerous thing youll see some increasing pressure from the private sector and congress to compete the work or outsource it directly77 another criticism levied at fair by unions is that the legislation requires agencies to report information about their federal employee workforces but there is requirement for contractors to report on the size and scope of their workforces colleen m kelley national president national treasury employees union has argued to make public an inventory of the inhouse workforce while systematically ignoring the contract workforce presents skewed picture

findings and four recommendations the report also includes individual statements from the panel members the panel recommended that the government adopt set of 10 sourcing principles make limited changes to circular a76 develop and demonstrate an integrated competition process that would draw from both the far and circular a76 and promote the development of highperforming organizations hpos 91 the 10 sourcing principles are support agency missions goals and objectives be consistent with human capital practices designed to attract motivate retain and reward highperformance federal workforce recognize that inherently governmental and certain other functions should be performed by federal workers create incentives and processes to foster highperforming efficient and effective organizations throughout the federal government be based on clear transparent and consistently applied process avoid arbitrary fulltime equivalent fte or other arbitrary numerical goals establish process that for activities that may be performed by either the public or the private sector would permit public and private sources to participate in competitions for work currently performed inhouse work currently contracted to the private sector and new work consistent with these guiding principles ensure that when competitions are held they are conducted as fairly effectively and efficiently as possible ensure that competitions involve process that considers both quality and cost factors provide for accountability in connection with all sourcing decisions in addition to recommending that government

sourcing statutes and statutory provisions by l elaine halchin g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the federal activities inventory reform act of 1998 is significant legislative initiative in long line of efforts aimed at encouraging the comp etitive sourcing and outsourcing of commercial activities coupled with circular a76 it provides the means for cataloguing government activities as either inherently governmental or commercial and for conducting cost comparison studies or converting commercial functions directly to contract nearly half century has passed since the bureau of the budget issued its first bulletins on the policy of governmental reliance on the private sector and as principle the policy appears to be firmly entrenched although congress acted in 1998 to provide statutory backing to the policy in fair debate continued on how best to implement the policy and promote agency participation the ongoing debate over publicprivate competition and contracting out reflects in some instances fundamental disagreement over the socalled division of labor between government and the private sector and the implications that might follow from particular arrangements congress may wish to examine this issue including fair and circular a76 in light of the bush administrations policies on competitive sourcing
