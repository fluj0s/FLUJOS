nations throughout the world led by the united states and several other developed countries sought to establish an open and nondiscriminatory trading system with the goal of raising the economic wellbeing of all countries aware of the role of trade barriers in contributing to the economic depression in the 1930s and the military aggression that rose following the depression the countries that met to discuss the new trading system saw open trade as essential for economic stability and peace the intent of these negotiators was to establish an international trade organization ito which would address not only trade barriers but other issues indirectly related to trade including employment investment restrictive business practices and commodity agreements the ito was to be united nations specialized agency but the ito treaty was not approved by the united states and few other signatories and never went into effect instead provisional agreement on tariffs and trade rules called the general agreement on tariffs and trade ga tt was reached and went into effect in 1948 this provisional gatt became the principal set of rules governing international trade for the next 47 years the gatt established trade principles that continue to be applied today among the most important of these principles was nondiscrimination with regard to the treatment of trade in goods among countries the mostfavorednation principl article i of the ga tt states that any advantage given by contracting party to product of another country must be extended unconditionally to like product of all other contracting parties second rule of nondiscrimination is national treatment the principle that imported and domestic goods should be treated equally although nondiscrimination is cornerstone of the ga tt some exceptions are allowed for example customs unions freetrade areas and special treatment for developing countries are permitted another principle is the open and fair application of any trade barriers tariffs were the most common and visible form of trade barrier at the time the gatt was established tariffs are bound or set at maximum levels and not to increase above the negotiated level in general quantitative restrictions such as quotas were not allowed since tariffs were much easier to identify and to eventually reduce the gatt also included forum and process for countries to follow in trying to resolve disputes the dispute process allowed countries to consult with each other and if that was not successful country could ask that panel hear the complaint although the panels decision was not enforceable the panel report carried some force of opinion and encouraged countries to work toward an agreeable resolution one of the ga tts chief purposes was the reduction of barriers to trade with this goal in mind gatt contracting parties met periodically to negotiate further reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers and changes to ga tt rules these negotiations were called rounds early rounds dealt only with tariff reductions but later rounds also included nontariff barriers to trade the most recent round the uruguay round lasted from 1986 to 1994 and included the most encompassing set of negotiations in the history of the gatt on the agenda was reform of the existing gatt system as well as expansion of rules to cover new areas such as services trade and the trade aspects of intellectual property rights copyrights trademarks and patents the agreements that resulted from the uruguay round also contained builtin agenda requiring that further

and government procurement begin by the year 2000 one of the most important changes that came about from the uruguay round was the establishment of new trade structure the world trade organization wto which incorporated the many changes reached during the uruguay round the former ga tt with its newly negotiated reforms bodies to oversee the new trade agreements stronger dispute resolution procedure regular review of members trade policies and many other committees and councils in contrast to the ga tt the wto was created as permanent structure with members instead of contracting parties the wto

29december 3 1999 that meeting was intended to review an agenda for new round of trade negotiations but trade ministers could not reach agreement and suspen ded their work the wto directorgeneral was directed to consult with delegations and discuss ways in which countries might bridge remaining differences known as the battle at seattle the ministerial was characterized by street violence and antiglobalization protesters the fourth ministerial conference was held in doha qatar on november 914 2001 at that meeting trade ministers agreed to launch new round of multilateral trade negotiations called the doha development agenda and set deadline for final agreements of january 1 2005 they established work program for the new round and agreed to consider numerous developing country issues4 the fifth ministerial conference was held september 1014 2003 in cancun mexico according to the ministerial declaration released two years earlier in doha qatar the fifth ministerial conference was intended to take stock of progress in the negotiations provide any necessary political guidance and take decisions as ne cessary many trade ministers at the cancun ministerial attempted to reach framework to guide the remaining negotiations of the new round but they could not resolve major differences and the negotiations stalled the sixth ministerial conference was held in hong kong on december 13182005 although an original goal of the ministerial was to agree on package of modalities for the ongoing doha development agenda dda round of trade negotiations this aim was dropped and members agreed to some modest advancements in agriculture industrial tariffs and duty and quotafree access for least developed countries the body that oversees the daytoday operations of the wto is the general council which consists of representative from each member country the council generally meets monthly and provides forum for countries to discuss range of trade matters the us delegate to the general council is the deputy us trade representative in geneva the general council also meets in two other unique capacities one is the trade policy review mechanism tprm the tprm was established under the uruguay round agreements to allow closer monitoring of national trade policies of member countries the four countries with the largest shares of world trade are reviewed every two years the next 16 largest traders are reviewed every four years and other countries are reviewed every six years although least developed countries might be reviewed less freque ntly the trade reviews provide information on countrys trade policies and comment on whether country is pursuing marketopening or marketrestrictive policies this public examination is mild form of pressure for country to avoid practices that discourage trade the general council also meets in the capacity of the dispute settlement body dsb the uruguay round agreements greatly strengthened the process for settlement of disputes the first stage of the process is consultation between the governments involved if consultation is not successful the complainant may ask the dsb to tablish dispute panel the dispute panel hears the case and reports back to the dsb if the complaint is upheld the respondent must either 4 for more information on results of the doha ministerial conference see crs report rl31206 the wto

the complainant may request that the dsb authorize suspension of obligations thereby giving permission for the complainant to retaliate for example complainant may re ceive permission to increase tariffs against respondent country that disregards decision by the dsb permission is automatic unless unanimously disapproved procedures are clearly set out with specific timetables at each stage more specialized work is done in three major bodies under the general council one of these is the council for trade in goods under which committees work on number of trade areas one committee works on trade in agriculture another committee oversees the related topic of sanitary and phytosanitary measures which are measures that pertain respectively to animal and plant health and safety some committees monitor practices that are considered unfair if not implemented in accordance with wto rules antidumping subsidies and countervailing measures other committees examine practices that are not necessarily unfair but could be tradedistorting nonetheless rules of origin safe guards technical barriers customs valuation and import licensing one committee works on the relatively new area of traderelated investment measures and another addresses market access issues tariffs and nontariff measures also under the council for trade in goods is the information technology agreement committee second major body under the general council is the council for trade in services which oversees the uruguay round agreement on trade in services the uruguay round services agreement has three parts the first part lists basic principles that countries agree to observe including national treatment mostfavorednation treatment and transparency open information about relevant laws and regulations the second part contains four annexes with rules on 1 the movement of persons who provide services 2 financial services 3 telecommunications and 4 air transport services the third part is schedule of country commitments these commitments are bound and cannot be reduced in scope much like the tariff levels on goods which cannot be increased once they are bound the service commitments may include exceptions to the national treatment and mostfavorednation principles if countries included these exceptions when they originally negotiated the commitments the council for traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips is the third major body under the general council the trips council monitors the agreement on intellectual property rights reached during the uruguay round and supervises members compliance the trips agreement has three parts the first part outlines basic principles that countries must observe including national treatment and mostfavorednation treatment the second part establishes standards for the different types of intellectual property rights such as patents trademarks copyrights industrial designs and geographical indications eg champagne indicates wine from specific region and ensures minimum lengths of time for protections the third part of the agreement establishes enforcement processes in addition to the bodies discussed above there are many other committees and working groups under the general council for example there are working groups on trade debt and finance and on trade and transfer of technology there are committees on plurilateral agreements which are not signed by all wto members on civil aircraft and on government procurement the committee on trade and development often works with other international institutions on special concerns of countries in development working parties on accession meet with applicant countries to identify changes that are necessary to bring the applicants trade regime into line with wto rules and principles the uruguay round also established committee on trade and environment

congressional debate involving the wto has focused on several major issues these concern 1 achievement of us trade goals through multilateral forum 2 assurance of us sovereignty in trade decisions 3 the wto dispute process and us interests 4 traditional and nontraditional topics in the wto and 5 the congressional role in us participation in the wto 1 to what extent are us trade goals achieved through the wtos multilateral forum compared to other means such as bilateral or regional trade agreements or unilateral action the wto has many benefits for the united states it provides the only multilateral dispute mechanism for international trade administers rules to discourage discrimination and ensures greater security on how trade will be conducted however some criticize the wto as slowmoving and cumbersome because of its large membership varied national interests and consensusbased decisionmaking one alternative is to pursue us goals through another multilateral body for example the united states and other mostly developed countries have pursued negotiations on shipbuilding and investment in the organization for economic cooperation and development but with mixed success another option is to pursue trade benefits through regional or bilateral agreements these agreements can offer benefits to us exporters and are easier to negotiate however some contend that regional and bilateral agreements create trade diversion and may distract the united states and other countries from potentially greater benefits from multilateral negotiations 2 can the united states maintain its sovereignty as member of the wto some critics of the wto have raised the question of whether the united states will lose its sovereignty as member of the wto as member the united states does commit to act in accordance with the rules of the multilateral body article xvi4 of the agreement establishing the world trade agreement states each member shall ensure the conformity of its laws regulations and administrative procedures with its obligations as provided in the annexed agreements those annexed agreements are the agreements reached during the uruguay round covering trade in goods trade in services intellectual property rights dispute settlement and other trade areas the wto however cannot force members to adhere to their obligations the united states and any other wto member may act in its own national interest the wto recognizes certain allowable exceptions such as national security however any multilateral institution is only as strong as its members adherence to the institutions rules if the united states or another member country chooses to take unilateral action contrary to wto rules that action may weaken the institution it is decision for us policymakers whether the discipline imposed by the wto is an acceptable cost for the benefits of an open trading system 3 are us interests served through the wto dispute process the united states realizes several benefits from the existence of multilate ral forum for trade disputes such forum in general allows countries to peacefully resolve disputes without having to resort to more drastic measures the wto dispute process presents clear understandable set of rules to be followed and the process is nondiscriminatory among countries 5 the united states has been relatively successful in using the process as complainant as of october 2006 the us trade representative reports that 24 cases were resolved to us satisfaction without litigation 26 cases 5 for information on the wto dispute process see crs

states did not prevail on core issues and 24 other cases were in panel stage in consultation or monitoring progress or otherwise inactive6 there are many complaints about the wto dispute settlement process in some cases countries have not adhered to dispute panels findings an example is the us complaint against european union eu trade restrictions on imports of beef produced with hormones critics say that some cases are filed for political not economic reasons for example some analysts say that the eu took action for years against us tax benefit for exports the foreign sales corporation but then filed challenge after us win in another case finally the united states as defendant has lost several cases involving trade remedies and this has led some members of congress to charge that the wto dispute panels are assuming too much authority in interpreting trade agreements the united states has not done well as respondent as of october 2006 the united states won 14 cases on core issues but did not prevail in 30 cases while 17 cases were resolved without completing litigation 10 cases were in the litigation or appellate stage and 22 cases were either in prelitigation consultation stage or inactive 7 4 should the wto cover traditional trade issues only or should it be broadened to include nontraditional issues such as labor and the environment the ga tt agreement first established rules only on border measures tariffs and quotas and later added rules on certain internal practices that clearly had direct effects on trade in goods eg subsidies government procurement the uruguay round agreements further expanded trade rules to cover new areas such as trade in services and intellectual property rights us businesses generally want the wto to refrain from extending beyond these traditionally traderelated issues because they argue that the greatest export opportunities will be achieved only if negotiators focus on trade barriers and do not include social factors many groups however argue that the wto should be expanded to include nontraditional topics two topics that have been at the center of current trade debate are labor and the environment labor groups argue that many countries exploit workers including children to produce lowcost products for foreign markets environmental groups want more consideration of the environmental effects of the production of goods for trade included under wto rules recently there has been discussion about the possible role of the wto in enforcing potential future climate change obligations there is strong disagreement domestically on traditional and nontraditional topics in trade negotiations internationally countries hold wide range of positions on this question 5 what is the role of congress in how th united states participates in the wto although the executive branch maintains staff in geneva and conducts trade negotiations in the wto congress has an important role in how the united states participates in the wto through its constitutional authority over the conduct of foreign commerce in trade promotion authority tpa legislation pl 107210 that approved ex pedited procedures for legislation to implement trade agreements passed in 2002 congress prescribed trade objectives for us negotiators and required the executive branch to consult with it during negotiations congress maintains oversight and the congressional oversight group which was established under pl 107210 6 see the us trade representative snapshot of wto cases involving the united st ates httpwwwustrgov

introduced congress decides whether or not to approve those legislative changes necessary to implement the trade agreement the current tpa legislation expired in july 2007 and congress may renew or extend tpa if doha round agreement is reached congress may so consider changes to us trade laws in response to possible adverse rulings under wto dispute settlement procedures the congressional role described above has evolved to help coordinate and streamline activities of the executive and legislative branches on trade matters but this role is continually debated and reevaluated many of those involved in the debate question whether this executivelegislative relationship is still useful or appropriate the administration has called for greater authority in trade negotiations saying that the need for repeated reauthorization of trade promotion authority interrupts us trade policy and keeps the united states from participating in trade negotiations however many members assert that congress has given up too much of its constitutional role and should have stronger hand in trade policy formulation and in oversight of trade negotiations periodically congress also has the opportunity to vote to withdraw from the wto under the uruguay round agreements act pl 103465 th us trade representative ustr must submit to the congress every five years report that analyzes the costs and benefits of continued us participation in the wto once congress receives this comprehensive report any member of congress may introduce joint resolution withdrawing congressional approval of the agreement establishing the wto this report was issued in 2005 on the tenth anniversary of us accession to the wto and house members considered joint resolution hjres 27 to withdraw congressional approval of the agreement establishing the wto the house ways and means committee reported the resolution adversely on may 26 2005 and the full house disapproved the resolution by vote of 33886 on june 9 2005 debate on the resolution offered members an opportunity to examine the costs and benefits of wto participation and examine other aspects of wto membership
