institutions petitioner cross appeals challenging the mtts decision granting responde nt summary disposition of petitioners additional request for an exemp tion under mcl 2117o which is applicable to charitable institutions we affirm respondent first contends that the mtt applied an incorrect test in determining that the prince center lodging facility is exempt from property taxa tion under mcl 2117n this court reviews decision of the mtt to determine whether the tribunal legally erred or adopted an incorrect legal principle ford motor co v bruce twp 264 mich app 1 5 689 nw2d 764 2004 in addition this court reviews novo lower courts d ecision with regard to motion for summary disposition willis v deerfield twp 257 mich app 541 548 669 nw2d 279 2003 motion for summary disposition under mcr 2116c10 is properly granted if factual dispute exists thus titling the moving party to judg ment as matter of law rice v auto club ins assn 252 mich app 25 31 651 nw2d 188 2002 in deciding motion brought under subrule c10 court cons iders all the evidence affidav its pleadings and admissions in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party id at 3031 the nonmoving party must present more than mere allegations to establish genuine issue of material fact for resolution at trial id at 31 mcl 2117n provides in pertinent part 1 real estate or personal property ow ned and occupied by nonprofit theater library educational or scientific institu tions incorporated under the laws of this state with the buildings and other property thereon while occupied by them solely for the purposes for which the institutions were incorporated is exempt from taxation under this act in engineering society of detroit v detroit 308 mich 539 550 14 nw2d 79 1944 the michigan supreme court articulated fourpart st for determining whether claimant seeking tax exemption qualifies for the exemption 1 the real estate must be owned and occupied by the exemption claimant 2 the exemption claimant must be library bene volent charitable 1 educational or scientific institution 3 the claimant must have been incor porated under the laws of this state 4 the exemption exists only when the buildings and other property thereon are occupied by the claimant so lely for the purposes for which it was incorporated the third requirement has since been found unconstitutional chauncey marion deering mccormick foundation v wawatam twp 186 mich app 511 514515 465 nw2d 14 1990 thus claimant must establish only the remaining three requirements respondent contends that the mtt erred by failing to apply an additiona l twopart test addressing whether the prince center lodging facility 1 fits into the general scheme of education provided by the state and supported by public taxation and 2 contributes substantially to the relief of the ducational burden of governme nt respondent relies on ladies literary club v city of grand rapids 409 mich 748 298 nw2d 422 1980 in that case the court stated that an organization seeking an educational exemption must fit into the general scheme of education provided by the state and s upported by public taxation id at 755 in addition the court stated that an exemption may be available if the institution makes substantial contribution to the relief of the burden of government id at 755756 the court determined that because the plaintiff did not sufficiently relieve the governme nts educational burden it was not entitled to an educational institution exemption id at 756 respondent contends that the mtt erred by failing to apply the above two additional criteria in this case it is apparent from ladies literary club however that these additional 1 former 2117 exempted from taxation real estate or personal property as shall be owned and occupied by nonprofit theater library benevolent charitable educational or scientific institutions the tax exemptions for edu cational institutions and charitable institutions are now provided separately under mcl 2117n and mcl 2117o respectively 2 criteria apply only in determini ng whether an organization qualifie s as an educational institution to satisfy the second requirement of the threepart engineering society of detroit test the court in ladies literary club was not concerned with whether the pr emises at issue were used solely for the purposes for which the organization was incorporated rather it addressed the clubs activities and whether the activities could be c onsidered as being sponsored by an educational institution ladies literary club supra at 755756 thus the additional criteria apply only to such an inquiry in circle pines center v orangeville twp 103 mich app 593 302 nw2d 917 1981 this court recognized the scope of the two criter ia discussed above afte r discussing the holding in ladies literary club this court stated while cpcs the petitioners activities focus on cooperative education and are both commendable and of benefit to the participants it cannot be said that such programs sufficien tly relieve the governments educational burden to warrant the claimed educationinstituti on exemption pet itioners reliance on national music camp v green lake twp 76 mich app 608 257 nw2d 188 1977 is misplaced in that case there was dispute over petitioners status as an educational institution unlike petiti oner in the instant cas the interlochen facility was recognized degreeconferring institution the primary issue there was whether certain property owned by petitioner was used for educational purposes therefore we hold that petitioner cpc is not an educational institution within the meaning of mcl 2117 id at 598 further in assn of little friends inc v city of escanaba 138 mich app 302 307 360 nw2d 602 1984 this court explicitly stated that the court in ladies literary club set forth test for determining whether an institution qualifies for property tax exemption as an educational institution emphasis added see also kalamazoo aviation history museum v city of kalamazoo 131 mich app 709 713714 346 nw2d 862 1984 applying ladies literary club test to determine whether the petitioner qualifi ed as taxexempt educational institution because dispute exists that petitioner in the instant case is an educational institution the additional twoprong test announced in ladies literary club is inapplicable respondent admits in its brief on appeal that petitioner is an educational institution and the mtt acknowledged as such in its opinion thus the mtt did not fail to apply the proper test in determining that the prince ce nter lodging facility is exem pt from taxation under mcl 2117n respondent next challenges the mtts ba ses for granting summary disposition for petitioner under mcl 2117n decisi on of the mtt constitutes an error of law if it is not supported by competent material and substantial evidence comstock village limited dividend housing assn v comstock twp 168 mich app 755 759 425 nw2d 70 1988 substantial evidence is more than scin tilla of evidence although it may be substantially less than preponderance of evidence id one of the requirements for exemption under mcl 2117n is that the property be occupied by the claimant solely for the purposes for which it was incorporated engineering society of detroit supra at 550 in reaching its conclusion the mtt recognized that according 3 to case law from this court and the michigan supr eme court the word solely in tax exemption statutes does not literally mean exclusively in webb academy v city of grand rapids 209 mich 523 532 177 nw 290 1920 which involved an educational tax exemption the defendants argued that the plaintiffs property was not occupied and used solely for the purposes of its incorporation because the property was used as residence portion of the property was used for garde n and the barn on the premises was on some occasions rented out to store auto mobiles the michigan supreme court stated it may be conceded that exemption of the premises in prior years is not controlling that the burden is upon the party claiming ex emption and as general rule statutes exempting from taxation are to be strictly cons trued which is not however to be extended so far as to defeat the legislative intent 1 cooley on taxation 3d ed p 362 and it has been said that th rule is not so rigidly adhered to in construing exemptions for educational purposes as those applicable to more strictly commercial or business enterprises id at 535536 the webb court relied on case law from other jurisdictions favoring construction of the word solely consonant with the sp irit which prompted the adopti on of the provisions and which serves great public use in pursuance of most beneficial public policy id at 540541 quoting bishop etc of st johns ca thedral v county treasurer 29 colo 143 68 p 272 1901 and yale university v town of new haven 71 conn 316 42 87 1899 similarly in american legion memorial home assn of grand rapids v city of grand rapids 118 mich app 700 708 325 nw2d 543 1982 which involved tax exemption for memorial homes this court stated with respect to statutory requireme nt that an institution be occupied solely for the purposes for which it was incorporated tax exemption is not lost by virtue of occasional or incidental uses for other purposes if the primary use of building is for clearly exempt purposes the exemption is not lost because on occasion the building is used for social purposes or is let out to other organizations citation omitted in american legion memorial home this court determined that use of the premises at issue for social purposes or by groups not affiliated w ith the american legion did not defeat the plaintiffs entitlement to tax exemption id at 710711 this court held that the purposes that the mtt found objectionable did not detract from the primary purpose of the building as site for strictly american legion functions id at 711 further in saginaw co agricultural society v city of saginaw 142 mich app 173 177 178 368 nw2d 878 1984 involving tax exemption for agricultural society property this court relied on its previous decision in american legion memorial home the issue was whether the tax exemption for the saginaw county fairgrounds was defeated by the lease of the premises for private storage id at 175 after quoting its previous decision in american legion memorial home this court concluded that the tax ex emption was not lost by virtue of occasional or incidental uses for other purposes id at 177178 4 from the above cases the mtt in the instant case concluded that the word solely in mcl 2117n did not mean that the property had to be used solely for the purposes for which petitioner was incorporated rather the mtt citing american legion memorial home opined that the test was whether the primary use of the building is for clearly exempt purposes although it does not appear that the mtt applie d the term solely according to its plain meaning respondent does not challenge the mtts interpretation of the wo rd solely or argue that case law has misinterpreted that term2 rather it argues that the mtt legally erred by rejecting its argument that the prince center is engaged in the business of renting hotel rooms for profit failing to consider the effect of tax exemption for the prince center on competing establishments relying on the mhefas determinat ion that the prince center is an educational facility and relying on foreign case law that is neither persuasive nor binding precedent in rejecting respondents argument that peti tioner is engaged in the business of renting hotel rooms for profit and is indistinguishable from any privately owned hotel the mtt relied on the lodging facilitys financia l information showing that it wa s not profitable and concluded that the information proves that the facility is not being operated as commercial venture the mtt also considered the fact that petitioner does not subordinate its use of the l odging facility to use for noncalvin college purposes the mtt further considered petitioners policies against smoking and consuming alcohol and opined that these policies would make the facility attractive only to those with beliefs consiste nt with petitioner in addition the lack of sign the location of the prince center and the lack of advertising were all indicative of petitioners intent not to make the prince center profitable commercial ve nture based on the above factors the mtt did not legally err in rejecting respondents argument that petit ioner operates the lodging facility for profit and that it is indistinguis hable from privately owned hotel respondent also contends that the mtt erred by failing to consider the effect of tax exemption for the prince center on competing establishments in pport of its argument respondent relies solely on leelanau center for education v leelanau twp 5 mtt 388 docket 96752 february 26 1988 although in that cas the mtt compared the premises at issue with other private camps rule of law requir ed the mtt in the instant case to make such comparisons thus respondents argument that the mtt legally erred by failing to consider the effect of tax exemption on any comp eting establishments is unavailing respondent further contends that the mtt erred by relying on the determination of the michigan higher education facilities authority mhefa that the prince center is an educational facility funding fr om the mhefa for the construction of the prince center was dependent on the mhefas conclusion that the pr ince center is an educational facility the mtt stated that it recognizes the mhefas unique expertise as an agency of the state within the department of education authorized by stat ute to loan money to institutions of higher 2 while the issue is not before us we neverthele ss note that although statutes should be applied according to their plain meaning see eg indenbaum v michigan bd of medicine 213 mich app 263 270 539 nw2d 574 1995 the inte rpretation of solely provided by webb supra is in our opinion binding given that webb is michigan supreme court case that specifically dealt with the meaning of the term 5 learning for the construction of educational fa cilities and in doing so finds the mhefas determination that the prince center is an educa tional facility persuasive respondent cites authority in support of its position that the mtt erred by relying on the mhefas determination party may not announce position without legal support and leave for this court the task of analyzing and advancing the position riverbend investors v progressive surface preparation llc 255 mich app 327 332 660 nw2d 373 2003 in any event the mhefas determination that the prince center is an educational facility applied to the prince center as whole rather than to the lodging facility in particular and this reasoning constituted only one factor supporting the mtt s decision thus even if the mtt erred by c onsidering this factor it appears to us that the mtt would have reached the same conclusion finally respondent contends that the mtt erred by relying on foreign case law that is neither persuasive nor binding preceden t in its opinion the mtt cited au hotel ltd v eagerton 689 so2d 859 861862 ala app 1996 in which the court determined that the subject property was not entitled to proper ty tax exemption because it was not used exclusively for school purposes the mtt c oncluded that this cas provided guidance because alabama courts have developed more stringent interpretation of the words solely and exclusively than have michigan courts thus the mtt did not rely on au hotel ltd in support of its decision the mtt did however rely on iowa hotel assn v st ate bd of regents 253 iowa 870 882 114 nw2d 539 1962 in which the iowa supreme court determined that food and lodging facilities are p roperly part of an educational institution such as the university of iowa the mtt concluded that the pr ince center food and l odging facilities are likewise incident to the main purpose an d complete program of calvin college and determined that the iowa supreme courts anal ysis of modern university is similar to petitioners arguments for why the lodging facility is an important component of calvin college respondent contends that iowa hotel assn is irrelevant to the in stant case because it involved stateowned land this argument however is unavailing given that the identity of the landowner was irrelevant to th mtts comparison the iowa supreme courts reasoning was not dependent on the land being state ow ned and although the mtt recognized that iowa hotel assn was not directly on point it nevertheless found that reas oning persuasive the mtt did not legally err by re lying on the case respondent next contends that the mtt s findings are not supported by competent material and substantial evidence because the mtt granted summary disposition under mcr 2116c10 it appears that respondent is challenging the mtts conc lusion that it reached based on the undisputed facts rather than any factual findings respondent first challenges the mtts relia nce on petitioners financial data and argues that the financial data were not supported by in dependent financial information in support of petitioners financial data peti tioner presented the affidavit of justin jackson manager of petitioners lodging facility pe titioner was not required to present independent financial information in support of its data factual di spute existed regarding the financial data after filing its motion for summary disposition petiti oner filed at the mtts request statement clarifying its revenue sources for the prince center lodging facility petit ioner attached to its statement the affidavit of henry devries petitioners vice pres ident of administration finance and information services explaini ng the revenue categories the affidavits of both jackson and devries stated that the financia l information was based on the prin ce center lodging facility in 6 particular and not on the prince center as w hole thus the mtts reliance on petitioners financial data and its conclusions drawn there from were supported by comp etent material and substantial evidence respondent next challenges the mtts relia nce on the prince center policies regarding smoking and alcohol consumption the mtt opine d that petitioners smoking policy and its prohibition of alcohol consum ption tends to make the use of the lodging facility attractive only to those persons whose beliefs are consistent with petitioner in ma king this statement the mtt was reasoning that the policies tended to show that the lodging facility is not operated to generate profit the mtts reliance on the smoking and alcohol polic ies in support of its conclusion regarding the intended profitability of the lodging facility was not erroneous the mtts conclusion was supported by competent material and substantial evidence further respondent challenges the mtts conc lusion that the prince center is located away from major rightsofway from the diagra m of petitioners campus it appears to us that the mtts conclusion was supported by competent material and substantial evidence the prince center is not immediately adjacent to the highway but the devos communication center separates the prince center from the highway it is also unclear from the diagram the best route to travel to the prince center from the hi ghway thus the mtts conclusion is supported by competent material and substantial evidence on crossappeal petitioner contends th at the mtt erred by denying summary disposition in its favor under mcl 2117o we disagree mcl 2117o1 provides property owned and occupied by nonpr ofit charitable institution while occupied by that nonprofit charitable ins titution solely for the purposes for which it was incorporated is ex empt from the collection of taxes under this act in michigan baptist homes development co v city of ann arbor 396 mich 660 671 242 nw2d 749 1976 the michigan supreme court stat ed that to qualify for charitable or benevolent tax exemption property must be used in such way as to benefit the general public without restriction thereafter in retirement homes of the detr oit annual conference of the united methodist church inc v sylvan twp 416 mich 340 348349 330 nw2d 682 1982 the court clarified the inquiry as whether the petitione r operates in such way that there is gift for the benefit of the general public without restriction or for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons see also michigan united conservation clubs v lansing twp 423 mich 661 673 378 nw2d 737 1985 stating that the proper focus is whether the plaintiffs activities taken as whole constitute charitable gift for the benef it of the general public without restriction or for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons we agree with the mtts determination that petitioner is not entitl ed to an exemption under mcl 2117o because it does not provide g ift benefiting an indefinite number of persons petitioner merely provides lodging accommodations and permits the general public to use the lodging facility as long as it is used for purposes consistent with petitioners mission and articles of incorporation offe ring service to the general public does not transform that service into gift as the mtt recognized to hold otherwise would potentially mean that accommodations provided by every privately owned lodging facility would qualify as gift 7 petitioner challenges the mtts reliance on th fact that petitioner does not allow the general public to use the lodging fac ility for free or at reduced rate petitioner correctly points out that an organization is not disqualified from receiving tax exemption merely because it charges persons able to pay for its services fee approximating the cost of the services retirement homes supra at 350 n 15 the mtt determined how ever that like the residents in retirement homes those who stay at the lodging facility do not receive any significant benefit that they do not pay for in retirement homes the court stated we conclude that there is gift for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons or for the benefit of the ge neral public without restriction in the operation of the apartments the monthly fee is designed to cover all operating costs as well as to recover the construction costs of the apartments while it does not appear that the apartments are operated for profit neither does it appear that the residents receive any significant benefit that they do not pay for there is gift to the residents id at 349350 likewise petitioners lodging f acility does not cons titute gift to the general public and the reasoning from retirement homes is controlling although th prince center lodging facility may not be operated to generate profit it does not appear that persons staying at the facility receive any benefit for which they do not pay accordingly there is gift benefiting the general public without restriction or benefiting an indefinite number of persons affirmed s patrick m meter s christopher m murray s bill schuette 8
