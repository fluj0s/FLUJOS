hydrogen programs for the department of energys does energy efficiency rd programs the administration seeks 4847 million with increases for hydrogen and hybridelectric propulsion the request would cut 748 million from the weatherization program and eliminate controversial fundi ng earmarks the house passed version of the fy2007 energy nd water appropriations bill hr 5427 would fund aei and cut earmarks the senate appropriati ons committee has also approved aei funding and would cut ear marks even further than the house energy efficiency programs have long been justified for the ability to reduce petroleum use and curb environmental impact s such as air pollution this made it economically and administratively convenient to have them also serve as part of low cost regrets policy to reduce greenhouse gas especially co2 emissions in addition to doe funding hr 5386 would provide about 100 million for the environmental protection agencys energy efficiency program and the senate appropriations committees version of hr 5522 would provide about 200 million for energy efficiencyrelated prog rams in developing countries does implementation of equipment effici ency standards has been subject of some congressional criticism the ener gy policy act of 2005 epact pl 10958 directed doe to report to congress on ac tions taken to addr ess the concern in response doe issued schedule for rulemakings on 30 products epact also raised the goals for energy efficiency in federal agencies and provided modest tax incentives for efficiency in certain vehicles and buildings automobile fuel efficiency regulation s been one of the most controversial aspects of energy efficiency policy the corporate averag fuel economy cafe program for new cars and light trucks achi eved significant energy

referred to as the takeback effect the rebound effect is discussed in the following continuedbackground energy efficiency concept energy efficiency is increased when an energy conversion device such as household appliance automobile engine or steam turbine undergoes technical change that enables it to provide the same service lighting heating motor drive while using less energy the energysaving result of the efficiency improvement is often called energy conservation the ergy efficiency of buildings can be improved through the use of certain mate rials eg attic in sulation components eg insulated windows and design aspect s eg solar orientation and shade tree landscaping further the energy efficiency of communities and cities can be improved through architectural design tr ansportation system design and land use planning thus energy efficiency i nvolves all aspects of energy production distribution and enduse these ideas of efficiency and conservation contrast with curtailment which decreases output eg turning down th thermostat or services eg driving less to curb energy use that is energy curtailment occurs when saving energy causes reduction in services or sacrifice of comfort curtailment is often employed as an emergency measure energy efficiency is often viewed as resource option like coal oil or natural gas in contrast to supply options howev er the downward pressure on energy prices created by energy efficiency comes from demand reductions instead of increased supply as result energy efficiency can reduce resource use and environmental impacts an important aspect of energy fficiency policy is to weigh such benefits against the cost of energy efficiency investments energy efficiency drivers various concerns and national interests drive energy efficiency policymaking recently high energy prices and concerns about energy security have renewed an emphasis on energy efficiency and energy conservation to dampen electricity natural gas and oil demand energy efficiency is also driven by the potential benefits of avoiding environmental costs that woul d otherwise result from growth in energy supply facilities with the ttendant impacts of their effl uents and emissions on land water air and global climate further energy efficiency is often driven by the potential to reduce consumer energy costs but this potential can be compromised by several barriers including perceived threats to the pr ofitability of energy supply companies the complexity of energy consumer decisionmaking and the rebound effect wherein expected savings are re duced by increased consumption elsewhere6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33599crs3 6 continued section measuring the rebound effect 7 this equipment is selected and installed by millions of consumers and companies which calls for different approach to meas urement than that for energy supplies 8 evaluation research is an empirical social science discipline that originated in the 1960s with focus on the use of control and treatme nt groups to measure the effects of education health and other social prog rams as broadbased energy programs emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s these techniques began to be applied to many energy programs 9 evaluations of energy efficiency and ener gy conservation programs have continued but they are focused mostly on effects at the stat or local level the international energy program evaluation conference is at the center of this conti nuing effort see abstracts of evaluation papers from its 2005 conf erence at http wwwiepec org 10 prominent examples

true for virtually all rd programs not just for energy efficiency rd programs the bush administration has launched an effo rt under the presidents management agenda to develop methods for assessing the impact s of applied rd programs including the energy efficiency program at doe the national academy of sciences has published reports in this area including energy research at doe was it worth it

look forward 2005 at httpdarwinnapedu books0309096049html70htmlmeasuring energy efficien cy and energy savings measurement challenge in the processes of extracting and producing energy energy supplies are physically tangible and easily measured in contrast measuring energy savings and energy efficiency is more challenging in effect one is attempting to measure something that never happens namely that consumption falls below projected level and the difference is attributed to the installation of more energy efficient equipment7 measuring energy savings by individuals and programs the scientific approach to measuring the impact of an energy efficiency program is known as evaluation research8 this technique employs surveys of actions taken by many of the individuals that receive benefits from an energy efficiency or energy conservation program due to the large s cale of national programs and the associated cost to mount large evaluation effo rt only few major evaluations of doe programs have been conducted mos tly during the 1980s and early 1990s9 these studies focused on assessing the ergy savings from grant programs10 evaluating impacts from rd programs is conceptually and mechanically much more difficult than evaluating grant programs11 nas study of barriers to action by individuals more than 20 years ago the national academy of sciences nas prepared landmark study

more information see lee schipper on the rebound the interaction of energy efficiency energy use and economic activity an introduction energy policy vol 28 2000 p 351353 also see crs report rs20981 energy efficiency and the re bound effect does increasing efficiency decrease demand by frank gottrondecisionmaking behavior of energy users the report reviewed several studies that found energy users often avoid making subs tantial investments in energy efficiency measures that would have been costeffectiv in particular nas observed that some major studies found that only 30 to 80 of economically ju stified investment would be induced by energy price signals further it found that belief in market effectiveness persists despite evidence that institutional barriers to investment in energy efficiency tend to blunt the effect of market signals the report identifies several technical market and information barriers to cons umer investment in cost effective energy efficiency in particular nas focused on the nonrational folk model of consumer energy decisionmaking people who try to make rational calculations based on their own assumptions folk model about energy would be led to make fewer energysaving investments than an expert analyst would reco mmend they would interpret their investments as less effective than would an expert12 in addition nas points out that nontec hnical and noneconomic factors have major impact on energy use more fundamentally there is problem with the very notion of users as investors people do not see their purchases of energy and energyusing equipment only as investment they have m eanings unrelated to the cost of fuel car purchasers for example do not look so lely at fuel efficiency they are also concerned with performance safety styling status considerations and other factors13 the report finds similar aspects are factored into decisions bout home improvements that have major implications for household energy use measuring the rebound effect one important behavi oral aspect of energy efficiency is the rebound effect this effect may reduce the measured level of energy and cost savings from an energy efficiency action well below the expected level the rebound can take the form of direct effect where resource use is increased eg drive an efficient car more miles an indirect effect where additional goods are purchased that use the same re source eg buy new electrical appliance for the home or market effect where lower resource price makes new uses affordable eg provide elect ric heating for hot tub studies have shown that the rebound for automobiles ranges from 10 to 30 and the rebound for home water heating ranges from 10 to 40 however in each case the losses in expected energy savings are generally associated with gains in equipment service eg more hours of use or increased comfort eg more desirable temperature setting14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33599crs5 15 doe energy conservation trends understanding the factors

that attempted to estimate the energy savings from its energy efficiency and energy conservation programs16 from 1985 to 2005 national energy use climbed about 20 q quads17 reaching record high of 999 q in 2005 does 1995 report energy conservation trends found that energy efficiency and conservation activities from 1973 through 1991 curbed the pre1973 growth trend in annual primary energy use by about 18 q an 18 reduction in 1992 doe said this wa s saving the economy about 150 billion annually in total us energy expenditures these two studies used an economic modeling approach to estimate past energy savings trends distinguish program savings from pricei nduced savings and energy savings for each enduse sector the 1995 re port concluded with f our basic lessons that provide guidance for policy development 1 energy prices strongly affect trends in energy savings 2 growth and struct ural change make energy conservation moving target subject to c ontinued reevaluation 3 trends in energy savings reflect diversity of responses among and with in each sector of the economy and 4 several areas of rising demand are diminishing or detracting from the gains in energy savings18 and they present targets of opport unity for further policy attention19 eias approach measure ener gy intensity of the economy in 1995 eia issued report that attempted to address difficulties in measuring energy efficiency20 the report declares that the ability to define and measure energy efficiency is essential to the doe objective of promoting energy efficiency to help the nation manage its energy resources in the absence of defensible energy efficiency measures any change in consumption might be equated with change in energy efficiency even if such fluctuations are caused by stru ctural or behavioral effects21 to contribute to the goal of accurately measuring energy efficiency eia developed an approach based on energy intensityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33599crs6 22 eia measuring energy efficiency pp vii and 4 23 in discussing the behavioral aspect as an intervening variable in measuring energy efficiency eia notes that consumer may cide to reallocate the energy savings to an increased level of service such as higher heating temperature in winter this behavioral phenomena is know as the rebound ffect as previously discussed 24 eia notes that for any given service ener gy intensity is inversely related to energy efficiency pp 34 25 eia pp 56 26 eia p 71 27 eia p 71 eia notes that the task of defining and measuring energy efficiency and creating statistical measures as descriptors is daunting one specifically it explains that change in energy use over time is driven by combination of efficiency weather behavioral and structural effe cts that may be only partially separable and may differ among energy services as practical matter it is virtually impossible to remove or even to consid er all of the behavioral or structural factors that would be necessary to obtain pure measurement of energy efficiency however broadly ener gy efficiency may be defined22 thus in this view because energy effici ency is tied to energy use and demand it must somehow be separate d from other factors that affect demand especially structural economy weathe r and behavioral effects23 eia suggested that one way to achieve this separation was to focus on energy intensity as measurement indicator of energy efficiency the energy intensity indicator was obtained from an equation in which energy consumption is set equal to the product of energy intensity energy us rate per unit of rvice times the total amount of service provided24 eia says it adopted comprehensive approach that starts the measurement process with the broadest available measures of energy use and demand indicators over time changes in such measures reflect changes in behavior weather structure and energy efficiency further structures of energy measures are needed that make it possible to separate the effects unrelated to energy efficiency25 eia observes that some of the obstacles to measuring energy efficiency on an economywide basis are lack of cons istent data difficulties in establishing demand indicators and absence of clarity in identifying structural and behavioral influences on efficiency26 eias report concluded that further work is needed to forge consensus on the definition of energy efficiency and the development of energyintensity indicators that are precise valid reproduc ible and as robust as possi ble eia offered its report as focus point for furthe r discussion and debate to improve energy efficiency measures27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33599crs7 28 eias energy efficiency measurement discussion was last updated in february 2003 and is available online at httpwwweiadoeg ovemeuefficiencymeasure_discussionhtm 29 eia energy efficiency measurement discussion section on energy intensity as common surrogate for energy efficiency 30 eia also notes that there is best practice approach that can be used for comparing the efficiency of current or average production activity with the best practice that could be used this approach is most appropriately applied to single production process or single company 31 the marketbasket of energy services approach is bottomup approach in which each category of service is controlled relative to its share in the index the comprehensive approach works from the topdow n starting with the broadest measures of energy use and then removing effects from behavior weather and structure the factorial decomposition approach takes energy use and separates it into activity structural and intensity effects measuring each by holding the other two constant this technique is used by the international energy agency in its publication indicators of energy use and efficiency the divisia index approach separates time trends in to different factors such as structure and intensityeias discussion of energy efficiency measurement was continued with an article on its website28 the article noted that there are data access and processing barriers to developing energy efficiency indicators further the effort to create international comparative indicators is made more difficult due to structural behavioral and economic diffe rences between nations even measure of energy intensity such as energy use per unit of gross domestic product gdp is difficult because of differing measures of ergy currencies and income accounts eia suggests that different policy contex ts call for the use of different energy intensity indicators for example focus on climate change policy might call for an indicator that shows carbon emissions in absolute terms or expressed per unit of energy use in contrast focus on economic productivity po licy might call for an indicator that shows energy expenditures pe r dollar of gdp eia said that intensity may only be rough surrogate for energy efficiency because it may mask structural and behavioral changes that do not re present true efficiency improvements nevertheless as with its 1995 report eia again found that energy intensity may be the best indicator of energy efficiency th at can be developed with available data energy intensity is defined as the ratio of energy consumption to some measure of demand for energy services the choice of measure of demand for energy services demand indicator in effici ency analysis is critical as examples in the transportation sector intensity measures could include gallons per passenger mile or gallons per vehicle m ile passenger mile and vehicle are the demand indicators in these two examples29 eia reported that there are four frequently used approaches to developing energy intensity indicators and indexes to measure relative changes30 each with its own strengths and weaknesses31 eia noted that the measurement of energy efficiency and energy intensity can also be affected by the choice between primary energy and site energy as the indicator of energy use primary energy is defined as the amount of energy delivered to an endhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33599crs8 32 this is particularly important for electricity where large amounts of heat are lost in the combustion of fossil fuels to generate power ho wever it is also true for fuel refinery where certain amounts of energy are used to ope rate the machinery that drives the chemical processes primary energy use is related to the concept of full fuel cycle energy use 33 this is usually the easiest measure of use shown on home electricity and natural gas meters 34 with an economic measure eia said it does not matter if there is shift from electricity to natural gas or vice versa because decrease in the cost of one fuel is likely to be counter balanced by an increase in the other thus in this view although site energy use may decline relative to primary energy use the expenditures would remain relatively level 35 detailed

housing unit adju sted to account for losses in generation transmission and distribution32 site energy is define d as the amount of energy delivered to an end user without adjusting for these losses33 eia said primary energy is better for constructing aggregate indicat ors eg energy usegdp and for showing ultimate resource or environmental impact for example attributing co2 emissions to residential electricity use when th focus is finding differences in enduse efficiency for example residential air conditioning compared over time using simple measure of site energy would be sufficient and may avoid distortions from changes in upstreamefficiency eia asserted that from an economists viewpoint using cost expenditures instead of primary or site energy may be preferable34 doe program history from 1974 through 1992 congress blished several complementary programs primarily at the partment of energy doe to implement energy saving measures in virtually every sector of soci etal activity these energy efficiency and energy conservation programs were created originally in response to national oil import security and economic stability cerns in the early 1980s states and utilities took an active role in promoting energy efficiency as costsaving demandside management tool for avoi ding expensive powerplant construction energy efficiency is also viewed as tool for mitigating environmental problems such as air pollution and global climate change this aspect spawned new programs at doe and at several other agencies including the environmental protection agency epa the agency for international development aid and the world banks global environment facility gef energy efficiency is increasingly viewed as an important element of sustaina ble development and economic growth the doe energy efficiency program incl udes rd funding grants to state and local governments and regulatory framework of appliance efficiency standards and voluntary guidelines for energy

appropriations committees congress merged appropriations accounts for the doe energy effi ciency program which had previously been under the department of the interior and related agencies appropriations bill with the appropriations accounts for the doe renewa ble energy program under the energy and water development appropriations bill as result appropriations for some subprograms such
