circumstances warrant the us strategy in pursuing the war on international terrorism involves variety of missions conducted by milita ry and civilian intelligen ce personnel characterized as special operations or paramilitary operations the separate roles of the department of defense dod and the central inte lligence agency cia are not always clearly reflected in media accounts and at times there has been considerable operational overlap proposals such as those made by the 911 commission to change organizational relationships will however be evaluated on the basis of separate role s and missions operating practices and relevant statutory authorities what are special operations and paramilitary operations dod defines special operations as ope rations conducted in hostile denied or politically sensitive environments to achieve military diplomatic informational andorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22017crs2 1 definitions are from joint publication 102 dep artment of defense dictionary

country but resembling them in organization equipment training or mission in this report the term military operations will be used for operations conducted by the cia whose officers and employ ees are not part of the armed forces of the united states in practice military personne l may be temporarily assigned to the cia and cia personnel may tem porarily serve directly under military commander in

conducts covert and clandestine operations to avoid direc tly implicating the us government roles and mission of cia and sof ussocom was established by congre ss in 1987 pl 99661 10 usc 167 ussocoms stated mission is to plan dir ect and execute special operations in the conduct of the war on terrorism in order to di srupt defeat and dest roy terrorist networks that threaten the united states2 the cia was established by the nationa l security act of 1947 pl 80253 to collect intelligence through human sources and to analyze and disseminate intelligence from all sources it was also to perform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the president or the national security council may direct this opa phrase was within few months interpreted to include range of covert activities such as those that had been carried out by the office of strategic services oss during world war ii although some observers long maintained that covert actions had st atutory basis in 1991 the nati onal security act was amended by pl 10288 to establish specific proce dures for approving covert actions and for notifying key members of congress the statutory definition of covert action activity or activities of the united states government to influence political economic or military conditions abroad where it is intended that the role of the united states government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly is broa d and can include wide ra nge of clandestine efforts from subsidizing foreign journals and political parties to participation in what are essentially military operations in the case of paramilitary operations there is clear potential for overlap with activities that can be carried out by dod in general the cia would be designated to conduct operations that are to be w holly covert or disavowablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22017crs3 3 see barton gellman and dafna linzer afghanistan iraq two wars collide washington post oct 22 2004 p

states lead responsibility for directing and executing paramilita ry operations whether cla ndestine or covert should shift to the defense departme nt there it should be consolidated with the capabilities for training direction and execution of such operations already bein g developed in the special operations command the 911 commissions basis for this recommendation appears to be both performance and costbase d the report states that the cia did not sufficiently invest in developing r obust capability to conduc t paramilitary operations with us personnel prior to 911 and in stead relied on imprope rly trained proxies foreign personnel under contract resulting in an unsatisfact ory outcome the report also states that the united states does not have the money or people to build

in one entity some observers question whether procedures are in place to insure overall coordination of effort press reports concer ning an alleged lack of coordination during afghan operations undoubtedly contributed to the 911 commissions recommendation regarding paramilitary operations7 although such accounts have been discounted by some observers the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act pl 108458 included provision section 1013 that requires dod and cia to develop joint procedures to improve the coordination and d econfliction of operations that involve elementsof the cia and dod when sepa rate missions are underway in the same geographical area the cia and dod are required to establish procedures to reach mutual agreement on the tactical and strategic objectives for the region and clear delineation of operational responsib ilities to prevent conflict nd duplication of effort potential impacts diminished cia intelligence capabilities some observers suggest that capability to plan and undertake paramilitary opera tions is directly related to the agencys responsibility to obtain intelligence from human sources some individuals and groups that supply information may also be of assistance in undertaking or supporting paramilitary operation if cia were to have responsibilitie s in this area however certain types of foreign contacts might not be exploited and capabilities that have proven important in afghanistan and else where might erode or disappear8 additional strain on sof some question if this proposed shift in responsibility would place additional strains on sof who ar extensively committed worldwide others argue that sof lack the experience and requi site training to c onduct covert operations9 they suggest that if sof do undertake covert operations training that it could diminish their ability to perform their more traditional missions reduction in flexibility the 911 report notes the cias reputation for agility in operations as well as the milita rys reputation for being methodical and cumbersome10 some experts question if dod and sof are capable of operating in more agile and flexible manner they contend that the cia was able to beat sof intohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22017crs5 11 kibbe p 112 12 see us congress senate select committee on intelligence authorizing appropriations for fiscal year 1991 102nd cong

are concerned that if sof takes over responsibility for clandestine and covert operations that they will become less agile and perhaps more vulnerable to bureaucratic interference from defense officials sof funding authority section 1208 of pl 108375 permits sof to directly pay and equip foreign forces or groups s upporting the us in combating terrorism although not recommendation in the 911 co mmissions report many feel that this authority will not only help sof in the c onduct of unconventional wa rfare but could also be crucial tool should they become involve d in covert or clandestine operations in afghanistan sof did not have the authority to pay and equip local forces and instead relied on the cia to write checks for needed arms ammunition and supplies issues for congress oversight issues congress may choose to revi ew past or current paramilitary operations undertaken by the cia and mig ht also choose to assess the extent of coordination between the cia and dod pl 108458 required that report be submitted to defense and intelligence committees by june 2005 describing pro cedures established in regard to coordination and deconfliction of cia and dod operations that report provided an opportunity to indicate how initiatives by the executive branch have addressed rele vant issues cia has not maintained sizable paramilitary force on the shelf when directed it has built paramilitary capabilities by using its individuals either us or foreign with paramilitary expe rience under the management of its permanent operations personnel in an entity known as the special activities division the permanent staff would be responsible for planning and for maintainin g ties to former cia officials and military personnel and individuals including those with special language qualifications who could be employed should the need arise few observers doubt that there is continuing need for coordination between the cia and dod regarding paramilitary capabilities and plans for future operations furthermore many observers believe that the cia should concentrate on filling the gaps focusing on those types of operations that dod is likely to avoid nevertheless they view this comparatively limited set of potential operations to be vitally important one that should not be neglected or assigned to dod there may be occasions when having to acknowledge an official us role would preclude operations that were otherwise considered vital to the national security the cia can provide the deniability that would be difficult if not impossible for military personnel12 potential legal considerations some experts believe that there may be legal difficulties if sof are required to conduct covert ope rations one issue is the legality of ordering sof personnel to c onduct covert activities that w ould require them to forfeit their geneva convention status to retain deniability to operate with deniability sof could be required to opera

be contrary to international laws or the laws of war and us military personnel are ge nerally expected to follow these laws13 traditionally the public text of intelligence legislation has included few provisions regarding paramilitary operations levels of funding and ot her details are included in classified annexes which are understood to have the force of law the house and senate intelligence committees do have considerable influence in supporting or discouraging particular covert actions in few cases c ongress has formally voted to deny funding to ongoing covert operations special forces however fall under the house and senate armed services committees and it is unclear how congress would handle oversight if covert operations are shifted to sof as well as how disputes between the intelligence and armed services committees would be dealt with congressional activity 109th congress the 109th congress did not address th is issue legislatively on november 23 2004 president bush issued letter requiring the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence to review matters relating to recommendation 32 and submit their advice to him by february 23 2005 in unclassified testimony to the senate select committee on intelligence in february 2005 the director of the cia testified that the cia and dod disagreed with the 911 committees recommendation14 in june of 2005 it was reported that the secr etary of defense and the director of the central intelligence agency responded to the pr esident stating that neither the cia nor dod endorses the commission s recommendation on shiftin g the paramilitary mission or operations15 the administration reportedly rejected the 911 commissions recommendation to shift the responsib ility for paramilitary operations to dod16 110th congress it is possible that the 110th congress might legislatively shift the responsibility for paramilitary operations from the cia to dod reports suggest that the democraticled house
