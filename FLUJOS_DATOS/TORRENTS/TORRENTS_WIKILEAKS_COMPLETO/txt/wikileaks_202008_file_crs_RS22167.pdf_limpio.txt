raich involved conflict between californias compassionate use act1 and the federal controlled substances act csa2 in august 2002 after federal agents seized and destroyed the respondents medicinal marijuana plants suit was brought in the northern district of california seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief against the us attorney general preventing the prosecution of medicinal users pursuant to the csa3 respondents argued that as applied to their specific situations the csa exceeded congresss authority under the commerce clause and therefore was unconstitutional4 the district court denied the motion concluding that the respondents could not establish likelihood of success on the merits5

states v lopez6 and united states v morrison lopezmorrison 7 held that as applied to the respondents the csa exceeded congresss power under the commerce clause8 in so holding the court constructed narrow affected class of activity namely the intrastate noncommercial cultivation possession and use of marijuana for personal medical purposes on the advice of physician and in accordance with state law9 with this narrowly defined class of activity the court proceeded to apply the four factor lopezmorrison test10 with respect to the first factorwhether or not the activity is commercial 1 cal

1222 1228 9th cir 2003 while the supreme court has previously addressed issues relating to the csa in light of californias medical marijuana statute it did not decide the case on commerce clause grounds see united states v oakland cannabis buyers cooperative 532 us 483 494 n7 2001 nor are we passing today on constitutional question such as whether the controlled substances act exceeds congress power under the commerce clause 9 see raich 352 f3d at 122829 stating that this limited use is clearly distinct from the broader illicit drug market as well as any broader commercial market for marijuanainsofar as the medicinal marijuana at issue in this case is not intended for nor does it enter the stream of commerce 10 taken together the courts decisions in lopez and morrison established four factor test to determine whether federal statute or regulation has substantial effect on in terstate commerce 1 whether the regulated activity is commercial or economic in nature 2 whether an express jurisdictional element is provided in the statute to limit its reach 3 whether congress made express findings about the effects of the proscribed activity on interstate commerce and 4 whether the link between the prohibited activity and the effect on interstate commerce is attenuated see continued httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22167g9g152g151g163g138g149g142g156g561g159g495g561g20

the narrow class of activity in this case could not be considered commercial or economic in nature11 the court next considered whether the csa contains an express jurisdictional element that would limit its reach to those cases that substantially affect interstate commerce with stated analysis and apparently persuaded by the reasoning of district court opinion the court concluded that such jurisdictional hook exists in the relevant portions of the csa12 with respect to whether the legislative history contains congressional findings regarding the effects on interstate commerce the court was able to cite findings relating to the effect that intrastate drug trafficking activity would have on interstate commerce13 while admitting that the legislative history lends support to the constitutionality of the statute under the commerce clause the court proceeded to diminish the importance of these findings by arguing that they were not specific to either marijuana or the medicinal use of marijuana but rather related to the general effects of drug trafficking on interstate commerce 14 in addition the court referred to language in morrison discussing the limited role of congressional findings15 moreover the court referenced ninth circuit precedent concluding that the first and fourth prongs of the morrison testwhether the statute regulates an economic enterprise and whether the link is attenuatedare the most significant factors to the analysis16 finally with respect to whether the link between the regulated activity and substantial effect on interstate commerce is attenuated the court expressed doubt that the interstate effect of homegrown medical marijuana is substantial citing authority questioning the validity of the federal governments claim of an effect on interstate commerce17 the court concluded that this factor favors finding that the csa cannot constitutionally be applied to the class of activities at issue in this case18 the united states supreme court granted certiorari specifically on the question of whether the power vested in congress by both the necessary and proper clause and the commerce clause of article i includes the power to prohibit the local growth possession and use of marijuana permissible as result of californias law19 the court in an opinion by justice stevens reversed the ninth circuits decision and held that

in reaching its conclusions the court relied heavily on its 1942 decision in wickard v filburn which held that the agricultural adjustment act s federal quota system applied to bushels of wheat that were homegrown and personally consumed wickard stands for the proposition that congress can rationally combine the effects that an individual producer has on an interstate market to find substantial impacts on interstate commerce21 the court pointed to numerous similarities between the facts presented in raich and those in wickard initially the court noted that because the commodities being cultivated in both cases are fungible and that wellestablished interstate markets exist both markets are susceptible to fluctuations in supply and demand based on production intended for homeconsumption being introduced into the national market 22 according to the court just as there was di fference between the wheat mr wickard produced for personal consumption and the wheat cultivated for sale on the open market there is discernable difference between personal homegrown medicinal marijuana and marijuana grown for the express purpose of being sold in the interstate market23 thus the court concluded that congress had rational basis for concluding that leaving homeconsumed marijuana outside federal control would similarly affect price and market conditions24 respondents argued that wickard was distinguishable because in the case of wheat the activity involved was purely commercial and the evidence clearly established that the aggregate production of wheat had significant effect on the interstate market conversely respondents claimed that the activity at issue in raich is noncommercialthe respondents had never attempted to sell their marijuanaand congress had made finding that the personal cultivation and use of medicinal marijuana has substantial effect on the interstate marijuana market 25 the court however noted that the standard for as sessing the scope of congresss power under the commerce clause is not whether the activity at issue when aggregated substantially affects interstate commerce but rather whether there exists rational basis for congress to have 20 id at 2205 citing perez v united states 402 us 146 151 1970 the final outcome was 63 with justice stevens writing for himself and justices souter kennedy breyer and

deferential standard concluded that congress had rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave gaping hole in the csa27 moreover the court affirmed that congress was acting well within its authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to regulate commerce among the several states28 despite having concluded that under the rational basis test congress had acted within its constitutional authority when it enacted the csa and applied it to intrastate possession of marijuana the court nevertheless had to distinguish lopez and morrison the courts more recent commerce clause decisions the court concluded that the csa unlike the statutes in either lopez gun free school zones act or morrison violence against women act regulated activity that is quintessentially economic therefore neither lopez or morrison cast any doubts on the constitutionality of the statute29 the court specifically rejected the reasoning used by the ninth circuit concluding that congress acted rationally in determining that none of the characteristics making up the purported class whether viewed individually or in the aggregate compelled an exemption from the csa rather the subdivided class of activities defined by the court of appeals was an essential part of the larger regulatory scheme30 in supporting its conclusions the court noted that by characterizing marijuana as schedule i narcotic congress was implicitly finding that it had medicinal value at all in addition the court returned to the fact that medicinal marijuana was fungible good thus making it indistinguishable from the recreational versions that congress had clearly intended to regulate according to the court to carve out medicinal use as distinct class of activity as the ninth circuit had done would effectively make any federal regulation including quality prescription or quantity controls of any locally cultivated and possessed controlled substance for any purpose beyond the outer limits of congresss commerce clause authority 31 moreover the court held that californias state law permitting the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes cannot be the basis for placing the respondents class of activity beyond the reach of the federal government due to the supremacy clause which requires that in the event of conflict between state and federal law the federal law shall prevail32 finally the court responded to the respondents argument that its activities are not an essential part of larger regulatory scheme because they are both isolated and policed by the state of california and they are completely separate and distinct from the interstate market33 the court held that not only could congress have rationally rejected this argument but also that it seemed obvious that doctors patients and caregivers will increase the supply and demand for the substance on the open market 34 in sum the court concluded that the case for exemption can 26 id at 220809 citing lopez 514 us at 557 see also hodel v virginia surface mining reclamation assn inc 452 us 264 276280 1981 perez 402 us at 155156 27 see raich 125 sct at 2209 28

domestically is immune from federal regulation which has already been precluded by the courts decision in wickard v filburn 35 justice oconnors dissent focused on the lack of evidence indicating that medicinal marijuana users have discernable or significant effect on the interstate market which congress sought to regulate36 moreover justice oconnor emphasizing the system of joint sovereignty espoused by james madison argued that this overreaching by the federal government deprives the states of their ability to make their own independent political judgments with respect to the validity of medicinal marijuana laws37 both justice scalias concurring opinion and justice thomass dissenting opinion focused on the scope and import of the necessary and proper clause justice scalias opinion argued that because congress could rationally have concluded that regulating such intrastate activity would have undercut its objective of prohibiting the sale of marijuana on the interstate market it was necessary to extend the scope of the csa to encompass this behavior 38 on the other hand justice thomass dissent argues that the necessary and proper clause as originally understood cannot be used to expand the scope of congresss enumerated powers39 according to justice thomas by allowing congress to regulate such intrastate noncommercial activity the court has effectively granted the federal government general police power over the entire country that subverts the constitutions basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty 40
