observers contend th at instead of amending the constitution congress could exercise its constitutional authority to preempt state law regarding the times places and manner of holding elections14 for the house and pass legislation that would require states to hold expedited special elections within specified time frame15 they assert that the legislation could amend current law16 which leaves it to state law to determine when an election must be held to fill house vacancy supporters of this approach note that curre nt provisions for filling vacancies in the house in nonemergency situations would remain intact and the expedited special elections would be triggered only in the event of significant number of house vacancies due to national emergency fu rther supporters argued that passing federal statute is far less cumbersome process than amending the constitution in addition advocates believe th at statute providing for expedited special elections could minimize the length of time house membership would be severely depleted without violating the basic tene t of elected representatives on the other hand critics of this approach argue that it could result in campaign periods so short that citizens could not make reasoned informed decisions about candidates and issues shorte r campaign periods could also be problematic for state election officials who in keeping with their responsibility for administering elections must handle filing deadlines filing requirements absentee ballots ballot access and other aspects of the election pro cess in congressiona l testimony
