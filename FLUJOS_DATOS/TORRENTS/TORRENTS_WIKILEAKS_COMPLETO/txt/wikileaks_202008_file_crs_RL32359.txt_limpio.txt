in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division globalizing cooperative threat reduction survey of options summary increasingly congress and the bush administration are looking to utilize nonproliferation assistance programs including cooperative threat reduction to help reduce the risk of terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction wmd in the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 sec 1308 congress authorized the bush administration to spend 50 million of unobligated funds from the cooperative threat reduction program in states outside the former soviet union as of september 2006 the administration had spent such funds only in albania 385 million for the purpose of eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles the report of the 911 commission called for continued support for threat reduction assistance to keep wmd away from terrorist groups this report which will be updated as needed analyzes the range of possible applications of ctr funds the kinds of assistance that might be supplied and describes legal financial technical and political constraints on possible assistance key underlying issue is that the countries posing the greatest risks may be the least amenable to cooperative approaches second issue is that there is an array of us domestic and international legal restrictions on the most useful kinds of cooperation both the executive branch and congress may need to consider domestic and international legal and political restrictions on cooperation with states outside the nonproliferation regimes low levels of transparency exhibited by most of the potential recipient states and the lack of incentives for many of these states to pursue threat reduction measures in addition congress may wish to consider whether potentially expanding the geographic scope of ctr may have negative effect on existing programs one school of thought believes russia as the largest source of stocks of biological chemical and nuclear weapons should continue to be the main focus of attention other observers believe there is now an opportunity to focus on states within the nexus of terrorism and wmd this report complements

relatively new tool in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction1 the cooperative threat reduction ctr programs funded by the department of defense dod are the most visible of these programs begun in 1991 ctr initially aimed to help russia meet its start obligations to reduce strategic nuclear weapons2 within decade however ctr took on the goal of reducing the threat of terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction wmd3 experts realized that russia needed to protect its cold war overhang of wmd materials scientists and equipment from those who might exploit insider opportunities and who had incentives particularly financial to sell wmd technology to anyone now however many analysts support expanding cooperative threat reduction programs beyond russia to other geographic areas the bush administration stated in early 2003 that it had expanded the strategic focus of the ctr program to support the war on terrorism4 in the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 sec 1308 congress authorized the bush administration to spend 50 million of unobligated funds from the cooperative threat reduction program in states outside the former soviet union as of september 2006 the administration had spent 385 million in albania for the purpose of eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles5 the report of the 911 commission called for continued support for threat reduction assistance to keep wmd away from terrorist groups this report surveys options for applying ctr programs to states that pose wmd and terrorism threat it describes potential recipients of such funding those states with wmd programs and terrorism problems the kinds of assistance that may be possible potential legal political and technical constraints on assistance and potential costs and benefits to the united states of providing such assistance the 1 this report was updated with the assistance of jill marie parilla research associate 2 see crs report rl31957 nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance us programs in the former soviet union by amy woolf for comprehensive review 3 wmd in this paper includes nuclear biological and chemical weapons and excludes the missiles that can delivery such weapons and radiological weapons 4 us department of defense fiscal year 20042005 biennial budget estimates february 2003 p 1 5 personal communication on september 14 2006 with official in cooperative threat reduction policy office ousdpolicy crs2 report begins with brief review of why ctr programs might be considered applicable to the threat of wmd terrorism and then takes more detailed look at the threat of wmd terrorism it reviews how certain kinds of ctr assistance might help defuse the threat and presents some options tailored for specific countries the report also looks at constraints involved in providing assistance and broader implications of such assistance connecting ctr and wmd terrorism the belief that terrorists were growing more interested in wmd grew after the 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states despite obvious link and continued to grow as us policy statements drew further linkages in his january 2002 state of the union address president bush highlighted iraq iran and north korea as axis of evil states those that support terrorism and also have wmd later that year both the national security strategy and the national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction proliferation highlighted the connection between terrorists and wmd in 2003 the us went to war with iraq justifying this action primarily on the grounds that iraq had wmd and connection to terrorists associated with 911 more recently the exposure of the aq khan nuclear network in pakistan which provided sensitive nuclear weapons technology including bomb design to libya iran and north korea has raised concerns not just about what could be traded clandestinely but also about potential terrorist access to wmd khans sale of technology to three state sponsors of terrorism allegations of ties to terrorist organization and the pakistan governments precarious relationship with terrorist groups on its soil have prompted some to call for assistance to pakistan to reduce the threat of terrorist access to wmd key strategy in limiting the risk of terrorist access to wmd is to cut off access at the source for some russia should continue to be the main focus of efforts to prevent and deter terrorists from acquiring wmd because of russias vast cold war overhang of wmd technologies material and personnel others see september 2001 as watershed after which cooperation should be extended to problem states such as pakistan syria libya and iran still others see nonproliferation assistance programs as way to bring states outside the nonproliferation regime like north korea and pakistan under some restraints the bush administration has advocated the use of traditional and new tools to counter wmd proliferation including interdiction preemption diplomacy and assistance in key nonproliferation speech on february 11 2004 president bush introduced seven new initiatives including expanding ctr in particular bush noted that such funds could be used for retraining weapons scientists in iraq and libya or for reducing uranium enrichment levels in foreign research nuclear reactors6 6 at the national defense university president bush unveiled six other initiatives to combat wmd 1 expand the proliferation security initiative to include shutting down facilities seizing materials and freezing assets 2 pass security council resolution requiring all states to criminalize proliferation enact strict export controls and secure all sensitive materials within their borders 3 encourage states to renounce uranium enrichment and continued crs3 in fact however programs to retrain such scientists have used state department nonproliferation and disarmament fund monies few underlying issues may influence the ultimate success of ctrlike approaches one is the cooperative element in the us relationship with the state in question states willingness to cooperate may hinge on calculations of the wmd programs importance to its security and other geopolitical considerations second issue may be that states perception of ctr assistance is this just another name for arms control us unilateralism or bribery more broadly there is the question of whether globalizing ctr may spread resources thinly at time when there is still significant work to be done in russia and the former soviet states congressional role since 1991 congress has authorized ctr funds specifically for use in the soviet union and later in russia and former soviet union fsu states before fy2004 agencies used other sources of funding for nonproliferation assistance programs applied outside of russia and the fsu in fy2004 the bush administration was able to use 50 million of unobligated ctr funds outside the fsu the nunnlugar expansion act was passed as part of the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 to assist the united states in resolution of critical emerging proliferation threats and to permit the united states to take advantage of opportunities to achieve longstanding nonproliferation goals the final language of the act requires the president to determine and notify congress in writing within 10 days after obligating funds that the projectactivity will help the united states in the resolution of critical emerging proliferation threat or permit the united states to take advantage of opportunities to achieve longstanding nonproliferation goals b department of defense is the government agency most capable of carrying out the projectactivity and c projectactivity will be completed in short period of time conferees noted that they expected the president to assign projects to the most appropriate agencies7 on february 8 2005 senator lugar introduced s 313 the nunnlugar cooperation threat reduction act of 2005 which sought to remove restrictions associated with using ctr funds outside of the fsu in brief the legislation would have lifted ctr programwide restrictions on spending the money including certifications removed the 50million cap removed restrictions on spending 6 continued plutonium reprocessing by ensuring reliable access at reasonable cost to fuel for civilian nuclear reactors and make nsg enrichment and reprocessingrelated nuclear exports available only to states that already have fully operational capability 4 make signature of the additional protocol prerequisite for any nuclear imports 5 create special committee of the iaea board of governors for safeguards and verification and 6 disqualify any state currently under investigation from serving on the iaea board see httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200402200402114html 7 in separate action rep schiff introduced hr 2063 for the same purpose schiffs bill specifically named pakistan india north korea china iran and iraq as potential recipients of ctr assistance crs4 money for chemical weapons destruction and provided notwithstanding authority the bill was referred to the armed services committee of the provisions in s 313 only the repeal of certification requirements was adopted as an amendment in the senates fy2007 national defense authorization bill section 1304 s 2766 however this provision was not incorporated in the bill agreed to in conference on september 20 2006 hr 5122 background the threat of terrorist access to wmd is relatively new concern for nonproliferation experts first the nonproliferation regime has always focused on controlling ingredients at the source as the most effective first line of defense such an approach already addresses two kinds of terrorist threats that an insider might collaborate to sell or give terrorist some materials and that terrorists might seek to steal materials themselves from facilities second the regime has controls for transfers to anyone not just states outside the regime third apart from aum shinrikyos use of sarin gas on the tokyo subway few nonstate actors have conducted or attempted to conduct an attack with functional nuclear chemical or biological weapon8 on the other hand the perception of an increased threat of terrorist use of wmd has grown since the september 2001 attacks on the united states there is evidence that qaeda assigned high priority to acquiring wmd capability and some observers believe that chemical and biological weapons cbw capabilities are increasingly available the central intelligence agency cia estimated that the threat of terrorists using chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn materials remained high in 2003 note the use of the word materials not weapons the cia also concluded that terrorist groups probably will continue to favor longproven conventional tactics such as bombings and shootings9 by february 2006 the director of national intelligence john negroponte told congress that today we are more likely to see an attack from terrorists using weapons or agents of mass destruction than states although terrorists capabilities would be much more limited in fact intelligence reporting indicates that nearly 40 terrorist organizations insurgencies or cults have used possessed or expressed an interest in chemical biological radiological or nuclear agents or weapons 8 richard falkenrath robert d newman and bradley thayer americas achilles heel cambridge ma mit press 1998 p 30 9 central intelligence agency unclassified report to congress on the acquisition of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional munitions 1 june through 31 december 2003 report pursuant to section 721 of the fy1997 intelligence authorization act see httpwwwciagovciareports721_reports pdfs721report_july_dec2003pdf crs5 many are capable of conducting simple smallscale attacks such as poisonings or using improvised chemical devices10 however negroponte provided further evidence to support those claims the threat nexus of wmd and terrorism according to the 2002 national security strategy rogue states are those that brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything for which it stands11 the cia has reported growing concern that traditional state recipients of wmd technology may follow north koreas practice of supplying specific wmd related technology and expertise to other countries or nonstate actors12 when those states are designated state sponsors of terrorism there is the possibility they may provide the terrorist organizations that they support with wmd materials or weapons while there is very little evidence to support this assumption it cannot be ruled out because these countries tend to be pariah states however they may offer few footholds for cooperation nonetheless some of the new and reinvigorated cooperation in counterterrorism since 2001 may help spur cooperation in other areas equally risky is the category of states that have terrorist activity on their soil and wmd programs these pose different kind of risk that terrorists may gain access to wmd without the authority or knowledge of the host government either through insider ties or through instability engendered by terrorist activity table 1 below crossreferences wmd capabilities and terrorist activities estimates of wmd capabilities are drawn from semiannual cia unclassified reports to congress per section 721 of the fy1997 foreign intelligence authorization act unclassified report to congress on the acquisition of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional munitions for the purposes of analysis terrorism activity is divided into state sponsors of terrorism per section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 and those with activity terrorist incidents on their soil it could be argued that the list of state sponsors of terrorism corresponds poorly with the threat because most of the formal state 10 john d negroponte annual threat assessment of the director of national intelligence for

cuba cuba was first designated state sponsor of terrorism in 1982 although it has ratified all 12 counterterrorism conventions it has remained opposed to the us global war on terrorism14 the cia judged in august 2003 that we have credible evidence however that the cuban government has engaged in or directly supported international terrorist operations in the past decade although our information is insufficient to say beyond doubt that collaboration has occurred15 the administrations assertions concerning cubas wmd programs which some observers dispute focus on limited biological

of the charter gave iran new deadline of august 31 to comply with security council requests or face stronger council action in the form of sanctions under article 41 to date iran has evaded demands that it halt uranium enrichment the united states believes that iran continues to seek chemicals production technology training and expertise from abroadand that it has stockpiled blister blood and choking agents and aired these concerns at the first review conference of the cwc in april 200319 iran which ratified the cwc in 1997 first admitted it had past cw program in 1998 but it has not acknowledged its use of chemical weapons against iraq iran also reportedly provided libya with chemical weapons that were later used in chad20 the cia has reported to congress that iran has continued to seek chemicals production technology training and expertise from chinese entities the cia also believes that iran has stockpiled blister blood and choking agents and probably has nerve agents in addition the cia reported in 2003 that iran continued to seek dualuse biotechnical material equipment and expertise from which its offensive bw program could have benefitted21 the state departments bureau of intelligence and research reported in april 2003 that iran probably has capabilities to produce small quantities of bw agents but has limited ability to weaponize them22 in august 2005 the

statements from north korea on its capabilities are bit misleading in 2003 north korea repeatedly stated that it has reprocessed all its spent fuel that it has nuclear weapons and on one occasion north korean officials threatened to export nuclear weapons29 in january 2004 north korean officials reportedly told an unofficial us delegation that they did not have nuclear weapons or uranium enrichment program30 there is public evidence that north korea has offered nuclear material for sale whether produced in the early 1990s or more recently on july 5 2006 north korea tested 7 ballistic missiles including an intercontinental missile that apparently failed or was aborted 42 seconds after it was launched on july 15 the security council unanimously passed resolution 1695 demanding that north korea suspend all related ballistic missile activity and return immediately to the sixparty talks without preconditions31 according to two chemical and biological weapons experts north korea has an estimated 25005000 tons of blister and nerve agents much of which is weaponized in artillery shells and rockets within firing range of seoul32 sudan sudan has ratified all twelve international

wmd development and ceases facilitating terrorist activity in iraq on may 11 2004 president bush issued executive order 13338 which implemented sanctions including ban on munitions and dualuse items as well as ban on exports other than food and medicine and syrian aircraft flights to or overflights of the united states36 in 2006 congress amended the iran nonproliferation act to include syria pl 109112 with respect to wmd syria has known cw program and is believed to be seeking biological weapons according to one press account it is the worst kept secret in the middle east that damascus has one of the largest stockpiles of chemical agents in the region37 syria is not party to the cwc and has signed but not ratified the bwc syria also has an arsenal of short and mediumrange ballistic missiles it is party to the npt and despite having signed nuclear cooperation agreements with russia in 1998 and 2000 few believe it has serious nuclear weapons aspirations states with terrorist activity and wmd programs in addition to the state sponsors of terrorism that have wmd programs there are other states with wmd programs that have terrorist activity on their soil pakistan india and israel fit in this category the fact that none is member of the npt could limit cooperation in the nuclear area all are members of the cwc but many observers believe israel and pakistan have covert cw programs india declared its cw program in 1997 after initial declarations that it had cw india has already destroyed 46 of its category 1 cw stockpile and all of its category 2 weapons it must destroy the rest by 2007 pakistan and india are members of the bwc and are not thought to have bw programs israel has not joined the bwc and many believe that it has carried out bw research and development 35

potential terrorist access of those three only egypt is not party to the cwc egypt is also concern because it is known to have bw program it has signed but not ratified the bwc the defense intelligence agency reported in april 2003 that we do not believe that saudi arabia is trying to acquire biological or chemical agents or weapons from foreign sources38 in january 2005 the iaea investigated reports that egypt had conducted some nuclear reprocessing at laboratoryscale level but did not conclude that egypt violated its safeguards agreement39 how significant is the nexus two factors should be considered in assessing the severity of threat of terrorist access to wmd intention and opportunities first terrorists operating in certain countries that have wmd programs do not necessarily have an interest in acquiring wmd most of the terrorist groups with an interest in wmd tend to be more internationally rather than domestically focused40 to date the kurdistan workers party pkk hamas qaeda and aum shinrikyo have demonstrated interest in developing weapons of mass destruction although the following countries have terrorist activities on their soil terrorists active on their soil have not demonstrated wmd intentions algeria india thailand and yugoslaviakosovo second the states in question present different opportunities for terrorists to gain access in some cases facilities may be remotely located with good surveillance capabilities and good security in addition some facilities may be under military control the level of security in country like north korea or israel may be much higher than for example in algeria or egypt even in country like russia which many observers believe presents significant opportunities for stealing nuclear material the ability of terrorists to acquire material is not given the cia has judged that none of the sixteen seizures of russian weaponsusable nuclear material since 1992 was connected to terrorists41 on the other hand the inability of state to control either its people or its territory which may or may not be defined as failed state may present opportunities for terrorists to move freely within country and take advantage of available resources the dualuse nature of many materials and technologies associated with wmd may present terrorists with the ability to enhance their wmd capabilities in countries that do not have an obvious wmd program in the case of nuclear programs for example south africa could be an attractive target for terrorists because it had nuclear weapons program and has heu in metal form under iaea 38 defense intelligence agencys dia unclassified responses to questions for the record from the worldwide threat hearing of february 11 2003 dated june 30 2003 p 223 39 report by iaea director general gov20052 40 this report does not cover domestic us groups that have attempted to acquire wmd related capabilities because of the focus on providing assistance to foreign countries on terrorism and counterproliferation 41 cia unclassified responses to worldwide threat hearing 2003 p 152 crs14 safeguards of course this attractiveness could be mitigated by good security and low terrorist activity on south african soil it appears that the bush administration has taken the position that weaponsusable material even if it is under iaea safeguards may not be secure enough42 one of the seven initiatives highlighted in president bushs speech on nonproliferation on february 11 2004 was spending more money to bring back heu from foreign countries and in may 2004 secretary of energy spencer abraham announced the global threat reduction initiative which consolidates and accelerates several existing programs to reduce this threat in large part revelations about irans nuclear program and the role of pakistan in supplying uranium enrichment equipment and technology to iran libya and north korea has revived decadesold debate about whether or not certain processes and materials should be controlled internationally or banned altogether not since the atoms for peace program in the 1950s has international storage of plutonium or enriched uranium or international control of enrichment and reprocessing facilities been in vogue however the director general of the iaea dr mohamed elbaradei suggested just such an approach in 2003 and convened an experts group to study options for multilateral management of the nuclear fuel cycle43 the basic objective of these options would be to restrict sensitive technology in the hands of few states while providing assured fuel supplies for nuclear reactors to other states in 2004 president bush proposed that enrichment and reprocessing technology should not be spread any further than it already is and that export controls national and multilateral agreements should be tightened to eliminate this possibility44 the g8 adopted voluntary moratoriums on such transfers in 2004 in 2006 the bush administration proposed global nuclear energy partnership gnep which envisions cooperation in developing proliferationresistant new kind of spent fuel reprocessing such new technology according to some observers may not be ready for decades cooperative threat reduction program as precedent for over decade us government agencies particularly the departments of energy and state have spent nonproliferation assistance funds in countries outside of the former soviet union fsu given the relatively new ability to expend dods ctr funds outside of the fsu however it may be useful to examine the ctr program for precedents including the origin of the program its objectives kinds of work funded and problems encountered congress enacted the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction ctr program in 1991 addressing in senator lugars words the dominant international proliferation danger the massive nuclear chemical and biological weapons 42 state department interview 43 dr mohamed elbaradei towards safer world the economist october 1824 2003 44 see httpwwwwhitehousegov for text of speech crs15 infrastructure of the former soviet union45 as the soviet union began to dissolve russia could not meet its obligations to reduce strategic nuclear weapons under the start treaty further it became clear that the unraveling of the military industrial complex could have security consequences that transcended the former soviet unions borders the initial legislation allowed the department of defense to use unobligated funds to destroy and dismantle strategic nuclear weapons make transportation and storage of weapons longer in the stockpile secure and convert former wmd facilities and scientists the ctr program had four key objectives destroy nuclear chemical and other weapons of mass destruction transport store disable and safeguard these weapons in connection with their destruction establish verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of these weapons their components and weaponsusable materials and prevent the diversion of scientific expertise that could contribute to weapons programs in other nations destruction and dismantlement activities included removing warheads deactivating missiles and eliminating launch facilities for strategic weapons under the start i agreement efforts to improve the safety security and control over nuclear weapons and fissile materials have included providing storage containers bullet proof blankets secure rail cars and building plutonium storage facility at mayak demilitarization projects have included defense conversion projects and international science and technology center projects to help wmd scientists pursue work with peaceful objectives and militarytomilitary contacts ctr programs have evolved and expanded over time adjusting to russian fsu states and us priorities as well as to changing perceptions about which threats posed the greatest risk the programs have also bowed upon occasion to bureaucratic intransigence and practical considerations in one notable incident department of energy officials provided blankets to facility guards who were leaving their posts to collect wood to build fires as the economy worsened in russia in the mid1990s ctr projects sought to provide alternative employment and sources of income for unpaid or outofwork wmd scientists increased reports of attempts to steal nuclear material highlighted the need for ctr to address material protection control and accounting mpca measures for nuclear material consolidation of nuclear weapons and material and secure transportation the united states developed practical approach quickfixes like bars on windows blastproof doors fences followed by second stage that included more sophisticated security measures like sensors cameras and personnel access measures 46 45 ctr was an amendment to the implementing legislation of the conventional armed forces in europe treaty pl 102228 sponsored by senators nunn and lugar in the form of the soviet nuclear threat reduction act of 1991 for more information see the lugar doctrine httplugarsenategovnunnlugarhtml 46 see remarks by rose gottemoeller former deputy undersecretary for defense and continued crs16 the idea that two former adversaries could cooperate on such sensitive matters as nuclear weapons and material security was radical in 1991 but so too was the prospect of russias wmd infrastructure unraveling the circumstances surrounding ctrs inception were unique there was previous agreement under the start treaty to destroy nuclear weapons agreement on both sides that those legitimate weapons needed to be secured before they were destroyed and absence of international inspections because of russias status as nuclear weapons state russia had already agreed to destroy weapons the only questions were how to implement those reductions quickly and who would pay for them that soviet nuclear weapons had been targeted at the united states for so many years presented compelling reason for the united states to help the same situation arose years later when russia signed the cwc and ctr funds were used to help destroy those weapons an issue that could arise in the context of expanding ctrs scope is whether states with stocks of chemical weapons that are bound to destroy them by 2007 under the cwc india and one anonymous state will see this as an opportunity to have their obligations paid for by the united states kinds of assistance ctr assistance to states outside the fsu might use four types of programs those that help secure weapons sites materials and personnel these correspond roughly to the ctr missions of weapons destruction ensuring transportation safety verifiably safeguarding against proliferation and preventing diversion of scientific expertise few differences stand out from the soviet case 1 not all of the countries of concern here have actual weapons 2 some that do have weapons programs belong to treaties that they may be currently violating and 3 others that have weapons programs have international restrictions on them and may not have any interest in giving up their weapons these differences will affect the kinds of assistance the united states might want to provide to those countries and possibly also the kinds of assistance it can legally provide weapons security us assistance to most states is unlikely to emphasize weapons security as it did with russia and the fsu primarily because potential recipient states will not be as highly armed as russia in the nuclear area measures to improve the chain of command and custody and secure transportation for nuclear warheads would likely be highly controversial if extended to state outside the npt nonetheless some observers have advocated assistance to improve nuclear weapons security with the objective of ensuring that weapons could not be stolen or detonated by an unauthorized person the simplest measures would be funding and training armed guards however potential recipient states are likely already aware of the advantages of protecting their nuclear weapons advice or equipment to ensure unauthorized 46 continued nonproliferation in the department of energy in transcript of carnegie endowment for international peace nonproliferation roundtable held on september 23 2001 entitled pakistans nuclear dilemma httpwwwceiporgfileseventspaktranscriptasp crs17 use of nuclear weapons such as permissive action links pals would require access to nuclear weapons which is unlikely to be granted general information on pals such as concepts or approaches is publicly available and would not require access to weapons in all likelihood however india pakistan and israel probably have exhausted public sources of information on that topic but north korea may not have measures to ensure that command and control systems work would also help ensure unauthorized use but could possibly enhance operational capabilities and therefore may be undesirable assistance in destroying nuclear biological or chemical warheads is different matter it is assumed that the priority for bw and cw would be destruction because the respective treaties unequivocally ban those weapons temporary security weeks or months or perhaps years in the chemical weapons case of biological and chemical weapons security might be appropriate prior to destruction in the case of chemical weapons nonstate party to the cwc presumably could adhere to the guidelines set out under the cwc for destruction or join the convention as libya has decided to do site security the ctr programs developed for russia vary in their goals for site security across the wmd spectrum for nuclear sites security measures focused on helping guard against the theft of weapons or materials by insiders or outsiders site security with respect to chemical weapons has focused primarily on destruction of weapons capabilities finally site security for biological weapons has focused on dismantlement safety and security at facilities for biological pathogens measures include perimeter security such as gates and other barriers like barbed wire and personnel identification systems which can help minimize the risk of unauthorized entry sensors to detect unauthorized actions movement tampering can help against both insider and outsider threats measures to protect against inside theft include checks on personnel leaving facilities typically onerous without technical detection measures for material or components cameras in sensitive areas and accounting and access procedures armed guards could help as would operational and administrative controls in russia us officials toured sites and conducted vulnerability assessments in other cases even perimeter visits could be viewed as too sensitive however the united states could offer information or briefings on how security is conducted at sensitive facilities in the united states such information would need to be presented in general terms not specific to particular facilities to protect us national security ideally assistance could cover types of requirements for personnel vetting and training and development of security culture assistance of this kind in the nuclear area is beginning to be provided under iaea auspices to india and pakistan if the united states wanted to install cameras or sensors at sensitive facilities licenses might be required for some of them given restrictions on materials going to sensitive sites particularly if the state has history of proliferation it is more likely however that potential recipients would use commercially available security systems installing them themselves crs18 material security in the biological area there are international standards for pathogen security while rejecting the protocol developed by bwc states the united states proposed that national authorities develop such measures47 nonetheless the united states is just beginning to implement such measures in this country48 moreover even under the rubric of ctr the united states has not been successful in implementing measures within russian facilities to guard against the insider threat of theft of pathogens49 as many observers have noted the sample size of biological agents is so small that it would be quite difficult to provide 100 assurance of material losses ken alibek who defected from the soviet bw program in 1992 has noted that some russian bw labs required laboratory personnel to strip all their clothes off before leaving the working zones of the building but even this did not prevent few from attempting to smuggle out samples50 under the cwc state parties are required to secure cw stocks and agents and account for quantities of specified chemicals most of the verification measures however pertain to destroying cw including continuous monitoring and seals there is material accounting system requiring annual reports on destruction transfer and use of controlled chemicals further declared sites are subject to challenge inspections in the nuclear area measures to enhance material security in russia and other fsu ranged from removing material like highly enriched uranium heu in kazakhstan and georgia blending heu down into lowenriched uranium so that it would not be usable in weapon to permanent storage of plutonium and finally to better material protection control and accounting mpca measures where nuclear material is longer intended for use it can be secured at storage site with tamperproof seals cameras and other monitoring techniques when it is intended for legitimate industrial or research processes system of accounting and control that can follow material flows is used international nuclear safeguards rely heavily on state systems of accounting and control ssacs in measuring physical inventories of materials some technical exchanges in these areas may be possible some new techniques for securing material in place could be shared one innovative approach used in russia was placing heavy cement blocks over plutonium containers the iaea and sandia national laboratory conduct programs on 47 statement by president george w bush november 1 2001 he proposed that all bwc parties establish sound national oversight mechanisms for the security and genetic engineering of pathogenic organisms 48 remarks of under secretary of state john bolton tokyo japan august 26 2002 referring to the usa patriot act 2001 and the public health security and bioterrorist preparedness

under license personnel security in the case of the soviet union chaos and poverty combined to create incentives for soviet scientists to proliferate wmd technology the us approach generally has been to encourage them to stay in their own country and redirect their work in nonweaponsrelated areas us programs have provided financial support through research grants to individual scientists or through the international science centers51 yet programs also need ultimately to provide secure jobs interesting work and an awareness of or commitment to nonproliferation programs could also establish database of relevant scientists in certain states either to target funding or to track their activities tailoring assistance to countries there is currently coordinated plan for prioritizing

capabilities more urgency is accorded to states with known indigenous st base and less urgency to states with little or indigenous capabilities tier i north korea and iran for north korea and iran there may be equal emphasis placed on all four kinds of assistance certainly in the case of north korea there is requirement to secure weapons if not actual nuclear weapons then certainly chemical and biological weapons sites material and personnel many observers believe that the threat posed by north korea with respect to terrorists and wmd is that the regime itself would sell excess nuclear material plutonium or highly enriched uranium given the extreme isolation of the country the potential for scientists freelancing their wmd wares is probably low however north korea might pose similar problem as did russia and the fsu in the 1990s because it does not have an existing market economy therefore interim measures might be needed to sustain former wmd workers on broad scale much would depend on the scope of change that would allow cooperative threat reduction measures to be implemented for example one could imagine vastly different programs depending on whether or not north korea completely dismantled its wmd programs whether there was change in government andor whether reunification with south korea was imminent crs21 table 3 assistance to tier i states weapons site material

technology relating to weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional munitions per sec 721 of fy1997 foreign intelligence authorization act iran poses very different issues it appears fairly evident that although iran had made great strides toward putting in place the technical capabilities to produce fissile material for nuclear weapon it is unlikely so far that there are actual nuclear weapons to secure there is limited experience in applying enhanced inspections under interim application of irans additional protocol from december 2003 to january 2006 should iran become candidate for ctrlike assistance ratification of its additional protocol would be necessary iaea inspections can also provide feedback on nuclear personnel issues as inspectors develop relationships with scientific personnel iran is known to have chemical weapons and thought likely to have biological weapons in this context measures to secure such weapons their sites and materials could be useful if political agreement could be reached on their eradication as member of the cwc however declaring and inspecting weapons before their destruction would be required iraq is longer covered in this report as tier i state because it was removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list in october 2004 however the united states budgeted 900 million to the iraq survey group in fy2003 and fy2004 supplemental requests to find and destroy weapons of mass destruction although actual weapons were uncovered sites and material were secured and program was established to retrain iraqi wmd scientists beginning with 2m effort by the state department to provide alternative employment tier ii cuba sudan and syria cuba sudan and syria comprise the second tier of state sponsors of terrorism with wmd

arms control and nonproliferation john bolton has highlighted cubas bw capability some intelligence estimates have cast doubt on both cubas intentions and capabilities in that area in short the intelligence is mixed here if such capability were put up for negotiation with the united states measures would likely focus on site and material security sudan has featured less prominently in bush administration descriptions of the threat of terrorism and wmd and has been lauded for its counterterrorism cooperation as noted earlier the most recent cia unclassified assessment states that although sudan has aspired to cw program the us is working with sudan to reconcile concerns about its past attempts to seek capabilities from abroad53 any assistance would likely focus on site and material security with few indigenous capabilities personnel security is less likely to be an urgent issue syria has known cw program and is believed to be seeking biological weapons should it agree to give up its chemical weapons assistance could run the gamut from weapons to personnel security it is not known to what extent syrian scientists may have cooperated with or without government approval with other states or possibly terrorist organizations as in other cases of repressive regimes 52 continued been included in this tier 53 cia wmd technology acquisition januaryjune 2003 crs23

sources crs estimates of wmd capabilities are drawn from semiannual cia unclassified report to congress on the acquisition of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional munitions per sec 721 of fy1997 foreign intelligence authorization act in pakistan repeated assassination attempts on president musharraf allegations and admissions of nuclear assistance to north korea iran and libya and continuous battle with terrorist elements within the country have made pakistan the most crucial node of the nexus of terrorism and wmd proliferation in addition crs24 combination of doctrinal preference for first use of nuclear weapons and conventional force inferiority has given pakistan strong incentives to forwarddeploy its nuclear forces leading many observers to conclude that assistance to secure pakistans nuclear warheads could be critical54 with respect to the known nuclear program and chemical weapons assistance could run the range of options from weapons to personnel security recent revelations about pakistani assistance to the iranian nuclear program also have heightened longstanding concerns regarding proliferation by prominent scientists with or without pakistani government approval nonetheless pakistani officials repeated statements to the press about the security of their arsenal appear to reflect handsoff attitude implying that pakistan is quite able to protect and secure its own weapons55 more importantly however the sensitivity surrounding nuclear weapons in the past has been such that even between the closest of allies for example the united states and the united kingdom proposals to share permissive action links pals which only allow authorized parties to arm the warhead reportedly were met with disinterest56 the proliferation potential of the indian nuclear program appears to be less severe than it is for pakistan however multiple indian suppliers have been sanctioned by the bush administration for supplying chemical weapons precursors to countries such as iraq and iran57 india is currently destroying its chemical weapons under the cwc but some assistance could possibly help speed that process in both the case of india and pakistan assistance in the nuclear area is likely to be severely curtailed by their nonnpt status see discussion on constraints nonetheless on january 12 2004 president bush announced new strategic partnership with india that would focus on three areas of cooperation civilian nuclear technology space technology and hightechnology trade58 us officials reportedly stated that any space technology must not be used in indias ballistic missile program and civilian nuclear technology must not be used in indias nuclear weapons program59 israel fits into similar category as india and pakistan but there are several key differences israel has adhered to policy of ambiguity about its nuclear weapons capabilities which likely would limit its receptivity to assistance and has 54 see crs report rl31589 nuclear threat reduction measures for india and pakistan for discussion of the pros and cons of such assistance 55 pakistans foreign

and issues for congress crs25 not been subject to usproliferationrelated sanctions israel has not ever been named as proliferator by us government sources and few have expressed concerns about the safety or security of its wmd arsenals some assistance in securing its nuclear program would likely be curtailed as in the case of india and pakistan by international and us laws prohibiting assistance to states outside the npt assistance in the cw and bw areas could probably focus on site material and personnel security algeria egypt and saudi arabia all have significant problems with terrorism on their soil and all three are suspected of having chemical weapons capabilities algeria and egypt additionally are thought to have conducted bw research algerian and saudi cw capabilities could be handled by the opcw secretariat for the cwc but egypt is not member of the cwc constraints on assistance there may be political technical and legal constraints on us assistance to some of the states mentioned above above all these countries have to be willing to negotiate with the united states on reducing the wmd threat in the best possible world that would mean abandoning their wmd programs like libya has done less desirable would be for them to curtail such programs and in some cases it may even be difficult for countries to admit they have such programs states would need to calculate the value of such wmd programs to the states national security prestige and regional stature the potential benefits for abandoning such programs and the likelihood of punitive actions by the united states andor the world community if it does not abandon such programs such political constraints may pose the most formidable hurdles to us assistance technical hurdles are clearly secondary constraints but they can lead to questions about the effectiveness of verifying threat reduction programs ctr programs in the former soviet union despite political willingness to participate in the ctr program have been dogged for years by questions about their effectiveness for both political and technical reasons technical constraints stem primarily from incomplete knowledge of countrys wmd program which makes it difficult to scope and prioritize the proliferation problems lastly there may be legal hurdles in providing assistance both because of us treaty obligations and domestic laws prohibiting assistance to proliferators and state sponsors of terrorism political constraints in some cases amount of pressure from the united states is likely to convince some states to give up certain wmd programs for example the nuclear programs of india pakistan and israel these states perceive nuclear weapons as crucial to balancing regional security and ultimately to their own survival barring change in the regional balance of power that would make nuclear weapons unnecessary there likely will be strong resistance to efforts to increase transparency of those weapons programs and in fact transparency may not always improve stability in some regions nor may it be perceived to help countrys national crs26 security one could argue that in the case of north korea ambiguity has served its national security better than the relative transparency of the agreed framework years in the middle east countries such as israel iraq and iran have relied on ambiguity or outright deception to mask their wmd programs in the case of pakistan which has taken fewer pains to hide its nuclear program its history of clandestine foreign procurement and sales of sensitive technologies could make greater transparency politically painful in short culture of secrecy which was not easily overcome in the case of russia may be as difficult if not more difficult to overcome in the case of other states on the other hand professional pride on the scientific or military levels may provide for some cooperation other countries may perceive direct and indirect benefits to foreswearing wmd programs such countries are unlikely to be lured merely by the promise of nonproliferation assistance but adhering to the nonproliferation regime may bring greater political acceptance more technical assistance in other areas and the lifting of sanctions many observers believe that libya was largely motivated to foreswear its wmd programs because it was one of the last major concessions required before lifting us sanctions in addition however libyan leaders may have perceived their wmd programs as longer vital to libyas national security regional stature or prestige some might argue that libya gave up its wmd precisely because they were not very successful programs this is exactly the kind of costbenefit analysis us nonproliferation efforts seek to promote assuming whether coerced or persuaded country has ended its wmd programs some constraints may still arise in the case of iraq the us search for wmdrelated items and to provide for site material and personnel security has been hampered by the chaos caused by the war and decade of deception for example there is significant gap in information about midlevel iraqi wmd scientists which complicates decisions about who should receive assistance in general incomplete knowledge of countrys wmd program can complicate provision of assistance in the case of russia political willingness to accept assistance did not extend to all areas of russias wmd programs for example us officials have never gained access to the four military facilities associated with russias biological weapons program with respect to nuclear material protection control and accounting programs most of the material according to one report remains outside of the program because the united states cannot gain access to sensitive facilities60 it is not difficult to imagine that the same levels of secrecy encountered in the case of russia might be encountered in other states it is possible that more secrecy may be attached to biological and nuclear weapons programs than for chemical weapons programs in addition it may be possible to know about some kinds of sites dual use facilities like chemical production sites uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing but not others for example weapons machining or assembly sites if country has made decision to end one but perhaps not other wmd programs eg pakistan decides to give up chemical weapons but not nuclear weapons the need to preserve secrecy about the other wmd programs may limit 60 us general accounting office wmd reducing the threat from the former soviet union an update gaonsiad95165 june 1995 crs27 transparency if country accepts some assistance for an ongoing wmd program eg pakistan accepts security assistance for its nuclear warheads but does not give them up providing such assistance could raise the question of whether the united states tacitly accepts that wmd program in fact some kinds of assistance like permissive action links to make nuclear weapons safe from unauthorized use could be viewed as actively helping wmd program and would likely be prohibited by us and international laws see legal constraints discussion below the existing level of cooperation between the united states and some of these countries will likely affect some aspects of assistance country that has not been cooperating with the united states on counterterrorism may be less likely to cooperate on nonproliferation on the other hand country like pakistan which has been cooperating closely with the united states in the war on terrorism may be given free ride on proliferation for fear of eroding antiterrorism cooperation and jeopardizing delicate political balances in the region technical constraints there are two basic technical constraints in providing assistance getting accurate information and being able to verify it and ensuring that assistance does not aid or benefit wmd capability that will continue to exist information about weapons of mass destruction programs is closely held even in the most open of societies while us intelligence assets can pick up remarkable details about wmd programs the recent us government assessments of wmd capabilities in iran iraq north korea and libya point strikingly to the fact that what we know is just small fraction of the entire picture even for advanced wmd programs that have existed for years details are few for example senior bush administration official described on pakistans nuclear program saying its what we dont know that worries us including the critical question of how much fissile material pakistan now holds and where it holds it 61 more recently the washington post reported that pakistan was building new plutonium production reactor sparking debate about how much us officials really knew about the reactor62 although the united states is certain that north korea has uranium enrichment program it has only been able to narrow down the location of an enrichment plant to three sites for chemical and biological weapons programs which rely on extensive dualuse materials and facilities there may be even fewer details on which to base assessments information from the defector ken alibek revealed far more extensive soviet bw program than previously thought and even though the us ctr program has elements for bw site material and personnel security there are few who would agree that we know the full extent of the program even today 61 nuclear headache what if the radicals oust musharraf new york times december 30 2003 62 pakistan expanding nuclear program washington post july 24 2006 crs28 in general it may be possible to know more about material production sites than about weapons productionassembly or weapons storage sites without knowledge of where vulnerabilities lie it will be difficult to target even the most rudimentary assistance in the case of russia and the nis us government officials have complained for years that russia has not provided the kinds of access necessary for the united states to ensure that its goals are being met with respect to the material protection control and accounting programs most of the material according to one report remains outside of the program because the united states cannot gain access to sensitive facilities63 second technical hurdle is ensuring that us assistance does not improve wmd capabilities some kinds of assistance do not run this risk for example providing physical security barriers for facilities or improving personnel reliability testing improving weapon transportation and storage security however might run such risk some innovations may have unintended consequences for example permissive action links which were developed by the united states in the 1960s were designed so that unauthorized users would not be able to produce nuclear yield from the weapon at the same time however it was recognized that weapons with pals on them are more deployable such devices if given to india and pakistan in the name of decreasing the possibility that such weapons could be stolen and used could also increase those weapons operational readiness legal constraints treaty obligations treaty obligations may play role in limiting assistance both from the perspective of us obligations and for the states in question the relevant treaties are the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt the chemical weapons convention cwc and the biological and toxin weapons convention bwc the united states is party to all three treaties each of these treaties contains language that generally prohibits transferring such weapons assisting encouraging or inducing any other state under the npt nonnuclear weapon states to manufacture or acquire weapons for the text of the relevant language in each treaty see appendix in addition the united states is prohibited by the npt from helping nonnuclear weaponstates control nuclear devices with the term control left undefined and prohibited under the cwc from engaging in preparations to use chemical weapons which could be broadly interpreted in general questions of treaty compliance were not publicly raised by us assistance to russia and the fsu nuclear assistance to the soviet union because it was nuclear weapons state by the terms of the npt was never questioned in the cw area most of the assistance to russia has focused on helping russia comply with the cwc primarily in destruction while some cw scientists may have participated in the international science centers there has been public criticism that assistance has helped the russian cw program with respect to russias biological weapons program there has been some uncertainty about whether assistance to bw scientists in certain institutes could benefit the russian bw 63 us general accounting office wmd reducing the threat from the former soviet union an update gaonsiad95165 june 1995 crs29 program but one has publicly suggested that the united states has not complied with its bwc obligations64 nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt under article i of the npt the united states is prohibited from transferring to any state nuclear weapon state non nuclear weapon state party or nonparty to the treaty nuclear weapons nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or devices directly or indirectly it is not readily apparent what is meant by control over such weapons narrow interpretation would focus on the ability of another state to use such weapon65 broader interpretation might conclude that better safety security or command and control measures would provide another state with improved control of its nuclear weapons perhaps violating this obligation not to indirectly transfer control the second part of the obligation lies in not assisting encouraging or inducing nonnuclear weapon states to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices the negotiators of the npt reportedly intended to interpret manufacture broadly from the beginning of the acquisition cycle to the end66 nonnuclearweapon states party to the npt are obligated not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of such weapons under article ii67 presumably this would cover assistance that enhanced command and control of weapons including permissive action link pal technology india pakistan israel and north korea would not be bound by such an obligation since they are not parties to the npt iran on the other hand would be bound by that obligation the us state department has not made public finding on what might constitute violation of article i under the npt but its legal advisors have examined precedents in the application of us domestic law in general they have advised that the closer assistance is attached to the nuclear weapons programs the more likely it could run afoul of us legal obligations both under international treaty obligations 64 us general accounting office biological weapons effort to reduce former soviet threat offers benefits poses new risks gaonsiad00138 april 2000 see discussion of risks of assistance which include sustaining russias existing bw infrastructure maintaining or advancing russian scientists skills to develop offensive bw and potential misuse of us assistance to fund offensive research pp 2934 65 during the negotiation of the npt concerns about transferring control focused on allies eg nato making command and control decisions for us nuclear weapons deployed in europe see willrich nonproliferation treaty p 71 ff stein and feaver argue that permissive action links were introduced as result of congressional concern about loose command and control of us nuclear weapons in europe see also feaver peter douglas guarding the guardians ny cornell university press 1992 pp 199ff 66 willrich nonproliferation treaty pp 9193 67 each nonnuclearweapon state party to the treaty undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices directly or indirectly not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices article ii of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons crs30 and domestic law thus some kinds of aid eg food or humanitarian aid could be considered in the extreme to be assisting or encouraging nuclear weapons program because they free up resources that the target government can put towards nuclear weapons program but are permitted in practice because they do not have close association with nuclear weapons program if assistance took the form of transferrable funds however the possibility of linkage to nuclear weapons program might be considered to be greater chemical weapons convention cwc there are two provisions in article i of the cwc that might affect us assistance first the prohibition on engaging in any military preparations to use chemical weapons and second the prohibition on assisting encouraging or inducing in any way anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to state party under this convention although us assistance clearly would not aim to contravene the treaty some actions even temporary could be interpreted as violating that obligation if they resulted in greater security of chemical weapons and not immediate destruction if weapons security measures were implemented eg security from terrorist access they would need to be accompanied by demilitarization measures separation from weapon launchers etc as evidenced by delays in the destruction of the us chemical weapons stockpile destruction could take years any such activities with noncwc parties egypt iraq north korea and syria for purposes here could be interpreted as falling under the prohibition against assisting encouraging or inducinganyone to engage in any activity prohibited under the convention biological weapons convention bwc as in the cases of the npt and cwc key provision here may be the prohibition on assistance encouragement or inducing of any state group of states or international organization to acquire agents toxins weapons equipment or means of delivery prohibited by the convention measures that included just assistance to scientists but not bw destruction or measures that included weapons and site security but destruction might fall into that category the likelihood is small but future recipients may be just as reluctant as the russians have been to allow access to the most sensitive bw related sites accepting assistance at lesser sites legal constraints nonproliferation and antiterrorism laws us domestic laws contain the following restrictions that may be relevant to providing assistance to the states covered in this report restrictions on financial assistance exports defense and dualuse to states that have poor proliferation records as recipients or suppliers of proliferationrelated goods and technology restrictions on financial assistance exports to states on state sponsors of

national security interests are better served by engagement rather than restrictions complete list of legislation is available in crs report rl31502 nuclear biological chemical and missile proliferation sanctions selected current law and crs report rl31559 proliferation control regimes background and status in brief the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended 42 usc 2053 et seq ensures that us nuclear technology will not go to proliferators for the most part it is unlikely that the kinds of assistance the united states might offer under an expanded ctr program for weapons site material or personnel security would fall under the categories covered by these laws the foreign assistance act and the arms export control act punish proliferators by prohibiting us military sales and economic or military assistance the export administration act of 1979 restricts exports of goods and technologies including dualuse technologies for foreign policy and national security reasons and the exportimport bank act of 1945 includes restrictions on the extension of credit for proliferation and terrorism reasons it should be noted that all proliferationrelated sanctions against pakistan and india stemming from the 1998 nuclear explosive tests have been lifted many of these constraints can be lifted by presidential waiver in 2005 the energy policy act pl 10958 section 632 amended the section 129 of the atomic energy act to include cutoff of nuclear exports to states that are designated state sponsors of terrorism antiterrorism laws sanctions against other countries for their support for international terrorism are four basic types ban on armsrelated exports and sales controls on dualuse item exports requires 30day congressional notification prohibition on economic assistance miscellaneous financial and other restrictions including us opposition to world bank imf loans and ban on dod contracts over 10000069 the specific laws that contain these bans have been described in great detail in other crs reports70 in general cuba libya and iran are all subject to comprehensive embargoes north korea is subject to economic sanctions and sudan and syria are subject to specific sanctions in addition iran is subject to the iran and libya sanctions act 69 patterns in global terrorism 2002 p 77 70 see for example crs report rl32727 syria political conditions and relations with the united states after the iraq war crs report rl32048 iran us concerns and policy responses crs report rl32604 libya legislative basis for us economic sanctions crs report rl31696 north korea economic sanctions crs report rl32251 cuba and the state sponsors of terrorism list crs36 perhaps the most salient legislation is what has become known as the state sponsors of terrorism list as provided for in section 6 j 1 of the export administration act of 1979 50 usc app 2405jl states can be removed from that list in two ways first the president could submit report to congress certifying that 1 there has been fundamental change in the leadership and policies of the government of the country concerned 2 the government is not supporting acts of international terrorism and 3 the government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future the second option is for the president to submit report to congress at least 45 days before the proposed recision will take effect justifying the recision and certifying that 1 the government concerned has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding sixmonth period and 2 the government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future both iraq and libya have been removed from the list in the last few years in addition however two other terrorism lists may apply the first is section 40 of the arms export control act which prohibits the export of munitions to governments that repeatedly provide support for international terrorism and section 620a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 which prohibits most assistance to countries supporting international terrorism section 40 of the aeca has specific procedure for congress to consider joint resolution to block the presidents removal of country from the terrorism list both section 40 of the aeca and section 620a of the faa include presidential waiver authority for national security interests or humanitarian reasons it is likely that sweeping lift of sanctions would occur only in the context of overall improved relations and with congressional concurrence that the sanctions regime ought to be undone nuclear cooperationnuclear weapons cooperation the atomic energy act aea governs nuclear cooperation and restricts sharing of information related to nuclear weapons it is unlikely that the united states would include significant nuclear cooperation with any of the states in question under an expanded ctr program eg sales of nuclear reactors nuclear material or major reactor components71 significant nuclear cooperation with states such as india pakistan israel or north korea would require that they abandon their nuclear weapons programs and adopt fullscope safeguards72 moreover section 129 of the aea states that nuclear material and equipment or sensitive nuclear technology shall be exported to 1 any nonnuclearweapon state that is found by the president to have at any time after march 10 1978 detonated nuclear explosive device or b terminated or abrogated iaea safeguards or c materially violated an iaea safeguards agreement or d engaged in activities involving source or special nuclear material and having direct significance for the manufacture or acquisition of nuclear explosive devices and has 71 major reactor components include primary coolant pumps pressure vessels control rod drive systems and online fuel charging and discharging equipment for candu reactors 72 in 2005 however president bush proposed to conclude nuclear cooperation agreement with india on july 27 2006 the house passed hr 5682 which authorizes the president to create an exception for india from current restrictions on nuclear cooperation crs37 failed to take steps which in the presidents judgment represent sufficient progress toward terminating such activities some states are additionally subject to countryspecific restrictions on nuclear cooperation agreements for example the north korea threat reduction act of 1999 stipulated that significant nuclear cooperation could occur with north korea unless relevant congressional committees were informed that north korea was in full compliance with its nuclear safeguards agreement b gave the iaea full access to nuclear sites c took steps to implement the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the korean peninsula d had enrichment or reprocessing activities and made significant progress in acquiring testing producing or deploying nuclear explosive device and had nuclear weapons in addition the president must notify congress that the transfer of key nuclear components was in the national security interests of the united states some of these requirements are already contained in existing laws but others are not for example implementing the joint declaration in the event that the united states contemplates sharing sensitive nuclear information eg information related to safety and security of nuclear weapons section 144 of the aea stipulates that the secretary of energy may release restricted data on various aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle except those related to the design or fabrication of atomic weapons the secretary of defense may exchange restricted data if it is necessary to develop defense plans b train personnel in employing and defending against nuclear weapons c evaluate the capabilities of potential enemies in employing nuclear weapons d develop compatible delivery systems for nuclear weapons the president can authorize the secretary of energy with the assistance of the department of defense to exchange restricted data on atomic weapons with another country provided that communication of restricted data is necessary to improve that nations nuclear weapon design development or fabrication capability and b that nation has made substantial progress in the development of atomic weapons when the language on substantial progress was added in 1958 the only nation that met the qualification was the united kingdom in general most weapons related data including some on safety security fuze and firing are classified as restricted data or formerly restricted data it is unlikely that the president would authorize such an exchange of restricted data under this provision of the atomic energy act particularly to states such as india and pakistan dualuse exports transfers of nuclearrelated equipment or nuclear material that do not meet the requirement for an agreement of cooperation could possibly still require fullscope safeguards as condition of supply under the nuclear suppliers group nsg guidelines since 1992 nsg member states have required fullscope safeguards as condition for supplying items on the nsg trigger list73 73 the trigger list governs the export of items that are especially designed or prepared for nuclear use these include i nuclear material ii nuclear reactors and equipment therefor iii nonnuclear material for reactors iv plant and equipment for the reprocessing enrichment and conversion of nuclear material and for fuel fabrication and continued crs38 in addition the department of commerce requires license for exporting items on the nsgs dualuse list those with nuclear and other applications to states outside the nsg many of the states that could be potential recipients of us ctr assistance are not members of the nsg more broadly the commerce control list specifies what items are regulated and why but an equally important consideration is the question of the enduser one technique for streamlining the export control system and making it more understandable for exporters was the development of the entities lists the department of commerce maintains list of entities subject to license requirements see supplement 4 to part 744 of the export administration regulations at present the entities of proliferation concern are located in china india israel pakistan and russia exports of items controlled for nuclear proliferation and missile technology reasons are reviewed on casebycase basis under the 1990 enhanced proliferation control initiative epci the department of commerce can impose licensing requirements on exports and reexports of goods and technology that would normally be uncontrolled where there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to activities related to nuclear chemical or biological weapons or missile proliferation us exporters are required to apply for license if they have knowledge of or have reason to know that such exports will be used directly or indirectly in any one of the following activities nuclear explosive activities unsafeguarded nuclear activities or safeguarded and unsafeguarded activities to produce special nuclear material through reprocessing or enrichment produce heavy water or fabricate nuclear fuel that uses plutonium section 7442 of the export administration regulations provides eight criteria for assessing license applications potentially the most significant of these criteria is the nonproliferation credentials of the importing country which include whether the state adheres to the npt has fullscope safeguards and has an agreement for cooperation with the united states and whether the actions statements and policies of the state support nuclear nonproliferation74 73 continued heavy water production and v technology associated with each of the above items the dualuse list governs the export of nuclear related dualuse items and technologies that is items that can make major contribution to an unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activity but which have nonnuclear uses as well for example in industry see httpwwwnsgonlineorgguidehtm 74 paragraph 7442 d license review standards for restrictions on certain nuclear end uses part 744 of export administration regulations the assessment of nonproliferation credentials is based on adherence to npt or international nuclear nonproliferation agreement b fullscope safeguards or equivalent c agreement for cooperation with us d whether state supports nuclear nonproliferation degree to which state cooperates in nonproliferation policy and f intelligence data on states nuclear intentions and activities crs39 costs and benefits of assistance the united states has provided nonproliferation assistance to many countries over many years in some instances the united states funded projects or programs because the country in question did not have the resources to fix proliferation problems however as the united states looks increasingly to bilateral fixes two questions need to be raised are there enough resources for the united states to tackle these multiple problems and do bilateral approaches undermine the multilateral nonproliferation regime two potential costs of undermining international institutions are decreased global pressure on proliferators and possibly decreased international support for us policy objectives in other areas bilateral approach may risk capturing the easy proliferation problems like libya and undermining support to tackle the hard proliferation problems like pakistan and north korea without clear disarmament steps assistance could be seen as rewarding bad behavior which has been recent us concern in the case of north korea impact on nonproliferation regime for states that are parties to the npt bwc andor cwc some treaty compliance issues may arise in the case of the bwc which does not have an inspection regime there likely will be less controversy about bilateral inspections superceding or undermining the treaty likewise there may be less pressure to bring noncompliance issues to light for example russia party to the bwc declared that it had an offensive bw program in 1992 twenty years after it signed the treaty in the case of the cwc compliance issues might be handled differently under the cwc iran pakistan saudi arabia sudan and israel have not openly declared stockpiles or capabilities and yet all are suspected of having cw for example if pakistan has covert chemical weapons stockpile that it is willing to dismantle with us help should pakistan be declared in violation of the cwc further would destruction be verified bilaterally or multilaterally under the cwc in the case of libya the opcw is overseeing cw destruction but the united states has taken on the destruction tasks related to libyas nuclear program if us or other sanctions were applicable would they need to be waived hardcore nuclear proliferators pose different challenge these states have remained steadfastly outside the treaty regime and are unlikely to dismantle their arsenals with the possible exception of north korea if assistance were accepted would this confer acceptance of their nuclear weapons status would such acceptance be good or bad for the nonproliferation regime for example on january 2 2004 president bush stated that he believes the pakistani nuclear weapons are secure thats important he said its also important that india as well have secure nuclear weapons program75 the presidents proposal to engage in peaceful nuclear cooperation with india has sparked significant criticism that the deal legitimizes indias nuclear weapons program on the other hand it is clear that 75 bush says pakistans arsenal is secure washington post january 2 2004 crs40 nuclear weapons status will not be awarded to iran and north koreas case still seems ambiguous for some observers the impact of assistance to new nuclear states on the nonproliferation regime is moot because the nuclear programs of india pakistan israel north korea iran and formerly libya prove that the regime is broken some observers also believe that cwc or bwc treaty compliance is essentially impossible to verify and that new tools should be used to mitigate the threat wherever possible issues for 110th congress sea changes in policy many us administrations have fought both proliferation of wmd and terrorism but few have connected or coordinated the two policy that seeks to eliminate the nexus of terrorism and wmd confronts more than few challenges one particular challenge is obtaining active cooperation from diverse group of states around the world many of which are not traditional allies of the united states according to one observer the united states hasnt made really clear howa former state supporter of terrorism stands with the united states and with the rest of the international community in dealing with that common scourge76 libya may provide an unfolding example of how former state supporter of terrorism can be redeemed an equally challenging question may be how states that were considered former proliferators stand with the united states and the rest of the international community here libya may not offer the best example although longtime successful supporter of international terrorism albeit with waning activity in the last decade libya was at best mediocre proliferator and decided to give up both activities in exchange for the lifting of burdensome economic sanctions more troubling example is states that retain their wmd programs but not the stigma of being proliferator pakistan raises the largest issue for the bush administration in its matrixed war against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction proliferation has one goal assumed priority over the other there have been ample statements from administration officials since 2001 to the effect that pakistan has not been pressed on its proliferation activities because of its strong support in the war against terrorism despite evidence of sales of uranium enrichment equipment to iran and libya and the bush administration maintains to north korea pakistani proliferation activities since 2001 are longer reported to congress in the semiannual unclassified section 721 of the fy1997 intelligence authorization act reports on the acquisition of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional munitions the sea change in nonproliferation policy can be traced to the september 2002 national security strategy in which president bush noted that the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology our 76 pbs newshour interview with david mack on libya august 18 2003 crs41 enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction few months later the december 2002 strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction opened with the statement weapons of mass destruction wmd nuclear biological and chemical in the possession of hostile states and terrorists represent one of the greatest security challenges facing the united states emphasis added focusing on the terrorism axis has shifted policies to combat wmd proliferation away from global approaches at least rhetorically to tailored approaches paradoxically this focus on hostile states and terrorists may leave the global community vulnerable to the proliferation activities of friendly states whoever those happen to be at the time recent legislation the 109th congress considered the following legislation that could restrict the provision of ctr assistance to some countries the state departments annual foreign operations appropriations bill the foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriations act includes provisions that prohibit assistance to ceratin countries section 507 of the fy2006 foreign operations appropriations bill pl109102 states that funds will be obligated or expended to finance directly any assistance or reparations to cuba libya north korea iran or syria the fy2007 bill passed in the house hr 5522 and awaiting passage in the senate includes the same provision the iran freedom support act introduced in both the house and the senate hr 282s 333 could make supplying ctr assistance to iran more difficult the iranlibya sanction act pl 104 172 has been extended through september 2011 pursuant to the iran freedom support act pl 109293 sudan has been severely limited from receiving us assistance since 1997 by combination of executive order and us law these include executive order 13067 section 520 of the foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriations act 2006 pl 109102 the comprehensive peace in sudan act of 2004 pl 108497 and the sudan peace act pl 107245 the 109th also considered legislation that could affect third party states or any state that could potentially receive ctr assistance to the extent such states are considered for these initiatives for example section 542 of the fy2006 foreign operations bill pl109102 prohibited assistance to countries that provide lethal military equipment to state sponsors of terrorism other examples include pl 109267 which extended the iranlibya sanctions act the iran nonproliferation amendments act pl 109112 which added syria to that act and the north korea nonproliferation act of 2006 s 3728 which added north korea to the iran syria nonproliferation act costs in its oversight capacity congress may wish to consider whether or not expanding ctr assistance could have snowball effect particularly if the united states insists on using its own resources rather than existing multinational inspectorates costs of assistance are likely to be minimal the first one or two years but these could escalate depending on the objectives of the program in the nuclear area the nuclear programs of india pakistan israel and north korea are far smaller crs42 than russias and unlikely to incur the kinds of costs that the ctr program has thus far incurred on the other hand data are scarce on the state of nuclear materials in those countries so it is difficult to determine the scope and timeframe of such program at minimum however such program is likely to be incrementally implemented costs could be minimal if quickfix lowtechnology information oriented approach is taken or they could be more substantial if sophisticated high technology approach is taken that would incorporate cameras encryption remote monitoring and other means the same is true in the bw and cw areas the scope of the undertaking in russia greatly outweighs the combination of programs of relevant states however the management of multiple programs could present particular difficulties certifications in 1991 the legislation that created the nunnlugar program stipulated that us assistance in destroying nuclear and other weapons may not be provided to the soviet union any of its republics or successor entities unless the president certifies to the congress that the proposed recipient is committed to making substantial investment of its resources for dismantling or destroying such weapons forgo any military modernization that exceeds legitimate defense requirements or is designed to replace destroyed wmd forgo the use of fissile materials and other components from destroyed nuclear weapons in new nuclear weapons facilitate us verification of weapons destruction that uses us money comply with all relevant arms control agreements and observe internationally recognized human rights including the protection of minorities certifications according to some administration officials allow the united states to hold the recipient states feet to the fire providing source of leverage in the view of others however they pose unnecessary and even dangerous delays in implementing ctr programs in the fy2006 national defense authorization act pl 109163 section 1303 of title xiii extended the threeyear authority to waive certification requirements indefinitely section 1304 of s 2766 the senates version of the fy2007 national defense authorization act would have repealed all certification requirements however the version of the defense authorization act passed in conference hr 5122 does not include provisions to repeal restrictions other considerations congress may wish to consider the implications of providing us assistance to countries that are not democratically governed section 508 of the foreign operations bill pl109102 in the 109th congress prohibited direct assistance to the government of any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by decree or military coup most of the six state sponsors of terrorism would fall in this category in addition pakistan has been subject to such restrictions pl 107 crs43 57 which exempted pakistan from existing restrictions prohibiting foreign assistance to any country governed by military that overthrew democratically elected regime requires the president to determine that foreign assistance facilitates the transition to democratic rule in pakistan and is important to united states efforts to respond to deter or prevent acts of international terrorism77 pakistans exemption was to run out by october 1 2003 but this was extended through the end of fy2004 by language in the emergency supplemental bill pl 108106 and then through subsequent foreign operations bills currently it is extended through the foreign operation fy2006 appropriation bill pl 109102 until the end of fy2006 and would be extended through fy2007 if the foreign operation fy2007 appropriation bill passes congress in its current form hr 5522 the law raises two pertinent issues will president musharraf restore democracy to pakistan and if not how would continued military leadership in pakistan affect us cooperative efforts particularly if new military leadership emerges in the absence of regime change similar questions might be raised about efforts conducted with cuba and syria 77 see crs report rs20995 india and pakistan current us economic sanctions crs44 appendix relevant treaty texts relating to obligations not to assist nonweapon states in
