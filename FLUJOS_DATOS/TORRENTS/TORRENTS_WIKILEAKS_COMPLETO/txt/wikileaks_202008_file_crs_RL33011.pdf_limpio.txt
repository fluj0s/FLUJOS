william j krouse specialist in domestic security domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33011terrorist screening and brady background checks for firearms summary historically terrorist watch list checks we re not part of the firearms background check process implemented pursuant to the brady handgun violence prevention act such watch lists were not checked because being known or suspected terrorist is not disqualifying factor for firearm transferpossession eligibility under current federal or state law neve rtheless if person is known or suspected terrorist it suggests that there may be an underlying factor eg illegal immigration or fugitive status that could bar him from legal fir earms possession for time moreover all brady background check records for approve d firearm transfers were destroyed almost immediately precluding the opport unity to use the background check system to screen for known and suspected terrorists consequently three issues emerge d regarding brady background checks following the 911 attacks first s hould approved firearm transfer records be maintained on temporary basis to dete rmine whether persons of interest in counterterrorism investiga tions had previously obtai ned firearms improperly second should terrorist watch list checks be incorporated statutorily into the brady background check process third s hould persons watch listed as known or suspected terrorists be prohibited st atutorily from possessing firearms in february 2004 the fbi reportedly m odified its national instant criminal background check system nics operating procedures to retain nics records temporarily for approved transfers that result in terrorist watch list hits and to pass that information on to fbi investigators on the joint terrorism task forces in addition attorney general alberto gonzales has directed the doj office of legal policy to form working group to review fe deral gun laws par ticularly in regard to brady background checks to determin whether additional authority should be sought to prevent firearms transfer s to known and suspected terrorists on march 19 2007 representative carolyn mccarthy

handgun violence prevention act prohibited the use of nics as an electro nic registry of firearms dispositions or owners6 in hearing before the senate committee on the judiciary on december 6 2001 senator charles schumer stioned attorney general ashcroft as to why the fbi was barred from reviewing these records7 the attorney general responded that the brady act strictly limited the use of such information although the attorney general did not acknowledge the need for gislation to authorize searching these records he said the depar tment would be happy to cons ider any related legislative proposals presented by congress even prior to the 911 attacks the use of approved firearms transfer records was controversial during the clinton adminis tration the department of justice doj issued final rule that would allow such records to be maintained for up to six months8 the national rifle association nra challenged this rule in federal court arguing that retaining the approved records was tantamount to temporary registry and in violation of the brady act on july 11 2000 however the us court of appeals for the district of columbia in the case of nra v reno 995270 216 f 3d 122 2000 us app xis 15906 found that nothing in the brady act prohibited the temporary reten tion of information about wful firearm transfers for certain audit purposes previously on march 9 1999 doj published

information collected from foreign and domestic sources on inte rnational terrorist threats in so doing the nctc also provides lookout records on inte rnational terrorists to the tsc for inclusion in the tsdboffices and international ports of entry and to better track them both abroad and if they manage to enter the united states at home17 in september 2003 the fbi administered terrorist screening center t sc was established and work was begun to improve and merge several watch lists maintained by the us government into consolidated terrorist sc reening database tsdb one of these watch lists was vgtof as part of these efforts tsdb lookout records from other agency watc h lists were downloaded into vgtof expanding that file from 10000 to over 140000 records18 with this improvement state and local law enfor cement officers now have limite d access to terrorist watch lists through ncic with monitoring from the tsc these officers are now able to screen for terrorists during routine tra ffic stops and similar encounters subject to constitutional and other legal limitations while it is clearly within the us governments mandate to identify and track persons who are intent on inciting or engaging in terrorist activities the determination of who may be member or supporter of terrorist organization and therefore should be subjected to police scrutiny and surveillance is ultimately subjective consideration made by intelligence analysts and special agents based on the best information available under the terms of hspd6 the national counterterrorism center nctc director19 the tsc director and the heads of federal departments and agen cies nominate persons for in clusion in the tsdb the tsc director is responsible for establishing procedures to review these records for continued inclusion in the tsdb the nctc is providing international rrorism data and the fbi is providing domestic terrorism data for inclusion in the tsdb both sets of data are merged in the consolidated tsdb maintained by the tsc according to the fbi international terrorists include those persons who carry out terrorist activities under foreign direction for this purpose they may incl ude citizens or noncitizens under the rationale that citizens could be recruited by foreign rrorist groups or noncitizens aliens could immigrate to the united states and naturalize become citizens

under current federal law hen ce doj has concluded that it is limited under current law in its authority to use terrorist watch lists as part of the brady background check process to deny firearms transfer s to known and suspected terrorists in hearings before the house committee on the judiciary attorney general alberto gonzales was questioned several times by members of congress about nics procedures and terrori st watch list hits representative chris van hollen asked the attorney general does it make sense to you that we stop person from boarding the airline in order to protect the public safety but that an individual can turn around get in their car go to the local gun shop and buy 20 semiautomatic assault weapons attorney general gonzales responded i think we should be doing everything we can to ensure that people who are in fact terrorists shouldnt have weapons in this country the truth of the matter is but unless they are disabled disqualified from having weapon under the statute theres not much that we can do other than maybe try and get them out of the country or by the way to see if theres any disability under the statute that would allow us to deny them firearm26 in may 2005 attorney general gonzales directed the doj office of legal policy to form working group to review fe deral gun laws par ticularly in regard to brady background checks to examine

approved firearm background check records that are related to valid terrorist watch list hits the other bill h r 1195 addressed the issue of whether known or suspected terrorist on one govern ment

should be retained and if retained whethe r they should be searched to determine whether known or suspected terrorists had previously obtained firearms related legislation in the 110th congress in the
