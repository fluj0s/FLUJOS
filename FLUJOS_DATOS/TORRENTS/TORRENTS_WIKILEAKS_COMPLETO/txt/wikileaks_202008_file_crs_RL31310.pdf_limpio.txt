7 of the us constitution 7 see 10 usc 114 8 the relevant subcommittees of the hous and senate appropriations committees are military construction for the military construction appropriation and

support in the senate armed services committee draft legislation to authorize military construction appropriationsagencies and commercejusticestate also include small amounts for national defense5 funds may be expended by any agency of the federal government before they are appropriated6 in addition for nearly half century congress has forbidden the department of defense to obligate funds for any project or program until specific authorization is granted7 this explains why for fense funds both authorization and appropriations bills are required two separate defense appropriations bills are written annually military c onstruction appropriations act dedicated to military construction and national defense appropriations act covering all other defense appropriations8 normally only one national defe nse authorization act is passed each year to authorize both of these appropriations9 therefore major debates over defense policy and funding issues includi ng military construction can be associated with any of these bills because issues in the defense authorization and appropriations bills intertwine this report includes salient parts of the authorization bill in its discussion of the military construction appropriation process the separate military constr uction appropriations bill dates to the late 1950s traditionally military cons truction was funded thr ough annual defense or supplemental appropriations bills howeve r the korean war prompted surge of military construction followed by st eady increase in military construction appropriations given the str ong and enduring

versions of the military constr uction appropriations act and authorized by the national defense authorization act it is possible to follow the changes in proposed legislation by consulting these tables ascertaining where each product was introduced adjusted or eliminated as th congress exercised its oversight and funding responsibilities couple of examples may serve to illust rate how these tables can be used 1 table 10 shows presidential budget request of 38 million to fund phase iv in the construction of an ammunition demilitarization facility at pueblo depot colorado an installation intended to disa ssemble and destroy munitions stockpiles congress assigned responsibility for this prog ram to the department of defense and dod has in turn passed executive responsib ility for the program to the department of the army the presidential submission placed this construction funding in the army budget but congress neith er appropriated nor author ized the funding zeroinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31310crs9 out the request instead table 10 indicates funding for pueblo depot under the defensewide dod budget with th house granting the full 38 million the senate passing slightly reduced 361 million and both appropriators and authorizers agreeing on the requested amount of 38 milli on the effect was to remove the project from the armys budg et and place it under the department of defense 2 second example is the air force alte ration of the gradua education facility at wrightpatterson air force base ohio funds were requested by the president but both chambers added 13 million in ppropriations and authorization for the project table 11 can be similarly used for ex amining the military family housing portion of military construction appropriations the first army project listed is single housing unit in stuttgart germany the budget submission requested 990 thousand for the work the house passed an appropriation for the full amount while the senate reduced the project to 500 thousand neither the appropriations conference nor the authorization included any funding zeroing out the request key policy issues several issues regarding military construction have gained visibility during the legislative deliberations of the current session of congress among these are overall and specific account funding levels request ed by the administration congressional additions to the military construction budget request military housing including the encouragement of private sector financin g of housing constructi on and maintenance and funding requested through th defense emergency response fund overall and specific account funding levels the fy2003 budget submitted by the president on february 4 2002 requested 8987 billion in new budget authority an amount 162 billion below the 2002 enac tment subsequent additional requests included in the fense emergency response fund derf raised the total request to 9578 billion in time for house consideration of its bill an additional 1225 million in army derf re quests was later r eceived by congress and will be considered by th senate this raises the to tal presidential budget request for

to support the armys interim brigade combat team and air force c17 aircraft mobility programs this and the upward adjustment of brac environmental clea nup funding was not reckoned with by the house

appropriating funds in excess of the request see figure 1 senator christopher bond commented during floor deba on fy1996 military construction appropriations that nationa l guard forces traditionally have been underfunded in construction requests submitted by the pentagon27 since fy1989 congress has consistently appropriated more than the administration request and the gap between request and

orthodox methods such as partnering with private enterp rise to build and maintain housing and increasing the military basic allowance for housing bah to cover the cost of off base housing28 at the

its own minimum housing standards with respect to living space amenities etc in addition bah compensation covered only 85 of the cost accommodation and utilitie s of living offbase dod and congress then initiated several programs to encourage private investment and to increase funding of traditional housing construc tion for both families and unaccompanied members and to increase the percenta ge
