the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks considerable concern has been raised because the 19 terrorists were aliens who apparently entered the united states with temporary visas despite provisions in immigration laws that bar the admission of terrorists foreign nationals not already legally residing in the united states who wish to come to the united states generally must obtain visa to be admitted with certain exceptions noted in law the report of the 911 commission maintained that border security was not considered national security matter prior to september 11 and as result the state departments consular officers were not treated as full partners in counterterrorism efforts the 911 commission made several recommendations that underscored the urgency of implementing the provisions on visa policy and immigration control that congress enacted several years ago as enacted the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 further broadens the security and terrorism grounds of inadmissibility to exclude aliens who have participated in the commission of acts of torture or extrajudicial killings abroad or who are members of political social or other groups that endorse or espouse terrorist activity it also includes provions to deploy technologies eg biometrics to detect potential terrorist indicators on travel documents establish an office of visa and passport security and train consular officers in the detection of terrorist travel patterns the conferees retained the provision on visa revocation as ground of inadmissibility but permit limited judicial review of removal if visa revocation is the sole basis of the removal as these more stringent visa policies have gone into force however new concerns have arisen about visa processing delays visa applicants often face extensive wait times for interviews from september 2005 through february 2006 gao found that 97 of doss 211 visaissuing posts reported maximum wait times of 30 or more days in at least one month whether these delays are having deleterious effect on travel and commerce has become an issue some now question whether sufficient resources and staff are in place to manage visa issuances in the postseptember 11 world meanwhile nonimmigrant ie temporary visas issued abroad dipped to 49 million in fy2003 after peaking at 76 million in fy2001 the fy2005 data most recent published source indicated an upturn as 54 million nonimmigrant visas were issued combined visitors for tourism and business comprised the largest group of nonimmigrants visas issued in fy2005 about 37 million down from 57 million in fy2000 other notable categories were temporary workers 17 and students or cultural exchange 94 the number of permanent resident visas issued each year by consular officers abroad has held steady at about 04 million over the past decade dos excluded 38434 potential immigrants in fy2005 and refused 270615 potential immigrants in fy2005 because their visa application did not comp ly with provisions in the ina in terms of temporary visas dos excluded 25212 potential nonimmigrants in fy2005 and refused almost 2 million potential nonimmigrants in fy2005

g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks considerable concern was raised because the 19 terrorists were aliens ie noncitizens or foreign nationals who apparently entered the united states on temporary visas fears that lax enforcement of immigration laws regulating the admission of foreign nationals into the united states makes the united states vulnerable to further terrorist attacks led many to call for revisions in the visa policy and changes in who administers immigration law the report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states also known as the 911 commission maintained that border security was not considered national security matter prior to september 11 and as result the state departments consular officers were not treated as full partners in counterterrorism efforts the 911 commission made several recommendations that underscored the urgency of implementing legislative provisions on visa policy and immigration control that congress enacted several years ago as these more stringent visa policies have gone into force however new concerns have arisen about visa processing delays visa applicants often face extensive wait times for interviews whether these delays are having deleterious effect on travel and commerce has become an issue some now question whether

nonimmigrants those for whom visas are not required including humanitarian admissions such as asylees refugees parolees and other aliens granted relief from deportation are handled separately under the immigration and nationality act ina those aliens granted asylum or refugee status ultimately are eligible to become legal permanent residents lprs4 illegal aliens or unauthorized aliens include those noncitizens who either entered the united states surreptitiously ie entered without inspection or who viol ated the terms of their visas the documentary requirements for visas are stated in 222 of the ina with some discretion for further specifications or exceptions by regulation as discussed below generally the application requirements are more extensive for aliens who wish to permanently live in the united states than those coming for visits the amount of paperwork required and the length of adjudication process to obtain visa to come to the united states is analogous to that of the internal revenue services irs tax forms and review procedures just as persons with uncomplicated earnings and expenses may file an irs short form while those whose financial circumstances are more complex may file series of irs forms so too an alien whose situation is straightforward and whose reason for seeking visa is easily documented generally has fewer forms and procedural hurdles than an alien whose circumstances are mo re complex there are over 70 us citizenship and immigration services uscis forms as well as dos forms that pertain to the visa issuance process

lpr status are first filed with uscis by the sponsoring relative or employer in the united states if the prospective immigrant is already residing in the united states the uscis handles the entire process wh ich is called adjustment of status if the prospective lpr does not have legal residence in the united states the petition is forwarded to consular affairs in their home country after uscis has reviewed it the consular affairs officer when the alien is coming from abroad and uscis adjudicator when the alien is adjusting status in the united states must be satisfied that the alien is entitled to the immigrant status many lprs are adjusting status from within the united st ates rather than receiving visas issued abroad by consular affairs as figure 1 indicates although over 1

nonimmigrants8 these aliens are admitted to the united states for temporary period of time and an expressed reason there are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories and 70 specific types of nonimmigrant visas are issued currently most of these nonimmigrant visa categories are defined in 101a15 of the ina these visa categories are commonly referred to by the letter and numeral that denotes their subsection in 101a15 for example b2 tourists e2 treaty investors f1 foreign students h1b temporary professional workers j1 cultural exchange participants or s4 terrorist informants as with immigrant visas the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish eligibility for nonimmigrant status and the type of nonimmigrant visa for which the application is made nonimmigrants must demonstrate that they are coming for limited period and for specific purpose specifically 214b of the ina presumes that all aliens seeking admission to the united states are coming to live permanently as result nonimmigrants must demonstrate that they are not coming to reside permanently the consular affairs officer at the time of application for visa as well as the customs and border protection bureau cbp inspectors at the time of application for admission must be satisfied that the alien is entitled to nonimmigrant status 9 the law exempts only the h1 workers l intracompany transfers and v family members from the requirement that they prove that they are not coming to live permanently 10 uscis and cbp play role determining eligibility for certain nonimmigrant visas notably h workers and l intracompany transfers also if nonimmigrant in the united states wishes to change from one nonimmigrant category to another such as from tourist visa to student visa the alien files change of status application with the uscis if the alien leaves the united states while the change of status is pending the alien is presumed to have relinquished the application personal interviews are generally required for foreign nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas interviews however may be waived in certain cases prior to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks personal interviews for applicants for b visitor visas reportedly were often waived11 this waiver formed the basis for the controversial and allegedly fraudprone visa express in saudi arabia now suspended where travel agents prescreened visa applicants and submitted petitions on behalf of the aliens 12 after september 11 2001 the number of personal interviews rose significantly as part of broader efforts to meet national security goals dos issued interim regulations on july 7 2003 that officially tightened up the requirements for personal interviews and substantially narrowed the class of nonimmigrants eligible for the waiver of personal interview prior to implementation of pl 108458 personal interview waivers might have been granted only to children under age 16 persons 60 years or older diplomats and representatives of international organizations aliens who were renewing visa they obtained within the prior 12 8 for full discussion and analysis of nonimmigrant visas see crs report rl31381 us immigration policy on

indicated 54 million nonimmigrant visas were issued earlier in the decade as figure 2 illustrates dos typically issued about 6 million nonimmigrant visas annually the number of immigrant visas issued each year by consular officers abroad has held steady at about 04 million over the past decade the growth in nonimmigrant visas issued in the late 1990s was largely attributable to the issuances of border crossing cards to residents of canada and mexico and periodic lifting of the ceilings on temporary worker visas combined visitors for tourism and business comprised the largest group of nonimmigrants visas issued in fy2005 about 37 million down from 57 million in fy2000 other notable categories were temporary workers 17 and students or cultural exchange 94 14 depending on the visa category and the country the alien is coming from the nonimmigrant visa may be valid for several years and may permit multiple entries uscis reported 337 million nonimmigrant entries in fy2000 279

most visitors enter the united states without nonimmigrant visas through the visa waiver program vwp this provision of ina allows the visa documentary requirements to be waived for aliens coming as visitors from 27 countries eg australia france germany italy japan new zealand and switzerland thus visitors from these countries are not required to obtain visa from us consulate abroad since aliens entering through vwp do not have visas cbp inspectors at the port of entry are responsible for performing the background checks and making the determination of whether the alien is admissible 16

class under quasirefusal code if warranted35 according to dos officials they sometimes prudentially revoke visas ie they revoke visa as safety precaution prudential revocation is undertaken with relatively low threshold of national security information to ensure that all relevant or potentially relevant facts about an alien are thoroughly explored before admitting that alien to the united states36 following september 11 2001 the us general accounting office gao subsequently renamed the government accountability office reviewed 240 cases of visa revocations and identified several problems it found that the appropriate units within the federal bureau of investigation fbi and the former ins were not always notified that lookouts were not consistently posted on the watch lists of suspected terrorists that 30 foreign nationals whose visas had been revoked entered the united states and may still remain and that the fbi and the former ins were not routinely taking action to investigate locate the individuals or resolve the cases 37 dos responded to the gao study by arguing that it was not fair or accurate to suggest that all persons whose visas were revoked were terrorists or suspected terrorists in many such instances dos reports that it finds that the national security information does not pertain to the alien whose visa was revoked mistaken identity due to inco mplete identifying data or that the information can be explained in way that clarifies the question at hand and eliminates the potential threat in these cases the consular officers reissue the visa and purge the aliens name from the lookout system dos maintains that the problem has been fixed in the creation last year of revocation code that is shared with the relevant agencies via ibis when visa is prudentially revoked it reportedly was put into place in december 2002 and dos asserts that it has verified that each and every revocation for calendar year 2003 was properly coded and entered into class and ibis and was available almost simultaneously to law enforcement and border inspection colleagues 38 spokesperson for dhss immigration and customs enforcement bureau ice disputed gaos findings he stated that its records indicate that the national security unit nsu in ice received information on 10 leads involving visa revocations and that the nsu conducted followup investigations in all 10 cases he reported that nsu concluded that there was insufficient evidence under current civil and criminal immigration law to allow ice to take action against the visa holders 39 subsequent gao report issued in july 2004 concluded that additional actions were needed to address weakness in the visa revocation process in this report gao stated our analysis of visas revoked

to share intelligence and coordinate activities is essential for us immigration policy to be effective in guarding homeland security some maintain that the reforms congress made in the mid1990s requiring all visa applicants to be checked in the look out databases were inadequate because the databases across the relevant agencies were not interoperable and the various agencies were territorial with their data they maintain that in the long run the most efficient and effective guard against the entry of aliens who would do us harm is an interagency and interdepartmental database

have claimed that security checks such as the visa mantis and visa condor programs have caused delays in the issuance of visas that could strain international business relationships47 the critics maintain that the scope of the alleged problem is multifaceted and not limited to initially bringing people from abroad to work in the united states companies that employ nonimmigrants who must renew their visas are affected as well in addition foreign customers of us firms typically travel here for plant visits and design meetings to inspect products prior to their shipment abroad and for training on the equipment being produced by the us company similarly some us companies hold conference s annually for foreign distributors of their products and there have been accounts of visitors from abroad being unable to secure visas in time to attend the events 48 for the same reason conference and trade show planners reportedly are reconsidering whether to hold meetings in the united states49 others argue that the impact of the more stringent visa policies on business has been exaggerated sparked by problems because the new screening procedures and databases were not fully operational these observers maintain that the visa reforms are essential for national security and that businessrelated travel will normalize once everyone is familiar with the new procedures some speculate that generalized travel concerns after the september 11 terrorist attacks and the slow down in the us economy were key factors in the reduction in nonimmigrant visas issued in fy2002 and fy2003 they maintain that the uptu rn in visas issued over fy2004 and fy2005 is evidence that the trend is reversing deputy assistant secretary for visas services tony edson addressed these competing

article 1 8 of the us constitution and the legislative branch has long taken the lead in immigration policy the 107th congress enacted several major laws that included significant revisions to visa policy administration and issuances the key visa provisions in these major laws are summarized below 53 g23g21g3g561g18g3g22g20g11g17g22g561g3g140g157g561 the usa pa triot act pl 10756 was broad antiterrorism measure that included several important changes to immigration law including specific visa policy matters foremost it expanded the definition of terrorism and the designation of terrorist organizations used to determine the inadmissibility and removal of aliens the act further sought to improve the visa issuance process by mandating data sharing so that consular officers have access to relevant electronic information these provisions authoriz ed the attorney general to share data from domestic criminal record databases with the secretary of state for the purpose of adjudicating visa applications 54 the usa pa triot act additionally mandated that by october 1 2003 all aliens applying for admission under the vwp must have machinereadable passports however the act allows the secretary of state to waive the requirement until september 30 2007 if he finds that the country is making progress towards instituting machinereadable passports and preventing passport

the enhanced border security and visa entry reform act of 2002 pl 107173 hereafter referred to as the border security and visa reform act expressly targeted the improvement of visa issuance procedures among its provisions it required the development of an interoperable electronic data system to be used to share information relevant to alien admissibility and removability and the implementation of an integrated entryexit data system it also requires that all visas issued by october 2004 have biometric identifiers in addition to increasing consular officers access to electronic information needed for visa issuances it expanded the training requirements for consular officers who issue visas 57 the border security and visa reform act placed new requirements on the vwp specifically mandating that the government of each vwp country certify by october 26 2004 that it has established program to issue tamperresistant machinereadable passports with biometric identifier the act also requires all vwp countrie s to certify that they report in timely manner the theft of blank passports allowing the secretary of dhs to remove country from the program if it is determined that the country is not reporting thefts of blank passports g10g152g150g142g149g138g151g141g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g3g140g157g561 prior to establishment of the dhs two departmentsthe dos through consular affairs and the doj through inseach played key roles in administering the law and policies on the admission of aliens at that time the ina gave dos responsibility for issuing visas abroad and specifically assigned such decisions to consular officers 58 the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 states that dhs through the directorate of border and transportation security issues regulations regarding visa issuances and assigns staff to consular posts abroad to advise review and conduct investigations and that doss consular affairs will continue to issue visas59 the memorandum of understanding that implements the working relationship between dos and dhss three immigrationrelated bureaus was signed september 29 2003 57 to close perceived loopholes in the admission of foreign students and to expand on the provisions in iirira the border security and visa reform act required the establishment of electronic means to monitor and verify the status of the students and exchange visitors see crs report rl32188 monitoring foreign students in the united states the student and exchange visitor information system sevis by alison siskin 58 under current law consular decisions are not appealable and critics of transferring the visa function to dhs warned that this adjudication might become subject to judicial appeals or other due process considerations if dhs assumed responsibility 59 the presidents proposal for dhs hr 5005 as introduced would have bifurcated visa issuances so that dhs would set the policies giving the dhs secretary exclusive authority through the secretary of state to issue or refuse to issue visas and retaining responsibility for implementation in dos when the house select committee on homeland security marked up hr 5005 on july 19 2002 it approved compromise language on visa issuances that retained doss administrative role in issuing visas but added specific language to address many of the policy and national security concerns raised during hearings an amendment to move the consular affairs visa function to dhs failed when the house passed hr 5005 on july 26

national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states also known as the 911 commission offered its assessment of how visa and immigration inspection failures contributed to the terrorist attacks the 911 commission contended that there were opportunities for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit qaedas travel vulnerabilities the report went on to state considered collectively the 911 hijackers included known qaeda operatives who could have been watchlisted presented fraudulent passports presented passports with suspicious indicators of extremism made detectable false statements on visa applications made false statements to border officials to gain entry into the united states and violated immigration laws while in the united states60 the report maintained that border security was not considered to be national security matter prior to 911 and as result neither the state departments consular officers nor the former inss inspectors and officers were considered full partners in national counterterrorism efforts61 the 911 commission made several recommendations that underscore the urgency of implementing legislative provisions on visa policy and immigration control that congress enacted several years ago they also suggest areas in which congress may wish to take further action the specific recommendations are targeting travel is at least as powerful weapon against terrorists as targeting their money the united states should combine terrorist travel intelligence operations and law enforcement in strategy to intercept terrorists find terrorist travel facilitators and constrain terrorist mobility the us border security system should be integrated into larger network of screening points that includes our transportation system and access to vital facilities such as nuclear reactors the department of homeland security properly supported by the congress should complete as quickly as possible biometric entryexit screening system including single system for speeding qualified travelers the us government cannot meet its own obligations to the american people to prevent the entry of terrorists without major effort to collaborate with other governments 62 60 us national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report executive summary pp 1314 july 2004 61 the 911 commission report executive summary

to whom they issue nonimmigrant visas bypassing the personal interview especially for visitors coming for purportedly short periods of time was advocated by some as an efficiency of staffing and resources critics assert that this cost savings comes at too high price in terms of national security while some argue that checking an aliens name in database is substitute for facetoface interview others assert that the value of brief personal interview is overrated as security precaution and that time is better spent doing more thorough background checks doss interim final regulations that increase the type and number of aliens required to have personal interview have sparked concern that the waiting times to obtain visa will increase dramatically hr 3452 and hr 3522 would have among other provisions required all visa applicants to be interviewed senatepassed s 2845 had provisions to narrow the authority to waive the personal interview for nonimmigrant visas to children under age

reviewed and adjudicated by consular officer pl 108458 requires an inperson consular interview of most applicants for nonimmigrant visas between the ages of 14 and 79 requires an alien applying for nonimmigrant visa to completely and accurately respond to any request for information contained in the application and clarifies that all nonimmigrant visa applications are reviewed and adjudicated by

revoked under current law the grounds for removal are similarbut not identicalto the grounds for inadmissibly discussed above and include national security and related grounds as well as document fraud some have maintained that foreign national should be immediately removed if the visa that enabled his or her entry has been revoked they have recommended that grounds for removal in ina 212a should be amended to expressly state visa revocation as basis for deportation some further argue that aliens whose visas are revoked should not be entitled to hearing before an immigration judge to determine if the alien should be deported others have asserted that current law balances the broader discretion given to the consular officers abroad with the explicit standards of the grounds for inad missibility and the legal process for removing aliens from the united states they further have maintained that consular officers often make prudential revocations of visas that they subsequently reissue and that anecdotal cases of mistaken identities suggest that the alien screening databases are not sufficiently precise to be the basis for removal without hearing on july 15 2004 legislation s 2661 was introduced to amend the ina to make the revocation of visas and of other documentation authorizing admission administratively and judicially unreviewable it also would have added revocation of visas to those grounds of inadmissibility supporting deportation thus making aliens subject to such revocation immediately removable similar provision was included in s 2845 3008 as passed by the

at consulates abroadwhere reportedly the attorney general has never invoked 243dto alien admissions at us ports of entry if enacted foreign nationals who have visas but are from uncooperative countries would be denied admission when they arrive at ports of try if the secretary of dhs so deemed in comparison s 2611 would have authorized the secretary of dhs to instruct the secretary of
