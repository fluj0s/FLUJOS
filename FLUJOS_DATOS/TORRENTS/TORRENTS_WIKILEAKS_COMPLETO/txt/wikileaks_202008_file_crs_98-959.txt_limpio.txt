fair labor standards act william g whittaker specialist in labor economics economics division summary the fair labor standards act flsa of 1938 as amended provides minimum wage overtime pay and related protections for covered workers while setting such minimum employment standards there may not always have been clear distinction between regularly employed persons and those who volunteer without expectation of compensation to do work of charitable or public service nature in august 1998 in order to clarify the distinction between an employee and volunteer with respect to work in nonprofit food bank the 105th congress passed the amy somers volunteers at food banks act subsequently signed by president clinton pl 1052211 this report will not likely need to be updated volunteers under the flsa the flsa was enacted in 1938 the late new deal after several decades of effort by labor and social reform advocates2 the immediate focus of the act was ensuring fair labor standards for workers who were largely nonunion and in many instances employed through long hours at low wages while general unemployment remained high its scope of coverage was narrow with expansion of coverage to follow into the late 1970s as the statute came to apply to an ever larger proportion of the workforce questions arose with respect to its application to specific groups of workers should all 1 pl

differences in the type of work performed and the conditions under which workers were engaged require exceptions from general standard for example some workers would be paid straight cash wage while others might work on piece rate or commission basis how would their hourly minimum wage be calculated and what would constitute their regular rate for overtime pay purposes how should workers with tip income be treated should handicapped workers be given special consideration through the years body of exceptions came to be written into the law providing flexibility but also certain rigidity in each of these cases however the persons involved were employees how should persons who might not really be employees per be treated section 203g the act defines the concept to employ in broad terms ie to suffer or permit to work in general section 203e of the act defines employee as any individual employed by an employer3 the definition of employee is section 203e is modified with regard to persons engaged in public sector volunteer services it provides the term employee does not include any individual who volunteers to perform services for public agency which is state political subdivision of state or an interstate governmental agency if i the individual receives compensation or is paid expenses reasonable benefits or nominal fee to perform the services for which the individual volunteered and ii such services are not the same type of services which the individual is employed to perform for such public agency b an employee of public agency which is state political subdivision of state or an interstate governmental agency may volunteer to perform services for any other state political subdivision or interstate governmental agency including state political subdivision or agency with which the employing state political subdivision or agency has mutual aid agreement4 as general rule under the flsa public worker may not volunteer to perform services for his regular employer that are essentially the same type of services for which he would regularly be paid these requirements suggest number of concerns for example might worker be coerced into volunteering ie to curry favor with his employer or might volunteering be part of an explicit or implicit quid pro quo arrangement leading to future paid employment5 3 section 203e further defines an employee in terms of employment by public agencies and sets forth an exemption with respect to persons employed in agriculture if such individual is the parent spouse child or other member of the employers immediate family 4 the concepts stated here are further developed in the implementing regulations see 29 cfr 533100 and following defined in the regulation for example are such concepts as expenses reasonable benefits and nominal fee 5 on this general issue see jordan kelley flsa restrictions on volunteerism the institutional and individual costs in changing economy cornell law review v 78 january 1993 pp 302335 with respect to the demographics of volunteerism see freeman richard continued crs3 some charitablenonprofit institutions have paid employees some of those employees may perform the same services for which nonemployees may volunteer in an explanatory bulletin the department of labor states individuals who volunteer or donate their services usually on parttime basis for public service religious or humanitarian objectives not as employees and without contemplation of pay are not considered as employees of the religious charitable and similar nonprofit corporations which receive their services6 as practical matter however some difficulty may arise in determining when person engaged in work although charitable in nature or public service is an actual volunteer and when he or she is an employee volunteers at nonprofit food banks on february 4 1998 representative campbell of california introduced hr 3152 precisely focused the bill proposed to exempt from the definition of employee under the flsa individuals who volunteer their services solely for humanitarian purposes to private nonprofit food banks and who receive from the food banks groceries the bill was referred to the committee on education and the workforce7 hearings were held on the bill on june 25 representative ballenger asked unanimous consent that the committee be discharged from further consideration of the bill and requested its immediate consideration by the house8 there was objection and consideration of the measure commenced representative ballenger explained that the bill focused upon very narrow issue but one important to the operation of food banks the clarification he argued was necessary because of the inconsistent and conflicting interpretations given in the past by the department of labor where the department had advised in 1992 that food bank volunteers would not appear to be considered as employees for flsa purposes mr ballenger stated later 1997 decision from the department advised that they would be regarded as employees because distributing organizations would be compensating needy individuals in the form of benefits that is food or other products for services that the individuals performed the issue appeared to turn on the concept of compensation was the otherwise qualifying indigent individual in effect working for food by june 1998 mr ballenger continued the department had once again decided that such volunteers although receiving groceries were not really employees these conflicting and inconsistent statements and letters he concluded indicate need to clarify this point in the statute representative ballenger added food banks which use such volunteers and encourage such volunteerism among those who receive food assistance should be able to do so

bill was further referred to the subcommittee on workforce protections chaired by representative ballenger 8 congressional record june 25 1998 p h5386 crs4 they are triggering an employment relationship including wage and other employment liabilities he emphasized the narrow focus of the bill explaining that this clarification with respect to volunteers at food banks should not be in any way construed to mean that by doing so congress is showing an intent that any other individual who performs community services and receives benefits is an employee9 that is to say that just because congress was dealing here with volunteers at food banks this action did not imply that other types of volunteers by omission were to be regarded as employees representative owens the ranking minority member of the subcommittee rose in support of the campbell initiative observing that the fair labor standards act is flexible and will yield to common sense after due deliberation10 representative campbell expressing appreciation for the expedited manner in which the bill was considered explained the philosophy behind the measure this bill is sponsored for one very important and simple purpose it is to allow food banks to give not only food but dignity those individuals who are of lesser means who volunteer their time in order to help put together bags of groceries are sometimes given bag of groceries for the hours that they may work in recognition not as wage but because they themselves might also be in need it is way for person who has need to receive help in his or her own right in way that confers and maintains their dignity as human being11 representative ballenger then offered an amendment with mr campbells approval that would honor recently deceased food bank director by titling the bill the amy somers volunteers at food banks act the ballenger amendment was agreed to and the bill was passed by the house12 received in the senate on june 25 hr 3152 was referred to the committee on education and labor13 on july 29 senator campbell of colorado asked that the committee be discharged from further consideration of the bill and following the pattern of the house asked that the measure receive immediate consideration once again there was objection without further discussion hr 3152 was approved by the senate14 9 congressional record june 25 1998 p h5386 an october
