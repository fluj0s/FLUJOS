estimated that the federal government would save 25 billion in medicaid if the 24month waiting period was eliminated however these federal medicaid savings would more than be offset by the aforementioned cost increases to the medicare program additionally the states would realize 18 billion in medicaid savings if the waiting period was eliminated 12
