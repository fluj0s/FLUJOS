program overview of institutional and water use issues summary the california baydelta program cal fed was initiated in 1995 to resolve water resources conflicts in the sacram entosan joaquin ri vers delta and san francisco bay baydelta in california the program planning effort focused on developing plan to address three main problem areas in the baydelta ecosystem health water quality and wa ter supply reliability calf ed was initially authorized to receive federal funding from fy1998 to fy2000 and since that time only certain projects supporting calfed goals received appropriations the program was finally reauthorized october 25 2004 the baydelta is formed by the conf luence of the northflowing san joaquin river the southflowing sacr amento river and the san francisco bay to which the delta of the two rivers is linked this 738000acre area contains vast network of marshes wetlands and open wa ter that supplies water to twothirds of californias population and nearly seven million acres of farmland through series of pumps canals and dams operated by the federal and state governments the competing demands for baydelta water have stre tched the resources capacity to provide reliable amounts of water to users eg fa rmers and the ecosystem the baydelta ecosystem is being altered by habitat conversion and water quality degradation including salt water intrusion for example several fish populati ons have declined and some species are on federal threatened and endangered species lists many attribute the deterioration to unnaturally low levels of wate r in the baydelta listing of these species has affected the timing and use of water pumped from the baydelta and has created uncertainty in water supplie s for water users in southern california allocating water from the baydelta has been the subject of conflicts and disputes among stakeholders such as farmers urban water contractors and environmentalists for years calfed was developed as response to these conflicts through series of agreements and revisi ons that have involve d federal and state legislation and stakeholder accords record of decision rod for the current calfed program was issued by consortium of state and federal agencies in august 2000 however legislation to imp lement the calfed program as outlined in the rod had not been enacted until recen tly calfed as described in the rod has 12 program components that range fro m water quality and supply to ecosystem restoration and governance calfed wa s planned to be implemented in three phases of which two are already completed the third phase is the implementation of the calfed program as outlined in the rod stage i of three stages in phase iii of calfed is currently underway and is expected to take seven years to complete and cost nearly 87 billion the reauthorization of calfed funding has been controversial specific issues such as authorization for water storage pr ojects balance among project and program activities and water supplies fo r the environment as well as broader issues such as governance and the degree to which the rod is implemented were resolved to varying degrees with the passage of p l 108361 which

and water use issues introduction the 1153square mile estuary at the conf luence of the san francisco bay and the sacramento and san joaquin rivers lta the baydelta is also the hub of californias extensive water supply system as such the baydelta has endured decades of competing water demands duri ng this time the baydelta ecosystem has experienced environmental degradation increasing regional wa ter demands and decrease in reliable water supplies for urban agricultural and natural areas for example by the late 1980s and early 1990s fish species declines and water quality problems had become so severe that tinued operation of th state and federal water supply projects were coming into conf lict with state and fe deral environmental laws to counter this tre nd and to avoid shutdown or severe operational changes to pumps at the heart of the state water project swp and the federal central valley project cvp the state of california and several federal agencies entered into partnership to resolve resour ce conflicts this partnershi p resulted in an agreement known as the baydelta accord which ultima tely led to the development of the calfed baydelta program calfed and the record of decision rod for the calfed baydelta final programmatic environmental impact statement and report eiseir1 the objectives of calfed were to restore ecological health improve water quality fortify infrastructure for managing water eg improving delta levees and increase water suppl reliability in the baydelta area the authorization of an annual fe deral appropriati on of 143 million from fy1998 to fy2000 for the calfed program to develop and implement specific portions of an ecosystem protection plan and longterm restoration projects for the baydelta expired september 30 20002 between 1998 and 2000 220 million in federal funds was appr opriated for the calfed program however absent an explicit authorization from the authorizing committees congressional appropriators have been reluctant to dir ectly fund the program since three bills were introduced in the 108th congress to authorize appropriations for federal participati on in the calfed program hr 2828 introduced july 23

26 2003 by george miller and s 1097 introduced may 21 2003 by dianne feinstein and barbara boxer3 all three bills would have authorized implementation of various calfed program components action items and activities identified in the rod however none of the bills would have authorized the implementation of the rod in its entirety4 the reauthorization of fe deral participation in the calfed program was quite controversial the controve rsy stems in part from the complex nature of water allocation from the baydelta itself for decades two massive water supply projects the state water project swp and th federal central valley project cvp have moved water from norther n california through the baydelta to water users in southern california decisions on who gets how much water and when they receive it are generally made annually and are based on myriad of state and federal laws historic water rights contr acts and negotiated agreements any proposed change to this complex water allocation system is met with concern from water users who fear they may lose water receive reduced prior ity for water supplies or receive water of degraded quality on the other hand many attribute the bayde ltas deterioration to unnaturally low water s upplies resulting from the management of the state and federal projects and ve called for changes in project operations in particular the decline of certain fish species eg wi nter run chinook salmon led to operational changes affecting when and how much water can be pumped from the baydelta to supply water users south of the delta additionally envir onmental groups have advocated increased water supplies for nvironmental purposes to stave off the decline of fish and wildlife species improve water quality for other uses and restore the health and vitality of the baydelta ecosystem while the calfed program is an attempt to balance competing interests and develop plan for managing baydelta wa ter resources to meet competing demands all parties have not been 100 satisfied in the final goal s programmatic actions and water management regimes called for the in the rod specifically some agricultural stakeholders have expresse d concerns over how much water they will receive and have asked for assurances that they w ill receive certain percentage of their contracted supplies however other agricultu ral and urban contractors fear their water supplies may be threatened by such assu rances some of the same groups and others are concerned that the methods of distributing water will disadvantage them that the program is not balanced eg between ecosystem re storation and water storage facilities and that f unding levels and authoriza tion for surface water storage facilities are inadequate further some question the legitimacy of scientific findings regarding environmental water needs and believe the level of water allocated for recovering threatened and endangered species in the baydelta may not be justifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31975crs3 5 calfed baydelta program 2003 annual report sacramento ca2003 6 the main crops grown in the baydelta ar wheat alfalfa cotton corn and tomatoesothers are concerned that legislative efforts to resolve some of these issues could undermine the ability of the calfed program to restore fisheries and other resources associated with the baydelta ecosystem some environmental groups argue for greater flows of water to na tural areas to support the recovery of endangered and threatened plant and animal species some also advocate investing in water conservation and new pricing strategies to lower demand for baydelta water and using new technolog ies eg desalinati on and water recycling to stretch existing water supplies in general environmental groups oppose development of new surface storage projects preferring in stead to manage existing supplies more efficiently where there was once general agreement perhaps tenuous among the stakeholders who participated in development of the rod this agreement was based on delicate balance of many interests and nearly decade of fairly intense negotiations consequently any attempt to authorize program

figure 1 the baydelta is considered the largest estuary on the west coast and its combination of fresh and salt water ecosystems provide habitat for diverse array of plant and animal life an estimated 750 species of plants and animals including over 130 species of fish are found in the baydelta5 the baydelta also contains over 700000 acres of farmland6 and is used by approximately 12 million recreationists per year who among other activities boat fish hike and sightsee in the baydelta the water regime of the baydelta was significantly altered in the 1930s when the federal government at th behest of california bega n massive project to divert water from the sacramento valley and delta to farmland in californias vast central valley the state some 20 years later followed with its own

fundamentally alte red the physical environment of th central valley as well as the baydelta hundreds of wetland areas were lost or altered nd by the late 1980s water quality and endangered species act issues threatened the operation of the cvp and the swp today the baydelta ecosystem is still generally considered to be unhealthy and unable to provide re liable amounts of water for water users some also believe that the baydelta is unable to sustain viable habitats for all of its plant and animal life11 water quality has deteriorated in the baydelta partially due to drainage of freshwater and influx of highly saline water further pollutants originating from agricultural runoff cities and ranches have lowered water quality in the baydelta the baydelta has also suffered from fragmentation and loss of native habitat of the nearly 350000 acres of original tidal marshland in the bay delta only 8000 acres remain several pl ant and animal species are on state and federal endangered and threatened lists including the steelhead trout and the winter run chinook salmon problems in the baydelta related to water quality and fish and wildlife have raised compliance issues with the clean water act cwa pl 92 500 as amended the endangered species act pl 93205 as amended as well as comparable state laws these issues are discussed in more detail below conflicts and federal go vernment involvement the limited supply of water in california has been the subject of conflicts among competing interests for decades the fundamental controversy over water supplies more recently has centered on the distribution of wate r supplies to urban areas and agriculture and their effect on the environment in 1986 california and federal government entered into c oordinated operation agreement coa to coordinate operations between the cvp and swp and to allow equitable sharing of surplus water12 afterwards controversy peaked when california was experiencing sixyear drought 1987 199213 limited water supplies during the drought led to water rationing in urban and agricultura l areas reduction in crop productivity and cultivation and environmental deterioration in river and marshland habitats the distribution of water was further complicat ed by the implementation of the federal cwa and in the baydelta concerns that annual operations of the cvp and swp may have been violating federal and state water quality and endangered species statutes resulted in new efforts to provide baseline water supplie s for environmental purposes in 1992 the central valley proj ect

distribution implementation of the fede ral endangered species act several fish species in the baydelta have been listed as either endangered or threatened under the federal the generally pr ohibits

habitat further the requires the designation of critical habitat areas where species is currently found or which might provide additional habitat for species recovery15 actions implemented under the have resulted in changes to dam operations water flow and pumping facilities in the baydelta for example exports of water out of the baydelta were limited to protect salmon runs of the winterrun chinook salmon onchorhyncus tshawtscha which was listed as endangered in 1989 as other fish species such as the delta smelt hypomesus transpacificus and springrun chinook salmon onchorhyncus tshawytscha have been listed as threatened further re strictions on water exports and project modifications have been implemented in the baydelta controversy over water allocated to the environment for recovering fish was exemplified when efforts to protect the then federally listed threatened sacramento splittail pogonichthys macrolepidotus resulted in lawsuit against the us fish and wildlife service fws by state water contractors fede ral judge in 2000 invalidated the decision to list the species citing the failure of the fws to consider the opinions of state game scientists explain high stocking rate s in 1998 and explain why the splittail was threatened in september 2003 the fws withdrew the splittail from the threatened species list after analyzing the population and determining that it would not become threatened or endangered in the foreseeable future implementation of the cvpia water allocation for endangered species and the environment in general was to be enhanced with the enactment of the cvpia in 1992 the legislation was enacted largely in response to the decline of fish and wildlife species in the baydelta and the sacramento and san joaquin rivers system the cvpia changed the priorities for water supply for the cvp by ranking fish and wildlife water needs on par with irrigati on and domestic water uses refuges are granted the same high priority given to agriculture and water reductions to refuges may not exceed 25 during drought years cvpia also reallocates cvp water back to natural areas to benefit salmon steel head trout and other fish and wildlife16 some argue that limited funds appropriated for the rest oration fund litigation overhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31975crs7 providing 800000 acrefeet of water for the environment each year and controversy over contract renewal pr ovisions has led to the cvpia not fully meeting environmental expectations at the same time many farmers and others have called the cvpia disaster claiming that the prio rity for allocating water supplies to the environment is too high implementation of the clean water act beginning in the late 1980s the implementation of the cwa by the us environmental protection agency epa generated controversy between the state water board and the federal government the cwa regulates both surface water and groundwater quality and is enforced by the epa in 1987 the epa notified the stat of california that state surface water quality standards were not in compliance with the cwa the state responded with new water standards that were again reject ed by the epa in 1993 after lawsuit brought by environmentalists the epa issued set of federal water quality guidelines for implementation in california these were later rejected by the state this ongoing struggle to address cwa requirements further threatened continued operation of the cv p and swp partic ularly operations of delta pumping facilities in order to forestall cutbacks in water project operations state and federal authorities jointly adopted mutually accep table water quality standards and agreed to regulate the cvp and swp operations to meet these standards as well as to develop target flows for listed species this agreement known as the baydelta accord included the following elements provisions to regulate springtime flow and export limits to benefit fish species operational flexibility to comply with provisions of the that address water supply and species monitoring issues among others and measures to improve nvironmental conditions in the baydelta estuary eg waste discharge control and bitat restoration the ccord was in effect until 2000 and then was incorporated in part by the rod calfed baydelta program controversies surrounding implementa tion of the federal statutes ou tlined above fueled the creation of the baydelta framework agreement refinement of the accord which was signed in 1995 by stat and federal agencies with regulatory responsibilities in the baydelta this ag reement marked the beginning of the calfed process and defined three issues that were deemed important for federal state coordination and cooperation the formulation of wate r quality standards coordination of federal and state project oper ations with regulato ry requirements ie coordination of cvp and swp operations to maintain compliance with the cvpia and state and federal water quality provisions and development of joint federalstate process to deve lop longterm solutions to environmental water supply and water quality problems in the baydelta the calfed program was created from the framework agreement to address these issues the initial authorization of federal funding for the calfed program came in 1996 with the enactment of pl 104208 division title i this legi

calfed s 1097 as introduced would have aut horized federal ag encies to conduct projects and activities included under 14 co mponents similar to the 12 components defined in the rod these activities range from the specific such as the construction of floodway imp rovements in the lower m okelumne river to broad categories such as water conservation pr ojects to enhance water supply reliability water quality and ecosystem benefits s 1097 as amended on may 20 2004 would have authorized 389 million in funding for these activities from fy2005 to fy2010 as passed by the house in july hr 2828 was similar to s 1097 in that it would have authorized federal agencies to conduct projects and activities included under components defined in the rod nd provided an authorization of 389 million for those ac tivities hr 2828 however differed from s 1097 in some ways the july version of hr 2828 would have 1 approved the rod as general framework 2 included provision potentially preauthorizing the construction of federal water projects 3 contained additiona l requirements for land acquisition and ecosystem restoration projects and 4 authorized appropriations from fy2005 to fy200824 thematically the major areas of bill differences include the degree to which the existing rod would have been implemented the entity in charge of managing program activities the process for project approval eg feasibility study and project authorization cost allo cation schemes and require ments for land acquisition congress is expected to face other calfed issues in the next few years including funding levels water storag water supplies for the nvironment land acquisition and science summary of each of these issues is presented below funding the implementation of calfed is expected to cost an estimated 10 billion dollars over 30 years however during the first seven years referred to as stage 1 implementation costs are estimated to be 87 billion the calfed program identified in the rod envisions threeway split in responsibility for funding between the federal government state government and local users eg through user fees however each program element in the plan may have its own

projects within the calfed program but lacking an authorizing st atute provided appropriations for the overall program from fy2001 to fy2005 for example in the joint explanatory statement to pl 108137 energy and water development appropriations for fy2004 conference managers stated that it would be difficult for congress to support the calfed program without program authorization by congress to date federal funding has been ppropriated to provide fish screens for existing water diversions implement pollution control measures manage fish riparian and estuarine habitat and study water storage pr ojects the funding has been in addition to funds already authorized for project s and programs under the cvpia and other previously authorized projects and pr ograms although federal funds were appropriated for the calfed progra m from fy2001fy2005 appropriations were provided for projects that support the goals of calfed such as the continued study of four water supply projects fede ral funds were appr opriated for fy2001 for calfed or any of its projects for fy2002 fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 congress included 30 million 23 million90 million and 85 million respectively in the water and

million for the calfed program for fy2005 fy2010 water storage many argue that an increase in water supplies for california is needed due to population growth in th state and lower supplies from the colorado river among other things one mechanism to increase the availability of additional water supplies is to increase the capacity for surface water storage several stakeholders including some members of congress have argued for an increase in investments for building additional surface water storage capacity in california others contend existing veloped water supplies can be stretched through conservation water reuse and recyclin g conjunctive use storing water in groundwater basins water transfers nd changes in water management policy egwater pricing during house resources committee hearing on calfed crosscut budget in may of 2003 several members of c ongress expressed concerns that more money has been spent on environmental activities than on storage program officials countered by explaining that the authorization for feasib ility studies for water storage expansion projects we re delayed until early in 2003 when they were authorized in the fy2003 omnibus ppropriations pl 108 7 and that over time funding for water storage will increase relative to future ecosystem spending thus they contend the calfed program is designed to be implemented in balanced

s 1097 and hr 2828 included veral provisions designed to provide balance among program components h r 2828 as originally passed the house further included provision to possibly streamline project approval the provision would have allowed the secretary of interior to proceed with water storage construction upon completion of feas ibility study unless congress passed disapproval resolution within 120 gislative days 103b5ai iii this provision was very controvers ial and was one of the majo r differences in the house and senate bills upon which there was strong disagr eement u ltimately the provision was dropped from the bill and re placed with provision requiring rebalancing of program elements and res ubmission of options for water storage if congress does not authorize construction of water storage facilities within certain time frame environmental water account to increase water supply reliability while not adversely affecting the baydelta ecosystem the rod included an environmental water account ewa whic h was established by calfed agencies in 2000 the account is seen as way to add flexibility to the regulatory system to ensure that fish are protected from water project operations while allowing for greater water supply reliability for agricultural and urban users calfed agencies are to use the ewa to annually acquire bank nd transfer approx imately 380000 acrefeet of water and arrange for its conveyance the account may use transfers options and acquisitions to obtain water to compensate water users when pumps are shut down to mitigate fish take26 in addition water may be obtained through financing conservation or recycling projects five calfed agencies are partners in the ewa us fish and wildlife service fws national oceanic and atmospheric association fisheries noaa fisheries bo r california depar tment of fish and game and california department of water resources these agencies authorize exports from the account to provide add itional water for species protection the use of the ewa and the amount of wate r that is needed or desirable in the ewa has generated controversy prior calfed bills would have directed that the ewa provide assurances that actions taken to protect species listed as threatened or endangered under the federal avoid wa ter delivery impacts and costs to project water users this language would have significantly narrow the scope and priorities of the ewa as compared with the rod for example the rod does not limit the scope of the ewa to only species listed under the nor does the rod contain provisions that protect water users from co sts associated with the function of the ewa while many stakeholders support the ewa they are divided as to how it should work some participants have expressed concern that the water level prescribed for fisheries is too low that baseline water needs are not adequately defined and that operating rules for the ew are unclear others believe that too much water is already allocated for the environment and want assurances that certainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31975crs13 27 adaptive management within the context of calfed could be described as incorporating new information learned from experience and scie ntific studies into restoration and water supply projects or policies that may make these projects and policies progress more efficiently toward reaching their goals quantities of water for far ming will be available both hr 2828 and s 1097 included several provisions ddressing the ewa yet they differ in some respects for example the definitions of the ew under s 1097 and hr 2828 were largely tied to the rod however s 1097 noted that the ewa is to provide water in addition to the regulatory baseline quantity of water to protect and restore delta fisheries while hr 2828 as reported and enacted defined the ewa as the cooperative management prog ram established under the rod as enacted pl 108 361 also authorizes the use of the existin g central valley proj ect restoration fund for ewa purposes not to exceed 10 million science ecosystem restoration is genera lly undertaken with uncertainties in the restoration process eg scientific uncer tainty in the ability of some restoration projects to succeed specifically restoration efforts may require the application of untested technologies and may uncover unforeseen circum stances that may indicate change in the initial restoration strategy indeed some argue that identifying and eliminating all uncertain ties involved with re storation is probably impossible some stakeholders question the level of scientific uncertainty in some restoration activities and regulations of calfed for example some question the validity of provisions that specify the level of water needed for the baydelta ecosystem to restore endangered fish species they have called fo r an independent scien tific review of the validity of the quantitative allocations of water to habitats of endangered and threatened fish species independent sc ientific review and the implementation of adaptive management was ddressed under various vers ions of hr 2828 and s 1097 pl 108361 contains provisions th at call for the establishment of an independent science board and other panels to provide ove rsight and peer review of the program creation of monitoring nd research programs and performance measures and development and imple mentation of adaptive management27 land acquisition federal and state land acquisition is expected to be necessary to implement veral components of the calfed program according to the rod for example the rod estimate s that nearly 260000 acres of agricultural land will need to be used for ecosystem restoration water quality water storage and conveyance and levee system integrity projects and activities because land acquisition may cause conflicts among stakeholders and affect surrounding landowners and local governments as r ecognized by the rod land acquisition in the baydelta is controversial some argue that land acquisition is essential for restoring ecosystems and should not be subject ed to extended delays and restrictions others argue that guidelines and assurances must be established to minimize potential economic impacts of land acquisition s 1097 and hr 2828 would have authoriz ed federal funds to acquire fee title to land only where consistent with the rod in implementing the calfed program 4f of s 1097 and 104e of hr 2828 this provision woul d have applied to all components under each bill hr 2828 as passed by the house in july includedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31975crs14 additional requirements for land to be ac quired for ecosystem restoration for example it would have directed that pot ential impacts of acquiri ng land be reported and mitigated preliminary management plans be created to report existing conditions expected ecological benefits cost estimates and implementation schedules and federa l land acquisitions be identifie d some fear such language would constrain ecosystem restoration activities while others argue that such language is needed to reduce pressure on acquiring private property and to ensure success in ecological restoration pl 108361 incorporates much of the language in hr 2828 including provision that re quires federal funds fo r the implementation of calfed be used to acquire fee title to land only where consistent with the rod other provisions require the s ecretary of the interior to identify parcels of land to be acquired and provide notice of land acqui sitions 150 days before the project is approved to appropriate authorizing co mmittees of the house and senate and senators and representatives whose districts will be affected pl 108361 also contains set of reporting provisions from h r 2828 that are to describe the process and timing of notifying public and local g overnments of land ac quisitions describe the measures taken to reduce impacts of land acquisition on agricultural lands pursuant to the rod and include preliminary management plans for all lands acquired including the expected ecological benefits cost estimates and implementation schedules conclusion decadelong attempt to address water qua lity water supply and issues in the california baydelta via the calfed process ultimately resulted in development of an estimated 30year 10
