which is an employer paying wage or salary to an employee in 2003 according to data from the current population survey cps the selfemployed numbered little over 93 million they accounted for fewer than 7 of all employed persons in nonfarm industries wage and salary workers at 1260 million represented more than 9 of every 10 employed persons in the nonfarm sector of the economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32387congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rl32387 selfemployment as contributor to job

contributor to job growth and as an alternative work arrangement summary selfemployment is the major alternative to the leading type of employee employer relationship which is firm payi ng wage to an employee the self employed have accounted for some 7 of nonfarm jobs over the past few decades selfemployment recently has drawn attention as one explanation for differing survey estimates of net job growth ce the 2001 recessions end there also was debate over the two prior decades about the contribution to net j ob creation of self employment or entrepreneurship ie pe ople starting businesses during the 1992 2000 economic expansion intere st in selfemployment focused on the kind of jobs being created ie alternatives to secure traditional wage nd salary jobs and on the possibility of misclassifying employees as selfemployed consultants or contractors who then are ineligible for certain government benefits eg unemployment insurance ui worker s compensation and family and medical leave since the early 1990s the governme nt has encouraged the establishment of selfemployment assistance programs to help reemploy some displaced workers likely to exhaust their ui benefits the contribution of selfemployment to net job creation has not varied greatly by decade except for the 1990s in the 1970s and 1980s increased selfemployment accounted for 7 and 10 of nonfarm job ga ins respectively during the 1990s however people more often became employees such that selfemployment contributed just 1 to net job growth to attract employees when unemployment rates were low in the second half of the 1990s firms may have ex panded benefits that appealed to those who otherwise would ve chosen selfemployment eg flexible work hours thus far in the current decade selfemployment has been much greater contributor to net job growth at 13 persons laid off in sluggish labor ma rket may become discouraged about their hiring prospects and turn to selfemplo yment eg during the slow rebound from the last two recessions studies disagree however about whether high unemployment pushes people into selfemployment because of dearth of other options or whether it dampens entrepreneurship because of scarce opportunities and factors beyond conditions in the labor market affect the propensity of displaced workers and others to start businesses older workers great er likelihood of selfemployment may reflect desire to phase into retir ement without jeopardizing r eceipt of employerprovided health insurance and level of employe rprovided pension be nefits womens increased selfemployment rate may reflect the desire of mothers with young children for hours flexibility to allow them to bala nce work and family roles thus over 80 of independent consultants in the february 19952001 period said they preferred their situation to that of traditional workers their satisfaction appears related to the comparatively high wages of male independent contract ors although the availability of benefits lags for the group as whole further in that low unemployment period only 3 to 4 of independe nt contractors considered their positions insecure many fewer than others in nontrad itional jobs this report will be updated as warrantedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32387contents w h t h i n t r s t 1 w h r t h s l f m p l d 4 g n d r 5 g e5 race and ethnicity 6 industry 8 c c u

because it purportedly enables companies to respond more flexibly to ch anges in market conditions and to reduce payroll taxes as well as employee benefit costs10 they contend the selfemployed consultants or free agents are able in turn to have the independence that is important to them others view with disfavor all alternative work arrangements because they allegedly reduce workers jo b

and be nefits among other things the study released in february 2000 noted that rise in the unemployment rate such as occurred during and after the 2001 recession could heighten the administrative burden of state ui staff due to an incr eased number of contes ted claims filed by independent contractors who t hought they were employees13 this report begins by defining and examining the characteristics of self employed persons it next analyzes the tr end in selfemployment its contribution to net job growth and why some individuals become entrepreneurs the report then explores group closely related to th selfemployed namely independent contractors and compares them with those in other alternative work arrangements and in traditional jobs who are the selfemployed the definition of selfemployment in the cps may be narrower than some peoples conception of working for oneself the monthly cps asks people whether in their primary job they currently are em ployed by government private firm nonprofit entity or whether they are lfemployed individuals who respond affirmatively to the first three choices are classified as wage and salary workers those who reply they are selfemployed s ubsequently are asked if their business is incorporated if they say it is then they too are classified as wage and salary workers because they legally are the employees of their corporations thus the cps estimate of selfemployment applies to those whose primary job is owner of an unincorporated business from whose profits they derive their income14 the unincorporated self employed may hire employees but they generally do not do so15 confusion on the part of cps respondent s may have led to understatement of the number of unincorporated selfemployed in the last decade or so when independent consultants seemingly became more prevalent16 during the dotcom bubble for example indemand network ad ministrators and software engineers may have leapt from their wage and salary jobs to start working as freelancers if they subsequently contracted to work for their former employers they or their family members may have misidentified the job to the cps interviewer as payroll employment rather than selfemploymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32387crs5 17 an individual is classified as selfemployed in the monthly cps if that is the job held at the time of the interview in the march suppl ement to the cps an individual is classified as selfemployed if that is the longest job he ld during the preceding year consequently the selfemployment rate derived from the monthly cps will be higher than the rate derived from the march supplement because the latter misses short spells of selfemployment studies of the composition of the selfemployed based upon data from the

independent contractors are addr essed in the reports last section but by way of preview the two ove rlapping groups have much in common gender as shown in table 1 selfemployment is much more common among men 80 than women 57 the disparity has lessened over time women today account for almost two of every five sel femployed individuals principally because relatively more women than men have become business owners over the years18 one often suggested reason for womens propensity toward selfemployment is it gives them control over work schedules wh ich facilitates accomm odation of their traditional role as family caregivers19 age selfemployment is increasingly common as people approach the end of their working lives some 15 of workers ag 65 or older were selfemployed in 2003 desire to phase into retirement likely ex plains much of the groups comparatively high selfemployment rate persons eligible for social security benefits might want to work less than fulltime schedules20 even were employers to allow them to work parttime older workers might be penalized for doing so if their pension plans base benefits upon recent salary levels moreover firm s less often extend health insurance coverage to parttime employees and when they do often require larger employee contribution faced with these circumstances mbers of the oldest age group might respond by retiring from their payroll jobs but keep their hand in by starting business or by making what pr eviously had been side business their primary job lesser but still well abovea verage share of 4564 year olds also are self employed the rate among midcareer workers probably is higher because they are more likely than younger workers to ve accumulated the capital and managerial skills needed to become an

about 7 of net new jobs the 18 million increase in selfemployed persons during the 1980s comprised larger share of job growth at almost 10 during the 1990s the very limited net increase in selfemployment 185000 contributed just 1 to the expansion in nonfarm employment while the absolute number of selfemployed workers had climbed steadily over the 1970s and 1980s their number remained fa irly flat at or approaching 9 million during the long economic expansion of the 1990s researchers who study self employment cannot ex plain the aberration28 as the labor market tightened and health insurance costs rose over the course of the decade companies may have offered such things as flexible work schedules telecommuting and benefits to lure free agents onto payrolls29 between 1991 and 1997 for example the proportion of fulltime wage and salary workers with fl exible schedules almost doubled rising from 15 to 2830 the robust economic times also may have dampened business starts because fewer people wo rried about losing or actually lost their payroll jobs31 for example in 1998 when the national unemployment rate was low 45 only 145 of people who started bus inesses said they did so because they had been laid off or feared that might happen32 selfemployment thus far into the current decade has been much more substantial contributor to net job gr owth than during the 1990s and exceeds its shares during the 1970s an d 1980s the net addition of 139000 selfemployed persons from 2000 to 2003 accounted for over 13 of nonfarm job gains reasons for entering selfemployment from unemployment arguably some workers who lose wage and salary jobs when few are being created such as during periodic nationw ide areawide or industrywide slowdowns or during prolonged geographic or

to report increased employment was the selfemployed34 recent empirical study of us men aged 21 and older in the 19791998 period concluded that dearth of wage and sa lary job opportunities pushes workers into selfemployment35 another analysis estimated that the unincorporated self employed in particular are sensitive with lag to local ec onomic cond itions the unincorporated presumably because incorpor ation can be costly and would be less attractive to persons who regard working for oneself as way station between salaried jobs with lag because it take s time to start business the economists model explained almost the entire increase in selfemployment that occurred since the 2001 recession began they speculated th at many of these new businesses are likely to disappear when the wage and salary sector improves36 there is an ongoing debate among researchers however bout whether high unemployment acts to discourage selfemployment because of the lack of available opportunities or encourage it because of the lack of viable alternatives37 demographic and economic factors be yond current labor market conditions affect the propensity of job losers among others to become entrepreneurs displaced workers age and prior househol d wealth were estimated to increase the probability of entering selfemployment38 other studies found that among women the likelihood of selfemployment increased if there were oung child ren in the family and if there was selfemployed s pouse who could serve as role model and who could provide capital for his wifes business venture39

by linda levineselfemployment as an alternative work arrangement an examination of independe nt contractors might shed additional light on the selfemployed particularly if as previously mentioned there may be some misidentification in the monthly cps of the selfemployed as wage and salary workers additionally the definition of i ndependent contractor that bls developed may accord more with the current perception of what it means to be selfemployed eg computer consultants and freelance writers as opposed to retail store and restaurant owners from february 1995 to february 2001 bls collected statistics biennially on alternative work arrangements through stions that supplemented the basic cps questionnaire independent contractors also known as independent consultants and freelancers obtain customers on their own to whom they provide good or service the designation of selfemployed or wage and salary worker according to the basic cps questionnaire is irre levant in the deter mination of who is in an alternative work arrangement41 thus almost 9 out of 10 indepe ndent consultants are unincorporated and incorporated selfemployed while the remainder are wage and salary workers42 there were almost 86 million independe nt contractors who accounted for 64 of total farm and nonfarm employment in february 2001 this does not differ much from the 91 million unincorporated business owners who accounted for 68 of nonfarm employment for all of 2001 as shown in table 2 which is not surprising because about half of all selfemployed persons incorporated and unincorporated farm and nonfarm said they were independent consultants since the supplementary questions were first asked independent consultants have been the largest of the four nontraditional worker groups most recently comprising little under 70 of the total the other groups are mporary help agency workers oncall workers and workers provided by contract firms traditional jobs are any that do not fall into the four

boss the great majority at least three out of four give personal reasons for wanting to be freelancers eg flexible schedules and family obligations rather than economic reasons eg only type of work available44 the labor market prospects of independe nt contractors seemingly temper their preference for the work arrangement45 thus compared to the group overall fewer of those who recently had been laid off preferred freelancing nonetheless majority 662 of persons who lost jobs in the three years before being reemployed as consultants in february 1995 preferred th eir alternative to traditional employment the high rate of satisfaction among those who conceivably might have involuntarily become independent contr actors through downsizing or some other job loss following the 19901991 recession is consistent with anecdotal evidence which indicates that while these workers may not have been happy to have lost their previous wage and sala ry positions they still would prefer not to return to situation in which they woul d be company employee instead these individuals may find that being an indepe ndent contractor affords them more job security than being someone elses employee does46 indeed fairly few independe nt consultants consider themselves to be in an insecure or contingent work arrangemen t ie one that is not expected to be longlasting when the economy was expanding vigorously toward the end of the 1990s and firms were competing intensely to hire employees the already small share of freelancers who believed their jobs were insecure shrank further 38 in 1995 35 in

us bureau of labor statistics data from the alternative work arrangement supplement to the current population survey during the tightening labor market that encompassed the february 1995 through february 2001 survey periods most independe nt consultants appear to have had good reason to perceive their situations as s ecure they reported both the longest median tenure of workers in alternative arrangements and longer tenure than workers in traditional arrangements in february 2001 for example the ty pical freelancer had been hisher own boss for 81 years while the typical traditional worker had held hisher job for 44 years as in the pa st the tenure gap was wider between male contractors 101 years and male traditional workers 48 years compared to female contractors 60 years and fe male traditional workers 40 years reflecting the older profile of male contractors49 earnings the relative pay of workers in alternative jobs is estimated to positively affect the preference for

categorized the groups differently than bls regular fulltime workers were defined as wage and salary workers employed at least 35 hours week and not included in other arrangements called nonstandard eg regular parttime workers whom bls does not consider to be in alternative arrangements are defined as wage and salary workers employed fewer than 35 hours week and not included in the other nonstandard arrangements temporary help agency workers oncall workers day laborers and contract company workers w hose definition unlike that of bls does not require employment at the client firms wo rkplace the analysis includes as nonstandard those persons who reported themselves as selfemployed including shop or restaurant owners it further distinguishes between independent contractors who said they very continuedin all other alternative arrangements except employees of firms that provide onsite services to other companies 79051 earlier surveys show independent c ontractors had higher median weekly earnings than workers in traditional empl oyment arrangements in 1999 the latest period for which such comparison can be made freelancers employed fulltime had median weekly earnings of 640 100 or 19 greater than fulltime workers in traditional jobs52 these earnings disparities are associated with individual and job characteristics compared to traditional workers indepe ndent contractors like the unincorporated selfemployed previously desc ribed generally are older they also more often are white males and college gr aduates who typically put in long hours in addition some occupations in which consultants are disproportionately employed are relatively highpaying eg executive administrative and managerial positions while the typical male freelancer employed fulltime earned more than males in traditional jobs during the second half of the 1990s the typi cal female freelancer earned less than her counterpart in traditional job53 an analysis comparing the hourly wage of nonstandard workers and re gular fulltime workers and taking into account these personal and job characteristics estimated that all selfe mployed independent contractors female independent contractors in wage and salary jobs and other male selfemployed eg store owners earned statistically significant wage premium in contrast other selfemployed women suffered statistically significant wage penalty compared to

and 168 resp ectively in 2001 this too may be related to demographic and job characteristics the share of freelancers at least 65 years old has been about three times the share of traditional workers most recently 79 and 26 respectively55 as previously noted members of this age group could choose to bridge their fulltime salaried careers and their nonwork years by consulting for few hours week in add ition female independe nt contractors are more likely than female traditional employees to be raising preschool children which may partly explain why over three times the share of adult female than male freelancers are employed parttime by choice56 relatively more adult male consultants than male traditional work ers are employed parttime for economic reasons ie slack work poor business c onditions or unable to find fulltime jobs which may be partly linked to the formers greater presence in industries with work weeks over which they have little control eg agriculture and construction57 benefits as with earnings workers provided by c ontract companies have the highest rate of health insurance coverage 801 among persons in alternative work arrangements independent contractors again come in second with 725 having health benefits in 2001 this contrasts w ith the larger percentage of traditional workers who have health care coverage 83158 freelancers may obtain health benefits by independently purchasing po licies or through spouses employer provided plan indeed it appears that the availability of health insurance coverage through spouse is positively associated with becoming selfemployed59 other consultants may have previously worked for companies that extend health benefits to retirees the situation is quite different when it comes to retirement benefits as might be expected just 23 of independent cont ractors had pension c overage through their employers compared to almost 583 of traditional workers in 200160 some 384 of freelancers had established individua l

salaries of freelancers whom the irs determined to be common law employees62 independent contractors who worked for microsoft between 1987 and 1990 then brought suit against the firm attesting th at as employees th ey should have been eligible for benefits eg group health and life insurance vacation and sick leave defined contribution 401k pension plan and stock purch ase plan the district court denied the plaintiffs claims on appeal of the decision concerning eligibility only for the 401k and stock option plans the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit held in vizcaino v microsoft corporation 97 f3d 1187 9th cir 1996 that the contractors were common law employees and therefore entitled to participate in their employers plans63 that decision was vacated and the case was reheard by the full court of appeals on the rehearing banc the court affirmed the panel decision that the workers were common law employees and that microsofts reasons for rejecting the workers participation in the two plans were invalid however the court remanded the decision about whether the wo rkers were covered by the 401k plan to the plan administrator for determination in accordance with the terms of the plan and remanded the decision as to the appr opriate remedy for excluding the workers from the stock pension plan to the district court vizcaino v microsoft corporation 120 f3d 1006 9th cir
