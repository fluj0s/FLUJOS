as yet unscheduled 2007 election in bangladesh will at least in part be referendum on the bangladesh national partys bnp government and the opposition awami leagues competing visions for bangladesh the roughly even political split between the bnp and the has given small islamist parties political voice disproportionate with their overall electoral support in the country the bnp by ruling in coalition with islamist parties has demonstrated its willingness to work with radical islamists while the has traditionally been critical of their activities the islamists position within the government has also given them new source of legitimacy1 the als signing of memorandum of understanding with the fundamentalist khelaphatemajlis party in december 2006 further indicates the rising power of small islamist parties2 the united states and britain are concerned over the rise of islamist influence and militancy in bangladesh the us department of state country reports on terrorism

to limited success by the government the report explained that endemic corruption porous borders and the governments serious institutional resource and political constraints all undermine the governments broader counter terrorism posture3 former us ambassador to bangladesh william milam is reported to have stated i fear that bangladesh might revert to its pre1991 condition in which even the peaceful transfer of power after credible elections was not possible adding this impasse has serious implications not only for bangladesh but also for the south asian region and the islamic world4 britains high commissioner anwar choudhury who was himself almost assassinated by extremists in 2004 is reported to have stated that there is serous potential for radical islam to take hold in bangladesh and that this would change the geopolitics of our engagement with islam and our efforts in countering terrorism5 counterterror efforts in november 2006 the bangladesh supreme court upheld

responsible for organizing over 400 near simultaneous explosions on aug 17 2005 despite their arrests the government is viewed as having had only limited success in dismantling jmb networks some view the governments efforts to explore possible linkages with the bnp and islamist parties as timid7 the government outlawed the jmb and the jmjb in february 2005 reportedly in policy reversal brought on by international pressure8 experts feel that their arrest and trial does not in and of itself address the prospect of quiet creeping islamisation9 the governments rapid action battalion rab has made some further moves against terrorist groups in december 2006 rab raid reportedly uncovered explosives and detonators in raid and seized additional detonators after shootout with jmb militants10 there

bangladesh based militants and terrorists14 political context bangladeshs form of moderate islam is increasingly under threat by radical elements while its political and economic development continues to be hampered by the forces of corruption radicalism and partisan fighting this was evident in the lead up to the election scheduled for january 2006 rivalry between the leaders of the nations two largest political parties has led to an ongoing series of demonstrations strikes and increasingly to politically motivated violence the frustration caused by the combination of poverty corruption and

bangladesh the bangladesh government banned bangla bhais organization in 200520 today many fear that ji has been colonizing the bnp from within the coalition21 the roots of the current political divide can be traced to the origins of the bangladesh state in 1947 when bangladesh became the eastern part of the newly independent state of pakistan at that time bangladeshs religious identity served as the basis of its political disposition despite linguistic and other divisions many islamists sided with pakistan during bangladeshs struggle for independence in 1971 bangladeshs ethnic identity then took on new prominence many who collaborated with pakistan in committing atrocities against bengalis in 1971 were members of islamist parties22 given its past use of islam for legitimacy return to power by the military could create further opportunities for islamists in bangladesh some experts see military rule as having given the islamists an opening into what is largely secular society in bangladesh bangladesh has been ruled by the military for approximately15 of the past httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22591 35 years regional expert sumit ganguly asserts that the militarys desire for legitimacy led them to wrap themselves in the mantle of islam and this created new political space for islamists in bangladesh as result they not only altered the terms of political discourse in bangladesh but also helped fashion new political culture that could accommodate shift toward more pristine austere and parochial vision of islam23 this analysis gives cause for concern that the military is thought by some as once again seeking to play political role behind the scenes by seeking to delay the 2007 elections24 former military ruler retired general hussain mohamad ershad 19821990 stated in january 2007 that the military would not intervene in the current political struggle25 violent and obstructionist political rivalry is debilitating to bangladesh former prime
