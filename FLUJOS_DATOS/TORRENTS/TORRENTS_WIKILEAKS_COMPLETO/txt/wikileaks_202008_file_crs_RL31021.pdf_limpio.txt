current issues and recent regulatory and legislative action summary in accordance with medicaid statute the secretary of health and human services hhs has established through ries of regulatory actions upper payment limits upls for inpatient and outpatient services provided by certain types of facilities in late 2000 the secr etary determined that regula tions in effect at that time created financial incentive for states to make higher than usual payments for care provided at nonstate govern ment facilities namely county and c ity facilities allowing these states to claim higher fede ral matching dollars states require these facilities to transfer some or all of the excess funds back to the state called an intergovernmental transfer or igt then st ates use these funds to cover part of the state share of medicaid costs andor fo r other purposes after hhs issued proposed rule in october of 2000 designed to halt these practices congress mandated additional changes to upper payment limits in the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa incorporated by reference into pl 106554 final regulations that included the bipa provi sions were released by the clinton administration on january 12 2001 among other changes this rule establis hed separate upls fo r inpatient services provided by local government facilities and for the subs et of local public hospitals only separate higher paym ent rate was allowed it so provided separate upl for private facilities parallel rules were established for outpatient hospital and clinic services three phaseout or transition pe riods for states with enhanced payment arrangements that were noncom pliant were also specified application of specific transition period to given state was prima rily dependent on the effective date of its plan describing the enhanced payment rrangement phaseout periods varied in duration and except for the shortest peri od required specific percentage reductions in excess payments for each transition year the bush administration made two changes to the clinton final rule 1 creation of separate minimum 1year transition period for certain states that have only recently received approval for enhanced payment arrangements and 2 elimination of the higher payment rate for nonstate public hospitals while there was legislative action in the 108th congress dealing with medicaid upl rules there has been considerable ongoing interest in how states finance the nonfederal share of medicaid cost s especially the use of igts cbo has estimated that other payments to providers largely comprised of upl dollars will total 48 billion in fy2005 representing pproximately 27 of federal medicaid spending this year the bush administration has implemented several strategies to rein in both upl and igt practices includi ng greater scrutiny of state financing methods in medicaid waiver applications and state plan amendments and new administration policy distinguishing igts that are permissible eg using state and local tax revenues from those that are impermissible eg recycling mechanisms under which payments to providers are return ed to the states additional reforms are

federalstate health progra m for low income persons services are financed jointly by the federal government and the states for each dollar of state spending the federal governme nt makes matching payment1 in the spring of 2000 newspaper re ports around the country described seemingly questionable medicaid accounting prac tices used by some states to obtain additional federal matching dollars for purposes other than providing services to medicaid beneficiaries these reports galvanized concern among some members of congress and the clinton administration about potential state financing abuses leading to series of subsequent legislative and administrative actions at issue were two interrelated factors loophole in the regulations governing upper payment limits upls and the practice of intergovernmental transfers in accordance with statutory requirements that payments for services be consistent with efficiency and economy2 the secretary established through regulation upper payment limits for different types of medicaid covere d services the regulations in effect during 2000 had been issued in 19873 for the purpose of applying the upls for inpatient or institutional care providers were divided into three primary groups inpatient hospitals iph nursing faci lities nf and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfmr within these three provider groups secondary distinction wa s made for facilities that were state owned or operated for each of the three primary provider groups iph nf and icfmr two separate upls were applie d one for overall aggregate payments to all public and private institutions in the primary group and the other for aggregate payments to state government facilities in the primary group aggregate payments to each primary group of providers iph nf and icfmr could not exceed reasonable estimate of what would have b een paid for those rvices under medicare payment principleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs2 4 section 1902a2 of the social security act 5 under the bush administration hcfas name was changed to the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms 6 us department of health and human rvices office of the inspector general review of medicaid enhanced payments to local public providers and the use of continuedfor outpatient hospital services and clinic services the 1987 regulations established single upl that applied to aggregate payments for all providers combined and these could not exceed estimates based on medicare payment principles thus with respect to applyi ng upls for outpatient care distinctions were made between primary groups of providers or groups of facilities based on ownership operation status two additional factors are important to this discussion first in the 1987 regulations there were separate inpatient or outpatient upls for other government facilities namely county or city providers sec ond both then and now states may fund up to 60 of the nonfederal shar of medicaid expenditures with local government funds4 the source of intergovernmental transfers that also played role in the state accounting practices that drew the concern of congress and both the clinton and bush administrations in part due to the newspaper reports in early 2000 the secretary determined that the 1987 regulations created financial incentive for states to provide excess payments beyond the usual payment rate to nonstateoperated government facilities eg county or city providers allowing these states to claim add itional federal matching dollars subsequen tly as part of that process states required the local government facilities to transf er all or portion of the excess funds back to the state states then used these funds to cover part of the state share of medicaid expenditures andor for other purposes although legal at that time the secretary deemed this practice to be inconsistent with the intent of the statute that medicaid payments be economical and efficient on july 26 2000 the health care financing administration hcfa5 released letter to state medicaid directors nnouncing forthcoming notice of proposed rulemaking that would close the upl loophole in the 1987 regulations and would outline transition provisions in that letter hcfa noted that excess or enhanced payments may be used for variety of purposes both healthre lated and nonhealth related in addition to financing the state share of medicaid costs some states used or planned to use the enhanced funds to cover uncompensated care or to provide communitybased services for seniors or th disabled in other cases the money was used to fill state budget gaps for state tax cuts or to reduce stat debt hcfa argued that while all these purposes may have rit medicaid funds are intended to pay only for medicaid services delivered to medicaid beneficiaries by medicaid participating providers in 2001 the office of the inspector genera l oig completed 7 audits in 6 states examining the enhanced payments under dicaid to public providers and the use of intergovernmental transfers in its report6 summarizing the findings from thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs3 6 continued intergovernmental transfers a030000216 september 2001 7 disproportionate share hospital dsh pa yments are supplemental payments made to hospitals that treat disproportionate share of uninsured and medicaid beneficiaries the intent of medicaid dsh payments is to provide financial relief to such hospitals 8 us general accounting office medicaid state financing schemes again drive up federal payments gaothehs00193 september 6 2000 9 for simplicity the example does not include state government facilities b ecause such facilities are few in number are subject to separate upl and were not the focus of the payment controversy that surfaced in 2000 audits the oig concluded 1 such paym ents were not based on the actual costs of providing services to medi caid beneficiaries nor were they directly related to improving the quality of care provided by these facilities 2 the majority of enhanced payments to public nursing facilities was returned to the states via intergovernmental transfers 3 while public hospitals kept larger portion of the enhanced payments such hospitals either did not receive medicaid disproportionate share hospital dsh7 payments or returned dsh payments to the states via intergovernmental transfers 4 some of th funds returned to states were used to cover health services but not necessarily for approved dicaid benefits and 5 the states developed mechanisms to attain federal medicaid funds without contributing their full share of required matching funds in an earlier analysis8 the general accounting office gao had drawn simila r conclusions from its investigation noting that these payment arrangements violate the integrity of the federalstate partnership under medicaid and th at states were guilty of replacing state dollars with federal dollars in the process table 1 shows an example of hypothetical payment arrangements for inpatient hospital services provided in private nd countyoperated fac ilities in hypothetical state under the 1987 rules9 the hypothetical state uses the total number of hospital days county and private combined in given month and medicare payment principles 1000 per day to determine an aggregate upper payment limit or total dollar amount for inpatient hospital servi ces the state claims federal matching funds based on this aggregate amount pr ivate hospitals are paid the usual daily medicaid rate 800 while th balance of the total calcu lated amount is allotted to county facilities which yields much higher average daily payment rate 2800 thus the state has established two di fferent payment rates for two different ownership categories of hospitals so that when all payments are combined the upper payment limit for inpatient hospital services is not exceeded the next step in the example involves th return of funds to the state through an intergovernmental transfer from the count facilities in this example the county providers return all excess do llars beyond the usual payment rate back to the state how do private facilities contribute to enhanced payment arrangements states cannot require private facilities to transfer excess payments back to the state thus there is little incentive to provide enhanced payments to these providers however as shown in table 1 because private facilities add si gnificantly to the total number of hospital days in termining the upper payment boundary using medicarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs4 10 66 federal register pp 31483177 jan 12 2001 on january 20 2001 the bush administration released an agency notice delayi ng by 60 days implementation of final rules issued near the end of the clinton administ ration the purpose of the delay was to allow for regulatory review by the bush administration because bipa required that the final medicaid upl rule be issued by the end of cy 2000 this rule was allowed to go into effect on its original effective date of march 13 2001 11 technically the rule imposed the new upl on all other governmentowned or operated facilities that is all nonstate government owned or operated facilities however indian health services facilities and tribal facilities are not subject to this new upl in addition dsh payments are not counted toward the uplspayment principles especially when th states recognized medicaid payment for care is lower than medicares they are crucial to the overall aggregation process in this example the state gains 200000 in enhanced payments through an intergovernmental transfer from the county f acilities and in this process has reduced its own share of total medicaid costs for acute inpatient care delivered in 1 month changes to upper payment limits 2000 forward tables 2 and 3 summarize key components of the series of regulatory and legislative changes made to the 1987 ru governing upper payment limits since 2000 table 2 describes upl modifications for inpatient or institutional care table 3 describes upl modifications for outpatient hospital and clin ic services in general to establish consistency changes made over time with respect to inpatient services were replicated for outpatient care the clinton administration issued proposed rule on medicaid upls in october of 2000 in december of 2000 the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa incorporated by referen ce into pl 106554 required that the final rule include separate upls for local government facilities thus the january 12 2001 final rule10 established new upls fo r city and county facilities11 and separate upls specific to privately owned and operated facilities thereby eliminating the overall aggregate upls that had previ ously applied to all public and private facilities within each primary group in this final rule hcfa clarified that these regulations apply only to feeforser vice medicaid payments managed care payments are subject to different regulations in terms of allowed payment amounts to f acilities the final rule issued by the clinton administration established an excep tion for payments covering inpatient and outpatient services provided by nonstateowned or ope rated public hospitals this exception allowed states to pay city and county public hospitals up to 150 of the medicare payment rate for such services hcfa justified this exception because these facilities provide access to wide ra nge of needed care not often otherwise available in underserved areas deliver significant proportion of uncompensated care and are critically depe ndent on public funding sources such as medicaid the january 12 2001 final rule also required th at payments to city and county public hospitals be separately identified and reported to hcfa such reporting was intended to ensure both that the higher paym ents were appropriate and that they were being fully retained by these facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs5 12 67 federal register pp 26022611 jan 18 2002 13 originally the effective date of this bush administration final rule was march 19 2002 on march 19 2002 cms announced delay of the effective date of this final rule to april 15 2002 67 federal register p 12479 the text of this notice does not provide reason for the delay however cms officials indica ted that the delay was undertaken in light of both pending litigation to halt the rule change and concerns regarding compliance with the congressional review act cra the cra stipulates that the effective date for major rule such as this bush administration final ru cannot be sooner than 60 days after the rule is published in the federal register or report is submitted to congress whichever is later on april 10 2002 during opening arguments in th is lawsuit the federal district court in arkansas ruled that since the senate did not receive the rule until march 15 2 002 the earliest permissible effective date was ma 14 2002 in press release cms announced continuedtable 4 provides an example of how the clin ton final rule substantially altered the methodology states may use to claim fe deral matching dolla rs and the resulting reduction in excess payments states may obt ain through intergovernmental transfers from city and c ounty facilities table 4 carries over the basic underlying assumptions defined in table 1 that is the total number of hospital days the split in hospital days between private and c ounty fac ilities and the basic medicare and medicaid payment rates are identical in the two tables there are two significant differences between table 1 1987 final rule and table 4 clinton final rule first under th 1987 final rule states could combine hospitalizations in public and private f acilities in calculating amounts to claim for federal matching once private facilities were paid the usual medicaid rate and all remaining funds were distributed to count facilities an interg overnmental transfer of the excess dollars exceeding the usual medicaid payment rate resulted in net gain of 2000 00 to the state in contrast under the clinton final rule states must treat private and county fac ilities separately in claiming federal matching dollars which substantially reduces the amount of federal funds ava ilable to pay county hospitals and to subsequently tr ansfer back to the state the second significant difference between tables 1 and 4 is the medicare payment rate used to set the upl unde r the 1987 rule states were allowed to pay all providers regardless of ownership up to 100 of the medicare payment rate under the clinton final rule states we re permitted to pay city and county public hospitals up to 150 of the medicare paymen t rate all other pr oviders were subject to the 100 rule despite the higher pa yment rate for local government facilities considerable savings were s till achieved under the clinton final rule in this example private facilities were paid the usual medicaid rate and federal matching funds were claimed accordingly among county public hospitals claim fo r federal matching dollars was based on the higher upl rate and these facilities were paid based on these calculations an intergovernmental transfer from the county hospitals of the excess dollars exceeding the usual medicaid payment rate resulted in net gain of 70000 to the state in new final rule published on january 18 200212 the bush administration eliminated the higher payment rate for c ity and county public hospitals beginning on may 15 200213 states may pay city and count public hospitals only up to 100httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs6 13 continued that the rule would go into effect on may 15 2002 14 in late december 2001 the oig issued an audit report recommending that the upcoming increase in dsh reimbursements may not be warra nted or should at leas t be studied further before implementation the oig noted that dsh payments are not always retained by public hospitals and the dsh funds received ar not always calculated correctly for more information see us oig reviews indicate that an increa in medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments to 175 percent of uncompensated care cost may not be warranted a060100069 december 2001of the medicare payment rate this rule also eliminated the reporting requirement applicable to all states making enha nced payments to city and county public hospitals the new rule retained the re quirement that states qualifying for transition period see below report nnually to cms actual facilityspecific payments made to all facilities and estimates of what medicare payments would have been to those facilities cmss rationale for the upl change was based on four consid erations first cms argued that the 100 upl is more than sufficient to ensure access for medicaid beneficiaries to such facilities moreover states retain the flexibility to pay such hospitals enhanced payments up to the medicare payment rate as long as the upl is maintained in the aggregate s econd the higher payments allowed under the january 12 2001 rule were not necessarily benefitting thes hospitals to the fullest possible extent as evidenced by the oig findings summarized above in that analysis public hospitals were transferring excess upl payments back to states or when these hospitals were allowed to retain portion of such payments they either were not receiving any dsh payments or were being required to transfer their dsh dollars back to the states thus the net gain for these hospitals was minimized third many city and county public hosp itals do qualify for dsh payments and bipa increased the hospitalspecific dsh limits up to 175 of hospitals reasonable costs for two stat fiscal years beginning in federal fiscal year 200314 so additional funding could be provided through this mechanism finally cms wanted to restore payment equ ity across all providers table 5 provides an example of how the bush final rule reduced funding available to city and c ounty public hospitals and further reduced the amounts available for intergovernmental transfers from these facilities back to states again the basic underlying assumptions are identical across all three tables in this report with respect to tables 4 and 5 illustrating the clinton and bush final rules respectively calculations for private facilities are identical that is private facilities were paid the usual medicaid rate and federal matching f unds were claimed accordingly because the bush final rule allows local government hospitals to be paid up to 100 of the medicare payment rate rather than 150 under the clinton final rule additional saving s are achieved an intergovernmental transfer from the county hospitals of the excess dollars exceeding the usual medicaid payment rate resulted in net gain of 20000 to the state in late 2001 some members of congress expressed oppos ition to this new rule two bills were introduced hr 3360 and s 1745 seeking to delay until at leasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs7 january 1 2003 any changes in medicaid re gulations that would modify the rule allowing payments of up to 150 of the medicare payment rate to city and county public hospitals both bills would have also required the secretary of hhs to submit report to congress at least 3 months prior to publication of any such rule describing plan to mitigate the loss of f unding to these facilities as result of new regulations and also providing recommenda tions for legislative action as deemed appropriate finally in early 2002 senate amendmen t was added to and later withdrawn from hr 622 the temporar extended unemployment compensation act of 2002 that would have delayed til at least june 30 2002 any re gulatory changes to the upl rule affecting city nd county public hospitals further action has been taken to date transition periods for achieving full compliance with new rules while the creation of new upls by facility type was expected to result in significant savings in federal medicaid spending see discussion below at the time of these rule changes federal policymaker s considered the impact of these regulatory changes on state budget planning instead of requiring full compliance with the latest upl rules immediately some states qualified for one of several transition periods that allow phase out of excess payments over specified length of time beyond the effective date of the applicable rule table 6 summarizes the key components of these transition periods as defined in the final rule issued by the clinton administration which incorporated bi pa requirements and the changes subsequently made by the bush administration most of the transition period provisions were defined in the january 12 2001 clinton administration final rule the goal of this rule was to provide phaseout period commensurate with the length of time states had relied on the additional federal funds gained through using enha nced payment arrangements that were curtailed states with shortterm reliance on these arrangements were required to phase out excess payments relatively quickly states that have relied on enhanced payment arrangements for number of year s were allowed re latively long period of time in which to phase out excess payments other states fell in the middle one feature is common to all transition period rules state fiscal year sfy 2000 is the base period for determining th amount of excess payments ie the difference between payments made under enhanced arrangements and amounts that would result from application of the ne w upls that must be phased out the january 12 2001 final rule created three trans ition groups w ith short medium and long phaseout periods see table 6 for these details the shortest transition group consisted of states with pproved plans effective on or after october 1 1999 for such payment plans the phase out period formally began on march 13 2001 the effective date of the ru and ended on september 30 2002 the second transition group consisted of those states with approved plans effective after october 1 1992 and befo re october 1 1999 for this group thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs8 15 in 46 states the state fiscal year runs from ju ly to june in new york the state fiscal year begins in april and ends in march in texas the state fiscal year is september to august among these 48 states the first state fiscal year that began after september 30 2002 was sfy2004 finally in alabama and michigan the stat fiscal year is the same as the federal

that such plans should be reviewed under the upl rules in place prior to march 13 2001 and not under the provisions of the january 12 2001 final rule 18 shortly after the september 5 2001 final rule was published the gao issued report continuedphaseout period formally be gan in sfy2003 aggregate payments for the specified provider groups must be reduced to the pplicable upl in increments over 3 years ie 25 reduction in the first year 50 in the second year and 75 in the third year leading to full compliance with the upl by the end of the fourth year sfy2006 finally the third transition group defined in bipa and incorporated into the january 12 2001 final rule includes states w ith approved plans effective on or before october 1 1992 for these states with the longest reliance on th additional federal dollars associated with such payment rrangements the phaseout period began with the first state fis cal year that started after september 30 2002 either sfy2003 or sfy200415 and ends on september 30 2008 rega rdless of the starting point all such states must be in compliance with the applicable upl by october 1 2008 the beginning of federal fiscal year ffy 2009 bipa also specified the schedule of percentage reductions in excess paymen ts incorporated into the january 12 2001 final rule such excess payments must be reduced by 15 increments over each of six consecutive periods full sfys for the firs t five periods and partial sfy for the sixth period the final 10 reduction occurs at the end of the transition period such that full compliance with the fina l upl is achieved by october 1 2008 on september 5 2001 the bush administration issued final rule16 that amended the transition period provisions in the january 12 2001 final rule the main purpose of the september 5 2001 rule was to specify new phaseout period for certain states that had enhanced paym ent plans that were pending hcfa approval as of the effective date of the prior final rule ie march 13 200117 specifically this rule divided states previously subject to the shortest transition period those with plans effective on or after october 1 1999 into two subgroups the subgroup of states that received plan approval before january 22 2001 the first business day of the new bush administration qualified for the original transition period ending on september 30 2002 the remaining states that had submitted payment plans before march 13 2001 but received plan pproval on or after january 22 2001 were required to eliminate excess payments above the upl by november 5 2001 the effective date of this rule or by one year from the effective date of the plan whichever is later at the time this rule was issued four states fell into this latter group florida michigan wisconsin and virginia cms indicated that this rule ensured that these 4 states had at least one full year to implement their enhanced payment plans18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs9 18 continued criticizing the approval of upl plans in these four states in that report gao claimed that the bush administration had reversed an ea rlier decision to deny approval of pending amendments that did not comply with the clinton final rule both cms and the states involved defended these approvals arguing that gao was improperly singling out certain states and officials for criticism cms furthe r noted that key administration officials with prior ties to virginia and wisconsin had recuse d themselves from the approval process for further details see us gao medicaid hcfa reversed its position and approved additional state financing schemes gao02147 october 2001while the january 18 2002 rule issued by the bush administration did not alter transition period provisions of the two prior fi nal rules this rule clarified that some states with enhanced payment arrangements for city and county public hospitals that exceed the newest upl would not qualify fo r transition period under the january 12 2001 final rule states qualified for tr ansition period if they met two criteria 1 payments to city and county public hospitals exceeded 150 of the medicare payment rate or for all other providers within primary group payments exceeded 100 of the medicare payment rate and 2 the date of pprovaleffectiveness for such payment plan fell within the parameters specified in the rule see table 6 for details in the case of city and county pub lic hospitals such states had until the end of the applicable transition period to redu ce payments to 150 of the upl plans that allowed payments up to 150 of the upl were in compliance with the january 12 2001 rule and so payment reductions were required and transition period applied however the new january 18 2002 fi nal rule lowered the upl for city and county public hospitals from 150 to 100 of medicare payment rates thus state plans approved under the prior january 12 2001 rule that paid such hospitals greater than 100 and up to 150 of the upl d to reduce such payments to 100 of medicare payment rates by may 15 2002 such state plans if any did not qualify for any of the previously defined transition periods because they did not meet both criteria outlined above as of january 2004 preliminary data fro m cms indicated that 23 states had upl payment plans that did or may qualify for transition period five of these states had more than one such payment plan eg one applying to inpatient hospital services and another applying to nursing facility care of the 29 payment plans identified by cms 18 were for nursing facility care 7 were for inpatient hospital services and 4 applied to out patient hospital services twelve plans were expected to qualify for the shortest transition periods which have now expired eleven plans were expected to qualify for the transition period that terminates at the end of sfy2006 and finally 6 plans were expected to qualify for the longest transition period ending on october 1 2008 what about intergovernmental transfers in its october 10 2000 proposed rule hc fa gave two reasons for not making policy change to intergovernmental transfers that can be used to finance up to 60 of the nonfederal portion of medicaid ex penditures first hcfa acknowledged that states and local governments have developed unique arrangements for sharing medicaid costs second ther are statutory restrictions on the secretarys authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs10 19 section 1903w6 of the social security act 20 the upl provisions in hr 5661 for which cbo provided its preliminary budget estimate were substantively identical to t hose contained in the conference agreement that eventually became incorporated by reference into pl 106554 21 both subcommittee on health hearings were entitled intergovernmental transfers violations of the federalst ate medicaid partnership or legitimate state budget tool and continuedto limit intergovernmental transfers19 thus such changes are included in any of the final upl rules issued to date early estimates of the costs and savings associated with changes to upl rules at the time that the clinton final rule was issued in january 2001 hcfa had identified 29 states with pproved or pending enhanced payment plans that would involve city and county f acilities going beyond the fy2001 budget baseline hcfa projected that the federal share of enha nced payments to city and county fac ilities may reach 10 billion per year by fy2006 nd over the next 10 years cumulative spending for such payments could total mo re than 90 billion in developing these projections hcfa assumed that in the ab sence of the final rule about onehalf of the remaining 21 states would eventually submit plans to institute similar enhanced payment arrangements hcfa estimated th at about twothirds of the enhanced payments would exceed the upls established in the final rule yielding potential savings of nearly 55 billion over the next 10 years in preliminary estimate of an earlier version of bipa20 cbo indicated that the upl provisions would result in considerab ly greater savings of 767 billion over the 10year period ending with fy2010 215 billion for fy2001 through fy2005 savings were accelerated in the second half of the 10year period as the phaseout or transition periods expire finally the bush administration projected further savings associated with its two final rules that amended medicaid uppe r payment limits first savings of 05 billion for fy2001 and fy2002 was estimated for the september 5 2001 final rule that created separate minimum 1year transition period for certain states that received approval for enhanced paymen t arrangements after january 22 2001 second elimination of the higher payment rate for city and county public hospitals was expected to save 9 billion over fy2002 through fy2006 current issues for the 109th congress while there was further legislative action in the 108th congress dealing with medicaid upl rules there was still considerable ongoing interest in how states finance the nonfederal share of medicaid costs especially the use of intergovernmental transfers in early 2004 the subcommittee on health of the house energy and commerce committee held two hearings on this issue as did the house budget committee21 in january 2005 house energy and commercehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs11 21 continued were held on

by those hospitals22 in addition gao published another report on upl practices across states and cms efforts to improve oversight noting that although both congress and cms have narrowed the upl loophole it has not been eliminated23 because changes have been made to the medicaid upl standard which remains tied to the medicare payment rate nor to federal statute or regulations governing igts to date cms has not released an offi cial count of all currently active upl payment plans at the conclusion of th eir transition periods the 29 payment plans described above may continue to be in effect but at minimum must be in full compliance with the current upl rules medicaid program administrative data available at the federal level do not include the detail necessary to determine accurately the amount of upl payments across states since 2001 in its medicai d baseline estimates cbo has included projected spending for other payments to providers which is largely comprised of upl dollars the impact of the upl changes described in this report is evident in cbos spending projections such paym ents were projected to grow from 39 billion in fy2000 to 74 billion in fy2002 roughly 5 of federal medicaid payments in that year beginning in fy2003 other payments to providers were expected to fall to 60 billion with furt her reductions to 52 billion and 48 billion in fy2004 and fy2005 respectively repres enting about 27 of federal medicaid payments in fy2005 projections throug h fy2009 show additional drops in other payments to providers the bush administration has proposed othe r strategies to rein in upl and igt practices for example the president s fy2005 budget proposal included plan to cap medicaid reimbursements to governmentoperated provide rs to more than the cost of medicaid services and to restrict the use of certain igts with estimated savings of 15 billion in fy05 and 96 billion ove r 5 years in its analysis of the presidents budget24 cbo elected not to estimate sa vings from these proposals since the administration did not provide specifi c details about how the proposed changes to medicaid would achieve savings httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs12

mcclellan administra tor of cms from the national association of public hospitals and health systems dated june 9 2004administration officials have taken some steps to curb what they have identified as improper state financing mechanisms in late 2003 cms began requesting detailed information regardin g sources of the state shar of medicaid funding from states applying for medicaid waivers and submitting medicaid state plan amendments subsequently in early january of 2004 the administration announced via federal register notice proposed ch ange to required state budget reporting form cms37 that would have allowe d cms to obtain upfront information on states proposed financing components for their medicaid programs before state budgets were dopted the purpose of the reporting change was to identify and resolve potential funding and expenditure i ssues early on thus avoiding subsequent recoupment of federal medicai d payments deemed inappr opriate after number of publicized complaints from states about th proposed change and an inadvertent oneday comment period in february of 2004 the secretary of hhs announced that cms would not move forward with its planned reporting form revision until consultation with states had been completed and that when new proposed regulations are published states w ould have 60day comment period also in early 2004 via letters exchanged with senator grassley the cms administrator described the agencys cu rrent policy regarding permissible and impermissible igts in the medicaid program cms identified true protected igt as one in which the state share of medicaid costs is comprised of state and local tax revenues or certified public expenditures cpes25 in other words only units of state or local governments can make protected igts or cpes furthermore igts must be derived from state or local tax revenues in order for health care provider to make protected igtcpe it must have access to state or local tax revenues ie must either have direct ta xing authority or must be able to access funding as an integral part of the governmental unit w ith taxing authority an unprotected igt was defined as an igt that uses recy cling mechanisms under which payments to providers for services are returned to the st ate in this case the recycling process shifts the cost of medicaid from statelocal governments to the federal government thus increasing the federal matching rate as in the examples provided in tables 1 4 and 5 of this report others outside of cms26 have questioned the agency s narrow interpretation of medicaid statute and regulations on igts and cpes and the agencys authority to change its policy without legislative or regulatory action these groups are concerned that some perhaps many providers identified as public agencies by states in the past may not meet the cms definition of an entity that can make protected igts or cpes eg hospitals on public property that were formerly owned and operated by city or count governments but that are now quasi or fully independent these groups are also c oncerned that the limitations on igts andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31021crs13 cpes now being imposed by cms will require some states to cut back on eligibility benefits andor provi der payments to offset the loss of now impermissible igts and cpes that formerly made up part of states share of medicaid expenditures in the coming months congress and the administration are likely to discuss medicaid reform as one mech anism for reducing the federal deficit the shape of that reform is yet to be determined but it is anticipated that restructuring medicaid will be part of the presidents fy2006 b udget proposal to be released in early february modifications to the methods st ates currently employ to finance the non
