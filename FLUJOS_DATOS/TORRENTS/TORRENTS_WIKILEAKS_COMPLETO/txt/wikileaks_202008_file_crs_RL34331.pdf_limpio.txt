and their vulnerability to deliberate acts of terrorism was elevated to national security concern following the events of september 11 2001 title vi of the energy policy act of 2005 regarding nuclear security amended the atomic energy act with the addition of new provisions for security evaluations and rulemaking to revise the design basis threat the act included provisions for fingerprinting and criminal background checks of security personnel their use of firearms and the unauthorized introduction of dangerous weapons the designation of facilities subject to enforcement of penalties for sabotage expanded to include treatment and disposal facilities as part of security response evaluations the act requires the nuclear regulatory commission nrc to conduct forceonforce security exercises at nuclear power plants at least once every three years and revise the designbasis threat to consider wider variety of potential attacks the nrc has strengthened its regulations on nuclear power plant security but critics contend that implementation by the industry has been too slow and that further measures are needed vulnerability to deliberate aircraft crash remains an outstanding

ctly endanger public health and safety through exposure to radiation out of cold war concerns the nuclear regulatory commission nrc in 1967 instituted provision that nuclear plants are not required to protect against an attack directed by an enemy of the united states1 this principle was reflected in the initial design basis threat dbt in the late 1970s describing potential attacks that nuclear plants must prepare for including the number of attackers th eir training and the weapons and tactics they are capable of employing following the september 11 2001 attacks on the pentagon and the world trade center the nuclear regulatory commission nrc began toptobottom review of its nuclear power plant security requirements on february 25 2002 the agency issued interim compensatory security measures to deal with the generalized highlevel threat environment that continued to exist and on january 7 2003 it issued regulatory orders that tightened nuclear plant access on april 29 2003 nrc issued three orders to restrict security officer work hours establish new security force training and qualification requirements and increase the dbt that nuclear security forces must be able to defend against in the energy policy act of 2005 epact congress imposed statutory requirement on the nrc to initiate rulemaking for revising the design basis threat 2 the dbt classified document describes general characteristics of adversaries that nuclear plants and nuclear fuel cycle facilities must defend against including radiological sabotage and theft of strategic special nuclear material epact required nrc to consider 12 factors in revising the dbt including but not limited to an assessment of various terrorist threats sizable explosive devices and modern weapons attacks by persons with sophisticated knowledge of facility operations and attacks on spent fuel shipments critics of nrcs security measures had demanded both shortterm regulatory changes and legislative reforms fundamental concern was the nature of the dbt which critics contended should be increased to include number of separate coordinated attacks in revising the dbt in 2003 the nrc indicated that private security force employed by nuclear power plant cannot reasonably be expected to defend against all threatsfor example airborne attacks the prospect of highjacked airliner repeating 911like airborne attack on nuclear power plant continues to draw concern critics also pointed out that licensees are required to employ only minimum of five security personnel on duty per plant which they argue is not enough for the job 3 nuclear spokespersons responded that the actual security force for the nations 65 nuclear plant sites numbers more than 1 it was feared that cuba might launch an attack on florida

materials required all nrclicensed commercial nuclear power plants to have series of physical barriers and trained security force the plant sites were divided into three zones an ownercontrolled buffer region protected area and vital area access to the protected area was restricted to portion of plant employees and monitored visitors with stringent access barriers the vital area was further restricted with additional barriers and access requirements the security force had to comply with nrc requirements on prehiring investigations and training 4 the nrc proposed to amend the security regulations and add new security requirements that would codify the series of four orders supplementing the dbt issued after 9115 one of nrcs regulatory orders april 2003 changed the dbt to represent the largest reasonable threat against which regulated private guard force should be expected to defend under existing law according to the nrc announcement6 nrc approved its final rule amending the dbt 10 cfr part 731 on january 29 20077 as directed by the energy policy act the final rule imposed the security requirements of the april 2003 order making the dbt orders generically applicable

plant site through security plans safeguards contingency plans and guard training and qualification plans although specific details of the revised dbt were not released to the public in general the final rule clarifies that physical protection systems are required to protect against diversion and theft of fissile material expands the assumed capabilities of adversaries to operate as one or more

mode of attack from adversaries coordinating vehicle bomb assault with another external assault in 2006 the government accountability office gao reviewed the upgrades in nuclear plant security and found generally logical and welldefined process8 gao found nrc staff trained in threat assessment who monitor information provid ed by intelligence agencies and screen the information to evaluate particular terrorist capabilities for inclusion in the dbt however the nrc produced revised dbt that generally but not always corresponded to the threat assessment staffs original recommendations the dbt final rule excluded aircraft attacks which raised considerable controversy in approving the rule nrc rejected petition from the union of concerned scientists to require that nuclear plants be surrounded by aircraft barriers made of steel beams and cables the socalled beamhenge concept critics of the rule charged that deliberate aircraft crashes were highly plausible mode of attack given the events of 911 however nrc contended that power plants were already required to mitigate the effects of aircraft crashes and that active protection against airborne threats is addressed by other federal organizations including the military 9 additional nrc action on aircraft threats is discussed below

years to test its ability to defend against the design basis threat in these forceonforce exercises monitored by nrc an adversary force from outside the plant attempts to penetrate the plants vital area and damage or destroy key safety components participants in the tightly controlled exercises carry weapons modified to fire only blanks and laser bursts to simulate bullets and they wear laser sensors to indicate hits other weapons and explosives as well as destruction or breaching of physical security barriers may also be simulated while one squad of the plants guard force is participating in forceonforce exercise another squad is also on duty to maintain normal plant security plant defenders know that mock attack will take place sometime during specific period of several hours but they do not know what the attack scenario will be multiple attack scenarios are conducted over several days of exercises in response to the growing emphasis on security nrc established the office of nuclear security and incident response on april 7 2002 the offi ce centralizes security oversight of all nrc regulated facilities coordinates with law enforcement and intelligence agencies and handles emergency planning activities forceonforce exercises are an example of the offices responsibilities full implementation of the forceonforce program began in late 2004 standard procedures and other requirements have been developed for using the forceonforce exercises to evaluate plant security and as basis for taking regulatory enforcement action many tradeoffs are necessary to make the exercises as realistic and consistent as possible without endangering participants or regular plant operations and security 8 gao06388 9 nrc nrc approves final rule amending security requirements news

the nuclear industry to develop and train composite adversary force comprising security officers from many plants to simulate terrorist attacks in the forceonforce exercises however in september 2004 testimony gao criticized the industrys selection of security company that guards about half of us nuclear plants wackenhut to also provide the adversary force in addition to raising questions about the forces independence gao noted that wackenhut had been accused of cheating on previous forceonforce exercises by the department of energy 10 exelon terminated its security contracts with wackenhut

accident at the three mile island nuclear plant near harrisburg pa congress required that all nuclear power plants be covered by emergency plans nrc requires that within an approximately 10mile emergency planning z one epz around each plant the operator must maintain warning sirens and regularly conduct evacuation exercises monitored by nrc and the federal emergency management agency fema in light of the increased possibility of terrorist attacks that if successful could result in release of radioactive material critics have renewed calls for expanding the epz to include larger population centers the release of radioactive iodine during nuclear incident is particular concern because iodine tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland of persons exposed to it emergency plans in many states include distribution of iodine pills to the popu lation within the epz taking nonradioactive iodine before exposure would prevent absorption of radioactive iodine but would afford protection against other radioactive elements in 2002 nrc began providing iodine pills to states requesting them for populations within the 10mile epz

reaction and assuring that the reactor core does not lose its coolant and melt down from the heat produced by the radioactive fission products within the fuel rods us plants are designed and built to prevent dispersal of radioactivity in the event of an accident by surrounding the reactor in steelreinforced concrete containment structure which represents an intrinsic safety feature two major accidents have taken place in power reactors at three mile island tmi in 1979 and at chernobyl in the soviet union in 1986 although both accidents resulted from combination of operator error and design flaws tmis containment structure effectively prevented major release of radioactivity from fuel meltdown caused by the loss of coolant in the chernobyl accident the reactors protective barriers

extreme events but deliberate attacks by large airliners load ed with fuel such as those that crashed into the world trade center and pentagon were not an alyzed when design requirements for todays reactors were determined12 taped interview shown september 10 2002 on arab tv station jazeera which contained statement that qaeda initially planned to include nuclear plant in its list of 2001 attack sites intensified concern about aircraft crashes in light of the possibility that an air attack might penetrate the containment building of nuclear plant some interest groups have suggested that such an event could be followed by meltdown and widespread radiation exposure nuclear industry spokespersons have countered by pointing out that relatively small lowlying nuclear power plants are difficult targets for attack and have argued that penetration of the containment is unlikely and that even if such penetration occurred it probably would not reach the reactor vessel they suggest that sustained fire such as that which melted the steel support structures in the world trade center buildings would be impossible unless an attacking plane penetrated the containment completely including its fuel bearing wings according to former nrc chairman nils diaz nrc studies confirm that the likelihood of both damaging the reactor core and releasing radioactivity that could affect public health and safety is low 13 nrc proposes to amend its regulations with new rule that would require newly designed power reactor facilities to take into account the potential effects of the impact of large commercial aircraft14 the proposed rule would only affect new reactor designs not previously certified by nrc15 westinghouse submitted changes in the design of its ap1000 reactor to nrc on may 29 2007

concern has been raised about the vulnerability of spent fuel to attack by aircraft or other means if terrorists could breach spent fuel pools 12 meserve richard nrc chairman research strengthening

terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools though difficult are possible and that if an attack leads to propagating zirconium cladding fire it could result in the release of large amounts of radioactive material nas recommended that the hottest spent fuel be interspersed with cooler spent fuel to reduce the likelihood of fire and that waterspray systems be installed to cool spent fuel if pool water were lost the report also called for nrc to conduct more analysis of the issue and consider earlier movement of spent fuel from pools into dry storage 17 the fy2006 energy and water development appropriations act pl 109103 hrept 109275 provided 21 million for nrc to carry out the sitespecific analyses recommended by nas nrc has long contended that the potential effects of terrorist attacks are too speculative to include in environmental studies for proposed spent fuel storage and other nuclear facilities however the us court of appeals for the 9th circuit ruled in june 2006 that terrorist attacks must be included in the environmental study of dry storage facility at californias diablo canyon nuclear plant nrc reissued the diablo canyon study may 29 2007 to comply with the court ruling but it did not include terrorism in other recent environmental studies18

officers at the peach bottom pa nuclear power plant were aired on local television an nrc inspection in late september 2007 confirmed that there had been multiple occasions on which multiple security officers were inattentive 19 however after followup inspection into security issues at the peach bottom plant the nrc concluded that the plants security program had not been significantly degraded as result of the guards inattentiveness nrc issued bulletin december 12 2007 requiring all nuclear power plants to provide written descriptions of their managerial controls to deter and address inattentiveness and complicity among licensee security personnel the house committee on energy and commerce announced january 7 2008 that it would conduct comprehensive review of the nrcs oversight operations 20 the nrcs stunning failure to act on credible allegations of sleeping security guards coupled with its unwillingness to protect the whistleblower who uncovered the problem raises
