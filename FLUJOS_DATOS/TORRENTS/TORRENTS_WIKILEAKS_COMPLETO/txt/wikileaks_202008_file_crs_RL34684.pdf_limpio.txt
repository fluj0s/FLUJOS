recalls during 2007 par ticularly of toys and other products used by children has focused attention on the consumer product safety commission cpsc pl 110 314 122 stat 3016 2008 the consumer product safety impr ovement act of 2008 cpsia was enacted as result of congresss consideration of major reform legislation to address organizational and systemic deficiencies as well as specific consumer product defect s and hazards this report provides an overview of the prior aut hority of the cpsc to establish consumer product safety standards and to inspect r ecall and restrict importation of unsafe consumer products and summarizes change s made by the cpsia to reform the cpsc and strengthen enforcement of consumer product safety standards the consumer product safety ac t cpsa 15 usc 2051 et seq established and authorized the cpsc in 1972 in response to growing concerns about protecting the public from unsafe defectiv consumer products however in the years since its establishment the staff and resources of the cpsc have been considerably reduced to the detriment of its ability to fulfill its mission effectively aside from the issue of adequacy of resources the highly publicized recalls of childrens toys in 2007 focused attention on alleged weaknesses in the cpsa and the authority of the cpsc to establish consum er product safety sta ndards and to inspect recall domestically and block impor ts of unsafe consumer products the cpsc is the central federal authority for the promotion and enforcement of consumer product safety the system is designed to be collaborative effort among the cpsc the industries producing the broad range of consumer products and the consuming public the cpsc research and promotes best practices for the industries producing guidelines for manuf acturers importers distributors and retailers although the cpsa authoriz the cpsc to promulgate mandatory consumer product safety standards it mandates reliance upon voluntary standards whenever compliance with voluntary standards would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury and substantial compliance with voluntary standards is likely besides the cpsa the cpsc also admin isters several other statutes whose authorities and functions were transferred to the cpsc upon its creation the federal hazardous substances act fhsa 15 usc 1261 et seq provides for warninginformational labeling of hazar dous substances and for the banning of certain hazardous substances for whic h labeling would not provide adequate protection for the public against the potentia l hazards posed by the substances thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34684crs2 1 cpsa 3 codified at 15 usc 2052 2 state agencies have jurisdiction over fixed rides that are located in park in their continuedflammable fabrics act ffa 15 us c 1191 et seq provides for the establishment of safety standards regarding fabric flammability it also prohibits the manufacture sale im portation transportati on or delivery in commerce of product fabric or related material or of produc t made of fabric or related material that does not comply with the standards and deems that such practices constitute unfair methods of competition and unfair and decep tive acts or practices under the federal trade commission act the poison prevention packaging act pppa 15 usc 1471 et seq authorizes the cpsc to blish special packaging standards for household substance if such standards ar required to protect children from serious injury or illness from using handling or ingesting such substance with exceptions for noncomplying packages for elderlyhandicapped pers ons and packaging at the direction of licensed medical practitioner the refrigerator safety act rsa15 usc 1211 prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any household refrigerator that does not conform with certain safety standards prior to amendment by the cpsia some of these statutes provided for powers that were similar but not identical to t hose established under the cpsa therefore the regulatory procedures and other actions which the cpsc is authorized to carry out with regard to the products regulated under these other statut differed and may still differ in some respects from those authorized under the cpsa before the cpsia the cpsc could choose to regula under the cpsa consumer product that could be regulated sufficiently under these ot her statutes only if the cpsc determined that it was in the public interest to do so the differences among the different statutory standards and pr ocedures and enforcement authority arguably led to inconsistency in the enforcement of di fferent product standards for example injunctive enforcement authority for states attorneys general is expressly provided by the fhsa and the ffa but was not ex pressly provided by the cpsa before amendment by the cpsia the apparent am biguity of the cpsa on this point led to amendments in the cpsia to provide express authority the cpsc has the authority to establis h consumer product sa fety standards for consumer products generally defined as any article or component part thereof produced or distributed i fo r sale to consumer for use in or around permanent or temporary household or resi dence school in recreation or otherwise or ii for the personal use consumption or enjoymen t of consumer in or around permanent or temporary household or

general author ity of the cpsc over inspections recalls and import bans for consumer products generally with the exceptions noted above unless other statutes provide other agencies with aut hority
