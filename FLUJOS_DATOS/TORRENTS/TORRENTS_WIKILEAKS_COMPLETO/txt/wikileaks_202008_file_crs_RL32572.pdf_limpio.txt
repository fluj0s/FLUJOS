weapons summary during the cold war the united st ates and soviet union both deployed thousands of nonstrategic nuc lear weapons that were inte nded to be used in support of troops in the field during conflict these included nuclear mines artillery short medium and longrange ballistic missiles cruise missiles and gravity bombs in contrast with the longerrange str ategic nuclear weapons these wea pons had lower profile in policy deba tes and arms control negotia tions at the end of the 1980s before the demise of the soviet uni on each nation still had thousands of these weapons deployed with their troops in the field aboard naval ve ssels and on aircraft in 1991 both the united states and sovi et union announced that they would withdraw most and eliminate many of th eir nonstrategic nuclear weapons the united states now retains approximately 1100 nonstrateg ic nuclear weapons with few hundred deployed with aircraft in europe and the remaining stored in the united states estimates vary but expert s believe russia still has between 3000 and 8000 warheads for nonstrategic nuclear weapons in its arsenal the bush administration has not announced any furthe r reductions in us nonstrategic nuclear weapons to the contrary it has indicated that nuclear weapons remain essential to us national security interests in addition russia has increased its reliance on nuclear weapons in its nationa l security concept some analysts argue that russia has backed away from its commitments from 1991 and may develop and deploy new types of nonstrategic nuclear weapons analysts have identified number of i ssues with the continued deployment of us and russian nonstrategic nuclear wea pons these include questions about the safety and security of russi as weapons and the possibility that some might be lost stolen or sold to another nation or group questions about the role of these weapons in us and russian security policy and the likelihood that either nation might use these weapons in regional contingency with nonnuclear nation questions about the role that these weapons play in nat policy and whether there is continuing need for the united states to deploy th weapons at bases overseas and questions about the relationship between nonstr ategic nuclear weapons and us nonproliferation policy particularly whether us policy that views these weapons as militarily useful tool might encourage other nations to acquire their own nuclear weapons or at least complicate us policy to discourage such acquisition some argue that these weapons do not create any problems and the united states should not alter its policy othe rs however argue that the united states should reduce its reliance on these weapons and encourage russia to do the same many have suggested that the united stat and russia expand efforts to cooperate on ensuring the safe and secure storage and elimination of these weapons possibly by negotiating an arms control treaty th at would limit these weapons and allow for increased transparency in monitoring th eir deployment and limination the second session of 110th congress may review some of these proposals this report will be updated as neededhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572contents introduction 1 the distinction between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons 4 definition by observable capabilities 5 d f i n i t i n b x c l u s i n

5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572nonstrategic nuclear weapons introduction during the cold war nuclear weapons were central to the us strategy of deterring soviet aggression against the united states and us allies towards this end the united states deployed wide va riety of systems that could carry nuclear warheads these included nuclear mines artillery short medium and long range ballistic missiles cruise missiles and gravity bombs the united states deployed these weapons with its troops in the field aboard aircraft on surf ace ships on submarines and in fixed ndbased launchers the ited states articulated complex strategy and devel oped detailed operationa l plans that would guide the use of these weapons in the event of conf lict with the soviet union and its allies most public discussions about us nd soviet nuclear weapons including discussions about perceived imbalances between the two nations forces and discussions about the possible use of arms control measures to reduce the risk of nuclear war and limit or reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons have focused on longrange or strategic nuclear wea pons these include longrange landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms and heavy bombers that carry cr uise missiles or gravity bombs these were the weapons that the united states and soviet union deployed so that they could threaten destruction of central milita ry industrial and l eadership facilities in the other country the weapons of globa l nuclear war but both nations also deployed thousands of nuclear weapons outsi their own territories with their troops in the field these weapons usually d less explosive power and were deployed with launchers that would deliver them to shorter ranges than strategic nuclear weapons they were intended for use by troops on the ba ttlefield or within the theater of battle to achieve more limited or tactical objectives these nonstrategic nuclear weapons did not completely escape public discussion or arms control bates their profile rose in the early 1980s when u s plans to deploy new cruise missiles and intermediaterange ballistic missiles in europe as part of natos nuclear strate gy ignited large public protests in many nato nations their high profile returned later in the decade when the united states and soviet union signed the1987 in termediate range nuclear forces inf treaty and eliminated medium and intermediate range ballistic and cruise missiles then in 1991 president george bush nd soviet president mikhail gorbachev each announced that they would withdr aw from deployment most of their nonstrategic nuclear weapons and eliminate many of them these 1991 announcements coming after th abortive coup in moscow in july 1991 but months before the december1991 co llapse of the soviet union responded to growing concerns about the safety and s ecurity of soviet nuclear weapons at timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572crs2 1 finn peter

that nation it also allowed the united states to alter its forces in response to eas ing tensions and the changing international security environment consequently for many in the general public these initiatives appeared to address and solve the problems associated with nonstrategic nuclear weapons moreover although the united states and russia included these weapons in some of their arms control discussions most of their arms control efforts during the rest of that decade focused on imple menting the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty start and negotiating deeper re ductions in strategic nuclear weapons the lack of public attention did not however reflect total absence of questions or concerns about nonstrateg ic nuclear weapons in 1997 president clinton and russias president boris yeltsin signed framework agreement that stated they would address measures rela ted to nonstrategic nuclear weapons in potential start iii treaty further during the 1990s outside analysts officials in the us government and many members of congress raised continuing questions about the safety and security of russia s remaining nonstrategic nuclear weapons congress also sought more detailed accoun ting of russias weapons in legislation passed in the late 1990s analysts have so questioned the role that these weapons might play in russias evolving national s ecurity strategy the rationale for their continued deployment in the us nuclear arsenal and their relationship to us nuclear nonproliferation policy the rrorist attacks of september 11 2001 also reminded people of the catastr ophic consequences that might ensue if terrorists were to acquire and use nuclear weapons with continuing attention focused on the potentially insecure stock of russian nonstr ategic nuclear weapons many analysts outside government have argued that th united states and russia should pursue formal arms control treaty possibly includi ng other nuclear weapons states to reduce and eliminate these weapons these weapons have returned to the pub lic eye in recent months in early 2007 russia threatened to withdraw from the inf treaty in response to us plans to deploy ballistic missile defe nse radar in the czech repub lic and interceptor missiles in poland1 some analysts speculated that the russian desire for relief from the inf treaty had as much to do with its growing interest in deploying new generation of mediumrange missiles as it did with the us missile defense plans some even suggested that the international community explore the possible extension of the inf treaty to other nations to address russia s growing concerns with emerging missile programs2 the bush administration has not howev er adopted policy of reducing or eliminating nonstrategic nuclear weapons when it announced the results of its nuclear posture review in early 2002 it did not outline any changes to the us deployment of nonstrategic nuc lear weapons at bases in europe it stated that nato would address the future of those weapons it also did not discuss these weapons with russia during arms control negotia tions in 2002 instead the strategic offensive reductions treaty moscow treat signed in may 2003 limits

httpwwwfasorgblogssp200806usnuclearweaponswithdrawnfromtheunited kingdomphpnumber of operationally deployed warhead s on strategic nuclear weapons reports indicate however that the united states has redeployed and w ithdrawn some of its nonstrategic nuclear weapons from base s in greece germany and the united kingdom3 further after the npr the bush admin istration sought funding for study to determine whether the united states coul d modify an existing nuclear weapon to improve its capability as robust nuclear earth penetrator weapon that could attack and destroy hardened and deeply buried targets the bush administration argued that such weapon would enhan ce the us nuclear deterrent and improve us security by improving the us ability to hold at risk key assets of emerging adversaries however in the f ace of strong congressional opposition the administration reportedly withdrew its request for fundi ng during the fy2006 authorization and appr opriations process many analysts outside government and some members of congress have argued that the bush administrations policies not only ignore the potential risks from russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons but could also ignite new arms race by raising the perceived utility of nuclear weapons this report will review the debate over the implications of the administr ations policy in later section it is worth noting at this point however that the bush administrations policy represents stark reversal from trends and debates during th late 1990s at that time debates in the nuclear weapons policy community focused on whether the united states should retain its relatively small arsena l of nonstrategic nuclear weapons when compared with the size of the russia arsena l or offer to reduce those weapons as part of an effort to reduce and secure the remaining russian arsenal the bush administration initially quieted discussions about nonstrategic nuclear weapons arms control and instead began to consider how the united states could maintain or enhance its own stockpile of these wea pons while discouraging the acquisition of nuclear weapons by other nations in the past few years in response to the administrations emphasis on the role that us nuclear weapons can play in deterring or defeatin g nations armed with weapons of mass destruction and in response to requests for funding for studies on new nuclear weapons congress had begun to review and debate the administrations plans for us nuclear weapons these debates have not focu sed on the difference between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear w eapons or on the particular concerns that have been raised about nonstrategic nuclear weapons in the past decade instead they have explored in greater detail ad ministration requests for funding for research into new types of nuclear weapons c ongress has also required that the next administration conduct new re view of us nuclear w eapons posture and programs in the fy2008 defense authorization bill hrept 110477 as the united states studies possible changes to its nuclear force structure that might include the deployment of new nuclear weapons nonstrategic nucl ear weapons may again risehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572crs4 4 this dictionary and these definitions can be found on the dod website at httpwwwdticmildoctrinejeldoddictindexhtmlto higher profile congress might then pursue broader deba about nonstrategic nuclear weapons and consider further measur to either broaden or narrow the role of these weapons in us national security policy in addition congress has remained concerned about the potential risks associated with russias continuing depl oyment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons the fy2006 defense authorization act p l109163 contained two provisions that called for further study on these weapons section 1212 mandated that the secretary of defense submit report that would determine whether increased transparency and further reductions in us and russian nonstr ategic nuclear weapons are in the us national security interest section 3115 called on the secretary of energy to submit report on what steps the united states might take to brin g about progress in improving the accounting for and security of russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons further hr 5017 bill to ensure imp lementation of the 911 commission report recommendations included provision sec 334 that called on the secretary of defense to submit report that detailed us efforts to encourage russia to provide detailed accounting of its force of nonstrateg ic nuclear weapons it also authorized 5 million for the us to assist russia in completing an inventory of these weapons the 109th congress did not address this bill or its components in any detail in the 110th congress hr 1 sought to ensure the implementation of the 911 commission report recommendations howeve r in its final form pl 11053 it did not include any references to russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons this report provides basic informati on about us and russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons it begins with br ief discussion of the differences between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons it then provides some historical background describing the numbers and types of nonstrategic nuclear weapons deployed by both nations during the cold war and in the past decade the policies that guided the

raised with regards to us and russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons esse ntially identifying the problems many associate with the continued deployment of these weapons it concludes with review of policy options or solutions for the preceding problems that might be explored by congress the united states russia and other nations the distinction between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons the distinction between strategic and nonstrategic also known as tactical nuclear weapons reflects the military defi nitions of on the one hand strategic mission and on the other hand the tactical us of nuclear weapons according to the department of defense dictionary of military terms4 strategic mission ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572crs5 directed against one or more of selected series of enemy targets with the purpose of progressive destruction and di sintegration of the enemys warmaking capacity and will to make war targets include key manufacturing systems sources of raw material critical ma terial stockpiles power systems transportation systems communication fac ilities and other such target systems as opposed to tactical operations strate gic operations are designed to have longrange rather than immediate effect on the enemy and its military forces in contrast the tactical us of nuclear weapons is defi ned as the use of nuclear weapons by land sea or air forces ag ainst opposing forces supporting installations or facilities in support of operations that contribute to the accomplishment of military mission of limited scope or in support of the military commanders scheme of maneuver usually limited to the area of military operations definition by observable capabilities during the cold war it was relatively easy to distinguish between st rategic nd nonstrateg ic nuclear weapons because each type had different capabilities that were better ited to the different missions definition by range of delivery vehicles the longrange missiles and heavy bombers deployed on us territory and missiles deployed in ballistic missile submarines had the range and destructiv power to attack and destroy military industrial and leadership targets central to the soviet unions ability to prosecute the war at the same time with their rge warheads and rela tively limited accuracies at least during the earlier years of the cold war these weapons were not suited for attacks associated with tactical or battlefield operations nonstrategic nuclear weapons in contrast were not suited for strategic missions because they lacked the range to reach targets inside the soviet ion or for soviet weapons targets inside the united states but because they we re often small enough to be deployed with troops in the field or at forward bases th united states and s oviet union could have used them to attack targets in the theater of the conflict or on the battlefield itself to support more limited military missions even during the cold war however the united states and russia deployed nuclear weapons that defied the standa rd understanding of the difference between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons for example both nations considered weapons based on their own territories that could deliver warheads to the territory of the other nation to be strategic because they had the range needed to reach targets inside the other nations territory bu t some early soviet submarinelaunched ballistic missiles had relatively short ie 500 mile ranges and the submarines patrolled close to us shores to ensure that the weapons could reach their strategic targets conversely in the 1980s the ited states considered sealaunched cruise missiles slcms deployed on submarines or surface ships to be nonstrategic nuclear weapons but if these vesse ls were deployed close to soviet borders these weapons could have destroyed many of the same targets as us strategic nuclear weapons similarly us intermediaterange missiles that were deployed in europe which were considered nonstrategic by the unite d states could reach central strategic targets in the soviet union httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572crs6 furthermore some weapons that had th range to reach strategic targets on the territory of the other nations could also deliver tactical nuclear weapons in support of battlefield or tac tical operations soviet bom bers could be equipped with nucleararmed antiship missiles us bom bers could also carry antiship weapons and nuclear mines hence the range of th delivery vehicle does not always correlate with the types of targets or objectives associated with the warhead carried on that system this relationship between range and mission has become even more clouded since the end of the cold war because the united states and russia have retired many of the shorter and mediumrang delivery systems considered to be nonstrategic nuclear weapons further both nations may develop the capability to use their longerrange strat egic systems to deliver warheads to full range of strategic and tactical targets even if longstanding traditions and arms control definitions weigh against this change definition by yield of warheads during the cold war the longerrange strategic delivery vehicles also tended to carry warheads with greater yields or destructive power than nonstrategic nuclear weapons smaller warheads were better suited to nonstrategic weapons because they sought to achieve more limited discrete objectives on the battlefield than did the rger strategic nuclear weapons but this distinction has also dissolved in more modern systems many us and russian heavy bombers can carry weapons of lowe r yields and as accuracies improved for bombs and missiles warheads with lower yields could achieve the same expected level of destruction that had required larger warheads in ear ly generations of strategic weapons systems definition by exclusion the observable capabilities that allowed analysts to distinguish between strategic and nons trategic nuclear weapons during the cold war have not always been precise and may not prove to be rele vant or appropriate in the future on the other hand the strategic weapons identified by these capabilities icbms slbms and heavy bombers are the only systems covered by the limits in strategic offensive arms control agreements the salt agreements signed in the 1970s the start agreements signed in the 1990s and the moscow treaty in signed in 2002 consequently an easy dividing line is one that would consider all weapons not covered by strategic arms control treaties as nonstrategic nuclear weapons this report takes this approach when re viewing the history of us and sovietrussian nonstrategic nuclear w eapons and in some cases when discussing remaining stocks of nonstr ategic nuclear weapons this definition will not however prove sufficient when discussing current and future issues associated with these wea pons since the early 1990s the united states and russia have withdrawn from deployme nt most of their nonstrategic nuclear weapons and eliminated many of the shor ter and mediumrange launchers for these weapons these changes are discussed in more detail below nevertheless both nations maintain roles for these weapons in their national security strategies russia has enunciated nationa l security strategy that allows for the possible use of nuclear weapons in regional contingenc ies and conflicts near the pe riphery of russia the bush administration has also stated that the united states will maintain those capabilities in its nuclear ar senal that it might need counter the capabilities of potential adversaries the administrati on does not however identify whether those capabilities will be resident on strategic or nonstrategic nuclear weapons

nuclear weapons during the cold war throughout the cold war the united st ates deployed thousands of shorter range nuclear weapons with us forces ba sed in europe japan and south korea and on ships around the world the united st ates maintained these deployments to extend deterrence and to defend its allies in europe and asia not only did the presence of these weapons and the presence of us forces in general increase the likelihood that the united states would come to the defense of its allies if they were attacked the weapons also could have been used on the battlefield to slow or stop the advance of the adversaries conventiona l forces the weapons in asia also contributed to us efforts to defend its allies there from potential threats from china and north korea strategy and doctrine in most cases these weapons were deployed to defend us allies against aggression by the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies but it did not rule out their possible use in contingencies with ot her adversaries in europe these weapons were part of nato s strategy of flexible response under this strategy nato did not insist that it would respond to any type of attack with nuclear weapons but it maintained the capab ility to do so and to control escalation if nuclear weapons were used this pproach was intended to convince the soviet union and warsaw pact that any conflict even one that began with conventional weapons could result in nuclear retaliation5 as the cold war drew to close nato acknowledged that it would longer maintain nuclear w eapons to deter or defeat conventional attack from the sovi et union and warsaw pact because the threat of simultaneous fullscale att ack on all of natos european fronts has effectively been removed6 but nato documents indicated that these weapons would still play an important political role in natos strategy by ensuring uncertainty in the mind of any potential aggressor about the nature of the allies response to military aggression7 force structure throughout the cold war th united states often altered the size and structure of its nonstrategic nuclear forces in response to changing capabilities and changing threat assessments these weapons were deployed at us bases in asia and at bases on the territories of several of the nato allies contributing to natos sense of shared responsibility for the weapons

amy woolf at 2027072379states began to reduce these forces in th late 1970s with the numbers of operational nonstrategic nuclear warheads declining from more than 7000 in the mid1970s to below 6000 in the 1980s to fewer than 1000 by the middle of the 1990s8 these reductions occurred for the most part because us and nato officials believed they could maintain deterre nce with fewer but more modern weapons for example when the nato allies agreed in 1970 that the united states should deploy new intermediate range nuclear weapons in eu rope they decided to remove 1000 older nuclear weapons from europe and in 1983 in the montebello decision when the nato defense ministers appr oved additional weapons m odernization plans they also called for further reduction of 1400 nonstrategic nuclear weapons9 these modernization programs tinued through the 1980s in his 1988 annual report to congress s ecretary of defense caspar weinberger noted that the united states was completing the deployment of pershing ii intermediaterange ballistic missiles and groundlaunched cruise missiles in europe modernizing two types of nuclear artillery shells upgrading the lance shortrange ballistic missile continuing production of the nucleararmed version of the tomahawk sealaunches cruise missile and developing new nuclear dept hstrike bomb for us naval forces10 however by the end of that decade as the warsaw pact dissolved the united states had canceled or scaled back all planned moderniz ation programs in 1987 it also signed the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty which eliminated all us and soviet groundla unched shorter and intermediaterange ballistic and cruise missiles11 soviet nonstrategic nuclear weapons during the cold war strategy and doctrine during the cold war the soviet union also considered nuclear weapons to be in strumental to its military strategy12 although the soviet union had pledged that it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons most western observers doubted that it w ould actually observe this pledge in conflict instead analysts argue that the soviet union had inte grated nuclear weapons into its warfighting plans to much greater degree than the

both surprise attack and preemptive attack according to one russi an analyst the soviet union would have used nonstrategic nuclear weapons to conduc t strategic operations in the theater of war and to reinforce conve ntional units in large scale land and sea operations13 this would have helped the soviet union achieve success in these theaters of war and would have diverted forces of the enemy from soviet territory the soviet union reportedly bega n to reduce its emphasis on nuclear warfighting strategies in the mid1980s under soviet president mikhail gorbachev he reportedly believed that the use of nuclear weapons would be catastrophic nevertheless they remained key tool of deterring and fighting largescale conflict with the united states and nato force structure the soviet union produced and deployed wide range of delivery vehicles for nonstrat egic nuclear weapons at different times during the period it deployed suitcase bombs nucl ear mines shells for artillery short medium and intermediate ballistic missiles shortrange airdelivered missiles and gravity bombs the soviet union deployed these weapons at nearly 600 bases with some located in warsaw pact nations in eastern europe some in the nonrussian republics on the western and s outhern perimeter of the nation and throughout russia estimates vary but many anal ysts believe that in 1991 the soviet union had more than 20000 of these weapons the numbers may have been higher in the range of 25000 weapons in earlier years before the collapse of the warsaw pact14 the 1991 presidential nuclear initiatives in september and october 1991 us pres ident george hw bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev sharply ltered their nations deployments of nonstrategic nuclear weapons15 each announced unilateral but reciprocal

artillery shells it also withdrew about 500 weapons normally deployed aboard surface ships nd submarines and planned to eliminate around 900 b57 depth bombs17 which had been deployed on land and at sea and the weapons for landbase d naval aircraft18 furthermore in late 1991 nato decided to reduce by about half the number of wea pons for nuclearcapable aircraft based in europe which led to the withdrawal of an additional 700 us airdelivered nuclear weapons the united states implemented these m easures very quickly nonstrategic nuclear weapons were rem oved from bases in korea by the end of 1991 and europe by mid1992 the navy had withdrawn nuclear weapons from its surface ships submarines and forward bases by the mid199219 the warhead dismantlement process has moved more slow ly taking most of the 1990s to complete for some weapons and with some work still to be done on others but this is due to the limits on capacity at the pantex plant in texas where the work is done the first bush administration decided to withdraw these weapons for several reasons first the threat the weapons were to deter soviet and warsaw pact attacks in europe had diminished with the collapse of the warsaw pact in 1989 further the milita ry utility of th landbased wea pons had declined as the soviet union pulled its forces eastward beyond th range of these weapons the utility of the seabased weapons had also declined as result of changes in us warfighting concepts that accompanied the end of the cold war moreover the withdrawal of the seabased weapons helped ease sour ce of tensions between the united states and some allies such as new zealand and japan who had been uncomfortable with the possible presence of nuclear weapons dur ing port visits by us naval forces20 the presidents announcement also responded to growing concerns among analysts about the safety and security of soviet nonstrategic nuclear weapons the soviet union had deployed thousands of th weapons at bases in remote areas of its territory and at bases out side soviet territory in ea stern europe the demise of the warsaw pact and political upheaval in eastern europe gene rated concerns about the safety of

to continue implementing these measures after the s oviet union collapsed at the nd of 1991 he also stated that russia would destroy many of the wa rheads removed from nonstrategic nuclear weapons23 these included all warheads from shortrange missiles artillery and atomic demolition devices onethird of the warheads from seabased nonstrategic weapons half the warheads from airdefen interceptors and half the warheads from the air forces nonstrategic nuclear weapons reports indicate that the soviet union had begun re moving nonstrategic nuclear weapons from bases outside s oviet territory

baltic states and central asian republics by the end of 1991 and from ukraine and belarus by midlate spring 199224 the status of nonstrategic nuclear weapons deployed on russian territory is far less certain according to some estimates the naval systems were removed from deployment by the end of 1993 but the army and air force systems remained in the field until 1996 and 199725 furthermore russia

has indicated that it would not use nuclear weapons in anything other than the most grave circumstances for nato nonstrategic nuclear weapons have played reduced but continuing role in security policy they have been seen not only as deterrent to wide range of potential aggressors but also as an important element in natos cohesion as an alliance in the press communique released after their november

in seven countries by 200033 some reports indicate that this number had declined further with the withdrawal of the wea pons in greece and at ramstein air base in germany between 2001 and 2005 in addition reports indicate that the united states has also withdrawn its nuclear weapons from the raf lakenheath air base in the united kingdom34 the bush administration did not recommend any changes for us nonstrategic nuclear weapons after completing its nu clear posture review in 2001 reports indicate that it has decided to retain the capability to restore cruise missiles to attack submarines because of their ability to ploy in secret anywhere on the globe in time of crisis35 the npr also did not recommend any changes to the deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in europe leav ing decisions about their status to the members of the nato alliance the alliance has reviewed these deployments and reaffirmed that the weapons remain an impor tant indicator of alliance unity with the sharing of information about the weapons and sharing of responsibility for their basing serving as an important bond am ong the members of the alliance after completing the npr the bush administration indicated that the united states would explore the development of new types of nuclear warheads it commissioned study on the robust nuclear earth penetrator which would have been modification of an existing type of nuclear weapon36 this program was designed to improve the us capability to attack hardened and deeply buried targets the administration argued that the united states had to improve its capability to attack these types of targets because many potential adversaries have significant number of these facilities which they could use to protect valued assets such as weapons stocks and command facilities the administra tion did not identify these weapons as either strategic or nonstr ategic such designation would likely depend on the intended target for the wea pon in the event of conflict the administration also funded research into advanced concepts for nuclear weaponshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572crs15 this program did not pursue any particular research or identify any new types of weapons for further study but many of th administrations cr itics believed it could be used to develop new types of low yield nuclear weapons congress eliminated funding for the dvanced concepts program in fy2005 and the robust nuclear earth penetrator in fy2006 the administration and others who s upported research into new earth penetrator weapon argued that by burro wing underground before exploding these weapons could not only achieve higher pr obability of destroying fortified targets but might also do so with lower collatera l damage by exploding deeply underground according to the administration these feat ures would increase their credibility as deterrent weapon some have also argued that new types of nuclear weapons such as highly accurate lowyield weapons could be used to attack and destroy stocks of chemical or biological w eapons in their bunkers again with lower collateral damage than the larger existing types of nuclear weapons these programs critics argue that these weapons with their reduced collatera l damage might be more useable than existing nuclear weapons and therefore increase the likelihood that the united states would resort to nuclear weapons dur ing conflict they note that even with their earthpenetrating capabilities thes weapons would produce horrific damage and destruction further they argue that any us attempt to make nuclear weapons appear more useable or to have great er military utility is likely to undermine us efforts to convince other nations not to acquire their own nuclear weapons the targets for these new types of wea pons could be strategic in nature supporting the military or political infrastructur needed to pursue conflict or they could be more tactical in nature suppor ting an adversarys troops or battlefield formations therefore the question of wh ether these weapons would be strategic or nonstrategic would depend on future war plan s and targeting options yet with the sharp decline in the numbers and type s of delivery vehicles for nonstrategic warheads these weapons might be delivered by strategic delivery vehicles such as ballistic missiles or bombers regardless of their targeting objective hence the us plans for the development of new type s of nuclear weapons highlight the complexities discussed above in defining and identifying nonstrategic nuclear weapons because in future scenarios it may be difficult to tell what weapon is intended to attack by the range of its livery vehicle or the yield of its warhead russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons after the cold war strategy

in other former s oviet states along russias periphery many analysts believed that by threatening even implicitly that it might resort to nuclear weapons russia hoped it could enhance its ab ility to deter similar regional conflicts russias sense of vulnerability and its view that the threats to its security were increasing also stemmed from the debates over nato enlargement in the mid 1990s russia feared the growing alliance would create new challenge to russias security particularly if nato moved nuclear weapons cl oser to russias borders these concerns contributed to the statement that russi might use nuclear weapons if its national survival were threatened russian officials repeated many of their concerns about nato enlargement and new nuclear threats during the latest round of expansion in 2003 and 2004 finally for many in russia natos air campaign in kosovo in 1999 underlined russias growing weakness and natos increasing willingness to threaten russian interests its nati

states and international associations to diminish the role of existing mechanisms for ensuring international security there are also threats in the border sphere vital task of the russian federation is to exercise deterrence to prevent aggression on any scale and nuclear or otherwise against russia and its allies consequently russia concluded that it should possess nuclear forces that are cap

vladimir putin who was then chairman of the security council stated that president yeltsin had endorsed blueprint for the development and use of nons trategic nuclear weapons41 many analysts in the

withdraw and eliminate nonstrategic nuclear weapons others dr ew different conc lusion one russian analyst has speculated that the documents approved in 1999 focused on the development of operations

russia planned to seek new generation of nonstrategic or low yiel d warheads that could be to be delivered by strategic launchers othe rs believe russia has also pursued the modernization of existing nonstrategic nuclear weapons and development of new nuclear warheads for shorterrange nuclear missiles concer ns about russias possible reliance on non strategic nuclear weapons in regional conflicts returned in early 2007 when as was noted earlier russia threatened to withdraw from the inf treaty force structure it is extremely difficult to estimate the number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons remaining in the russia arsenal this uncertainty stems from several factors uncertainty about the number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons that the soviet union had stor ed and deployed in 1991 when president gorbachev announced his pni uncertainty about the pace of warhead elimination in russia and uncertainty about the whet her all warheads rem oved from deployment are still scheduled for

stroy all of its tactical nuclear weapons that it would instead hold on to its stockpile s in response to us plans to develop new types of nuclear warheads45 many analysts and us officials interpreted this statement as sharp reversal of russias commitments under the 1991 pnis with consideration for these uncertainties analysts have estimated that russia may still have between 3000 and 8000 warhead s for nonstrategic nuclear weapons with the lower number reflecting the numbe r of deployed weapons and the higher number including those weapons that remain in central storage while some estimate that only airdelivered weapons remain operational the tota l amount may be split between warheads for tactical aviation naval nuclear weapons and air defense missiles with some ground forces still in the mix46 russia had also reportedly reduced the number of military bases that could deploy nonstrategic nuclear weapons by over 250 and had consolidated its storage areas for these weapons liminating

about the possibility that the weapons might be lost stolen or sold to other nations or groups seeking nuclear weapons49 russian officials acknowledged c oncerns about the safety and security of these

weapons in us national security policy the bush administration has claimed as result of its 2001 nuclear posture review the united states has reduced its reliance on nuclear weapons by increasing the role of miss ile defenses and pr ecision conventional weapons in the us deterrent posture however the administration also noted as result of the nuclear posture review that the united states would longer base the size and structure of its nuclear forces only on the russian threat instead the united states would acquire and maintain those capabilities that it needed to deter and defend against the capabilities of any nation with the potential to threaten the united states particularly if the poten tial adversary possesse s weapons of mass destruction it noted that these new threatening capabilities could include hardened and deeply buried targets and possibly bunkers holding chemical or biological weapons it indicated that the united st ates would seek to develop the capabilities to destroy these types of facilities the administration has argued that its new policy is designed to enhance deterrence by giving the united states more credible tailored options in the event of conflict with nation armed with chemical biol ogical or nuclear weapons this however presumes that the us military could identify credible scenario that included the option of using nuclear weapons this may not be possible in battlefield contingencies when us forces would be vulnerable to fallout and other nuclear effects further the use of nuclear weapons to destroy underground bunkers housing chemical or biological w eapons presumes that the ited states would have the exquisite intelligence needed to locate the bunkers with the agents anything less than direct precise attack could disperse

adversary and they also serve as link among the nato nations with ba ses in several na tions and shared responsibility for nuclear policy planning an d decisionmaking but if the united states develops new nuclear warheads th at can fulfill nonstrategic missions with delivery from strategic platforms such as heavy bomber the need for forward basing in europe diminishes hence some believe that the

ty pes of nuclear weapons to achieve newly defined battlefield objectives56 the administration has c ountered this argument by noting that few nations acquire nuclear weapons in response to us nuclear programs they do so either to address their own regiona l security challenges or to counter us conven tional superiority57 policy options status quo the bush administration and some analysts outside government argue that the united states doe s not have to adopt any new or different policies to address the issues raised above they argue that the 2001 nuclear posture review strengthened the us nuclear deterrent by adjusting us strategy and doctrine to address emerging rather than co ld war threats they do not believe that these policy changes undermine us nonprolif eration policy or that they make the use of nuclear weapons more likely in future conflicts the bush administration also has not dopted any new policies to address the potential risks created by russias conti nued

raise concerns about these weapons in discu ssions with their russian counterparts however the administration appears to be lieve that any concerns about the safety and security of these weapons can be addressed through th ongoing cooperative threat reduction program they argue however that russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons pose military threat to stability or security for the united states or its allies and therefore requi re unilateral or cooperative responses from the united states58 further some argue that any recipr ocal or cooperative effort to address concerns about russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons such as negotiated transparency or arms control measures could undermine us flexibility and limit us and nato options for the deployme nt of nonstrategic nuclear weapons specifically pursuing arms control ag reements on these weapons might undercut natos nuclear posture generating political pressure to withdraw the remaining weapons in addition arms control w ould make problematic the development of new nonstrategic nuclear weapons capabilitie s that may be required to deter and defend against todays threats and especi ally for the deterrence of rogue states armed with weapons of mass destruction59 reduce reliance on nuclear weapons many analysts believe the united states should adopt policy that re duces its reliance on nuclear weapons in general and weapons with battlefield objectives in particular the bush administration argues that its policy achieves this objective by including missile defenses and precision strike conventional weapons in its new triad of us forces and capabilities others however argue that the administrations policy actually blurs the distinction between conventiona l and nuclear weapons and may increase the us reliance on nuclear weapons by addi ng to the contingencies when the united states would consider nuclear use they argue instead that the united states should adopt first use pledge so that the united states would make it clear that it would not use nuclear weapons against nonnuc lear states at present the united states does not explicitly threaten to use nuclear weapons but it also will not rule out their use supporters of the existing policy argue that this ambiguity enhances deterrence by keeping the possible prospect of nuclear attack in the adversarys calculations those who support first use pledge argue that it would reduce the perceived value of nuclear w eapons indicating that they serve only as deterrent to the use of nuclear weapons by other nations many believe that this change in policy would not hinder us deterrent strategy or us security because they believe that the us nuclear deterrent is r obust with thousands of deployed nuclear warheads and that us conventional forces are suffici ent to address any potential or emerginghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572crs25 60 stansfield turner nukes can us practice what it preaches christian science monitor january 28 2004threats to us security this includes the potential need for the united states to attack hardened and deeply buried targets including those that might house chemical or biological weapons the united states could use its conventional weapons to seal off entry and exit points and to cut off communications and ventilation60 thereby sealing chemical or biol ogical weapons in place in their underground bunkers for the duration of conflict the united states could then remove and dispose of these weapons after winning the conflict without risking dispersing them and creating fallout with nuclear attack some have also argued that if the united states and nato reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons possibly even withdr awing nonstrategic nuclear weapons from europe russia might also alter its policy others however argue that russias policy is only rhetorically linked to nat policy and with continuing concerns about weaknesses in its conventional for ces russia is unlikel to res pond with its own change in policy some also belie ve that changes in us and nato policy could affect the policies of other nations with nonstrateg ic nuclear weapons such as india pakistan or china by demonstra ting that the united states has reduced its reliance on nuclear weapons others howev er point out that these nations have acquired their nuclear weapons to address their own secu rity interests and are unlikely to alter limit their forces simply because the united states and nato have set an example of reductions cooperative responses analysts have noted that the only arms control measures affecting nonstrategic nuclear weapons the 1991 pnis do not require data exchanges and did not establish monitoring provisions so each nation can be certain that the other is adhering to its commitment s they also are voluntary because they are not incorporated in formal treaty or agreement either side could reverse its commitments at any time hence the re ductions under these measures may be vulnerable to disruptions in the relations hip between the united states and russia those who believe that us and russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons continue to pose threat to international security ither because of the prospects for loss of control over russian weapons by deliberate us by either nation or because of their symbolic value and potential to undermine nonproliferation policies argue that the united states and russia should pursue furt her cooperative measur to address the perceived threats from the weapons and th perceived weaknesses in the existing controls on them congress also voiced its in terest in the future of these weapons section 1212 of the fy2006 defense author ization act pl 109163 calls on the secretary of defense to determine whether it is in the us national security interest to identify and develop mechanisms and procedures to implement the transparent reductions in nonstrategic nuclear weapons and to identify and develop mechanisms and procedures to implement the transparent dismantlement of excess nonstrategic nuclear weapons analysts outside government have ffered several propos als for cooperative measures that might address concerns with nonstrategic nuclear weapons for example in an article published in the wall street journal in early 2008 severalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572crs26 61 george p schultz william j perry henry kissinger and sam nunn toward nuclear free world wall street journal january 15 2008 p 13former senior defense and national security officials argued that the united states should start dialogue including with in nato and with russia on consolidating the nuclear weapons designed for forward ployment to enhance their security and as first step toward careful accounting for them and their eventual elimination61 this proposal is part of larger agenda that these officials ve outlined as part of path toward world free of nuclear weapons other analysts have proposed number of measures that might be take n specifically to address concerns about nonstrategic nuclear weapons these include increase transparency many analysts argue that the united states and russia should at minimum provide each other with information about their numbers of nonstrategic nuclear weapons nd the status ie deployed stored or awaiting dismantlement of these weapons such information might help each side to monitor the others progress in complying with the pnis it could also help resolve questions and concerns that might come up bout the status of these weapons or their vulnerability to theft or misuse the united states and russia have discussed transparency measures for nuc lear weapons in the past in separate forum in the early 1990s and as part of their di scussions the framework for start iii treaty in the late 1990s they failed to r each agreement on either occasion russia in particular has seemed unwilling to provide even basic information about its stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons some in the united states have resisted as well arguing in particular that public discussi ons about the numbers and locations of us nuclear weapons in europe could increase pressure on the united states to withdraw these weapons expand threat reduction assistance in the early 1990s as part of the early efforts of the cooperative threat reduction program the united states provided russia with assistance in transpor ting nuclear weapons back to russia from other former soviet republics it s also provided russia with assistance in improving security at its central storage facilities for nuclear wea pons however much of this assistance focused on the warheads removed from strategic nuclear weapons rather than nonstrategic nucl ear weapons because many nonstrategic nuclear weapons remain at remote storage areas near former ployment areas and concerns remain about security at these f acilities some analysts have suggested that the united states could expand its threat reduction assistance to these sites so that it could build confidence in the safety and security of these weapons others however argue that the united states s hould only provide assistance at sites that support the retirement or limination of nuclear warhead s and should not provide funding for sites that can support the w eapons continued depl oyment some have also questioned whether russia would accept assistance at these sites particularly if it were not permitted reciprocal access to u s weapons storage sites russia did however recently conduct an exercise w ith nato observers and ctr funding to explore the vulnerability of its nuclear wea pons storage sites to incursions and theft negotiate formal treaty several analysts have suggested that the united states and russia negotiate formal treaty to both codify the measures outlined inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572crs27 62 the only way to get real handle on nsnf security and the relationship of these weapons to strategic arms control and the real military threats they pose while maintaining some capability is the warhead control r oute see joseph f pilat controlling nonstrategic nuclear forces in larson jeffrey and kurt j

reduction in deployed weapons including us weapons in eu rope and could re sult in both nations reducing their reliance on these weapons in their military strategies some analysts have also argued that this treaty could be multilateral to include nations such as china india and pakistan rather than bilateral thus intr oducing arms control limits to the forces of other nations w ith nonstrategic nuclear weapons however as have been noted throughout this report the two sides would likely find it difficult to agree on definition of which weapons counted as nonstrategic nuclear weapons particularly if either nation begins to deploy warheads designed to achieve battlefield objectives on longrange or strategic delivery vehicles the issue would be further complicated by the fact that both the united states and russia hold many of these warheads in storage and so could conceivably return to deployment in relatively short amount of time to ddress these problems some analysts have suggested that the arms control regime count and limit all warheads stored and deployed strategic and nonstrategic etc this type of agreement would allow each side to determine for itself the size and mix of its deployed forces within the limits on total warheads62 critics argue that such limits would be extremely difficult to define and monitor making it difficult to verify compliance with warheadcontrol treaty they also note that the lack of symmetry between us and russian forces would make it extremely difficult to find common definitions and limits that addressed each nations concerns in par ticular because russia views us nato weapons as threat to its security it coul d insist on the complete removal of these weapons in exchange for less comprehe nsive limits on the far greater numbers of russian forces63 further the other nations with nonstrategic nuclear weapons seem unlikely at this time to be willing to join regime that would limit their capabilities analysts recognize that negotiating such an agreement would be complex and timeconsuming but it suffers from still another problem neither the russian nor us governments have expresse d any interest in pursuing this path russian officials have denied that their weapons pose sa fety and security problem and they still consider these weapons esse ntial to russian military stra tegy and national security the bush administration has also shown interest in negotiating further limits on us nuclear warheads or weapons to th contrary in the 2002 strategic offensive reductions treaty moscow treaty the unite d states indicated that it would only count operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads unde r the limits in the treaty this metric counts fewer warhead s than the start treaty and far fewerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572crs28 than metric that would include stored and deployed strategic and nonstrategic nuclear warheads the bush administration has resisted more confining arms control measures arguing that the united states must maintain the flexibility to adjust its forces and redeploy warheads to respond to changes in the international security environment nevertheless analysts who view these w eapons as threat to us russian and international security maintain that circumstances could change and bilateral or multilateral treaty could address many concerns for example if the united states and nato reconsider the military utility of forward deployed nuclear weapons and as russias economy and conve ntional forces recover mo re of their stability both sides might grow more willing to accept limits on their forces if it allows for greater openness and transparency at both storag and deployment areas although it is harder to imagine other na tions relinquishing their nons trategic nuclear weapons some contend that treaty that estab lished norm against nonstrategic nuclear weapons combined with diplomatic efforts to address security concerns could alter the perceptions of these nations as well
