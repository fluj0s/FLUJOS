charge daffaires for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 cnf mr president your meeting with italian pm silvio berlusconi comes at time when his closest advisors fear italy is losing the credibility and influence that it enjoyed in washington under the previous us administration in fact while italy has been stalwart partner and participant in nearly every usled security operation around the world since the end of the cold war domestic political foibles and economic malaise are diluting its international influence italy continues to support our efforts in afghanistan lebanon iraq and the balkans but its diplomatic economic and military institutions which the berlusconi government and its predecessors have starved for resources are sorely stretched berlusconi and his government have tried to compensate for italys failure to invest in its instruments of national power by presenting italy as mediator and interlocutor with difficult actors on major international issues this selfappointed role has sometimes complicated international efforts on iran for example italys role under the previous government gave tehran the impression that the international community was divided more recently goi actions have provided european platform for russias efforts to challenge nato security interests in europe berlusconi will certainly present himself as the best hope for moderating russian behavior and will seek signal from you that he has mandate to speak on the wests behalf he will also seek to use italys g8 presidency to address issues far beyond the scope and effectiveness of the organization we should discourage both instincts italy has an important voice in the euroatlantic community but its efforts have proven constructive only when undertaken in coordination with the us and other key allies berlusconi the politician 2 cnf our relationship with berlusconi is complex he is vocally proamerican and has helped address our interests on many levels in manner and to degree that the previous government was unwilling or unable to do since his return to power last spring as well as in his previous turns in government in his first 90 days in office he approved controversial us base expansion that had been halted by bureaucratic inaction and antiamerican political opposition eliminated caveats on italian troops in afghanistan and allowed us to base two of three africom component commands in italy at the same time he has criticized missile defense nato enlargement and support for kosovos independence as american provocations of russia he claimed russian pm putins military push into georgia in august 2008 was necessary to end the bloodshed of innocents caused by georgian president saakashvili he displays an overweening selfconfidence born of stable and strong political popularity that has made him deaf to dissenting opinion the strict control he exercises over his government and party inhibits his staff from giving him unpleasant messages his unorthodox governing style coupled with his frequent verbal gaffes and highprofile scandals including public bickering with his wife about his alleged philandering have caused many including some inside the us government to dismiss him as feckless vain and ineffective as modern european leader 3 cnf his shortcomings notwithstanding marginalizing berlusconi would limit important cooperation with key ally berlusconi is one of europes most enduring politicians whose popularity in italy will guarantee that he will influence italian politics for many years still to come he has arrested the trend of weak shortlived italian governments that has plagued this country since the end of the second world war when successfully engaged he has shown the willingness to adopt policies however unpopular in line with ours including support for an expanded nato role in afghanistan and turkeys membership in the eu when ignored he seeks to carve out visible international and rome 00000649 0026 of 004 frequently unhelpful role for himself dealing with berlusconi therefore requires careful balance of close coordination with him and his key advisors while avoiding giving the impression that he can speak on our behalf with many of the worlds difficult actors 4 cnf italy held elections for the european parliament on june 6 and 7 which reaffirmed berlusconis people of liberty pdl party as italys largest party reaching 35 percent well ahead of the main opposition democratic partys 26 percent while berlusconi does not have competitive rival in the center left his party missed the 40 percent mark that it was aiming for and witnessed the growth of xenophobic coalition ally northern league ln pdl is personalitydriven party whose members tell us that the ideology is little more than berlusconismo the missed target of 40 percent can be attributed to an overambitious berlusconi as well as the turnoutdepressing effects of weeks of personal attacks by the center left in the runup to the election that included allegations of fiscal and sexual impropriety an enduring result of the election will be the heightened competition between pdl and ln who now dominate italian politics lns tough stands on security and against immigration have won broad approval even as berlusconi has tried to stem the flow of pdl voters to ln by descending to the antiimmigrant rhetoric usually favored by the northern league additionally after this mild electoral setback we can expect berlusconi to use his white house meeting and his hosting of the g8 to underscore to italians the important figure he cuts on the world stage economic crisis 5 c prudent some would say stodgy banking practices allowed italy to avoid the global financial sector meltdown italys banks simply did not engage in subprime lending and they did not buy the toxic assets that caused so much trouble in the us and elsewhere but italy has not been able to avoid the pain of the worldwide recession that has followed the financial crisis italys economic growth rate which was relatively low even before the crisis has dropped precipitously owing to sharp contractions in its export markets and falling domestic demand unemployment is expected to exceed eight percent this year and to rise further in 2010 government tax revenues are not unexpectedly off sharply italys already high level of government debt and the debt ceilings that come with eu membership significantly limit the governments ability to provide fiscal stimulus for the economy g8 6 cnf berlusconis stewardship of his g8 presidency has been marked by proliferation of ministerial and subministerial meetings coupled with lastminute change of summit venue from sardinia to the earthquakestricken city of laquila that took even his sherpa by surprise he and his cabinet tend to regard italys g8 year more as an opportunity to curry favor with g8 outsiders such as egypt spain and libya than as tool to address the worlds problems however his desire to prevent the g8 from taking back seat to the g20 on his watch has driven an ambitious agenda that may make useful contributions on climate change africa development and food security he will be eager to work with you to build legacy of g8 deliverables that will bear the italian label the major economies forum meeting during the g8 summit which will include the leaders of 17plus countries that emit over 80 percent of global emissions will be an important chance to mobilize highlevel consensus in the runup to the december climate change talks in copenhagen guantanamo detainees 7 cnf berlusconi welcomed your decision to close guantanamo and has publicly and repeatedly underscored italys desire to support the move by taking detainees fm frattini recently outlined for ag holder the efforts italian officials have been making within the eu to negotiate rome 00000649 0036 of 004 common eu framework that will open the door to individual country agreements with the us while the junior partner in berlusconis coalition opposes taking any detainees berlusconi has made it clear that he views this as moral commitment to support the us russia 8 cnf dependence on russian energy lucrative and frequently nontransparent business dealings between italy and russia and close personal relationship between berlusconi and putin have distorted the pms view to the point that he believes much of the friction between the west and russia has been caused by the us and nato berlusconi believes he acting as mediator can restore spirit of dialogue and cooperation between europe the us and russia but largely on russias terms through indefinitely postponing natos outreach to ukraine and georgia diluting the eus efforts to promote democracy in belarus and undermining osces important role in promoting human and democratic values across the whole of europe berlusconi has publicly proposed to mediate your relationship with russian president medvedev and is hoping you will give him signal however small that he has your blessing to do so instead you can let him know that we believe that issues of security that affect the transatlantic community should be addressed by the alliance at large and that the us is not prepared to sacrifice values in exchange for shortterm stability predicated on russian promises of good behavior and we will react and expect others who share these values to do so as well when russia crosses redline for instance in threatening the sovereignty of neighboring states energy 9 cnf berlusconis close personal ties with putin and the very strong corporate ties between italian energy parastatal eni and russias gazprom often put italy squarely at odds with usg efforts to reduce europes dependence on russian energy for example the italian government is deeply ambivalent about energy projects that would help europe diversify its energy imports while at the same time it is supportive of other projects that would increase europes russian energy dependency eni 30percent owned by the italian government often dictates goi energy policy and uses its influence through the goi to block eu energy market liberalization plans italy is taking some steps however in the right direction by supporting energy projects that will diversify its own energy sources it would be helpful if you could raise with berlusconi longstanding usg concerns about european energy security emphasizing that increasing the flow of russian gas around ukraine is not the same as policy seeking true diversity of energy sources routes and technologies 10 c the berlusconi government is pursuing plans to bring back nuclear power to italy usbased companies westinghouse and ge face stiff competition from foreign rivals particularly france whose governments are heavily lobbying the goi word to berlusconi that the us expects this to be fair and transparent competition is critical if us firms are to have fair chance to bid for italian nuclear energy projects iran 11 cnf with italy frustrated by its exclusion from the p5plus1 negotiating circle berlusconi will highlight italys wouldbe role as an interlocutor between the west israel and iran claiming excellent relations with all parties involved he may also push for the us to drop the p5 1 framework altogether italian officials were thrilled by your commitment to embark upon direct diplomatic engagement with iran but cannot resist the impulse to try to be present at the creation fm frattini has worked strenuously to lock in highlevel iranian attendance at the june 2627 afghanistanpakistan outreach meeting hoping thereby to play host to the first usiranian ministerial encounter in decades rome 00000649 0047 of 004 libya 12 cnf berlusconi has continued italys policy of developing an expanded relationship with libya largely in order to stem the tide of irregular migration from libyan shores but also to gain advantageous access to libyas oil reserves for italian firms mainly eni as followup to the 2008 libyaitaly friendship treaty which committed libya to sterner measures to deter irregular migrants from entering italy from its shores but also offered 5 billion usd in development assistance libyan leader qadhafi will pay an historic first official visit to rome june 1012 just before berlusconis washington visit as the current african union president qadhafi will be at the g8 summit in laquila and we anticipate berlusconi may lobby you to meet with the libyan leader during your visit partner in security 13 cnf berlusconi has maintained significant military commitment in afghanistan 2600 troops mostly in italys regionalcommand west but has dropped from fourth to sixthlargest isaf contributor as other countries like france and canada have augmented their troop levels at stasbourgkehl his government pledged modest increases to cover election security which if made permanent would put italy back in the top tier of isaf contributors he has also supported the creation of the nato training mission in afghanistan doubling the number of carabinieri police trainers to over 100 italy has been an anemic contributor to international aid efforts in afghanistan and pakistan and has cut overall foreign assistance by more than 60 percent in this years budget however berlusconi knows this is priority area for the us and will likely respond positively if you press him to do more in the region 14 c our shared security interests with italy go beyond afghanistan us facilities in italy provide unmatched freedom of action and are critical to our ability to project stability into the mediterranean middle east and north africa we have 15000 us military on six italian bases and these installations host some of our most advanced capabilities deployed outside the us our bases and activities out of italy are not uniformly popular but pm berlusconi in this government as in his last has made preserving this security relationship priority and the goi has invariably come through on our top requests despite domestic political risks the goi has approved the expansion of our base at vicenza to consolidate the 173rd airborne brigade the deployment of the usaf global hawk uav in sicily and the establishment of africom army and navy component commands on italian soil italys leadership in other overseas missions helps us concentrate our forces on our top priorities in addition to its troops in afghanistan italy currently has 2300 in the balkans 2400 in lebanon and is the leading contributor to the nato training mission in iraq conclusion 15 cnf the robust usitalian relationship provides us with major national security benefits in our military missions overseas our own power projection and on broad law enforcement agenda but the prime minister is an erratic steward it might be tempting to dismiss berlusconi as frivolous interlocutor with his personal foibles public gaffes and sometimes unpredictable policy judgment but we believe this would be mistake despite his faults berlusconi has been the touchstone of italian politics for the last 15 years and every indication is that he will be around for years to come when we are able to successfully engage him in pursuit of our common objectives he has proved an ally and friend to the united states he respects and admires the us and is eager to build strong and successful relationship with you dibble
