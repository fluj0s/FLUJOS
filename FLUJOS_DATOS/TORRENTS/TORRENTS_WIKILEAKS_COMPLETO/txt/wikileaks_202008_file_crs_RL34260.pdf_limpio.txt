attention as critical issue facing the nations of the world the negotiations to be held in bali indonesia december 314 2007 are widely regarded as critical next step in continuing to chart an international course to mitigate global warming and deal with its impacts this report provides background on the negotiations in four sections 1 summary of the status of the 1992 ited nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and the 1997 kyoto protocol that established mandatory limits on the six major greenhouse gases for the major developed nations listed in annex i of the unfccc and generally referred to as annex i countries 2 brief review of the science and economics underlying concerns about climate change and related possible future goals to reduce greenhouse gases 3 the progress to date of annex i and nonannex i nations under the kyoto protocol and 4 an overview of the upcoming negotiations at the 13th conference of the parties of the unfccc cop13 and third meeting of the parties to the kyoto protocol mop3 in bali at preliminary meeting leading up to the december copmop four key elements were outlined as the focus for bali road map 1 mitigation of climate change agreeing on emission reduction commitments 2 adaptation to impacts of climate change 3 financial assistance issues and 4 technology development and transfer it is very likely that while future negotiations will grapple with the effort to obtain some form of legally binding mandatory commitments from all parties the recognition of differing national circumstances and differing abilities of nations to take on various types of commitments will be major elements in the discussions it is widely expected that the outcome in bali is likely to be decisions that focus only on the framework procedures and time frame for negotiations to follow on post2012 agreement substantive issues will be taken up in those future negotiations all parties appear to agree that an agreement needs be completed by the end of 2009 in order to be ratified by the necessary number of parties by 2012 when the kyoto protocol commitment period ends

only agreement establishing legally binding reductions of greenhouse gas ghg emissions which are major contributors to global warming it was negotiated under the auspices of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and the united states played major role in shaping the provisions of the protocol 1 the unfccc opened for signature at the 1992 earth summit in ri janeiro outlined goal of voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 at the annual conferences of the parties cop participants soon concluded that the year 2000 goal of the unfccc would not be met and that voluntary reductions would not suffice negotiations began on protocol that would provide for mandatory legally binding emissions reductions for the developed countries listed in annex i of the unfccc negotiations on the protocol were completed in 1997 and the united states signed it in 1998 however it has never been sent to the us senate for advice and consent and thus the united states has not ratified it president bush characterized the protocol as fatally flawed and rejected it in early 2001 citing economic burdens competitiveness concerns and the lack of mandatory emissions requirements for major developing countries such as china and india the united states withdrawal from participation in the protocol and its rejection of mandatory limitation of greenhouse gas emissions has remained sensitive issue in us relations with many nations particularly the european parties to the protocol they continue to express the hope that the united states will rejoin the negotiations that continue on the protocol and particularly on measures to reduce ghgs after the protocol commitment period ends in 2012 key element of both the unfccc and the kyoto protocol is common but differentiated responsibilities which has meant that while all nations developed or developing have responsibilities for monitoring and reporting their emissions only the developed annex i nations have had an obligation to reduce ghg emissions this has meant in practice that in negotiations relating to the kyoto protocol new commitments for developing countries have been under consideration this concept arises from two basic principles accepted by all parties to the unfccc and the kyoto protocol that the indus trializeddeveloped nations are responsible for most of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere several of these gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or century or more and that nations have widely different capacities and resources to undertake the costs of mitigation 2 with developed nations generally having the resources and technological infrastructure to undertake emissions reductions as ways to involve 1 for

principle will be the subject of much debate3 the overall reduction for the 38 industrialized nations specified in annex b of the kyoto protocol is stated as 52 below 1990 levels averaged over the fiveyear commitment period between 2008 2012 target for each annex b country was negotiated the united states target in the protocol would have been to reduce the six major greenhouse gases by 7 below 1990 levels because of the fact that sinks which remove and store carbon from the atmosphere are counted and because emissions credit trading 4 would be allowed the actual reduction of emissions within the united states that would have been required to meet the target was estimated to be lower than 7closer to 4 but based on projections of potential growth of emissions the actual required reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the united states would have been an estimated 15 to 30 below where their levels would otherwise be by the 20082012 period the kyoto protocol obtained the necessary number of ratifications from annex b countries in late 2004 and entered into force in february 2005 5 some 169 nations have ratified or accepted the kyoto protocol according to the unfccc secretariat representing 66 of the emissions of developed countries with obligations outlined in the protocol6 as noted above the protocols provisions apply only to those countries that have ratified it which two of the annex i countriesthe united states and australiahave not done annual meetings of the parties to the unfccc and the kyoto protocol continue and attention of the negotiations has turned in large part to next steps following the end of the commitment period in 2012in particular the extent to wh ich developing countries nonannex i would assume binding commitments which most of the major greenhouse gas emitters among them remain reluctant to do the united states has attended these annual meetings participating in an observer status

underscored large areas of agreement on climate issues as well as some important uncertainties and disagreements the ipcc concluded unequivocally in its first report in 20077 that the earths climate has changed over the past century8 and that while natural factors including changes in solar irradiance and volcanoes have played roles in the observed changes most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic9 greenhouse gas concentrations10 the ipcc has dealt with both mitigationmeasures that would reduce climate changes largely involving reducing greenhouse gas emissionsand adaptation which involves identifying impacts of climate change and taking measures to deal with the impacts in its fourth report the ipcc concluded there is high confidence that neither adaptation nor mitigation alone can avoid all climate change impacts however they can complement each other and together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change many impacts can be reduced delayed or avoided by mitigation mitigation efforts and investments over the next two or three decades will have large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels and increase the risk of more severe climate change impacts11 elevated greenhouse gas ghg concentrations in the atmosphere carbon dioxide is now about onethird higher than in 1880 result from fossil fuel use land clearing industrial and agricultural emissions current levels of ca rbon dioxide are at approximately 381 parts per million ppm in the atmosphere up from some 270 ppm in preindustria l times ghgs in the atmosphere remain there for many decades to centuries the united states contributes almost onefifth of net global greenhouse gas emissions china emits about as much as the united states 12 but with its robust economic growth dependent on industrialization fueled largely by coal china will likely become and remain the rgest global emitter for the foreseeable future future greenhouse gas emissions will grow most rapidly from developing economies as they strive to eliminate poverty and raise income levels towards those of the wealthier annex i countries future ghg trajectories are widely uncertain depending largely on the rate and composition of economic growth and technology choices the plausible future range may be significantly influenced by policy decisions to limit emissions scientists have found it very likely that rising greenhouse gas concentrations if they continue unabated will increase global average temperature above natural variability by at least 15 celsius 27o fahrenheit during the 21st century above 1990 temperatures with small 7 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc working

projections thought most likely by many climate modelers are for greenhouse gasinduced temperature rise of approximately 25 to 35oc 45 to 63of by 2100 future climate change may advance smoothly or sporadically with some regions experiencing more fluctuations in temperature precipitation and frequency or intensity of extreme events than others many scientists expect that wet regions will get more precipitation and dry regions are likely to become drier floods droughts storms and other extreme weather events are projected to increase with impacts for ecological and human systems some impacts of climate change are expected to be beneficial in some locations with few degrees of warming eg increased agricultural productivity in some regions less need for space heating opening of the northwest passage for shipping and resource exploitation most impacts are expected to be adverse eg lower agricultural productivity in many regions drought rising sea levels spread of disease vectors greater needs for cooling risks of abrupt surprising climate changes with accompanying dislocations are expected to increase as global average temperature rises disturbing both natural and socioeconomic systems with national and international security implications disparities across locations will increase pressure on international aid and migration with possible implications for political stability and security impacts may be alleviated through investments in adaptation though this strategy is thought to be more challenging as climate changes become more widespread uncertain and severe the potential costs of adapting to climate change and the residual damagesincluding possible catastrophic eventslead many people to believe that actions are justified to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit climate change economic analyses of costs for mitigation interact with peoples values and ethical considerations of disparities across populations already living and future generations and across countries and income groups ethical approaches also vary concerning how to weigh potential risks to ecological systems such as expected increases in extinctions of species in order to mitigate climate change variety of specific policy targets have been proposed for example the european union eu has articulated goal of avoiding more than 2 oc 36of increase of global mean temperature above preindustrial levels13 this is estimated to require stabilizing ghg in the atmosphere at between 450 and 550 parts per million ppm carbon dioxide equivalent the ar4 of the ipcc concluded that lowest stabilization targets require an earlier peak of co2 and co2equivalent emissions in the majority of the scenarios in the most stringent stabilization category stabilization level below 490 ppmv co2equivalent emissions are required to decline before 2015 and are further reduced to less than 50 of todays emissions by 2050 for somewhat higher stabilization levels eg below 590 ppmv co2equivalent global emissions in the scenarios generally peak around 20102030 followed by return to 2000 levels on average around 2040 for high stabilization levels eg below 710 ppmv co2equivalent the median emissions peak around 2040 14 13 council of the european union press release 627207 february 20 2007 brussels belgium p 6 14 brian fischer and nebojsa nakicenovic et

their ghg emissions at what rate and whenin the post2012 periodwill underlie the discussions in bali countries will position themselves in the debate on whether to set longterm temperature or concentration targets and whether to set binding mediumterm emission caps based on perceptions of the potential damages of climate change and mitigation costs all countries are concerned about the costs of policies to abate greenhouse gas emissions and considerable research underlies understanding of the economics and uncertainties the ipcc concluded that in 2050 global average macroeconomic costs for multigas mitigation towards stabilization of ghg concentrations between 710 and 445 co2eq are between 1 gain to 55 decrease of global gdp15 delaying initiation of ghg limitations may decrease cumulative costs of meeting given ghg target if the reductions are timed to minimize early retirements of productive capital and if lower ghg technologies advance rapidly or if better information on climate impacts allows relaxation of the ghg limit however aiming for given ghg or temperature target but delaying ghg emission limitations may increase costs if hopedfor technological advances do not materialize if the more rapid emission reductions required in later years accelerate early retirement of productive capital or if climate change impacts appear to be worse than expected and there is desire to ratchet down the ghg cap how allowable emissions are distributed among sour ces worldwide is not strong determinant of future climate but would strongly affect who pays how the burdens of ghg reductions may be distributed is critical political economic and values issue however given the scientific and economic uncertainties policymakers are not bound to make an immediate single decision on longterm goals that must remain fixed for decades into the future once post2012 goals are set policymakers may adapt them as scientific technological and socioeconomic information improves

permits it to purchase emissions reduction credits generally called allowances18 from another country that has determined it will achieve more emissions reductions than necessary to comply with emissions trading countries that can make relatively inexpensive emissions reductions have an incentive to reduce emissions below the level required by the kyoto protocol and sell the extra allowances to other countries whose emissions control costs are more expensive thus both the seller and the buyer will have lower costs by virtue of the sellers profit and the buyers savings this type of implementation scheme is commonly called capandtrade program 19 after rocky start primarily resulting from data shortcomings several positives have emerged from the learning by doing exercise that may assist the ets in making the kyoto compliance phase run more smoothly including 1 greatl improving emissions data 2 encouraging development of the kyoto protocols projectbased mechanismsclean development mechanism cdm and joint implementation jia nd 3 influencing corporate behavior to begin pricing in the value of allowances in decisionmaking particularly in the electric utility sector however several issues that arose during the trial phase remain contentious as the ets moves into its kyoto commitment period including allocation schemes shutdown credits and new entrant reserves and others in addition the expansion of the eu and the implementation of the directives linking the ets to the kyoto protocol projectbased mechanisms created new issues to which the ec has had to respond in 2006 the european environmental agency eea projected the 15 eu members that had jointly agreed to reduce ghgs by 8 below 1990 levels during the kyoto compliance period would meet their obligation as whole however the eea estimated that 7 of those countries would not meet their individual kyoto obligations 20 in contrast the eea estimated that all 10 of the new member countries with obligations under the treaty would meet them21 the eea also estimated that noneu countries iceland and sw itzerland would meet their obligations while liechtenstein and norway would not in october 2007 the ec announced agreement on linking the ets with emission trading systems in norway iceland and liechtenstein22 the other major european signatory the russian federation is anticipated to meet its obligations under the treaty although it will do so due in large part to economic contraction after the previous union of soviet socialist republics ussr collapsed as its economy expands these conditions are likely to change outside europe the major annex b parties are new zealand canada and japan in september 2007 the new zealand government decided to phase in an emission trading scheme beginning in 2008 last stage beginning in 2013 to assist new zealand in complying with its kyoto obligations 23 however the governments most recent analysis estimates new zealand will not continued

global accumulations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere negotiators recognized that the goals of the protocol even if met by all the parties would not produce the stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gases posited as the goal of the unfccc the protocol set forth timetable for reviewing progress of actions undertaken to meet the protocols goals and to consider next steps as momentum and concern have built over the past year strong expectations have been expressed by all parties that positive outcome is critically important at the negotiations to be held this year in bali indonesia december 3 14 2007 it is widely accepted by all parties that postkyoto agreement needs to be completed by the end of 2009 and that the outcome in bali is likely to consist primarily of road map for future negotiations that will provide an agenda for identifying and resolving the substantive issues involving the nature of obligations to be undertaken by all parties and the methods to be used to achieve them contributing heavily to sense of increased urgency were both the scientific findings and reports of the ipcc over the year as noted above growing public concern and the high priority given to climate concerns in numerous high level international meetings in these meetings high expectations were expressed by participating nations that the cop13mop3 in bali would launch process of negotiations that would culminate by 2009 in post2012 agreement on greenhouse gas emissions reductions key meetings included the united nations held two major meetings to express high level of concern about climate change in april the security council held its firstever debate on the relationship among climate change energy peace and security and in early september the united nations general assembly held highlevel ministerial meeting on climate change the g8 meeting in june put climate change high on its agenda and issued declaration that was regarded as compromise between the european proposal for 50 reduction in ghg emissions by 2050 in order to limit global warming to an increase of some 36 degrees fahrenheit and the continuing insistence of the united states on voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gas intensity the final declaration suggested the european proposal would be seriously considered and recognized the continuing principle of common but differentiated responsibilities of nations but also recognized that the efforts of 24 new zealand ministry for the environment projected balance of emissions units during the first commitment period of the kyoto

other countries are needed just prior to the g8 meeting president bush announced may 31 2007 that the united states would convene meeting in washington in late september of major economiesthose that are major emitters of ghgon energy security and climate change26 this meeting occurred september 2728 2007 the us summary of the major economies meeting on energy security and climate change stated discussion refl ected common understanding that any long term goal is aspirational and that it should not be used as basis for burden sharing 27 this continuing rejection of mandatory limits in favor of aspirational goals was disappointment to those in particular the european participants who hoped for breakthrough in the us approach at the meeting future meetings of these participants were discussed to be held after the bali meeting the challenge before the upcoming copmop mee ting in bali remains how to find agreement on the nature of commitments if any that would be acceptable to all the major playersincluding kyoto protocol parties with existing obligations developing countries that are major ghg emitters and the united states whose role is regarded as critical by all potential participants in the post2012 period one key element in the negotiations that go forward at bali and afterward will be the extent to which lowcarbonemitting technological alternatives to the current energy and development patterns will be or can be adopted by both developing and developed countries one major key to this question will be how developing countries can continue to make economic progress and enhance their prosperity while finding the additional resources to address the issue of technological change it is the latter concern that prompts major focus by these countries on the need for financial support from developed nations the major ghgem itting nonannex i countries continue to reject mandatory requirements for themselves while pushing developed annex i nations to continue mandatory ghg reduction goals in the negotiations there are concerns expressed by advocates of mandatory obligations that the us major economies meetings focusing as they do on voluntary measures may serve to reinforce the resistance of developing countries to taking on mandatory obligations there are further concerns that without us agreem ent to mandatory ghg reductions developing countriesand developed nations as wellmay be less willing to take on new or continuing mandatory obligations the latter concern is reflected in the expressed views of some observers that although all parties agree on the goal of completing an agreement by the end of 2009 it may also be difficult to achieve until new administration after us elections takes office and takes different approach to the issue of mandatory emission reduction requirements 28 at preliminary meeting leading up to the december copmop four key elements were outlined as the focus for bali road map 1 mitigation of climate

change 3 financial assistance issues and 4 technology development and transfer it is very likely that while future negotiations will grapple with the effort to obtain some form of legally binding mandatory commitments from all parties the recognition of differing national circumstances and differing abilities of nations to take on various types of commitments will be major elements in the discussions in summary it is widely expected that the outcome in bali is likely to be decisions that focus only on the framework procedures and time frame for the substantive negotiations to follow on post2012 agreement substantive issues will be taken up in those negotiations all parties appear to agree that an agreement needs be completed by the end of 2009 in order to be ratified by the necessary number of parties by 2012 when the kyoto commitment period ends in addition as nations businesses and societies consider their actions and investments in the future it is regarded as important to provide some certainty about what the future national and international obligations are likely to be
