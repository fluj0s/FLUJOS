authoritarian ever since haiti became an independent republic in 1804 when africandescended slaves revolted against their french colonial masters between the end of the rule of toussaint louverture leader of the slave rebellion in 1803 and francois duvalier founder of the 30year dictatorship that fell in 1986 both of whom declared themselves president for life were some 30 other despotic rulers this legacy would appear difficult to overcome in addition most of the traditional centers of power in haiti such as the military the catholic and protestant churches the business sector and the traditional elite find democratic reformist ideas threatening in the haitian context the government apparatus is still staffed principally by duvalierist appointees many of whom have resisted change during the numerous postduvalier governments and will most likely continue to do so longstanding racial conflict haitian history is marked by conflict between two racial groups the mulatto elite and the majority blacks the vast majority of haitians are black poor illiterate peasants the mulattos established their economic power and elite status principally by controlling the business sector both groups enjoyed periods of political dominance black rulers generally emphasized haitis african roots and traditions including the africanbased folk religion voodoo the mulatto elite emphasized european catholic tradition because of their education mulattos held some government positions even during black rule race relations have improved in recent years the once disdained creole dialect used by the majority is now an official language spoken by all haitians interracial marriages are common and the government is longer as dominated by mulattoes but recent political events have again heightened racial and class tensions within haiti the poor black majoritys only access to power has been through public protests when tolerated and the recent elections the mulatto elite wields most of the economic and political power in haiti and generally resists dramatic changes toward redistribution of wealth and privilege to improve the lot of the poor majority crs2 us occupation of haiti and the duvalier legacy for much of this century haitian history was marked by occupation government or the authoritarian duvalier regime the united states intervened in haiti in 1915 to stop civil strife and prevent germany from establishing foothold there by mid august 1915 there were more than 2000 us marines in haiti1 the marines stayed until 1934 overseeing public works tax collection treasury management and the development of native haitian constabulary which was haitis first professional military force some of these contributions were welcome and much needed but the us presence was also deeply resented as an affront to haitian sovereignty many haitians charged the united states with discriminating against blacks by placing mulattoes in positions of power by 1932 the us withdrawal from haiti was well underway during the administration of herbert hoover because of growing concerns about the effects of the occupation president hoover had appointed commission 1930 to study the us involvement in haiti the commission concluded that while the occupation had brought about material improvements to haiti the us occupation also excluded haitians from positions of real authority in the government and the constabulary under president franklin roosevelt disengagement agreement was signed in august 1933 and the last contingent of us marines left haiti in august 19342 francois duvalier and his jeanclaude ruled haiti for nearly 30 years leaving behind legacy of repression and corruption francois or papa doc duvalier became president in 1957 through elections marred by numerous irregularities although duvalier originally ran on platform calling for political liberty and social reform within year he had established himself as dictator under his rule arbitrary imprisonment torture and unexplained deaths became commonplace the duvaliers private militia the tontons macoutes carried out most of this repression the macoutes creole for bogeymen were loosely organized armed gangs enlisted by the duvaliers to eliminate opposition to their rule through violence and extortion the macoutes also served to counterbalance the armys power which the duvaliers kept in check to prevent military coups3 in 1964 the elder duvalier had the constitution amended to make himself presidentforlife in 1971 three months before his death he had it amended again so that he could name his 19yearold jeanclaude presidentforlife in the 1980s baby doc duvaliers marriage to prominent mulatto and their opulent lifestyle stirred up much resentment among the poor black majority who lived in absolute poverty in addition fiscal corruption was rampant and widely recognized in jeanclaudes government as popular dissatisfaction rose his regime grew increasingly repressive in the

ushered in the seventh government in the five and one half years since the young duvaliers departure the first interim government was 6man militarydominated national council of government cng that disbanded the tontons macoutes and allowed the drafting of new constitution the new constitution which over 99 percent of haitian voters reportedly approved in plebiscite guaranteed personal liberties distributed power among president prime minister and two legislative houses and transferred the police to the department of justice it also created an independent electoral council to oversee elections leading to the inauguration of civilian government in february 1988 members of the armed forces and anyone closely associated with the duvalier family dictatorship were barred from running for office but duvalierists in collaboration with the army thwarted the november 1987 elections by mounting violent campaign that culminated in the killing of dozens of voters on election day as result of the violence the elections were suspended in january 1988 the cng ran its own elections widely viewed as rigged in favor of leslie manigat longexiled academic but less than 6 months later on

coalition of political and civic organizations selected ertha pascaltrouillot the only woman on the supreme court as provisional president state council was established with the objective of giving policy guidance to the executive branch the council severed relations with the executive branch however after the executive branch failed to consult the council or to take action against political violence president trouillot headed what was generally considered weak civilian government unable or unwilling to effectively control the military she established and cooperated with an independent electoral council that organized successful elections at the end of the year crs4 election and overthrow of the aristide government4 hopes that haiti would leave behind its authoritarian past were raised on december 16 1990 when haitians elected president national legislators and municipal officials despite security concerns and lack of democratic tradition voter turnout was estimated to be 70 percent on election day and international observers declared the elections generally free and fair the elections were in part the result of strong democratic movement that had emerged in the late 1980s in support of an elected government that would establish order in nonrepressive manner the democratic movement encompassed many elements of haitian society including political parties as well as peasant labor human rights and professional organizations many observers also credited the success and relatively peaceful nature of the elections to the heavy presence of international observers whose presence the government of haiti had requested and to the economic and material support provided by many nations and international organizations jeanbertrand aristide was elected president with 675 percent of the vote and was inaugurated on the fifth anniversary of the collapse of the duvalier dictatorship 37yearold populist roman catholic priest he was the most controversial of 11 candidates ruled eligible to run by the independent provisional electoral council cep to his supporters aristide is martyr willing to risk his life to defend the poor an advocate of liberation theology aristide spoke out against duvalier and the military rulers who followed him in september 1988 an armed group attacked and burned aristides church killing 13 and wounding 70 surrounded by his parishioners aristide escaped unharmed to his detractors aristide is potentially dangerous demagogue whose inflammatory oratory they say encourages the rampages known as dechoukajes or uprooting in creole in which suspected tontons macoutes are attacked or killed by angry mobs aristide reportedly denies that his book 100 verses of dechoukaj condones violence nonetheless the salesian religious order expelled him for preaching politics from the pulpit including what the order called class struggle when aristide became candidate he toned down his revolutionary and anti us rhetoric aristide previously opposed democratic elections in haiti arguing that free and fair elections were impossible as long as duvalierists still had hold on economic and political power nonetheless he joined the race in response to former tontons macoutes chief roger lafontants potential candidacy lafontant was ruled ineligible to run for the presidency and in early january 1991 he led an attempted coup against president trouillot in an effort to prevent aristid whom he called an ultracommunist from taking office on february 7 1991 lafontant seized the national palace and tried to declare martial law instead the army arrested lafontant and promised to have him tried in the civilian courts the popular celebration that followed turned violent as crowds hunted down and lynched dozens of suspected macoutes mobs also burned down the 220year old cathedral in apparent retaliation for homily by the archbishop whose relations 4 this section draws from various new york times and washington post articles for specific details see facts on file 1990 and 1991 crs5 with aristide have long been tense that warned of coming regime of authoritarian politics many foreign diplomats criticized aristide for not condemning the street violence quickly or forcefully enough president aristide was faced with some of the most serious and persistent social economic and political problems in the western hemisphere after 8 months in office aristide had received mixed reviews he was credited with curbing crime in the capital reducing the number of employees in bloated state enterprises and taking actions to bring the military under civilian control but some observers questioned the new governments commitment to democracy neither aristide nor his prime minister belonged to political party and leaders of other political parties criticized him for not reaching out and establishing spirit of cooperation among the democratic elements many legislators including some from aristides own coalition protested the presidents appointment of supreme court judges and ambassadors without consulting the senate as required by the constitution aristide later agreed to consult the legislature but relations between the two branches remained strained aristide was also criticized for his attitude toward the judicial system lafontant was tried in july 1991 for his role in the failed january coup attempt aristide called for life sentence which lafontant received although the constitution limited sentences to 15 years aristide declared the next day national holiday many observers expressed concern over the trial saying it differed little from trials under the duvaliers it lasted for over 20 consecutive hours important witnesses were not called and the court appointed five lawyer trainees to defend lafontant because even his own lawyer felt it too dangerous to defend him initially criticized for not having clear plan the aristide government in july 1991 presented macroeconomic reform and public sector investment plan to representatives of several nations and international lending institutions who lauded the plan and pledged 440 million in fy1992 aid most of that aid was suspended because of the coup that overthrew aristides government on september 30 1991 aristides human rights record in the area of respect for human rights president aristide also had mixed reviews he was criticized for appearing to condone mob violence but was also credited with significantly reducing human rights violations while he was in office some observers believe that as president aristide helped to polarize the situation in haiti by refusing to condemn violent acts of retribution and holding out the threat of mob violence against those who disagreed with him for example aristide refused to condemn the practice of pere lebrun or burning someone to death with necklace consisting of gasolinesoaked auto tire after the former head of the tontons macoutes was sentenced to life in prison aristide gave speech in which he noted that without popular pressure and the threat of pere lebrun in front of the courthouse the life sentence would not have been chosen moreover in september 27 1991 speech aristide appeared to threaten former tontons macoutes with pere lebrun aristide reportedly said you are watching all macoute activities throughout the country we are watching and praying we are crs6 watching and praying if we catch one do not fail to give him what he deserves what nice tool what nice instrument what nice device it is pretty one it is elegant attractive splendorous graceful and dazzling it smells good wherever you go you feel like smelling it it is provided for by the constitution which bans macoutes from the political scene5 in exile aristide condemned the practice of necklacing6 observers contend that in the speech aristide also threatened the bourgeoisie for not having helped his government enough7 some saw the speech as another factor leading to his overthrow just days later and maintain that members of the bourgeoisie were financially supporting the coup leaders in report on the aristide governments human rights record americas watch and two other human rights groups wrote it is unfortunate but understandable that aristides speeches in support of pere lebrun have overshadowed other speeches in which he advocated lawful redress for abusepresident aristide had duty to refrain from any statement that could be understood to support pere lebrun and to speak out firmly and consistently against this barbaric practice his failure to fulfill this duty is serious blemish on his human rights record8 the report also reflected the views of many in the international community when it recognized president aristide as the sole legitimate haitian head of state elected with twothirds majority an unusual mandate in the hemisphere the report further stated while we recognize the need to correct the human rights shortcomings of the aristide government we believe firmly that these failings cannot be used to justify committing yet further serious human rights violation by depriving the haitian people of the right to elect their government9 most human rights monitors credit the aristide government with being the first haitian government to address the need to improve respect for human rights and the needs of the poor majority they assert that progress made during his term was undone by the military regime that followed most sources credit aristide with creating much greater sense of security in haiti than there had been in years he greatly reduced common crime in the city the removal of the chefs sections or sheriffs many of whom had ruled rural haiti through extortion and violence for decades brought greater security to the countryside as well according to the state 5 foreign broadcast information service daily report latin america aristide address 27 sep after visit to october 7 1991 pp 1819 6

political killings also rose dramatically after aristide was ousted the september 1991 coup began just four days after aristide addressed the united nations an event he reportedly said marked the end of haitis dark past of dictatorship the state department estimated couprelated deaths at 300500 while amnesty international estimated them to number over 1500 role of the military in the democratic process under the military dominated interim governments the haitian army frequently impeded the democratic process after the departure of the last military dictator in march 1990 however some observers believed there had been transformation of the army to one supportive of democracy throughout the 1990 electoral process the 7000man army proved itself capable of establishing and maintaining order several factors accounted for the change including attrition of antidemocratic elements with the downfall of the various interim governments the armys inability to form viable government new generation of officers interested in reform and professionalization of the armed forces and growing domestic and international pressure for civilian democracy initially the army accepted aristides assertion of authority including his purge of the haitian army high command brig general cedras who oversaw security for the december elections was reportedly reluctant participant in the coup but as its spokesman he said aristide was ousted for meddling in army affairs some analysts argue the army does not want to relinquish control so that it can continue to profit from contraband and narcoticstrafficking in its attempts to implement provisions of the haitian constitution that impose civilian authority over the military the aristide government met significant army resistance for example the constitution calls for the separation of the police from the army with the police under the command of the ministry of justice the law also mandates that cases involving military abuses against civilians be tried in civilian courts not by the military the military had resisted previous efforts to execute those laws military personnel were prosecuted for human rights abuses under any of the interim governments when he was overthrown aristide was opening an attack on corruption pressing reforms in the army and creating civilian police force the militarys trend toward improved human rights under the aristide government was reversed after the coup according to the state departments 1991 human rights report that and other human rights reports stated that the military used violence to intimidate political opposition popular organizations the urban poor and the media10 during the numerous interim governments as well as under aristides rule many former members of the army and the

rights violations or sent consistent signals that macoute violence would not be tolerated the public sometimes took matters into its own hands carrying out popular justice or summary public executions
