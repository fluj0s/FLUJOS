dianetics date the main question we face at this time but which way man goes from this point is actually not the question we do have the means by which man could improve himself and his societies we have them in scientology in its application to education because we can educate people today perhaps for the first time and the main question which of course faces man at this time is is he going to live long enough to avail himself of this material and of course thats all up to throw of the die flip of the coin and other such chances or perhaps to our own abilities and endeavors now because we can take all those mechanisms away from them wholesale lots just remember that all those mechanisms make game and some people like that game so it requires certain amount of granting of beingness on your part to let the other fellow play game the only game which i dont think we dare let the other fellow play is blow up earth and if we can influence the stopping of that in any way why i think were more or less honor bound to do so this excerpt was taken from london congress on human problems life is game an article by l ron hubbard excerpted from the games congress game has many factors and these factors are all very nicely answered so that we have four types of games that is four game conditions you might say there is game condition knowing man knows he is playing game and therefore he is living man thinks he is playing game of living but is actually playing five or six other games he doesnt know hes playing well thats an aberrated condition what is the aberration the aberration is totally concerned with unknowing game condition in which he is involved if he doesnt know hes playing these games why then they are aberrative to him well how about nogame conditions well actually nogame conditions are quite interesting since they are the stuff of which thetan is made for many millennia man able to write has sought for truth able to write able to talk able to think observe hes sought for truth scientology might have been called at one time or another just another search for truth its hideous thing to realize that mans search for truth was bound to failure it could not have been possible for man to discover truth since the totality of the barriers which lie between him and truth consist of games lies difficulties and unless he goes in game condition unless he goes into condition of nonfactuality he never arrives in condition of truth the road to truth for man who has been living lies through lies by examining and processing the lies that are told he achieves truth if he tries to achieve truth directly he perishes on the road and thus weve had narrow squeak we were seeking for truth and if these factors had not been discovered it is very very likely that our search would have deadended since man cannot handle truth alone and come up with answers to anything this is the most hideous little booby trap that was ever rigged life is game you have to address the games the man is playing and has played in order to restore him to condition where he is able to sit serenely or play game at will in other words the road to truth detoured through games through aberrative conditions through stress and strife games is the common denominator of it and those games contain freedom barriers and purposes and the road back is the same road and to sit with nice turban on and contemplate your navel or whatever they do in the upper snowy regions of india pronounced indjuh might benefit other people whom you would not trouble but is not likely to do anything for you life comes apart at the seams and is understood and restores itself to any condition you care to have only so long as only so long as it follows through games l ron hubbard excerpted from the
