independently in affordable accessible housing became prominent issue starting in 1999 as the result of supreme court decision olmstead v lc the court held that institutionalization of persons with mental disabilities in lieu of communitybased care may constitute discrimination shortly after the olmstead decision on february 1 2001 the president announced the new freedom initiative an effort through multiple federal agencies to ensure full participation in society of persons with disabilities part of the new freedom initiative was executive order 13217 which implemented the olmstead decision by ensuring among other things that all people with disabilities not just those with mental illness benefit from communitybased treatment in order to ensure that persons with disabilities may live in community settings rather than in institutions affordable and accessible housing is necessary the department of housing and urban development hud operates number of programs that provide housing for persons with disabilities in various ways the section 811 supportive housing for persons with disabilities program provides capital grants and project rental assistance to nonprofit developers of housing targeted specifically to persons with disabilities prior to creation of section 811 persons with disabilities lived together with elderly residents defined by hud as households with one or more adults age 62 or older in developments funded through the section 202 supportive housing for the elderly program the projectbased section 8 and public housing programs give project owners the option of dedicating facilities to elderly residents residents with disabilities or both populations together both the section 811 and section 8 programs set aside housing vouchers for persons with disabilities and two hud block grant programshome and the community development block grantmay be used by states and communities to construct or rehabilitate housing for persons with disabilities in addition to these hud programs the low income housing tax credit lihtc administered by the internal revenue service may be used by states to target housing to special needs populations including persons with disabilities the lihtc may be used in conjunction with hud grants including capital grants through the section 811 program the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 made it possible for developers of section 811 housing to qualify for higher tax credit rate which could potentially make these mixed financing developments more feasible in the 110 th congress the frank melville supportive h ousing investment act hr 5772 bill that would make changes to the section 811 program was approved by the house on september 17 2008 among its changes the bill would turn over funding of section 811 vouchers to the section 8 program and would create demonstration program for section 811 rental assistance to be used in conjunction with other funding streams including the lihtc and home program version of the bill was also introduced in the senate s 3593 this report will be updated as events warrant

physical disabilities developmental disabilities or mental illnesses frequently face difficulty in finding suitable housing together with supportive services often referred to as persondirected or consumerdirected services in which they can live as active members of their community for those individuals with physical disabilities it may be difficult to find rental units that are accessible and some prospective residents with disabilities may face discrimination in their search for housing 1 zoning laws may also prevent the construction of homes where persons with disabilities live together2 in addition the affordability of housing and services may be an issue individuals with disabilities may have low incomes due to the inability to work the need for additional education and training to find suitable employment or employer discrimination3 insufficient income can put the costs of inhome care and supportive services out of reach and services are not always available in all states through programs such as medicare and medicaid 4 as result of these limitations among other causes persons with disabilities may be institutionalized in nursing homes psychiatric hospitals or similar facilities rather than living independently5 those individuals not in such facilities may still live in group homes or small multifamily housing developments dedicated to persons with disabilities instead of on their own6 however national recognition of the need for appropriate housing for persons with disabilities gained support after the 1999 supreme court decision in the case of olmstead v lc in that case two women who had spent years in psychiatric hospital argued that their institutionalization constituted discrimination under the americans with disabilities act the supreme court agreed finding that states are required to provide communitybased treatment for persons with mental disabilities when the states treatment professionals determine that such placement is appropriate and the placement can be reasonably accommodated7 shortly after the ruling in olmstead on february 1 2001 president bush announced the new freedom initiative an effort through multiple federal agencies in cooperation with the states to ensure full participation in society of persons with disabilities part of the new freedom initiative was an executive order implementing the olmstead decision to ensure that all people with disabilities not just those with mental illnesses benefit from communitybased treatment8 however for many states and 1 see for example margery austin turner

in community environment without the availability of accessible and affordable housing9 the federal government makes available funds to finance subsidized rental housing for persons with disabilities primarily through the depart ment of housing and urban development hud the section 811 supportive housing for persons with disabilities program is the only federal program that funds supportive housing exclusively for persons with disabilities however the section 811 program is not the only source of funds to provide housing units for persons with disabilities over the years number of other hud programs have been used to fund housing units dedicated to persons with disabilities and many of those units are still in service these programs include the section 202 supportive housin g for the elderly program public housing the projectbased section 8 rental assistance program and the section 8 voucher program in recent years federal block grant programsthe community development block grant and home investment partnerships pr ogramhave been source of funds used by states and local communities to develop and rehabilitate housing for persons with disabilities another source of funds is the low income housing tax credit administered by the internal revenue service through which state governments have the discretion to prioritize housing for persons with disabilities this report describes how federal funds are used to develop housing designated for persons with disabilities it also discusses current issues surrounding housing for persons with disabilities including mixed financing arrangements worst case housing needs persons with disabilities who are homeless and legislation in the 110 th congress

specifically for persons with disabilities individuals with disabilities may also live in housing that has not been specifically designed for their needs however the fair housing act fha enacted as part of the civil rights act of 1968 contains provisions that are meant to ensure that persons with disabilities may obtain accessible rental housing even in facilities not specifically designed for them the fha was created to prevent discrimination in the provision of housing based on race color religion and national origin 10 in 1988 the fair housing amendments act pl 100430 amended the fha to prevent discrimination based on handicap the fair housing act defines handicap as 1 having physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities 2 having record of such impairment or 3 being perceived as having 9 see for example linda velgouse and molly dworken olmstead update presentation for the american association of homes and services for the aging annual

against persons based on handicap the fha imposes affirmative duties on housing providers under the fair housing amendments act of 1988 if landlord fails to follow certain requirements to make housing accessible to persons with disabilities it is considered discrimination in the area of new construction beginning 30 months after implementation of pl 100430 in 1988 it became unlawful for multifamily housing developers to design and construct housing of four or more units that fails to 1 have common areas that are accessible and useable by persons with disabilities 2 have doors wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs and 3 include units with accessible routes through the unit bathrooms and kitchens that are wheelchair accessible electrical outlets light switches and thermostats that are accessible bathrooms with reinforcements where grab bars may be installed and kitchens and baths that may be maneuvered through with wheelchair 12 for units in older facilities or in units not covered by the fha the fair housing amendments act recognized that modifications to units may be necessary to make them accessible to persons with disabilities under the law it is discrimina tory for landlords to refuse to allow tenants to make physical changes to the premisesrefer red to as reasonable modificationswhere changes are necessary to afford tenants full enjoyment of the premises13 in addition the law gives tenants the right to ask their landlords for reasonable accommodations in the rules policies practices or services that ordinarily apply to tenants living in rental property it is considered discrimination under the fha for landlord to refuse to make reasonable accommodation where it is necessary to give residents with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their dwelling unit14 reasonable modifications and reasonable accommodations are described below g20g142g138g156g152g151g138g139g149g142g561g15g152g141g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 while the fha may require landlords to permit tenants to make reasonable modifications to the rental premises the statute neither defines the term reasonable modification nor the circumstances under which modifications might be required to ensure tenants enjoyment of the premises however hud and the department of justice doj have published joint guidance describing reasonable modifications15 they may include changes to rental unit such as widening doorways installing ramp or grab bars or lowering cabinets16 the huddoj guidance requires that there be an identifiable relationship between the tenants disability and the modification if there is not landlord may refuse to allow the alteration17 landlords are not required to pay for modifications and if the modifications would prevent future tenants enjoyment of the premises the landlord may require tenants to restore the unit to its original state when moving out in order to ensure that this occurs landlord may require tenants to deposit 11 42

cannot require tenants to pay higher security deposit because of modifications to the property while federal program exists specifically to help tenants with disabilities pay for home modifications funding may be available at the state or local level for example some states make funds available through their medicaid waiver programs to allow persons with disabilities to make modifications19 states may also set up grant or loan programs using state local or federal funds to assist with home modifications sources of federal funds that could be used for this purpose include the home investment partnerships block grant and the community development block grant these programs are described later in this report

landlords may be required to make reasonable accommodations to ensure that tenants with disabilities may use and enjoy their dwelling reasonable accommodations may involve altering or making an exception to rules policies practices or services that would otherwise apply to tenants but when applied to an individual with disability may prevent them from maintaining their tenancy or fully enjoying use of the facility 20 as with reasonable modifications there must be relationship between the disability and the requested accommodation however unlike reasonable modifications tenant may request an accommodation that will involve cost to the housing provider although the requested accommodation cannot pose an undue financial or administrative burden and cannot fundamentally alter the

housing for elderly residents 23 and those with disabilities ultimately resulting in creation of the section 811 program however units for persons with disabilities that were created as part of the

the section 202 program was created as part of the housing act of 1959 pl 86372 and provided lowinterest loans to nonprofit developers to construct multifamily housing for families where one or more person is age 62 or older section 202 did not initially provide housing for persons with disabilities five years after the creation of the section 202 program the housing act of 1964 pl 88560 added nonelderly handi capped individuals and families to the definition of elderly families under the section 202 program at the time handicapped was defined by pl 88560 as physical impairment 1 expected to be of longcontinued or indefinite duration 2 that substantially impedes the ability to live independently and 3 is of such nature that the ability to live independently could be improved by more suitable housing conditions mental or developmental disability was not included in the definition the housing act of 1964 also changed the name of the secti on 202 program to housing for the elderly or handicapped however the law did not require that certain number of units be set aside for tenants with disabilities or direct that units be made accessible very few tenants who were considered nonelderly handicapped participated in the section 202 program between 1964 and 1974 although data were not collected hud estimated that through 1977 less than 1 of section 202 tenants were nonelderly

the word physical from the term physical impairment in the definition of handicap and also expanded the definition of handicap to include developmental disabilities27 the removal of the word physical was meant to make persons with mental illnesses eligible for section 202 housing28 however the development of housing for this population did not occur immediately in 1978 in the conference report accompanying the housing and community development amendments pl 95557 congress acknowledged that the re has been some confusion over whether chronically mentally ill persons are eligible for section 202 housing and that it was never the intent of congress to exclude chronically mentally ill persons from participating in the section 202 program 29 the report went on to direct hud to develop criteria and standards for providing housing for this population in 1978 hud undertook demonstration program together with the department of health and human services t hen the department of health

accessible putting project sponsors at disadvantage in applying for funds35 the setaside was meant to address this issue in addition pl 95557 specified that nonprofit sponsors of section 202 housing were expected to develop innovative ways of providing housing for persons with disabilities including group homes and independent living complexes integrated into the surrounding community together with supportive services tailored to resident needs36 after enactment of the housing and community development amendments of 1978 with its setaside for housing for persons with disabilities the number of developments built specifically for these households versus elderly households increased37 hud estimates that by the end of the 1980s approximately 10 of units funded through the section 202 program were in facilities designed for persons with disabilities38 nearly ten years after enactment of the h ousing and community development amendments another law made changes to the way in which persons with disabilities were served under the section 202 program the housing and community development act of 1987 pl 100242 amended the law to require that 15 of the total amount available for section 202 loans be set aside for persons with disabilities rather than the 50 million established in the 1978 act pl 95 557 in appropriations acts from fy1988 throug h fy1991 congress went beyond the statutory set aside however and required that 25 of section 202 loan authority be used for housing for persons with disabilities39 another change made by pl 100242 involved rental subsidies for those section 202 units for persons with disabilities since the enactment of the housing and community development act of 1974 section 202 units for both elderly and disabled residents had been subsidized through the projectbased section 8 rental assistance program however there was growing acknowledgment that section 8 rental assistance was not sufficient to support units for persons with disabilities because it did not take account of the higher cost of providing housing in smaller developments such as group homes 40 pl 100242 specified that rental assistance in projects for persons with disabilities should be provided through separate subsidy program based on the total actual and necessary reasonable costs of developing and operating the project not including however the costs of supportive services41 the fy1989 hud appropriations act pl 100404 provided rental assistance funds for housing for persons with disabilities separately from those for elderly residents this

separation of housing for persons with disabilities from housing for elderly residents that began in 1978 with set aside in the section 202 program and continued with separate rental assistance in 1987 was made permanent in the cranstongonzalez national affordable housing act of 1990 pl 101625 congress completely separated housing for persons with disabilities from the section 202 program by creating the section 811 supportive housing for persons with disabilities program not only did pl 101625 separate the housing for persons with disabilities program from the housing for the elderly program it also changed the way in which units would be financed under both the section 202 and section 811 programs until the enactment of pl 101625 units created through the section 202 program had been financed with combination of loans and projectbased section 8 rental assistance contracts pl 101625 instituted method of financing in which section 202 and section 811 developments would be financed through capital grants rather than loans as long as units remain afford able to very lowincome residents for at least 40 years project owners need not repay the capital grants the law also created new form of rental assistance similar to section 8 called prac or pr oject rental assistance contracts in addition the law instituted new way of determining development cost limitations for both section 202 and section 811 facilities the new method was to take account of special design features for persons with disabilities and congregate space for supportive services among other factors the provisions creating the section 811 program originated in the senate version of the bill s 566 that would become the cranstongonzalez national affordable housing act the senate banking committee in its report regarding the bill described the reasons behind creating program separate from section 202 the committee believes that separation of the programs for elderly and persons with disabilities would further the goal of developing program that meets the housing and related needs of nonelderly persons with disabilities separate program would spur the development of bureaucracy knowledgeable bout and sensitive to the special needs of tenants with disabilities needs which can differ from those of many elderly residents separate program would also create an institutional voice for housing concerns that are particular to this constituency 43 the report also stressed the importance of changing the terminology used to refer to persons served through the section 811 program replac ing handicapped persons with persons with disabilities44 community integration was another important goal of the new section 811 program in the years leading up to the enactment of pl 101625 group homes and other facilities dedicated only to those persons with disabilities had been the focus of housing funded 42 the section 202 units funded with this new rental assistance are sometimes

made tenantbased rental assistance part of the section 811 program by authorizing the use of vouchers for eligible households79 the vouchers sometimes referred to as mainstream vouchers are administered using the same rules that govern the section 8 voucher program unlike section 8 vouchers however these vouchers are funded through the section 811 account for initial fiveyear terms section 8 vouchers are funded on an annual basis the first year in which congress set aside funding for mainstream vouchers was fy1997 the hud appropriations act for that year pl 104204 specified that hud could use up to 25 of the amount appropriated for the section 811 program for fiveyear vouchers in the first two years that the section 811 vouchers were distributed only public housing authorities phas could administer the vouche rs but beginning in fy1999 private nonprofit organizations were eligible to apply to administer them 80 hud makes vouchers available through an annual notice of funding availability nofa process through which phas and private nonprofit organizations interested in administer ing the vouchers apply to hud applicants are scored based on number of factors which include the number of persons with disabilities at or below poverty in the area to be served by the applicant as well as the existence of agreements with organizations that will provide supportive services to voucher holders 81 since 2005 hud has required voucher administrators phas and private nonprofit organizations to help persons with disabilities who have section 811 vouchers to obtain supportive services if they request them as well as to provide technical assistance to landlords in making reasonable accommodations or reasonable modifications82 the nofas issued by hud in fy1997fy1999 specified that the section 811 vouchers should remain available to disabled families during the initial funding term of the voucher five years but were silent on who could use the voucher if the original family left the program either voluntarily or due to eviction or other nonvoluntary reason after the initial funding period was over advocates for persons with disabilities have pointed out that these vouchers may have been provided to nondisabled households after the original tenant left the program83 however in annual appropriations acts since fy2005 congress has required that section 811 vouchers be made available to disabled families upon turnover 84 further in 2004 hud began to require that phas track the disability status of families using section 811 vouchers and

act of 1956 pl 841020 authorized the public housing administration predecessor to hud to provide units specifically for lowincome elderly individuals 88 the first elderlyonly public housing development was built by 196089 beginning in 1961 the hud definition of elderly family was amended to include individuals with disabilities of any age90 since then persons with disabilities have lived in public housing facilities designated for elderly residents defined as households where one or more person is age 62 or older public housing developments designated for derly residents and where mixed population of elderly residents and residents with disabilities live together have been controversial during the early years of public housing for elderly persons disabled residents made up only small proportion of residents the number of residents with disabilities living in public housing for the elderly began to increase in the 1980s and early 1990s for at least two reasons first individuals with mental illnesses were less likely to be institutionalized as result of the availability of outpatient mental health care and were therefore in need of affordable housing91 second factor was passage of the 1988 fair housing act amendments pl 100430 the amendments added persons with handicap to the class of indi viduals protected from discrimination in the provision of housing the definition of handica p included individuals with alcohol and drug addictions92 following these changes public housing experienced an increase in the number of younger residents with disabilities often with mental illnesses and addictions along with the increase public housing authorities reported greater number of incidents of disruptive behavior and some elderly residents reported feeling unsafe 93 due to tension between elderly residents and residents with disabilities in the housing and community development act of 1992 pl 102550 congress allowed phas to designate buildings as elderly only disabled only or as mixed population facilities94 in 1996 the public housing opportunity extension act of 1996 pl 104120 streamlined the process for designating public housing projects if

to enactment of the housing and community development act of 1992 pl 102550 as discussed earlier provisions in pl 102550 permitted owners of public housing and projectbased section 8 developments where elderly residents and residents with disabilities lived together to either designate buildings as elderly only or to prioritize elderly tenants 103 section 8 owners were given the authority to create preference for elderly families in these designated buildings though they could not exclude disabled families altogether phas were given the authority to designate entire buildings as elderly only although phas cannot evict tenants with disabilities if building is designated as elderly only with attrition eventually building may have only elderly residents these policy changes affected the ability of tenants with disabilities to live in these facilities from fy1997 through fy2002 congress appropriated funds for section 8 vouchers in order to assist tenants with disabilities who would

act pl 110161 provided 30 million for section 8 vouchers for tenants with disabilities affected by the designation or restriction of tena nt populations to elderly only unlike section 811 mainstream vouchers section 8 designated housing vouchers for persons with disabilities shall remain available to other disabled households upon turnover to the extent practicable emphasis added105 section 811 vouchers must be made available only to families where an adult member has disability hud defines the term to the extent practicable to mean that before voucher can be provided to nondisabled

with disabilities others with special needs include individuals and families who are homeless elderly individuals or other populations in need of housing with supportive services112 states may choose to make housing units for populations with special needs one of the priorities in the competition for tax credits in number of ways113 these methods include requiring developers to set aside portion of units for special needs populationsfor example north carolina requires that the greater of five units or 10 of units in each tax credit development be devoted to persons with disabilities or those who are homeless114 setting aside certain dollar value or percentage of available tax credits for specified populationfor example illinois sets aside 2 million of the total available tax credits for developments where at least 50 of units serve persons with special needs 115 developing scoring system in the competition for tax credits that awards additional points for proposals that take account of certain special needs populationsfor example new mexico awards 15 points in the tax credit competition to developers that propose to build housing in which at least 25 of units are dedicated to

localities that receive home funds have discretion in choosing the populations they wish to serve also like the lihtc jurisdictions that receive home funds develop plan regarding how they will distribute funds this is done through huds consolidated plan process jurisdictions applying for funds from four hud formula grant programs including home119 submit single consolidated plan to hud the plan includes an assessment of community needs and proposal to address those needs using both federal funds and community resources state and local plans must also contain housing needs assessment including the need for housing for persons with disabilities 120 in developing the plan states and communities must adopt citizen participation plan through which they are encouraged to consult with citizens with disabilities121 states are further required to consult with organizations that provide services including fair housing services to persons with disabilities when preparing their consolidated plan 122 after taking into consideration the needs of persons with disabilities home recipient jurisdictions may choose to prioritize housing for persons with disabilities as part of their consolidated plans123 in the tenantbased rental assistance portion of the program the home regulations specify that recipient jurisdictions may choose to establish preference for tenants with special needs including persons with disabilities124 further recipients of home funds may choose to target tenantbased rental assistance to individuals with specific disability in terms of new or rehabilitated rental housing that may be developed with home funds communities can choose to develop not only multifamily rental housing and single family homes but also transitional housing single room occupancy projects and group homes 125 some jurisdictions may find that these types of housing developments are well suited for tenants with disabilities

improvement of neighborhoods the creation of public facilities or the promotion of economic opportunity funds may also be used to rehabilitate housing including making housing accessible for persons with disabilities cdbg funds may also be used to make public facilities accessible to persons with disabilities130 in addition communities may use cdbg funds for public services which include such

order to support the design construction and ongoing operating costs of project in addition to federal funds provided through hud programs affordable housing developers may use mortgage revenue bonds tax credits and local housing trust fund resources among other sources to develop housing for lowincome and special needs populations while hud funds once might have been sufficient on their own to develop an affordable housing project that is rarely the case today this is true for section 811 developers who often must bring together multiple sources of funding to develop project in 2000 in order to help section 811 and section 202 developers bring together multiple financing sources congress enacted law that makes the interaction of section 811 funds and the lowincome housing tax credits lihtcs more feasible by changing the definition of private nonprofit organization in the section 811 statute this change and its implication for section 811 developers is described below the value of lihtcs are determined in part based on the cost of developing property referred to as the qualified basis 132 the costs of constructing acquiring and rehabilitating 129 hud notice cpd05003

the property is calculated 2 this amount is reduced by federal grants received by the developer and 3 the resulting value is then multiplied by the percentage of space in the housing development that is devoted to lowincome use this percentage is the lowe r of either the unit fractionthe ratio of lowincome units to all units in the buildingor the floor space fractionthe ratio of square footage in

qualified basis but the amount must then be reduced by any federal grants received by the developer which in turn reduces the value of the tax credits therefore if nonprofit developer were to receive section 811 capital grant its value would be subtracted in calculating the qualified basis which could result in minimal lihtcs the homeownership and economic opportunity act pl 106569 enacted in 2000 allowed forprofit limited partnerships where nonprofit organization is the sole general partner to be eligible section 811 owners the changed law allows nonprofit section 811 grantee to loan the section 811 capital grant to the limited partnership under this arrangement the section 811 funds are longer federal grant to be subtracted in calculating the qualified basis potentially increasing the value of lihtcs the change in the law to allow forprofit limited partnerships to own section 811 housing developments has not immediately made mixed financing arrangements common however the transactions are complicated and may require extensive expertise in housing finance to make them work hud acknowledges that most developers seek to avoid the use of federal grant financing in most lihtc projects 134 in addition the treatment of section 811 prac in tax credit transactions has been unclear although the irs has created exceptions to the rule that federal grants do not count toward the qualified basis of property for certain categories of rental assistance section 811 prac has not been among the exceptions the programs that have been exempted from the requirement include section 8 projectbased rental assistance payments and public housing capital and operating funds 135 the native american housing block grant program136 rent supplement and rental assistance payments programs137 and the shelter plus care and single room occupancy programs138 despite language in the homeownership and economic opportunity act of 2000 indicating that congress intended section 811 and section 202 assistance to be included in calculating qualified basis rather than subtracted from it the irs has not issued ruling that would be necessary to make this possible 139 another possible limitation in developing mixed finance projects using federal grants such as section 811 together with the lihtc was removed with passage of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 under lihtc law developers may qualify for tax credits worth roughly 9 or 4 140 under previous lihtc law the high er 9 credit was available for continued 4to determine the total annual value of the tax credits 133 in addition to the costs of materials construction and or rehabilitation among the costs included in determining qualified basis are contractor fees developer fees engineering fees and the cost of drawing up architectural specifications among the costs that are not included are the cost of land and fees associated with longterm financing see joseph guggenheim tax credits for low

credit was available for either federally subsidized new construction or existing buildings the statutory definition of federally subsidized included below market federal loans the structure used by limited partnerships to loan section 811 capital grants141 the fact that developers of federally subsidized buildings did not qualify for the higher tax credit made fina ncing projects with the lihtc less lucrative developers either had to accept the lower 4 credit or to set up system through which federal grants were loaned to the project at market rate of interest 142 however pl 110289 removed the phrase below market federal loans from the definition of federal subsidy in the lihtc statute this makes all federally subsidized new construction placed in service after the effective date of pl

persons with di sabilities and hud persons with disabilities have need for affordable housing since 1991 hud has regularly released reports ten to date on the worst case needs for affordable housing in the united states144 hud defines households with worst case housing needs as very lowincome renter households those households with incomes at or below 50 of area median income that do not receive rental assistance and either 1 pay more than half their income toward rent or 2 live in severely substandard housing 145 substandard housing is measured using the ameri can housing survey definition of housing with severe physical problems these are varying degrees of problems with plumbing heating electrical wiring and upkeep of the physical unit or public areas146 using data from the 2005 american housing survey in its most recent report affordable housing needs 2005 hud found that 599 million households had worst case housing needs statistically significant increase of 16 over the 518 million households that had worst case needs in 2003147 this represented an increase from 489 of all us households to 550 of all households continued department of the treasury credit rate formula for

estimate of the number of persons with disabilities who have worst case housing needs because disability status is not reported in the american housing survey hud used three sources of income as proxies to estimate households where nonelderly adult member has disability these three proxies were 1 social security and railroad retirement benefits 2 supplemental security income ssi and 3 public assistance such as welfare using these three income sources as proxies hud estimated that there were 542000 households with nonelderly adult member with disability that had worst case housing needs 148 these estimates did not include households with children less than year after releasing the affordable housing needs 2005 report however hud released supplement in which it revised the estimate of households with nonelderly adult who has disability and that has worst case housing needs149 the supplement used an additional income proxy to arrive at an increased number of persons with disabilities with worst case housing needs over the number that had been estimated in the original report in addition to social securityrailroad retirement benefits ssi and public assistance the supplemental report included cases where respondents to the american housing survey reported that they received social security disability insurance ssdi workers compensation veterans disability payments or other disability payments using these four income sources as proxy for disability status the hud supplement estimated the number of households having nonelderly adult member with disability in two different categories those households with children and those without children the original affordable housing needs 2005 report did not report the number of households with children and an adult with disability of very lowincome households without children and an adult with disability hud reported that 694000 had worst case housing needs making up 116 of all households with worst case housing needs the original estimate in the affordable housing needs 2005 report was 542000 of those very lowincome households with children and an adult with disability the supplement estimated that 365000 had worst case housing needs making up 61 of all households with worst case housing needs nonetheless hud noted that even its updated estimates are an undercount of persons with disabilities who have worst case housing needs 150 this is due to the fact that homeowners homeless persons and persons living in institutions are not part of the worst case needs calculation the hud supplement to its affordable housing needs 2005 report was in part in response to an analysis commissioned by the consortium for citizens with disabilities ccd housing task force coalition of groups that advocates for persons with disabilities151 the ccd report whose author had been an author on previous hud affordable housing needs reports like the hud supplement used the fourth income proxyssdi

it became more prevalent phenomenon in the 1970s and 1980s when the homeless population began to grow and become more visible to the general public explanations for the growth in homelessness include the demolition of skid rows 153 the decreased availability of affordable housing generally the reduced need for seasonal unskilled labor the reduced likelihood that relatives will accommodate homeless family members the decreased value of public benefits and changed admissions standards at mental hospitals 154 early in the current decade attention was again turned to homeless individuals this time to those persons who experience socalled chronic homelessness when president bush announced an initiative to end chronic homelessness within ten years in the late 1990s researchers identified chronically homeless individuals as those who have disability including those who suffer from mental illness andor substance abuse disorders and who have been homeless for long periods of time 155 according to hud person is chronically homeless if they have been continuously homeless for one year or have experienced four episodes of homelessness in the past three years156 estimates of the number of chronically homeless individuals as percentage of the total homeless population range from 18 to 27157 rates of mental health problems are estimated to exist in more than 60 of chronically homeless individuals and more than 80 of individuals are estimated to have alcohol or drug problems 158 medical problems including hivaids are also prevalent among chronically homeless individuals159

bill to amend the section 811 program the frank melville supportive housing investment act of 2008 hr 5772 was introduced in the house on april 10 2008 on july 30 2008 the bill was approved by the house financial services committee and on september 17 2008 it passed the full house under suspension of the rules similar bill with the same title was introduced in the senate on september 25 2008 s 3593 hr 5772 would make number of changes to the section 811 program one of these would be to eliminate the funding of tenantbased rental assistance through the section 811 program account advocates for persons with disabilities contend that section 811 vouchers are poorly targeted and may not always be used to serve households with disabilities 162 instead existing and future vouchers would be funded through the section 8 account the bill would authorize sufficient section 8 funds to support the number of vouchers that were funded in fy2008 hr 5772 also would codify the requirement that congress has inserted in recent appropriations acts requiring section 811 vouchers to be turned over to households where an adult member has disability when the current voucher holders give them up another proposed change would reduce the concentr ation of persons with disabilities in section 811funded housing by limiting the number of units in building developed with section 811 capital grants to 25 of the total units in the building limiting the number of units for persons with disabilities in building would also encourage developers to use other funding sources such as the low income housing tax credit lihtc to supplement the section 811 funding this 25 limitation would not apply to group homes or independent living facilities in cases where grantees combine section 811 capital grants with funding from other sources such as lihtcs for the development of multifamily housing the bill would delegate the review and processing of the project to state or local housing finance

section 811 capital grant to the hfa together with the tax credit is thought to be more efficient in addition hr 5772 would create project rental assistanceonly competitive demonstration program to encourage mixed finance developments where rental units for persons with disabilities would be interspersed with units for nondisabled households the rental assistance awarded through the demonstration program instead of subsidizing units developed through section 811 capital grants would be used to subsidize units of housing developed through lihtcs the home program or projects develope d with government funds from other sources under the demonstration program only extremely lowincome persons with disabilities would be eligible for the assisted units those with incomes at or below 30 of area median income and more than 25 of units in lihtc and home developments would be allowed to be setaside for those households the initial term of the rental assistance would be 15 years although facilities would be required to operate for at least 30 years as supportive housing for persons with disabilities the bill also would amend the definition of person with disabilities in the section 811 program to include person who meets the social security act definition of disability as noted earlier in this report the current section 811 definition does not reference the social security definition in addition the bill would expand the section 811 definition to include those individuals who are living with hivaids consistent with the public housing and section 8 programs see appendix current section 811 regulations state that person whose sole impairment is diagnosis of hiv positive ie does not meet the qualifying criteria in the statute will not be eligible for occupancy in section 811 project the proposed language would instead state that the term person with disabilities shall not exclude persons who have the disease of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or any conditions arising from the etiologic agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome hr 5772 also woul d make clear that persons age 62 and older may not be considered person with disabili ties for purposes of the section 811 program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34728 g561 g5g20g21g556g345g342g561g3g153g153g142g151g141g146g161g495
