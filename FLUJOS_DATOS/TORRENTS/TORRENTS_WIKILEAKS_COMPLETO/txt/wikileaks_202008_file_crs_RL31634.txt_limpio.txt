the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of 1996 pl 104191 provided for changes in the health insurance market it guaranteed the availability and renewability of health insurance coverage for certain employees and individuals and limited the use of preexisting condition restrictions the act created federal standards for insurers health maintenance organizations hmos and employerprovided health plans including those that selfinsure it permitted however substantial state flexibility for compliance with the requirements on insurers hipaa also included tax provisions relating to health insurance it permitted limited number of small businesses and selfemployed individuals to contribute to taxadvantaged medical savings accounts msas established in conjunction with highdeductible health insurance plans it increased the deduction for health insurance that selfemployed taxpayers may claim in addition it allowed longterm care expenses to be treated like deductible medical expenses and clarified the tax treatment of longterm care insurance finally the act included administrative simplification and privacy provisions instructing the secretary of hhs to issue standards addressing the electronic transmission of health information and the privacy of personally identifiable medical information since the passage of hipaa there have been subsequent amendments in 1996 new provisions required group health plans and insurers to cover minimum hospital stays for maternity care and for limited period to provide parity in certain mental health benefits parity was later extended for one year in 1998 provision was passed requiring health plans that cover mastectomy to also offer reconstructive breast surgery amendments have also increased the tax deduction for premiums paid by selfemployed taxpayers the act as amended continues to generate numerous questions what kinds of policies does it cover does it help people who are currently uninsured does it help people with preexisting medical conditions how does it affect health insurance premiums how do its requirements interact with the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra continuation coverage answers to those questions as well as other commonly asked questions are provided as well as descriptions of each of the major sections of hipaa some of the answers provided may not be definitive this is because in some cases final regulations have not yet been promulgated other regulations such as those defining the administrative simplification provisions remain under development in addition the answers to many questions about the requirements on the individual health insurance market depend upon particular state responses to the act for some provisions states were allowed the

22 the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of 1996 overview and guidance on frequently asked questions the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 pl 104191 hipaa provided for changes in the health insurance market and imposed certain federal requirements on health insurance plans offered by public and private employers it guaranteed the availability and renewability of health insurance coverage for certain employees and individuals and limited the use of preexisting condition restrictions the act established federal standards for insurers health maintenance organizations hmos and employer plans including those who self insure however it allowed states and sometimes insurers substantial state flexibility for compliance with the federal requirements hipaa also included tax provisions relating to health insurance it permitted limited number of small businesses and selfemployed individuals to contribute to tax advantaged medical savings accounts msas established in conjunction with highdeductible health insurance plans it increased the deduction for health insurance that selfemployed taxpayers may claim in addition it allowed longterm care expenses to be treated like deductible medical expenses and clarified the tax treatment of longterm care insurance hipaa amended the employee retirement income security act erisa the public health service phs act and the internal revenue code irc in general requirements on employer plans are found in the erisa and irc amendments requirements on health insurance issuers such as insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations hmos are found in the phs act and erisa amendments the increased deduction for the selfemployed taxfavored msas and longterm care provisions are amendments to the irc part i the act in general the basic intent of hipaas health insurance provisions is to lower the possibility that people and small employers will lose existing health plan coverage and to make it easier for individuals to switch plans or to purchase coverage on their own if they lose employeroffered coverage the health insurance reforms ensure that people who are moving from one job to another or from employment to unemployment are not denied health insurance because they have preexisting medical condition portability and limit the waiting time before plan covers any preexisting medical condition for participants and beneficiaries in group health plans crs2 the reforms were also intended to guarantee that individuals and employers who choose to purchase coverage are able to find plan guaranteed issue and that individuals already covered as well as employers that offer coverage to their employees are able to renew their coverage guaranteed renewal finally the health insurance provisions prohibit discrimination on the basis of health status non discrimination and require plans to offer special enrollment periods other hipaa provisions seek to make health insurance more affordable the act raised the tax deduction for health insurance premiums paid by the self employed msas coupled with qualified high deductible health insurance plans were made available on trial basis to limited number of individuals new tax incentives were made available to encourage individuals and employers to purchase longterm care insurance finally the act included administrative simplification and privacy provisions instructing the secretary of hhs to issue standards addressing the electronic transmission of health information and the privacy of personally identifiable medical information additional federal protections have been added since the passage of hipaa the protections required plans that cover newborn delivery to allow for minimum twoday hospital stay under certain conditions required plans that offer mental health services to offer them subject to similar limitations as other health benefits and required plans that cover mastectomy to also cover reconstructive surgery in addition the deduction allowed for premium costs for the selfemployed was changed does hipaa help individuals who are uninsured hipaas insurance provisions were designed to help insured americans who have preexisting medical condition and have stayed in job because they fear that they would lose coverage for such condition if they change to new employer or move to an individual policy it also would help those who have been denied the option to purchase insurance as an individual or through their employer because of their health status they do not address the larger problem of the uninsured estimated to be 45 million people in 2003 although other hipaa provisions such as the tax deductibility of health insurance costs for the selfemployed may encourage some uninsured self employed individuals to purchase coverage for themselves it is also the case that hipaa largely addresses the availability of insurance and does not regulate the price of health insurance coverage1 some evidence suggests that the cost of health insurance in the individual market for individuals taking advantage of hipaas grouptoindividual portability provisions is significantly higher than the cost for individuals who could otherwise obtain insurance this may be discouraging many hipaa eligibles from buying insurance2 whether this experience continues over the long run remains to be seen 1 insurance that is regulated by state law may be subject to state premium limits there are premium limits on selfinsured employer plans 2 us general accounting office health insurance standards new federal law creates challenges for consumers insurers regulators gaohehs9867 february 1998 crs3 are employers required to offer health insurance as benefit the act does not require employers to offer or pay for health insurance for their employees also the act does not require employers to offer or pay for family coverage spouses and dependents finally the act does not require employers to cover part time seasonal or temporary employees however an employer who elects to sponsor group health plan has to comply with certain requirements of the act these requirements restrict the use of preexisting condition limitation periods b prohibit an employer plan from discriminating on the basis of health status in determining the eligibility of an employee to enroll in group health plan and the employees spouse and dependents if the plan provides family coverage c prohibit an employer plan from requiring an individual to pay premiums or contributions which are greater than those charged to similarly situated individual on the basis of health status and d mandate documentation of creditable coverage part ii health insurance reforms portability hipaas portability protection means that once person obtains creditable health plan coverage he or she can use evidence of that coverage to reduce or eliminate any preexisting medical condition exclusion period that might otherwise be imposed when moving to another health plan the protections apply when person moves from one group health plan to another from group health plan to an individual policy or from an individual policy to group health plan the concept of portability is really one of being able to maintain coverage and being given credit for having been insured when changing health plans it does not mean that an individual can take specific health insurance policy from one job to another what is creditable coverage the concept of creditable coverage is that individuals are given credit for previous insurance when applying for new plan under the act creditable coverage is coverage under any of the following group health plan b health insurance coverage3 including individual health insurance coverage c medicare d medicaid military health care4 f medical care program of the indian health service or of tribal organization g state health benefits risk pool h the federal employee health benefits program i public health plan as defined in regulations j health benefit plan under 3 health insurance coverage is defined as benefits consisting of medical care provided directly through insurance or reimbursement or otherwise and including items and services paid for as medical care under any hospital or medical service policy or certificate hospital or medical service plan contract or hmo contract offered by health insurance issuer 4 military health care is care described under 10 usc part 55 crs4 section 5e of the peace corps act 22 usc 2504e or k the state childrens health insurance program schip5 what is preexisting medical condition under the act preexisting medical condition is physical or mental condition for which medical advice diagnosis care or treatment was recommended or received within the 6month period ending on the enrollment date the enrollment date is the date of enrollment of the individual in the health plan or insurance if earlier the first day of the waiting period for such enrollment6 pregnancy is not considered preexisting medical condition also preexisting medical condition limit or exclusion may not be imposed on covered benefits for newborns who are covered under creditable coverage within 30 days of birth finally preexisting medical condition limit or exclusion may not be imposed on covered benefits for newly adopted children or children newly placed for adoption if the child becomes covered under creditable coverage within 30 days of the adoption or placement final regulations7 implementing the health coverage portability provisions of hipaa addressed other types of benefit exclusions that are not designated as preexisting condition exclusions by the plan but are considered to be so by the regulators examples of these specific benefit exclusions include provisions excluding coverage of pregnancy until 12 months after the individual is eligible for benefits or provisions excluding treatment of injuries relating to accidents that occurred prior to enrollment plans are required to bring those exclusions into compliance with hipaa portability provisions by july 1 2005 the act also prohibits the use of genetic information as preexisting condition unless there is diagnosis of preexisting medical condition related to the information for example evidence of positive test for the gene that predisposes woman to inheritable breast cancer cannot be treated as preexisting condition unless diagnosis of breast cancer is made within the 6month period described above what is preexisting medical condition limitation period during this period plan may exclude or restrict coverage of participants or beneficiarys preexisting medical condition under the act group health plan is prohibited from imposing more than 12month preexisting condition limitation period 18 months for late enrollees on an hipaaeligible participant or beneficiary as described below that period is reduced by the amount of the individuals creditable coverage in the individual market hipaaeligible individuals also have portability protection 5 having creditable coverage does not necessarily make an individual eligible for the group toindividual market protections see below for discussion of the limitations of these protections 6 see below for more information on limitation and waiting periods 7 us department of the treasury department of health and human services and department of labor final regulations for health coverage portability for group health plans and group health insurance issuers under hipaa titles i iv 69 federal register 78720 dec 30 2004 crs5 although the circumstances under which those protections apply are complex as described in more detail below portability in the group market hipaa requires group health plans plans that are offered to an employment based group including both employers and employee organizations that are covered by the act to meet the following requirements related to portability when person with prior creditable coverage first enrolls in group health plan the plan cannot impose limitation period on preexisting condition that is longer than 12 months 18 months for late enrollees as defined below the length of the allowed preexisting condition limitation period is based on any creditable coverage that an individual may have the plan cannot apply any preexisting condition waiting period on pregnancy covered newborn or on any covered child under 18 who is adopted even if the adoption is not finalized however the employer may still require individuals to work for period of time before they are allowed to participate in the health plan this is called waiting period and should not be confused with preexisting condition limitation period8 employers who sponsor group health plans are required to provide enrollees with certificate that states the amount of creditable coverage accumulated and whether or not the enrollee was subject to waiting period under the employers plan individuals can use this certificate to demonstrate prior creditable coverage when moving to new group or individual health insurance plan the act does not require an employer to continue offering coverage to enrollees who have left their jobs except under cobra continuation provisions as described below how do people take full advantage of the portability provisions of the act to benefit from the act individuals should maintain coverage under health insurance plan without experiencing significant lapses in coverage since the portability protection only applies to people with continuous coverage which the statute defines as coverage with lapses of 63 or more days individuals should not allow their insurance coverage to lapse for 63 or more days how long can group health plan restrict coverage for preexisting medical condition coverage of preexisting medical condition may be limited or excluded for up to 12 months for those who enroll in health plan when first eligible to enroll in the case of late enrollment the maximum permitted limitation is 18 months for those moving from one group plan to another group plan or from individual to group coverage the new plan must reduce any preexisting condition limitation period by one month for every month that such individuals had creditable coverage under previous plan provided that they enroll when first eligible and had break 8 see below for more information on limitation and waiting periods crs6 in previous coverage of 63 or more continuous days for example individuals with 6 months of prior creditable coverage could face maximum preexisting condition limitation period of 6 months individuals with 11 months of prior creditable coverage could face maximum limitation period of 1 month once 12month limitation period is met new limitation may ever be imposed as long as continuous coverage is maintained that is there is break in coverage lasting longer than 62 days even if there is change in jobs or health plans if there is period of 63 consecutive days during which individuals have creditable coverage they may be subject to as much as 12month preexisting condition exclusion period or an 18 month exclusion for late enrollees9 individuals establish eligibility for waiver of preexisting condition limitations by presenting certifications that document prior creditable coverage health plans and health insurance issuers must supply written certifications of the period of creditable coverage under the plan coverage if any under cobra continuation provisions and any waiting or affiliation periods imposed the certification must be provided 1 when participant is longer covered under the plan or otherwise becomes covered under cobra continuation provision 2 after termination of cobra coverage if applicable and 3 upon request which is made not later then 24 months after coverage ends the interim rules issued by the three agencies administering the act provide guidance and model certification forms to streamline this process10 in general the certification must be provided in writing what is late enrollment late enrollment occurs when an individual enrolls in group health plan other than during the first period in which the individual is eligible to enroll under the plan or b special enrollment period as described above group health plan may require late enrollee to wait 18 months before preexisting condition is covered what is waiting period how does it differ from preexisting condition limitation period waiting period is set amount of time an employee must wait before he or she is eligible to enroll in health plan for example an employer may require an employee to work for 6 months before health insurance benefits become available the act does not limit this type of waiting period employers and health insurance issuers are free to determine the length of waiting period however the act requires that any waiting period be applied uniformly without regard to the health status of potential plan participants or beneficiaries also days in waiting period are not taken into account when determining whether an individual has experienced break in coverage of 63 or more days this differs from preexisting condition exclusion limitation period which allows plans to exclude coverage for certain preexisting health conditions for up to 12 months or 18 months as described above any waiting period required before an employee or his or family member can become plan participant or beneficiary must run concurrently with any preexisting condition limitation period for 9 see what is late enrollment below 10 69 federal register 16894 apr 8 1997 crs7 example if an employer required an employee without any creditable coverage to work for 5 months before he or she could enroll in the firms health plan then the preexisting condition limitation period imposed on the coverage of that individual could not exceed 7 months from the date of actual enrollment in the plan if that individual had 7 or more months of creditable coverage then preexisting condition limitation period could be imposed on the coverage under the new plan do plans and issuers have any discretion in the method of crediting prior coverage yes when an individual changes plans the new benefit package may cover some benefits that were not covered under his or her most recent prior plan and the law allows the new plan or issuer some discretion in applying prior creditable coverage to those new benefits plans and issuers may choose between two alternatives when determining creditable coverage 1 they can chose to include all periods of coverage from qualified sources and thus not look at any specific benefits or 2 they can examine prior coverage on benefitspecific basis and are allowed to exclude from creditable coverage any categories or classes of benefits not covered under the most recent prior plan the april 8 1997 interim rule defines the categories of benefits that may be considered separately to be mental health b substance abuse treatment c prescription drugs d dental care or vision care11 thus for example if prior plan did not cover prescription drugs and the new plan includes this benefit the new plan may exclude coverage of prescription drugs for up to 12 months under this second method if the second method is chosen plans or issuers must disclose its use at the time of enrollment or sale of the plan and apply it uniformly do these protections apply to an individuals spouse and children under group health plan an employer is not required to offer coverage to an individuals spouse or children if the employer does offer family coverage the same protections apply to spouse and dependents coverage may not be denied because family member is sick and preexisting condition restrictions are limited as described above portability and guaranteed availability in the individual insurance market hipaa guarantees the availability of plan and prohibits preexisting condition exclusions for certain eligible individuals who are moving from group health insurance to insurance in the individual market states have the choice of either enforcing the hipaa individual market guarantees referred to as the federal fallback or they may establish an acceptable alternative state mechanism in states using the federal fallback approach hipaa requires all health insurance issuers operating in the individual health insurance market to offer coverage to all eligible individuals and prohibits them from placing any limitations on the coverage of any preexisting medical condition issuers can comply with the acts requirements in three ways 11 69 federal register 16932 1694546 1696162 crs8 1 they must offer eligible individuals access to coverage to every individual insurance policy they sell in the state or 2 they must offer eligible individuals access to coverage to their two most popular insurance policies based on premium volume or 3 they must offer eligible individuals access to lowerlevel and higherlevel coverage these two policies must include benefits that are substantially similar to other coverage offered by the issuer in the state and must include risk adjustment risk spreading or financial subsidization issuers can refuse to cover individuals seeking portability from the group market if financial or provider capacity would be impaired this means for example that if networkbased plan like an hmo can demonstrate that it is filled to capacity then it would not have to accept eligible individuals it would have to apply this exception uniformly without regard to the health status of applicants who is eligible for grouptoindividual market portability and guaranteed availability under the act an eligible individual must have creditable health insurance coverage for 18 months or longer most recent coverage under traditional employer group plan governmental plan or church plan exhausted any cobra or other continuation coverage12 eligibility for coverage under any employmentbased plan medicare or medicaid and breaks in coverage of 63 or more days13 individuals purchasing insurance on their own who do not meet these eligibility criteria are not protected by hipaas portability and guaranteed availability provisions these individuals may be protected under state laws what are the limitations of the grouptoindividual portability and guaranteed availability protections the grouptoindividual portability and guaranteed availability protections apply only to individuals whose most recent coverage was provided through traditional employerbased group arrangements 12 individuals may have continuation coverage that is not cobra coverage under fehbp or under state continuation of coverage laws 13 an eligible individual must have 18 months of creditable health insurance coverage at least the last day of which was under group health plan child is deemed to be an eligible individual if the child was covered under any creditable coverage within 30 days of birth adoption or placement for adoption and the child has not had break in coverage of 63 or more days issuers are not required however to offer family coverage 69 federal register 16996 apr 8 1997 crs9 governmental plans or churchsponsored plans group plans are defined as those meeting the erisa definition which is limited to those sponsored through traditional employeremployee relationship or an employmentbased association governmental plans are also defined in erisa they are plans that are established or maintained for its employees by the government of the united states the government of state or political subdivision of state this limitation means that people whose most recent coverage was sponsored by the military champus and tricare many collegesponsored student plans the peace corps the veterans administration the indian health service medicare medicaid and schip are not eligible for the federal grouptoindividual portability and guaranteed availability protections state laws however may offer these individuals such protections what are the requirements for an acceptable alternative state mechanism an acceptable alternative state mechanism for coverage of eligible individuals must provide choice of health insurance coverage to all eligible individuals not impose any preexisting condition restrictions and include at least one policy form of coverage that is comparable to either comprehensive health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in the state or standard option of coverage available under the group or individual health insurance laws in the state in addition to these requirements state may implement one of the following mechanisms certain national association of insurance commissioners naic model acts14 qualified highrisk pool15 that meets certain specified requirements or other risk spreading or risk adjustment approach or financial subsidies for participating insurers or eligible individuals or any other mechanism under which eligible individuals are provided choice of all individual health insurance coverage otherwise available 14 the naic model acts include the small employer and individual health insurance availability model act as it applies to individual health insurance coverage and as revised in state regulations to meet all the necessary requirements and the individual health insurance portability model act as adopted on june 3 1996 and revised in state regulation to meet all necessary requirements 15 highrisk pool is generally the insurer of last resort typically for sicker andor older individuals who 1 are denied coverage in the private market 2 are offered only restricted coverage or 3 cannot find less expensive coverage crs10 examples of potential alternative state mechanisms include health insurance coverage pools or programs mandatory group conversion policies guaranteed issue of one or more plans of individual health insurance coverage open enrollment by one or more health insurance issuers or combination of such mechanisms how have states

of coverage is less than 63 days individual states may require health plans to give credit for prior coverage even if the lapse was longer than 63 days 3 rating bands are laws that restrict plans use of experience health status or duration of coverage in setting premiums rates for individuals for example state may set the band of 2 to 1 for health status special enrollment periods in the group market as an adjunct to its portability requirement the act provides for two different special enrollment periods to ensure that people losing group health insurance coverage can more easily obtain other group coverage when it is available the two special enrollment periods are 1 individual losing other coverage group health plan or an issuer offering coverage in connection with group health plan must allow an employee who is crs14 eligible but not enrolled to become covered under the plan if the following conditions are met16 the employee or dependent was covered under group health plan or had health insurance coverage at the time coverage was previously offered to the employee or dependent for example the employee may have been covered by spouses employer and declined coverage under his own employers plan the employee stated in writing at the time of declining enrollment that the reason for declining was that he or she was covered under another health insurance plan this condition applies only if the plan sponsor or issuer requires such written statement the employees or dependents previous coverage was under cobra continuation provision that had become exhausted or was under some other coverage that had been terminated as result of loss of eligibility for the coverage for reasons such as legal separation divorce death termination of employment or reduction in the number of hours of employment or because the employer contribution towards such coverage was terminated to take advantage of special enrollment period the employee would have to request enrollment later than 30 days after the date in which his or her prior coverage was exhausted or terminated 2 dependent beneficiaries this special enrollment period applies to individuals who become dependents through marriage birth adoption or placement of adoption generally this provision applies if group health plan makes dependent coverage available and the new dependents spouse or parent is either participant or eligible including meeting any waiting periods to be participant under the plan the newly dependent individual must be allowed to enroll as beneficiary under the plan however enrollment must be sought within 30 days of the qualifying event eg the marriage employees or spouses who are eligible but not previously enrolled in the plan may also enroll during this special enrollment coverage is effective on the date of the birth adoption or placement for adoption in the case of marriage coverage is effective later than the first day of the month beginning after the date the request for enrollment is received nondiscrimination in the group market can group health plan refuse to enroll individuals with history of illness or disability or high medical expenses can it drop someone from coverage who becomes sick or starts using lot of medical care the act prohibits group health plan and an issuer offering group health coverage from establishing rules for eligibility for any individual to enroll under the 16 the employees dependent would also be allowed to enroll if family coverage is provided under the terms of the plan crs15 plan based on health statusrelated factors17 these factors include health status medical condition including both physical and mental illnesses claims experience receipt of health care medical history genetic information evidence of insurability including conditions arising out of domestic violence and disability group health plans are also prohibited from failing to reenroll participant or beneficiary on the basis of health statusrelated factors hipaa also prohibits plans from charging differential premiums for enrollees within group plan based on these health status related factors can an employer condition coverage under its health plan on passing physical examination the act prohibits employer plans and issuers of group health coverage from establishing rules of eligibility to enroll under the terms of the plan that discriminate based on one or more healthstatus related factors can group plan refuse to enroll individuals who engage in high risk recreational activities these individuals cannot be denied enrollment in group health plan based on hipaas nondiscrimination provision group plans or issuers offering group health coverage cannot use information about an individuals health status to either deny coverage or charge differential premiums on january 8 2001 the department of labor issued preliminary final ruling with comment period defining the nondiscrimination provisions of hipaa in this ruling health status is defined very broadly to include evidence of insurability which in turn includes provision that prohibits excluding coverage for individuals who participate in highrisk activities18 thus this broad interpretation extends the nondiscrimination protections to individuals who engage in highrisk recreational activities can group plan exclude coverage of treatments for injuries obtained while engaging in highrisk recreational activities hipaas protection extend to enrollment policies and premiums the protection does not address the benefits that are covered by these plans therefore there is federal requirement to cover treatments for injuries associated with highrisk activities even if these treatments are otherwise covered under the plan for example plan may exclude coverage for broken leg if it occurs as result of high risk activity 17 in the individual market there are federal rules explicitly limiting denials based on health status on the other hand portability and guaranteed issue protections may apply see above section on portability and guaranteed availability in the individual insurance market 18 this ruling stems from language in the conference report on hipaa the inclusion of evidence of insurability in the definition of health status is intended to ensure among other things that individuals are not excluded from health care coverage due to their participation in activities such as motorcycling snowmobiling allterrain vehicle riding horseback riding skiing and other similar activities hrept104736 104th cong 2d sess 186 1996 crs16 do these nondiscrimination protections apply to an individuals spouse and children under group health plan an employer is not required to offer coverage to an individuals spouse or children if the employer does offer family coverage the same nondiscrimination protections apply to spouse and any other dependents as defined under the terms of the plan coverage may not be denied because family member is sick and preexisting condition restrictions are limited as described above does the act restrict the premium amounts that an employer can charge for health insurance the act does not restrict premium amounts that an employer or insurer can charge it also expressly permits an employer or group health insurer to offer premium discounts or rebates or modify otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles for participation in health promotion and disease prevention programs however the act does prohibit health plan from charging an individual higher premium than the premium charged for another similarly situated individual enrolled in the plan on the basis of any healthrelated factor such as preexisting medical condition guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability the act requires insurers hmos and other issuers of health insurance selling in the small group market to accept any small employer that applies for coverage regardless of the health status or claims history of the employers group19 this requirement is often referred to as guaranteed issue the act defines small employer as one with two to 50 employees if on the first day of the plan year the plan has fewer than two participants who are current employees it is not considered small group and would not be covered by this guaranteed issue requirement under guaranteed issue the issuer must accept for enrollment under the policy not just the employers group as whole but also every eligible individual in the employers group who is eligible for and applies for timely enrollment20 exceptions to guaranteed issue are provided in the act for network plans that might otherwise exceed capacity limits or in the event that the employers employees do not live work or reside in the network plans area employer groups with more than 50 employees are not protected by this requirement unless otherwise required under state law in the past health insurance issuers usually did not examine the health status or medical history of larger employer groups when deciding whether to accept such groups for coverage the act requires the secretary of health and human services hhs and the general accounting office renamed the government accountability office in july 2004 to report every three years beginning in december 2002 on access to health insurance in the large group market 19 this is consistent with most state health insurance reforms which primarily apply to the small group market typically defined as 2 to 25 2 to 35 or 2 to 50 employees however some state laws provide for guaranteed issue of groups with as few as one employee 20 the interim rules interpret the guaranteed issue requirement to apply to all products actively marketed by an issuer in the small group market 69 federal register 16971 apr 8 1997 crs17 can health insurance issuers drop or cancel coverage for groups because of high medical costs the act requires all health insurance issuers to continue coverage for any group regardless of health status or use of services if the group requests renewal this requirement is known as guaranteed renewability an issuer may drop coverage in cases of nonpayment of premiums fraud or similar reasons not related to health status such as violation of participation or contribution rules21 but there are limits on amounts insurers may charge federally required benefits as originally passed hipaa did not require an employer or issuer of group health insurance to offer specific benefits twice since its passage congress added to hipaas protections by mandating specific benefits but in each case only for plans that cover certain services as part of the fy1997 appropriations bill for the departments of veterans affairs and housing and urban development vahud congress included provisions that 1 require plans that cover mental health services to provide limited mental health parity and 2 prohibit plans that cover newborn delivery from limiting hospital stays for newborn delivery to less than two days22 the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act incorporated the womens health and cancer rights act which requires plans that cover mastectomy as treatment for breast cancer to also cover reconstructive surgery23 mental health parity private health insurers often provide less coverage for the treatment of mental illnesses than they do for the treatment of other illnesses for example health plans may limit treatment of mental illnesses by covering fewer hospital days and outpatient office visits and increase cost sharing for mental health care by raising deductibles and copayments twentytwo states have passed full parity laws that require health plans to impose the same treatment limitations and financial requirements on their mental health coverage as they do on their medical and surgical coverage several other states have enacted legislation that requires health plans to provide certain specified mental health benefits but not full parity however these state laws have limited impact because they do not cover self insured plans erisa exempts selfinsured plans from state regulation nationwide about 52 of covered workers are in selfinsured plan according to the 2003 kffhret survey of employer health benefits in 1996 congress passed the mental health parity act mhpa which amended erisa and the public health service act to establish new federal standards 21 an example of participation rule is requirement set by the issuer that 80 of all full time employees participate in the employers group health plan an example of contribution requirement is that all participants in the health plan must pay 20 of the plan premium these requirements are used to protect the issuer from selection bias also known as adverse selection in which only sick members of an employers group sign up for insurance coverage 22 fy1997 appropriations bill for the departments of veterans affairs and housing and urban development pl 104204 title vii 23 in addition to hipaas limited federal protections most states have their own mandates for insurers operating in their states crs18 for mental health coverage offered by employersponsored plans24 identical provisions were later added to the internal revenue code25 the mhpa is limited in scope and does not compel insurers to provide fullparity coverage for group plans that choose to offer mental health benefits the mhpa requires parity only for annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage plans may still impose more restrictive treatment limitations and cost sharing requirements on their mental health coverage the mhpa includes several other limitations employers with 50 or fewer employees are exempt from the law in addition employers that experience an increase in claims costs of at least 1 as result of mhpa compliance can apply for an exemption the mhpa currently is authorized through december 31 2005 the 107th congress tried unsuccessfully to enact legislation s 543 that would have amended and expanded the mhpa by requiring plans that choose to offer mental health benefits to provide fullparity coverage fullparity legislation is strongly supported by advocates of the mentally ill and enjoys broad bipartisan support among lawmakers employers and health insurance organizations oppose such legislation because of concerns that it will drive up health care costs for more information see crs report rl31657 mental health parity newborns and mothers health protection act the newborns and mothers health protection act was also passed as part of pl 104204 this act prohibits group health plans and issuers offering group coverage from restricting the hospital length of stay for childbirth for either the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours for normal deliveries and to less than 96 hours for caesarian deliveries womens health and cancer rights act of 1998 enacted in 1998 title ix of the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act26 requires group plans and health insurance issuers that provide coverage for mastectomies also to cover prosthetic devices and reconstructive surgery the provision included requirement that beneficiaries be notified of available coverage for prostheses and treatment of physical complications of reconstructive procedures can an employer exclude coverage for specific types of illnesses such as cancer or acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids or treatment of injuries associated with highrisk activities federal law does not prohibit employers from excluding treatment of specific illnesses or conditions from their health benefit plans on the other hand number of factors limit certain employers ability to exclude specific illnesses from coverage most states have enacted legislation requiring that specific benefits or coverage be included in insured products some employers particularly small ones purchasing insurance products have little or discretion in choosing or excluding specific types of services or procedures this is because many insurance companies and hmos have set menu of products that do not vary considerably from one employer group to 24 pl 104204 title vii codified at 29 usc 1185a and 42 usc 300gg5 these provisions were part of the fy1997 vahud appropriations bill 25 pl 10534 section 1531a4 codified at 26 usc 9812 26 pl 105277 title ix womens health and cancer rights crs19 another for selffunded plans however erisa prevents state laws from applying and benefits are crafted by each individual employer plan thus only the few federal requirements enacted in hipaa and its amendments described above place specific coverage requirements on these selffunded plans general questions about the health insurance reforms do the requirements of the act apply to the plans of employers that provide for dentalonly coverage or visiononly coverage such specific benefit plans do not have to comply with the requirements of the act if they meet certain conditions spelled out in the act to be exempt for example the dentalonly policy would have to be provided under separate policy certificate or contract of insurance or not otherwise be an integral part of the plan do the requirements of the act apply to associationsponsored group health plans yes association plans must comply with the various requirements of the act relating to group health coverage for example the sponsor of an association plan cannot drop group from coverage because of the use of medical services by the groups members moreover the association plan must comply with the restrictions on the use of preexisting medical condition limitation periods provide for creditable coverage and renew coverage except in limited cases however nothing under the act requires that an association plan accept for coverage individuals who are not members of the association can states impose requirements on insurers selling to group health plans that are different from those in the act yes states may impose their own requirements but hipaa ensures that state laws do not prevent the application of its consumer protections for example state laws regulating rating continue to apply because the act generally does not address rating practices on the other hand the acts provisions relating to portability such as restrictions on the use of preexisting medical condition limitation periods override state laws exceptions include specific types of state laws that provide for greater portability such as state laws that define preexisting medical condition to be one that existed for less than 6 months prior to becoming covered instead of the 6 months required under the act provide for preexisting medical condition limitation periods shorter than 12 and 18 months in the act and allow for breaks in continuous coverage longer than the 62day period specified under the act27 thus for example state may prohibit issuers selling to group health plans from imposing more than 6month preexisting medical condition limitation period on 27 other possible types of state laws providing for greater consumer protections are also specified in the act crs20 enrollees instead of the 12month limit in the act however state laws that allowed such limitation periods in excess of 12 months would be overridden by the requirement of the act do the insurance reforms apply to federal employees health benefits plans fehbp while there are specific references in hipaa or the subsequent benefits mandates that apply the requirements specifically to fehbp the plans provided by the fehbp program are presumed to fall under the hipaa definition of group health plan as result the federal office of personnel management which administers the fehbp program complies with the hipaa requirements does the act regulate the premium amount that an issuer can charge an eligible individual the act does not place any restrictions on the premium amount that issuers can charge however some states limit insurance premiums in the individual market and more may decide to do so in the future such limits would then apply because the act does not preempt or override either current or future state laws regulating the cost of insurance implementation and enforcement the secretaries of hhs labor and treasury are required to jointly enforce the provisions of the act the secretary of labor enforces the requirements on employer plans under title i of erisa the secretary of labor is also generally given authority to promulgate regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the act relating to group health plans and health insurance issuers in connection with any group health plan the secretary of treasury enforces requirements on all group health plans under the internal revenue code requirements on health insurance issuers such as insurance carriers and hmos are enforced by the secretary of hhs to the extent that such requirements are not enforced by the states the secretaries are required to coordinate their activities to avoid duplication of effort states have the primary responsibility for enforcing hipaas access portability and renewability standards applying to insurers in both the group and individual markets if they do not pass laws that substantially enforce these standards however dhhs must do the enforcing itself as of 2001 only missouri had not enacted enabling legislation how are the insurance requirements of the act enforced noncomplying group health plans covered under erisa may be subject to civil money penalties and both plans and issuers can be sued by participants and beneficiaries to recover any benefits due under the plan the secretary of labor has the investigative authority to determine compliance with the laws requirements for group health plans generally the irs can fine noncomplying employer 100 per day per violation requirements on issuers will be enforced by the states for missouri the secretary of hhs enforces the provisions the secretary may impose fine of 100 crs21 for each day the entity the issuer or nonfederal governmental plan28 is out of compliance the act gives the secretary of hhs the

coverage how does cobra continuation coverage29 interact with hipaa persons cobra continuation coverage is considered creditable coverage in the case of an individual who moves from one group policy to another group policy or from group policy to an individual policy this allows an individual to move from cobra to new health plan without having to wait for coverage of any preexisting medical condition under the new plan providing the individual does not have lapse in coverage of 63 or more days with respect to hipaas individual market protections the situation is somewhat more complex one of the requirements for eligibility for guaranteed availability and portability in the individual market is that an individual must first have elected and exhausted any available cobra or other continuation coverage eligible individuals who do not have access to cobra or other continuation coverage may move directly to the individual market additionally in the individual market it is important to note that the insurer accepting the eligible individual for coverage can charge whatever rate is allowed under state law the act does not limit the premiums that insurers can charge does hipaa make any changes in cobra continuation of coverage requirements yes the act makes several changes to the laws providing for cobra continuation of coverage it provides clarification that disabled qualified beneficiary and all other qualified family members of the beneficiary are also eligible for the additional 11 months of cobra that the qualifying event of disability applies in the case of qualified beneficiary who is determined under the social security act to be disabled during the first 60 days of cobra coverage that qualified beneficiary for cobra coverage includes child who is born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee during the period of cobra coverage and that cobra can be terminated if qualified beneficiary becomes covered under group health plan which does not contain any exclusion or limitation affecting participant or his or her beneficiaries because of the requirements of the act it should also be noted that under the medical savings account msa provisions of the act see below individuals may withdraw funds from their msas without penalty to pay their cobra premiums 29 the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 cobra pl 99272 requires employers with 20 or more employees to offer continued group health insurance coverage to employees and their dependents after certain events see crs report rl30626 health insurance continuation coverage under cobra by heidi g yacker crs27 part iii other provisions in addition to the insurance provisions discussed above hipaa includes other provisions affecting health care this section briefly summarizes these provisions and refers readers to other crs reports where available30 administrative simplification in addition to provisions relating to private health insurance hipaa directed the secretary of hhs to issue standards to support and promote the electronic transmission of health care information between payers and providers the standards specify the content and format of electronic health care claims and other common administrative and financial health care transactions eg health plan enrollment referrals they are intended to streamline administrative operations within the health care system which currently stores and transmits health information in numerous paper and electronic formats in 2001 congress enacted the administrative simplification compliance act pl 107105 which enabled payers and providers to seek oneyear extension on the october 16 2002 deadline for compliance with the electronic transactions and codes standards hipaas administrative simplification provisions also instructed the secretary of hhs to develop security standards and safeguards which health plans and providers must incorporate into their operations to protect health information from unauthorized access use and disclosure health care providers and most health plans must be in compliance with the security standards by april 21 2005 in addition hipaa directed the secretary to develop standards for unique health identifiers ie id numbers for patients employers health plans and providers cms has issued standards for both the employer and provider identifiers but the health plan identifier remains under development in each fiscal year since fy1999 congress has prevented cms from developing standard for the unique patient identifier by inserting language in the agencys annual appropriations bill the language prohibits the use of funds for developing unique patient identifier standard unless legislation is enacted specifically approving such standard the growing use of information technology in the management administration and delivery of health care has led to increasing public concern over the privacy of medical information patients are worried about who has access to their medical records without their express authorization they fear that their personal health information will be used against them to deny insurance employment and housing or to expose them to unwanted judgment and scrutiny lawmakers addressed these concerns by including in hipaas administrative simplification provisions timetable for developing standards to protect the privacy of health information hipaa gave congress until august 21 1999 to enact comprehensive health privacy legislation otherwise the secretary was instructed to develop privacy standards 30 not included in this summary are hipaa provisions that were revenue raisers these related to companyowned life insurance individuals who lose us citizenship or who were longterm residents and terminate us residency and interest allocation rules for financial institutions crs28 congress was unable to meet its own deadline and so the secretary proceeded to develop health information privacy rule the final rule was issued on december 28 2000 and modifications to the rule were published on august 14 2002 for more information on the privacy rule see crs report rs20500 medical records privacy questions and answers on the hipaa final rule information on the status and implementation of all the hipaa administrative simplification standards is at httpaspeosdhhsgovadmnsimp medical savings accounts hipaa authorized taxadvantaged medical savings accounts msas under demonstration that began in 1997 msas now formally called archer msas are personal savings accounts for unreimbursed medical expenses they can be used to pay for health care not covered by insurance including deductibles and copayments the legislation provided that msas may be established by taxpayers who have qualifying high deductible insurance and none other with some exceptions and who either are selfemployed or are employees covered by the high deductible plan established by their small employer employer contributions to msas are not subject to either income or employment taxes while contributions made by individuals allowed only if the employer does not contribute are allowed as an abovetheline deduction not limited to itemizers msas are held in trust by insurance companies banks and other financial institutions and whatever earnings they have are exempt from taxes withdrawals are not taxed if they are for medical expenses unreimbursed by insurance or otherwise while other distributions being nonqualified are included in gross income and subject with some exceptions to an additional 15 penalty hipaa set deadlineoriginally december 31 2000 for establishing new accounts and limited the total to various ceilings eventually 750000 accounts in october 2002 the irs estimated that there would be 78913 msa returns filed for tax year 2001 it also determined that 20592 taxpayers who did not make contributions in 2001 established accounts in the first six months of 2002 these numbers were far less than the 750000 statutory ceiling31 later amendments extended the deadline for new accounts to december 31 2003 although new msas may be created with some exceptions current owners can maintain their accounts and provided they have qualifying highdeductible insurance can continue to make contributions however most msa owners can now have hsas and their msa balances can be rolled over into the new accounts 31 irs announcement 200290 msas are not counted toward the statutory ceiling if the owners were previously uninsured moreover all accounts established by an individual are added together and married individuals opening separate accounts are treated as having one account the small number of msa accounts opened can be attributed to number of factors including product familiarity consumer aversion to financial risk and the reluctance of insurance agents to sell lowerpriced policies however statutory restrictions undoubtedly have played some role crs29 for more information about msas and hsas see crs report rs21573 tax advantaged accounts for health care expenses sidebyside comparison by bob lyke and chris l peterson and crs report rl32467 health savings

legislation also by bob lyke health insurance for selfemployed taxpayers hipaa increased the portion of premiums that selfemployed taxpayers may deduct from income for the purposes of determining federal taxes owed under prior law the deduction was 30 of health insurance costs hipaa increased it to 40 in 1997 45 in 1998 through 2002 50 in 2003 60 in 2004 70 in 2005 and 80 in 2006 and thereafter subsequent legislation pl 10534 and pl 105277 accelerated and increased the percentages set by hipaa beginning in 2003 100 of health insurance costs can be deducted as discussed below hipaa also allowed selfemployed taxpayers to take account of longterm care insurance premiums in making this deduction selfinsured plans hipaa provided that payments for personal injury or sickness through an arrangement having the effect of accident or health insurance are excluded from gross income that is they are exempt from taxation provided the arrangement has adequate risk shifting and is not merely reimbursement arrangement thus with respect to taxes payments from selfinsured plans covering selfemployed individuals are treated like payments from commercial insurance longterm care hipaa established new rules regarding the tax treatment of longterm care insurance and expenses effective january 1 1997 qualified longterm care insurance is treated as accident and health insurance and benefits are treated as amounts received for personal injuries and sickness and reimbursement for medical expenses actually incurred as consequence benefits are excluded from gross income that is exempt from taxation the exclusion for benefits paid on per diem or other periodic basis is limited to the greater of 1 240 day in 2005 or 2 the cost of longterm care services32 employer contributions to the cost of qualified longterm care insurance premiums are excluded from the gross income of the employee the exclusion does 32 treating longterm care insurance as accident and health insurance and excluding benefits from gross income also exempts the inside buildup of the insurance from taxation long term care insurance usually has premiums that do not increase with age aside from optional inflation adjustments for some policies premiums for early years of policy and the earnings on them the inside buildup help pay for costs later on the tax treatment of nonqualified longterm care insurance remains uncertain crs30 not apply to insurance provided through employersponsored cafeteria plans or flexible spending accounts unreimbursed longterm care expenses are allowed as itemized deductions to the extent they and other unreimbursed medical expenses exceed 75 of adjusted gross income longterm care insurance premiums can be counted as these expenses subject to ageadjusted limits in 2005 these limits range from 270 for persons age 40 or less to 3400 for persons over age 70 selfemployed individuals are allowed to include longterm care insurance premiums in determining their abovetheline deduction not limited to itemizers for health insurance expenses only amounts not exceeding the ageadjusted limits can be included so limited 100 of the cost of the insurance may be claimed as deduction in 2005 as described above qualified longterm care insurance is defined as contract that covers only long term care services does not pay or reimburse expenses covered under medicare is guaranteed renewable does not provide for cash surrender value or other money that can be paid assigned or pledged as collateral for loan or borrowed applies all refunds of premiums and all policy holder dividends or similar amounts as reduction in future premiums or to increase future benefits and meets certain consumer protection standards policies issued before january 1 1997 and meeting states longterm care insurance requirements at the time the policy was issued are considered qualified insurance for purposes of favorable tax treatment qualified longterm care services are defined as necessary diagnostic preventive therapeutic curing treating mitigating and rehabilitative services and maintenance or personal care services which are required by chronically ill individual and are provided according to plan of care prescribed by licensed health care practitioner however amounts paid for services provided by the spouse of chronically ill person or by relative directly or through partnership corporation or other entity will not be considered medical expense eligible for favorable tax treatment unless the service is provided by licensed professional chronically ill persons are defined as those individuals unable to perform without substantial assistance from another individual at least two of the following activities of daily living adlsfor period of at least 90 days due to loss of functional capacity bathing dressing transferring toileting eating and continence33 having level of disability similar to the level of disability specified for functional impairments as determined by the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the secretary of health and human services or requiring substantial supervision to protect them from threats to health and safety due to severe cognitive impairment 33 qualified longterm care insurance contract must take into account at least five of these six activities crs31 hipaa required that licensed health practitioner physician registered professional nurse licensed social worker or other individual prescribed by the secretary of the treasury certify that person meets these criteria within the preceding 12month period accelerated death benefits hipaa clarified that accelerated death benefits that is benefits paid before death received under life insurance contract on the life of an insured terminally or chronically ill individual are excluded from gross income also excluded are amounts received from viatical settlement provider for the sale or assignment of life insurance contract34 these exclusions do not apply to amounts paid to persons other than the insured if they have an insurable interest in the insured for business reasons terminally ill individual is one who has been certified by physician as having an illness or physical condition which can reasonably be expected to result in death within 24 months of the date of certification chronically ill individual is defined the same way as for longterm care see the previous section in this case the exclusion of accelerated death benefits is limited to the actual costs of longterm care incurred by the individual that are not compensated by insurance or otherwise the exclusion for benefits paid on per diem or other periodic basis is limited to the greater of 1 240 day in 2005 or 2 the costs of longterm care services35 contracts must not pay or reimburse expenses which are reimbursable under medicare or would be but for the application of deductible or coinsurance amount in addition contracts are subject to the consumer protection provisions specified in the tax code for longterm care insurance except for analogous standards specifically applying to chronically ill individuals that are adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners or the state in which the policyholder resides state insurance pools hipaa added two types of organizations to the list of those expressly exempt from the federal income tax 1 statesponsored membership organizations that provide insurance coverage or medical care to highrisk individuals and 2 state sponsored workmens compensation reinsurance
