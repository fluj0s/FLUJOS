social policy division leave benefits in the united states summary in addition to their jobs workers have obligations civic familial and personal to fulfill that sometimes require them to be absent from the workplace eg to serve on jury retrieve sick child from day care or attend funeral the us government generally has allowed individual employers to decide whether to accommodate the nonwork activities of employees by granting them leave with or without pay rather than firing them in other countries national governments or the international organizations to which they belong more often have developed social policies that entitle individuals to time off from the workplace oftentimes paid for variety of reasons eg maternity and vacations public policies specifically intended to reconcile the work and family lives of individuals have garnered increased attention among countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in the united states which is an oecd member congressional interest recently has coalesced around family friendly paid leave proposals eg hr 1542s 910 s 80 and hr 5781 s 1681 and hr 5873 they would entitle workers to time off with pay to accomplish parental and caregiving obligations to help women in particular balance work and family responsibilities because they are the typical family caregiver and majority of women in the us population are in the labor force currently there are few federal statutes that pertain directly or indirectly to employer provision of leave benefits for any purpose this report begins by reviewing those policies including the pregnancy discrimination act and the family and medical leave act temporary disability insurance tdi programs which five states have established to compensate for lost wages while workers are recovering from nonoccupational illnesses and injuries are discussed as well so too are the california and new jersey family leave insurance programs which essentially extend the tdi programs of the two states to employees caring for family members the report then examines the incidence of different types of paid leave that us employers voluntarily provide as part of an employees total compensation wages and benefits for example vacations and holidays are the most commonly offered leave benefits more than threefourths of employees in the private sector receive paid time off for these reasons access to leave by various employee and employer characteristics also is analyzed with particular attention focused on paid sick leave which is offered to 57 of private sector employees the report closes with results from federal government survey of the average direct cost to businesses of different types of leave indirect employer costs that might arise in connection with some types of leave more than others such as the greater likelihood of hiring and training temporary replacements for employees absent because of maternity versus bereavement reasons

generally has allowed individual businesses to decide whether to accommodate the nonwork activities of employees by granting them leave with or without pay rather than firing them in other countries national governments or the international organizations to which they belong more often have developed social policies that entitle individuals to take time off from the workplace for variety of reasons1 for example workers in countries that are part of the european union have minimum vacation benefit with pay of some 20 days per year in spain employees can take paid time off to perform jury service among other civic duties2 and 169 countries guarantee women leave with income in connection with childbirth3 policies specifically intended to reconcile the work and family lives of individuals which include leave benefits childcare subsidies and flexible work arrangements have garnered increased attention in the 30member organization for economic cooperation and development oecd4 in the united states which is an oecd member congressional interest recently has coalesced around family friendly paid leave proposals they would entitle individuals to time off with pay to accomplish parental and caregiving obligations eg bonding with newborn or newly placed adopted child or assisting seriously ill spouse women are regarded as the chief beneficiaries of these proposals

approaches have been proposed in congress to guarantee workers the right to take paid leave to attend to family and medical needs an employer mandate eg hr 1542s 910 s 80 and hr 5781 and temporary disability insurance program eg s 1681 and hr 58737 while during the past two decades the generosity of paid parental leave has increased in all oecd countries with the exceptions of ireland the united kingdom and several countries with legislation mandating paid leave such as the united states8 the organization remains focused on leave and other policies thought to ameliorate workfamily conflict its continuing interest in encouraging more women to participate in the labor force is partly motivated by concern about the impact of population aging on the future labor supply in member nations the economic rationale underlying paid family leave is that it will increase the amount of labor supplied by women with child care and increasingly elder care obligations and thereby mitigate the slowdown in labor force growth overall in the united states the end of years of escalating labor force participation by married mothers especially mothers of infants9 is overlaid on the fear of an impending labor shortfall because of its aging population10 5 women represent 60 of informal caregivers to family and friends age 18 and older according to caregiving in the united states 2004 by the

compensation that is benefits eg health insurance retirement plans and leave the few employmentbased benefits that congress has mandated are social security unemployment compensation workers compensation and most recently unpaid familymedical leave an overview follows of past and present federal laws and regulations that relate to time off from work state statutes may require the provision of leave beyond that in federal law employers and unions may negotiate paid time off as supplement to wages in collective bargaining agreements complete coverage of leave benefits that originate from these nonfederal sources is beyond the scope of this report the fair labor standards act the primary law setting standards for wages paid to and hours worked by most employed persons in the united states is the fair labor standards act flsa although people often think that the act regulates time not worked the flsa largely is silent on the subject11 it does not require that firms provide employees time off for breaks eg to use bathroom12 meals13 illness holidays and the like 10 continued levine 11 under the flsa workers must be paid for short rest breaks but not for meal breaks that employers voluntarily provide 12 the occupational safety and health administration in 1998 memorandum interpreted the sanitation standard for general industry 29 crf 1910141c1i toilet facilities to mean that companies must make toilet facilities available to employees and allow individuals timely access to them 13 some states have laws that require businesses to give time off for meals or other breaks during the workday some municipalities also have laws regulations or guidelines that address meals or other breaks crs4 although the flsa applies to both the private and public sectors federal employees are entitled to legal holidays with pay as prescribed by the office of personnel management under title 5 of the us code holidays also may be designated in state and municipal laws or regulations private sector employers may choose to follow the public sectors holiday practices and pay their employees for the time not worked if businesses voluntarily close on holidays firms can pay an employee they require to work the employees usual hourly wage rate because the flsa does not distinguish holidays from any other workday the flsa does require employees to be paid more than their regular hourly wage rate in another instance namely overtime work it is in connection with overtime that the act has become part of the debate over worktime flexibility to accommodate the family responsibilities of employees the flsa was enacted in 1938 during period of extraordinarily high unemployment payment at oneand onehalf times an employees standard hourly rate for working more than 40 hours in week thus was required of companies as penalty for extending the workweek of current employees rather than hiring unemployed persons about 50 years later congress allowed employers in one industry federal state and local government to offer employees time off in lieu of the overtime pay they had earned14 that is to say government can offer its workers the option of taking leave in the future rather than immediately compensating them for overtime worked those who want to extend comptime to the private sector began in the 1990s to put the worktime arrangement in family friendly context by arguing that it would afford workers the opportunity to accumulate hours they could later take off for caregiving or any other reason if the use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer15 federal contractor legislation in the davisbacon act of 1931 and service contract act of 1965 congress required that certain contractors pay at least prevailing wages and benefits to their workers employed on federal and federally assisted construction and service projects the wage and hour division in the us department of labor dol develops wage determinations they list the wage rates and fringe benefit rates dol determines are prevailing in given area for particular jobs paid sick vacation and holiday leave are among the benefits that can be included in wage determination16 temporary disability insurance nationwide program exists that compensates individuals for wages lost while they are absent from the workplace due to shortterm health conditions eg childbirth the flu or injuries unrelated to employment 14 1985 amendments to the flsa pl 99150 15 hr 1119 family time flexibility act report 108127 108th cong 1st

httpwwwdolgovesaprogramsdbrafaqsfringeshtm crs5 it was during the severe depression of the thirties that the united states began its national social insurance programs of unemployment insurance and oldage insurance consequently providing protection against costs of sickness that are more or less recurring regardless of economic conditions did not seem to have the same urgency as providing protection against cyclical unemployment and old age dependency17 in 1946 however the federal unemployment tax act was amended to allow states in which employees contribute to their unemployment insurance programs to use those contributions toward cash payments for persons unable to work as result of temporary nonoccupational illnesses or injuries18 california new jersey new york and rhode island passed temporary disability insurance tdi laws during the 1940s two additional jurisdictions hawaii and puerto rico enacted tdi legislation in the late 1960s today employees and employers contribute to four of the jurisdictions social insurance programs rhode island and california continue to rely on only employee payroll deductions the governments usually do not make contributions19 both employed and unemployed workers may receive tdi benefits how this is accomplished varies among the jurisdictions depending in part on whether employers are allowed to substitute private insurance plan for stateoperated plan most employees in the private sector are covered because the laws generally apply to businesses with one or more workers jurisdictions may cover their own government employees and the selfemployed as well the value of payments and their duration also differ by jurisdiction in addition the way in which tdi benefits are coordinated with employerprovided paid sick leave and other accrued leave benefits varies20 the tdi laws do not require employers to retain individuals on their payrolls while receiving benefits21 however employers must comply with other laws that regulate treatment of employees experiencing shortterm nonwork disabilities antidiscrimination legislation the pregnancy discrimination act of 1978 pda pl 95555 which amended title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 makes it illegal for employers with 15 or more employees to fire refuse to hire or 17 chapter on temporary disability insurance from the social security administrations 1997

withhold promotion because an individual is pregnant the act further prohibits these employers from treating women who are limited in their ability to work because of pregnancy childbirth or related health conditions differently from other employees experiencing disabling medical conditions unrelated to work if firm has policy permitting temporarily disabled employees to take sick leave then it must allow woman unable to perform her job due to pregnancy or childbirth to take leave on the same terms22 thus firm must hold open job for pregnancy related absence the same length of time jobs are held open for employees on sick or disability leave23 title vii and the americans with disabilities act of 1990 do not require employers to provide leave to employees to attend to their own shortterm illnesses they also do not require employers to offer employees time off to care for sick family members but as in the case of company with sick or disability leave benefits firm that has instituted family leave policy is prohibited from administering it in discriminatory manner24 for example men and women must be afforded the same opportunity to take the same amount of time off to care for their children under an employers family leave plan taking action against family responsibilities discrimination may be difficult however because congress has never prohibited discrimination based on caregiver status so such claims must be indirect applications of existing prohibitions against sex bias disability discrimination and unequal pay25 as recently as may 2007 the equal employment opportunity commission released clarifying guidance that addresses unlawful disparate treatment founded on sexbased stereotyping of pregnant workers and of employees who are family caregivers disparate treatment of employees caring for family members with disabilities and harassment that creates hostile work environment for employees providing family care26 relatedly differences across states in leave benefit laws may make multistate companies susceptible to discrimination complaints for interfering with the rights of employees for example californias family sick leave kin care law requires all employers in the state that offer paid sick leave to allow employees to use some of their time off to care for sick children parents spouses or domestic partners27 but in minnesota employers with at least 21 employees must permit them to use their 22 chapter xiv equal employment opportunity commission 29 cfr part 160410 23 see httpwwweeocgovtypespregnancyhtml 24 see

policies also means that families have quite different options depending on the state in which they live tdi and family leave california washington and new jersey in 2002 california became the first state to mandate paid family leave benefit by establishing family temporary disability insurance commonly known as paid family leave pfl insurance beginning in mid2004 both male and female workers could take up to six weeks of paid time off to bond with their new biological adopted or foster children in addition they became entitled to wage replacement while absent from work to care for seriously ill children parents spouses or domestic partners employers may require workers to use maximum of two weeks of accrued vacation time before drawing payments from the insurance fund like the states tdi program employers must make deductions from the wages of employees to pay for pfl the deductions are deposited in the states disability fund pfl must be taken concurrently with the maximum of 12 weeks of unpaid familymedical leave available to eligible employees of covered employers under the california family rights act cfra the act was passed in 1991 and amended in 1993 to conform to federal legislation discussed immediately below the most noteworthy differences between cfra and pfltdi are that the former provides workers at firms with at least 50 employees unpaid time off with the right to continued health benefit coverage and guaranteed reinstatement to the same or comparable job the latter provides almost all employees cash benefits during their shortterm absence but not job protection two other states have since enacted paid family leave legislation washington state passed family leave insurance program in 2007 it will partially compensate eligible workers at firms with at least 25 employees who take up to five weeks of jobprotected leave in connection with the birth or adoption of child the paid timeoff must be taken concurrently with unpaid leave taken under the federal family and medical leave act fmla benefit payments will become available on october 1 2009 pending submission to the legislature of task forces recommended financing plan and passage of implementing legislation by january 1 200829 the task force recommended that the program be administered by the employment security department and that startup costs should come from the states general fund its members could not agree on longterm financing mechanism in the states supplemental budget signed by the governor in april 2008 62 million is provided as startup funding for the program it is hoped that during 28 crs report rl33710 state family and medical leave laws by jon shimabukuro cassandra l foley and tara alexandra rainson hereafter cited as crs report rl33710 state family and medical leave laws 29 the bill as introduced had included payroll tax on employees crs8 the 2009 session of the legislature longterm solution to the funding issue will be enacted that permits employees to begin taking leave under the program on october 1 2009 as stated in the law in 2008 new jersey also enacted family leave legislation but unlike washingtons law it included financing mechanism the statute will enable almost all workers to take up to six weeks of paid time off starting july 1 2009 to bond with newborn or newly adopted child and to care for child spouse domestic partner civil union partner or parent employers may require workers to use maximum of two weeks of any paid sick leave vacation time or other leave before being eligible to draw payments from the insurance fund as in california which also is tdi state the new jersey family leave program will be funded by employees through payroll deduction and the cash benefits must run concurrently with unpaid jobprotected leave taken under the federal family and medical leave act many more states have mandated the unpaid jobprotected approach to family medical leave found in the california family rights act than have adopted the insurance approach some 35 states and the district of columbia either proposed or passed unpaid jobprotected timeoff legislation shortly after the first familymedical leave bill was introduced in congress in 198530 the family and medical leave act congress passed and president clinton signed the family and medical leave act fmla pl 1033 in 1993 the federal law entitles eligible employees at covered employers to leave without pay for the following reasons the birth of child of the employee and to care for the newborn child the placement with the employee of child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child to care for an immediate family member ie spouse child under age 18 or any age if incapable of selfcare due to an activitylimiting disability or parent with serious health condition that necessitates the employees presence31 or 30 janine parry family leave policies examining choice and contingency in industrialized nations nwsa journal vol 13 3 fall 2001 31 the term serious health condition is defined at 29 cfr part 825 as an illness injury or mental or physical condition that involves any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care in hospital hospice or residential mental facility period of incapacity requiring absence of more than three consecutive days from work school or other regular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by or under the supervision of health care provider any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or prenatal care period of incapacity that is permanent or longterm due to chronic condition for continued crs9 to care for the employees own serious health condition including maternityrelated disability that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of hisher position the latest labor department survey shows that the predominant reason for leavetaking under the fmla in 19992000 at 49 was to attend to the employees own health including maternityrelated disability caregiving for newborn newly adopted or newly placed foster children followed at almost half the rate about the same fraction of fmla leavetakers used their time off to care for ill family members32 employees who take leave under the act are generally guaranteed the right to reemployment in the same or comparable positions employers cannot retaliate against workers for taking fmla leave by for example firing them but employers are allowed to terminate leavetakers for legitimate business reasons eg the duties of the unit in which the employee works are outsourced private sector firms that had 50 or more employees on their payrolls for at least 20 workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year must allow employees to take leave under the act if the employees worked for them at least 12 months minimum of 1250 hours and at facility where at least 50 employees are employed by the firm within 75 miles regardless of their size public sector employers eg federal and local governments congress and its agencies also must provide fmla leave33 the acts 12 workweeks of leave in 12month period firmsize threshold and reasons for leave are minimum standards employees who work for employers that offer or are covered by collective bargaining agreements that include more expansive familymedical leave or who work in jurisdictions that have enacted more comprehensive statutes are entitled to the more generous benefits34 31 continued which treatment may not be effective or any absences to receive multiple

with serious health condition and for pregnancyrelated disability as recently as june 2007 the oregon legislature amended the statute to require that employers allow employees to use their paid sick leave for leave taken under the act previously use of sick for family leave was matter of employer policy see also crs report rl33710 state family and medical leave laws and httpwwwdolgovesa programswhdstatefmlaindex_pfhtm crs10 the 12 workweeks of leave need not be taken consecutively employees caring for their own serious health condition or that of an eligible family member can take time off intermittently or work reduced schedule eg shortened workday employees must obtain their employers agreement if they want to take leave intermittently or work reduced schedule in the case of the two other fmla qualifying reasons employees may elect or employers may require them to use accrued paid vacation time or personal leave for the acts unpaid leave the substitution of paid family or sick leave is subject to the employers policy concerning the use of these benefits the fmla differs from tdi by being national in scope providing more reasons for leave35 continuing health benefit coverage for absent workers and guaranteeing job security the tdi programs for their part provide cash benefits and do not have firmsize exclusions employees drawing tdi benefits cannot be terminated however if they have not exhausted their entitlement to leave under the fmla or comparable state laws analogously employees receiving cash payments under californias pfl program while caring for newborn newly adopted or newly placed children and while caring for children spouses or parents cannot be terminated while still entitled to leave under the fmla or cfra the birth and adoption unemployment compensation plan president clinton directed the department of labor dol to propose regulations enabling states to utilize tax dollars accumulated in the federalstate unemployment compensation uc program to partially replace the wages of parents who opt to take time off to bond with their newborn or newly adopted children the purpose of the birth and adoption unemployment compensation baauc experiment popularly known as baby ui was to allow dol to determine if the availability of cash benefits to working parents within 52 weeks of the birth or placement for adoption of child encourages longterm attachment to the labor force36 unlike the fmla baauc leave was not guaranteed nationwide and employers did not have to retain employees receiving baauc unless they were also fmlaeligible the reasons for leave under baauc were much narrower than under the fmla as well alternatively the firmsize requirements of the fmla did not apply to baauc which was guided by the much broader employer coverage of the uc program dol included model state legislation in an appendix to the baauc regulations which went into effect in mid2000 the model baby ui bill envisioned the availability of baauc for maximum of 12 weeks and the time not worked would be counted toward the maximum duration of unemployment benefits it also 35 only californias tdi program in combination with its pfl program provides reasons for leave comparable to those under the fmla 36 65 fr 114 june 13 2000 p 37210 crs11 assumed that states would base the amount of baauc benefits on the same criteria earnings and employment histories as their individual uc programs and would deduct other income eg employerprovided paid sick or family leave and the value of employer contribution to disability insurance from baauc payments in commentary attached to the regulation dol noted that it was not imposing solvency requirements on states before their enactment of baauc the department stated its expectation that states would not initiate baauc without first examining the impact on the solvency of their uc trust funds in late 2003 the bush administration rescinded baauc as part of review of all dol regulations the review was undertaken in the context of recession having led to much reduced balances in state uc funds and challenge in federal district court to the consistency of baauc with federal uc law37 the bush administration declared baauc to be misapplication of federal uc law relating to the aa requirements which state that person must be able and available for suitable work to be eligible for unemployment benefits38 it disagreed with the clinton administrations explanation of the baauc rule as part of an evolving interpretation of the aa requirements that recognizes practical and economic realities eg not terminating or denying uc benefits to individuals while they are awaiting recall to the firms that temporarily laid them off39 the bush administration declared that the intended recipients of baauc generally do not meet this test as they have initiated their separation from the workforce and it is their personal situation rather than the lack of available work that has removed them from the labor market because the baauc experiment is based on an assumption of increased future labor force attachment the payment of baauc will likely be made for periods where parents have completely suspended their labor force attachment indeed in cases where the parent is on approved leave from job baauc more closely resembles paidleave program than uc program40 it further stated that congress intended the uc system to be subordinate to the main task of getting people back to work baauc is not consistent with this goal since it encourages parents to refuse available work41 some 24 babyui bills were introduced in 20 states in 2001 the year after the baauc regulation became effective42 but state had passed legislation before the regulation was removed in november 2003 37 see lpa inc v chao 211 fsupp 2d 160 ddc 2002 dismissed on procedural grounds 38 67 fr 233 december 4 2002 p 72122 39 65 fr 114 june 13 2000 p 37213 40 67 fr 233 december 4 2002 p

of states while the baauc regulation was in effect and the handful of states with tdi laws they appear reluctant to require familymedical leave benefits by taking either an approach based on unemployment or disability insurance the belief that higher taxes paid by companies located in states that adopt either approach arguably putting them at competitive disadvantage with firms in nonadopting states might contribute to this reluctance on the part of individual states the uc program is largely financed through state and federal payroll taxes of employers and three of the five states with tdi programs partly finance them through payroll tax on employers the incidence and cost of leave benefits unlike the abundant data on wages and salaries less information is available on the benefits paid to workers at present benefits account for 30 of the total compensation wages and benefits of employees in the civilian economy43 leave benefits which represent 7 of total compensation receive short shrift compared to the information on some other supplements to wages voluntarily provided by employers for example the governments primary survey of the labor force the current population survey cps does not ask households about time off from work while it does ask about health and retirement benefits these benefits respectively account for almost 8 and over 4 of total compensation as result there is limited data on gender age and other demographic characteristics of workers by employer provision of paid leave the us bureau of labor statistics bls more often looks to employers for information on benefits because they typically furnish more reliable information than households do on the details of employerprovided benefit plans and the employers costs for providing those benefits44 the national compensation survey ncs collects information from companies on benefit incidence as well as compensation cost levels and trends firm size as measured by the number of employees is one of the company characteristics for which the ncs obtains data again employer rather than household surveys are better source of size information although the ncs lacks demographic information on employees receiving benefits it does afford data by job characteristics eg occupation industry and earnings some private firms conduct compensation surveys but the results may be proprietary very expensive to access or not representative of typical business practices eg if the survey covers primarily large corporations for these reasons the analysis below is derived from the ncs and to provide demographic information from the national survey of americas families and the medical 43 bls employer costs for employee compensation september 2007 december 11 2007

paid leave for personal reasons employers in the private sector offer paid family leave to very small percentage of their workers 8 as shown in table 1 regardless of the type of paid leave it usually is true that relatively more private sector employees in whitecollar occupations ie management professional and related sales and office than bluecollar occupations ie natural resources construction and maintenance production transportation and material moving or service occupations eg food cleaning personal health and protective service workers have access to leave with pay relatively more fulltime than parttime workers receive paid leave relatively more union than nonunion employees have the opportunity to take leave with pay and relatively more higher than lower paid employees are provided leave as part of their compensation package in terms of company rather than worker characteristics it generally is the case that regardless of the type of paid leave relatively more employees of larger than smaller establishments receive leave with pay relatively more workers in firms located in metropolitan than nonmetropolitan areas have access to paid leave benefits and relatively more employees at firms in the new england and middle atlantic regions compared to other regions are provided paid leave the picture is more mixed for incidence of paid time off by sector of employment substantially larger percentages of businesses that produce goods than produce services offer employees leave for vacations and holidays the opposite is true for sick leave if government is added to the private serviceproducing sector shown in table 1 the gap in sick leave provision between the two sectors is even wider when the bls last surveyed benefit incidence in state and local governments crs14 in 1998 96 of their employees had sick leave45 federal employees similarly have near universal access to paid sick leave as well as many of the other benefits for which data are collected in the ncs they also are permitted to use their annual leave not only for vacations but also for personal reasons46 in addition they can use sick leave for family caregiving and bereavement some state governments also permit their employees to use sick leave for other reasons eg family caregiving47 45 bls employee benefits in state and local governments 1998 december 2000 percentage applies to

information on the characteristics of working parents 1854 years old with any type of paid leave significantly more fathers 835 than mothers 762 report having any time off with pay married parents 815 are significantly more likely than single parents 738 to have access to paid leave receipt of paid leave increases with age of parents and age of youngest child as result it appears that workers with great need for leave parents with very young children are the least likely to have access to leave48 access to paid leave benefits increases in step with family income measured as percentage of the federal poverty level two other studies similarly estimated direct relationship between family income and receipt of paid time off from work on the basis of data from the national longitudinal study of youth 76 of families in the bottom quartile of the income distribution lacked paid sick leave and 58 lacked paid vacations at some point while employed between 1990 and 1996 in contrast 40 of families in the top quartile of the income distribution lacked paid sick leave and 41 lacked paid vacations49 similarly results from the kaiser foundations 2001 womens health survey show that 64 of employed women with family income below 200 of the federal poverty level are not paid when they miss work to care for sick child compared to 37 of working women in higher income families50 welfare receipt at any time significantly reduces parents likelihood of having paid leave according to the analysis of nsaf data but leave availability is greater among those longer receiving welfare than among current recipients with almost three in five working parents currently on welfare lacking any type of paid time off the studys author describes the low rate of access to paid leave among parents currently receiving welfare as troubling because these parents may be trying to move off public assistance without ample work supports including jobprotected leave they may be unable to keep their ties to the labor market in the event of family crisis or even just sick child51 the data from the nsaf household survey accord with that from the ncs employer survey in terms of the relationship of benefit access to hours worked and firm size employees who work fewer hours are less likely to be offered time off with pay and the incidence of paid leave is lower at smaller than larger employers the availability of paid leave among working parents generally increases with job tenure for poor working parents however access to any kind of paid leave is 48 katherine ross phillips getting time

associated with low provision of paid leave benefits see table 1 detailed look at paid sick leave the medical expenditures panel survey meps cosponsored by the agency for healthcare research and quality and the national center for health statistics asks nationally representative sample of households in the civilian noninstitutional population about demographic characteristics job characteristics and access to paid sick leave in the following analysis of the household component of meps data for 2004 undertaken by the congressional research service individuals are considered employed if they had job when they were interviewed or had job to return to on the date of the interview sick leave coverage is for the main job held on the interview date selfemployed persons and individuals who did not respond to the sick leave question are excluded little more than three in five workers 617 reported that their employers provide paid sick leave52 the meps also asked households about access to paid vacations which are available to almost seven in ten employees 696 although the magnitudes not surprisingly vary given the different employee populations and time periods they cover the meps and ncs data agree that relatively more workers have access to paid time off to take vacations than to care for illnesses or injuries as shown in table 2 relatively more employed women 632 than men 603 have sick leave in their compensation package small but statistically significant difference married persons 692 also are significantly more likely than nevermarried individuals 473 who could include single parents to have access to the leave benefit although more than 60 of employees age 25 and older receive paid sick leave this is true for fewer than half as many younger workers the high rate of parttime employment among young workers and the low incidence of sick leave among part timers may partly account for this finding in 2006 45 of 16 to 24yearolds at work in nonfarm industries usually were employed fewer than 35 hours week part time employment among those aged 25 and older was much lower 2053 as shown in table 1 22 of parttime workers versus 68 of fulltime workers had paid sick leave coverage in that year54 52 the total employment on which the percentages were calculated is individuals who responded to both the paid sick leave as well as demographic income and other questions 53 bls employment and earnings january 2007 table 22 54 the meps data also show that the rate of paid sick leave receipt is lower among persons employed parttime

receive paid sick leave than the nonhispanic groups shown in table 2 the industry employment pattern among hispanics may contribute to this outcome because they work at well aboveaverage rates in few industry groups where access to paid sick leave is limited in 2006 when hispanics accounted for 136 of all employed persons they represented 194 of workers in agriculture and related industries eg crop production and the same share of workers in leisure and hospitality industries eg traveler accommodations restaurants and other food services 251 of workers in the construction industry were of

just 280 of employees with less than 12 years of schooling have paid sick leave compared to 808 of those who completed 4 years of college occupational employment patterns may help explain this pattern

positive relationship between employee earnings and the prevalence of paid sick leave appears in the meps data which echoes the pattern found in the ncs shown in table 158 just 169 of persons who

extraction and maintenance production transportation and material moving 58 additionally study of 2006 ncs microdata by the institute for womens policy research iwpr estimated that 21 of workers in the bottom quartile of the wage distribution had paid sick leave in 2006 while 72 of workers in the top quartile received the benefit testimony of iwpr president heidi hartmann before the us senate committee on health education labor and pensions hearing on the healthy families act february 13 2007 crs22 among those who earned between 726 and 2000 per hour59 the percentage of employees who had access to the benefit was still higher over 80 for those paid more than 2000 an hour part of the reason lowwage workers are less frequently offered paid sick or other leave benefits may be that employers consider them more easily replaceable than higher skilled workers in whom they tend to make greater investments eg training table 6 earnings of workers with paid sick leave by earnings 2004

prepared by us congressional research service from the 2004 medical expenditures panel survey meps household component cost to employers paid time off from work composes considerable part of the employee benefit package the cost to employers of offering leave with pay 195 per hour worked on average in nonfarm private industries and state and local government nonetheless comes in well behind insurance and legally required benefits see table 7 if congress were to pass either of two proposed paths to paid family medical leave mandate or tdi program funded in part through payroll tax on employers one would expect the compensation costs of employers to increase because employees generally are more valuable ie productive to businesses after imposition of benefit however they have economically sound reason to raise their workforces total compensation as result of either congressional action economists therefore theorize that firms will try to finance the added benefit cost by reducing or slowing the growth of other components of compensation bls computes benefit costs across all surveyed employers whether or not they provide the benefit therefore the cost per hour worked will be affected by the incidence of benefit provision not surprisingly then in light of the abovedescribed frequency of provision by type of leave the employers average cost per hour worked 59 an hourly rate of 725 was chosen because that is the wage to which the federal minimum was raised in pl 11028 the next interval 7262000 was chosen because the average hourly earnings of all wage and salary workers in 2004 was 2034 as estimated by crs from the march supplement to the cps crs23 is highest for vacations followed by holidays the lower incidence of sick leave benefits is reflected in its average cost being about onethird that for vacations and onehalf that for holidays good deal of variation exists between private firms and state and local government in labor costs for time not worked the widest disparity between the two types of employers occurs in connection with paid sick leave the time off allowed employees to care for illness or injury costs private firms 22 cents per hour worked on average state and local government 76 cents once again this difference reflects the generally greater prevalence of sick leave among government workers table 7 employer costs per hour

september 2007 december 11 2007 note benefit costs are computed across all surveyed employers whether or not they provide the benefit percentages may not add to 100 due to rounding and omission of miscellaneous benefits supplemental pay is premium pay for working overtime weekends or holidays shift differentials and nonproduction bonuses b legally required benefits are social security unemployment compensation and workers compensation within the private sector the cost of leave benefits per hour worked usually is less on average at smaller than larger companies because relatively few small businesses offer paid leave see table 8 for example the provision of paid sick leave at workplaces with fewer than 99 employees averages 14 cents per hour worked at workplaces with 100 or more employees 30 cents per hour worked there is little variability in the average cost of sick leave provision between firms crs24 with 1 to 49 employees versus 50 to 99 employees as also is the case according to ncs data60 however the average cost of offering employees sick leave doubles between firms with 100 to 499 employees and 500 or more employees table 8 employer costs per hour worked for

statistics employer costs for employee compensation september 2007 december 11 2007 concluding remarks access to the paid time off from work that employers voluntarily provide is not evenly distributed across employees this unevenness appears to exacerbate wage inequality with leave benefits more often available to higher than lower paid workers to more rather than less educated workers to whitecollar compared to blue collar or service workers to persons working full rather than parttime and to employees of larger in contrast to smaller firms the us government has comparatively limited role in mandating or regulating leave benefits the sole leave entitlement congress passed unpaid time off under the fmla has long hotly debated history state governments have been more active in this policy area than the federal government nonetheless very few states appear interested in enacting individually familymedical leave statute that provides both cash benefits and job security businesses for their part have been loosening the link between employment and benefit provision in the last several years eg the shift from traditional pensions to 401k retirement plans and ceasing to extend employee health insurance to retirees 60 according to unpublished ncs data for march 2006 when 57 of employees in nonfarm private industries had access to paid sick leave 48 of employees at firms with 114 employees 49 of employees at firms with 1549 employees 47 of employees at firms with 5099 employees and 69 of firms with 100 or more employees had access to paid sick leave for other
