exempt from the mandatory credit counseling requirement in certain circumstances for example the requirement does not apply to debtor who resides in district where the us trustee has determined that approved credit counseling agencies in that district are not reasonably able to provide adequate services to such individuals9 debtor may also be temporarily exempted from the mandatory credit counseling requirement if the debtor submits to the court certification10 that 1 describes exigent circumstances meriting waiver of this requirement 2 states that the debtor requested credit counseling services from an approved credit counseling agency but was unable to obtain such services within the fiveday period beginning on the date the debtor made the request and 3 is satisfactory to the court11 this exemption terminates when the debtor meets the requirements for credit counseling participation but not longer than 30 days after the case is filed unless the court for cause extends this period up to an additional 15 days 12 the requirements for an exemption from credit counseling under section 109h are considered stringent and failure to strictly follow the requirements has led to both denial of exemptions and an inability to file for bankruptcy13 in addition debtor may be exempt from the mandatory credit counseling requirement if the court determines after notice and hearing that the debtor is unable to complete this requirement because of incapacity disability or active military duty in military combat zone14 incapacity under this provision means the debtor is impaired by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency so that the debtor is incapable of realizing and making rational decisions with respect to financial responsibilities15 disability under the 11 usc 109h provision means that the debtor is so physically impaired as to be unable after reasonable effort to receive credit counseling whether by participating in person or via telephone or internet briefing16 bapcpa also amends the bankruptcy code to deny discharge to chapter 7 and chapter 13 debtors who fail to complete personal financial management instructional course17 this requirement does not apply if the debtor resides in district where the us trustee has determined that the approved instructional courses in that district are not adequate18 such determination must be reviewed annually by the us trustee19 in addition these provisions do not apply to debtor who the court determines after notice and hearing is unable to complete this requirement 9 id 11 usc 109h2 the us trustee is appointed by the us attorney general and is authorized to supervise the administration of chapter 7 and chapter 13 bankruptcy cases see 28 usca 581 28 usca 586a3 some states allow for bankruptcy administrator to perform this role and this is acceptable under bapcpa 10 use of the term certification in bapcpa has led to some controversy the term certification which was not used in the bankruptcy code prior to bapcpa appears severa l times in the 2005 act definition for the term was included in bapcpa courts are split as to how to apply the term in reference to section 109 see

bankruptcy courts have examined number of issues concerning bapcpas credit counseling requirements most commonly courts have looked at the provisions of section 109h and have ruled on 1 what circumstances constitute sufficient grounds to waive41 the credit counseling requirements and 2 the period of time in which debtor must receive credit counseling to be eligible for filing for bankruptcy the following cases present some of the circumstances under which the requirements of section 109h have been analyzed42 36 11 usc 111d1b 37 11 usc 111d1c 38 11 usc 111d1d 39 11 usc 111d1e 40 11 usc 111d2 41 it should be noted that while section 109h3 as well as some courts refer to waiver of the credit counseling requirements the word waiver as used in ths section may be misleading debtor who receives waiver of the credit counseling requirements under section 109h3 must obtain this counseling within 30 days after the bankruptcy case is filed unless this period is extended for an additional 15 days by court see hrept 10931 p 55 the court in in re dixon 338 br 383 bap 8 th cir 2006 pointed out this discrepancy and stated that what court is authorized to grant would be better described as deferral 42 while not discussed in this report one controversial issue that courts have considered is whether bankruptcy petition should be dismissed or stricken due to debtors failure to receive credit c ounseling under bapcpa whether case is dismissed or stricken has different implicati ons for debtors for discussion of this issue see in re salazar continued

debtor may be temporarily exempted from mandatory credit counseling if debtor submits to the court certification that 1 describes exigent circumstances meriting waiver of this requirement 2 states that the debtor requested credit counseling services from an approved credit counseling agency but was unable to obtain such services within the fiveday period beginning on the date the debtor made the request and 3 is satisfactory to the court in dixon chapter 13 debtor filed certification requesting waiver of credit counseling in his certification the debtor claimed exigent circumstances based on the fact that foreclosure sale was scheduled for the debtors home on the same day as the bankruptcy filing43 further the debtor claimed that after he learned of the credit counseling requirement he was informed that it would be two weeks before credit counseling could be obtained over the telephone and 24 hours before the counseling could be accessed by the internet based on these circumstances the debtor argued that it was impossible for him to receive credit counseling prior to the foreclosure sale the bankruptcy court refused to waive the credit counseling requirement and denied the bankruptcy petition on appeal the us bankruptcy appellate panel for the eighth circuit considered whether the bankruptcy court erred in its decision to deny the waiver the panel discussed the meaning of exigent circumstances and pointed out that there are two requirements first that there be exigent circumstances and second that the exigent circumstances must merit waiver of the credit counseling requir ement in discussing whether waiver of credit counseling requirements is appropriate the panel explained that debtors exigency must be such that it precludes debtor from obtaining the credit counseling within the fiveday window preceding the bankruptcy 44 the panel went on to describe exigent as meaning that the debtor finds himself in situation in which adverse events are imminent and will occur before the debtor is able to avail himself of the statutory counseling45 the panel acknowledged that in virtually all cases including the instant case debtors have exigent circumstances the real question the panel explained was whether exigent circumstances present were deserving of waiver the panel noted that in the earlier decision the court had observed that state law required 20 days notice of foreclosure with that much notice the panel found the circumstances were not exigent the panel concluded that the bankruptcy court had not abused its discretion in denying the waiver and affirmed the decision 46 continued 339 br 622 63334 bankr sd tex 2006 43 in re dixon 338 br 383 388 bap 8th cir 2006 affg in re dixon bankr ed mo nov 10 2005 44 the panel also discussed the meaning of

as mentioned above under section 109h2 debtor may be exempt from credit counseling if the debtor resides in district where the us trustee has determined that approved credit counseling agencies are not reasonably able to provide adequate services to such individuals in petit louis the debtor who could only speak and understand creole filed chapter 7 bankruptcy petition47 because the debtor could not obtain the credit counseling in creole and because he could not afford to hire an interpreter the debtor requested that the us trustee either waive the credit counseling requirement provide creole interpreter or decertify the approved counseling agencies for failure to provide creole speaking counselors the us trustee declined the requests of the debtor and the debtor then applied to the bankruptcy court for waiver of the counseling requirements the us trustee claimed among other things that the trustee had responsibility to provide language interpreters and that lack of english capability was not sufficient reason for waiver the court found that the credit counseling agencies in the district were not reasonably able to provide adequate services to the debtor and the court waived the credit counseling requirement on motion for reconsideration the us trustee argued that the court did not have the authority to waive the credit counseling requirement the court disagreed and ruled that not only could court waive the credit counseling requirement under section 109h3 it also had the authority to waive the requirement under section 109h2 the us trustee also argued that the court did not have the right to review us trustee finding that credit counseling agencies in the district were adequate the court again disagreed and found that the forum was proper the court affirmed its determination that credit counseling services in the southern district of florida were inadequate for this debtor the court explained that mr petitlouis had properly invoked the courts jurisdiction by notifying the us trustee that he intended to challenge the adequacy of the credit counseling available and giving the us trustee an opportunity to respond the us trustees motion for reconsideration was denied

amends section 109 of the bankruptcy c ode to require an individual to receive credit counseling prior to filing petition for bankruptcy in general most courts have strictly followed this provision and have been reluctant for any reason to accept bankruptcy petition when credit counseling was sought or obtained after the petition was filed for example in davenport debtor claimed she was unable to receive prepetition counseling due to the repossession of her car48 she later obtained counseling after filing bankruptcy petition and sought to be excused from the prepetition requirement the

be obtained within the 180day period preceding the date of filing for bankruptcy in warren debtor received credit counseling on the day he filed his bankruptcy petition50 although the debtor filed certain documentation with the court in timely manner the debtor filed the certificate of credit counseling after filing his bankruptcy petition the us trustee claimed that the case should be dismissed because under the statute the certificate of credit counseling was required to be filed with the bankruptcy petition and counseling had to be received at least one day before the filing date the debtor argued that the case should be allowed to proceed because credit counseling was obtained prepetition the bankruptcy court sided with the debtor and refused to dismiss the case the court found the late filing of the credit counseling certificate was not automatically fatal to the debtors case and stated that because the debtor had already received credit counseling the requirement for filing the certification with the bankruptcy petition was matter of form over substance the court also discussed the meaning of the word date and concluded that date refers to not only specific calendar day but to specific day month year and time of day the debtor had complied with the requirements of 109h1 because he had received credit counseling few hours before filing for bankruptcy 51
