whole track lecture given on 25 january 1962 thank you okay what do we have here we have the 26th of jan ad 12 and here we go for lecture on what i know what do you need what dont you know anything about oh scientology all right come on what dont you know anything about what do you feel foggy on female voice track traps female voice track male voice track track track oh wow female voice the whole track yeah whole track i dont know i havent given lecture on whole track for years do you want to hear something about whole track audience yes well once upon time there was thetan and he was free and all powerful and stupid and he didnt have any judgment at all because he had experience of any kind and he thought if he just kept battering out things and withholding things and keeping things from coming in on him that he would then stay as powerful as he had always been and that was mistake because the more he battered out the more he felt he ought to withholdbecause at the same time he was doing all this he was making other people guilty of battering out and telling them they shouldnt have done it and then he duplicated those he told he shouldnt have done it and the final analysis was that he was withholding and here you are today oh its very intriguing the ideas of the whole track but itd be niceitd be nice if you had ever lived before but of course this is just an idea this is just an idea im reminded of john and he left here in pretty good shape that was good win for us but i think in all of the twelve years of arduous processing and hammering and pounding or something like thati think it was just the educational process had just made little dent on his case17th acc i think in all those years there wasnt single process that had ever been brought out that had ever made dent on him and he got over here and he started running into routine 3a and 3d and security checking and few things like that and all of sudden why he blew off the first terminal of the goals problem mass and found himself upgrading rapidly into other things and he was really flying andgive you an idea how he was flying he cancelled the plane which would have gotten him home by christmas to his family in order to get another session from norman he did didnt he norman male voice yes and norman tied into it and found an obstructionist as the upgraded terminal of menial and this was tying into the teeth of cruel person and in between an obstructionist and so forth there had been hidden terminal called troublemaker and in that session he became absolutely certain that he had been troublemaker which he had never been and that blew in just that one session didnt it and then he found this obstructionist and i think went home with that package isnt that right id think if hehe was smart because if he had left here just teetering on the edge of tipping over into troublemaker look at all the trouble wed had well anyway that is the toughest case i ever came up against in that the case was just quietly tough you know there was nothing spectacular about it but probably right here there are some people who have audited this fellow or seen him gone and they knew how rough this case was and so we made dent on it all right we got him flying all right swell but what did it take to do this it took very very precise knowledge of the whole track it took precise knowledge of the consequences ofthat thetan runs into and how he had gotten himself balled up and how hed tangled himself up along the line and then if you knew this perfectly why of course you could take it apart thats fairly easy to do some lectures on this exist under routine 3 and they have to do with this but you are following rule in auditing whole track and that rule isit occurs actually as first or second sentence of one of the sectional books of dianetics modern science of mental health if you can parallel what the mind is doing and undo that or handle that why you will get gain and that is the basic rule of processing and we have not violated that rule in all these years thats remarkable that that thing has remained that constant well lets take look at this if an individual had lived only once and then you processed that one lifetime he had lived wouldnt it become apparent after while that the individual would glow clear and disentangle gorgeously on just having audited that one lifetime lets just present that as piece of evidence thatd be possible wouldnt it actually if an individual had lived only one lifejust onehere he was and if he was just meat body and so forth and you know he has psychologicaltype brain you know solid meat and if that wasall there was to this fellow then he would untangle in this lifetime in other words the aberrations could be untangled and so forth if they ever could be now if one lifetime were true then freudian analysis would work if just one lifetime were true freudian analysis would work but freudian analysis didnt work if just one lifetime were true then running the engrams off one lifetime would clear somebody right and that is not true and cant be done you run the lifeall the engrams out of one lifetime you can straighten somebody up remarkably you can do marvelous things but for some reason or other there is always little additional bug unless you go at it on the basis of conditioning the individual to be able to confront all of the pictures and things and stuff that he found in the bankthat is to say he isnt afraid of pictures and hes not fighting themyou can actually do very delicate keyout on one lifetime and leave him separate from all of these masses and so forth well you canyou can accomplish that now theres justthats just evidence this has nothing to do with anybodys recall this has to do only with the technical aspects of existence in scientology nineteen fiftyone i rolled up my sleeves and started to investigate the whole track because in 1950late 1950it had started to raise its ugly and unseemly head and auditors who would run into it and try to audit it and pcs who dare bring it up of course ran into considerable social ostracism of one character or another that was not done the first foundation board tried to pass regulation board ruling to the effect that nobody would ever look at believe in or investigate past lives and so forth and yet auditors in auditing them kept running into them you see so that probably was the basic splitup of the first foundation the first foundation wanted to sit there comfortably and just grind on and on in presentlife engrams and consider that we had it all made and they wanted further research or investigation of any kind whatsoever well that wouldnt go and that was that because auditors were not turning out the results they should have turned out if one had only lived one life so in 1951 thisi didnt fly in the teeth of this i would have investigated anything i mean theres real resistance on my part you show something tell i cant investigate it im liable to investigate it you show something and tell i can investigate it im liable to investigate it i mean there is influence in that line ijust down through the trillennia i have not paid attention to andor paid attention to people who have told not to look i just have not paid any attention to this one way or the other this of course adds up to total neglect of thethe finer sensibilities i think theyre called of other people the finer sensibilities i think is another way of expressing the idea hes too yellow to look so anyway 1951 i started in to investigate how far back this went and where it went and actually an entire year was spent and mary sue was of considerable assistance at that time and we went plowing aroundi didnt mean to modify that by saying at that time only i thinki think there was time there in 54 when you were also of assistance for but to be very blunt about the thing there wasnt anything i dont think that we didnt chew into one way or the other if there was any free track associated with it we looked at it and the result of that work the records of that work dont exist because you cant sit around and do research and make records you either research and get research done or you make records and the primary thing they do today in the field of research is to make records and youll find the timewasting and expensive thing to do in research is making records that costs like mad and you have 185 clerks filing and compiling records in quintuplicate and crossfiling and crossindicating and what they neglect on the modern research line is to have somebody who is finding any data to record theyve omitted him from the research line of course this is probably very wise because when you think of the people the research is being done for you could see at once why there would be slowdown strike you see on people who could research well look at it governments and politicians and that sort of thing whod do any research for them id research them id use them as case historiesresearch them look around here and find something you can go out of arc with i think theyinvestigate that anyway what we found out basically was lot of the operational characteristics of the emeter were discovered at that time and tremendous numbers of incidents of all shapes sizes squares and types were dredged up in whole sections of track and so forth and i got adid track map at some time or another and you can do track map on an individual its fascinating too but you start to do track maps and you start to do this type of research you are only researching free track now in view of the fact that amongst dozen pcs almost any part of the track is free track you see these twelve different pcs will have different parts of the track grouped and occluded into what we call valences but theyve still got lots of free track amongst them and if you take the free track collectively of these individuals you can get whole track but the goals problem mass consists of those sections of track you know not what of which have become balled up into what we have for long time called circuits weve called them valences weve called them ridgesthey have had numerous names of course ridge deserves just little bit ofit isnt valence ridge is ridge but valence or circuit are definitely just an identity that is so dominant that it balls up whole section of the whole track it takes large section of the whole track and bundles it all up in black ball and its gotall full of pictures and when you think at it it does thinkingness and this is all very very tricky thetan never made these things he lived this life and then he got in trouble and it all went scrunch and hes since maintained it well of course it was tryinghe was trying to persist while he was it so of course the common denominator of all such circuits and valences is persistence so naturally there they are and youll find them right here in present time today theyre persisting well you take whole section of lives lets say he lived numerous lives as plumber and all these lives as plumber if he then withheld it and considered them reprehensible and attacked things as plumber and was attacked as plumber and bunch of other conditionsin other words your four flows are beautifully violated and mucked up during these four six eight ten twelve lives as plumber youre going to get gaudy mass of condensed pictures and characteristics and individual thinkingnesses behavior patterns everything that you now consider an individual is all going to be bundled up in little black ball and that little black ball we call valence or circuit and when it begets activated or restimulated of course since he has been it he can now dramatize it and when it is too close in on top of himand i do mean that in actual spacewhen it is too close in terms of space to the pc he will dramatize it now to run out its individual characteristics is long thankless arduous and stupid task and thered be reason to do this you can run out the whole package all at once so there isnt any reason to take it apart characteristic by characteristic now that thing im talking about that circuit or valencebetter known as valence but it operates as circuit anything ive ever said about circuits are done by valencesall of that in balledup mass is mass it is an electronic mass it does have weight it does have density it does have influence you could feel it and so forth it is actuallyto the degreeto the degree that it is in the mind and therefore rather ephemeral it has the same reality in the mind as big black billiard ball would have sitting out here on the table you see thats justis itisnt any imaginary mass you know that all of us have heard about you know when you run into this thing you go splat see if you picked it up and threw it at somebody it would go splat you see it does have that characteristic you might ask why is your body at this present moment persisting or why is that blackboard persisting well that blackboard is ais mass which is persisting in time and thats all you can say about that present time is persistence of mass well in the mind you get mental mockup which nevertheless is persistence which nevertheless is mass and the primary mistake that you could make about these things is that these things areyoud say these things are imaginary because of course they occur in the imagination and of course when the fellow first runs into one of these things lets take bowling ball you know of some sizeand black bowling balland hes standing there holding this black bowling ball and somebody has greased it up and he drops it and it hits him on the toe well that would hurt that would hurt i guarantee you and if you tried to tell him at that moment that it was an imaginary bowling ball you are liable to get into an argument you would be very likely to get into an argument as he stood there rubbing his toe he would be likely to express not only his opinion of bowling balls but his opinion of you he wouldnt enter into the logic or discussion as to whether or not it was imaginary he would simply refute that that was intolerably stupid well similarly one of these black valence masses when collided with or these mental energies when collided with are imaginary just up to the time of that collision and after somebody yoyos in and out of one or tries to go through one and hits an apathy strata in one and dramatizes it too and after hes had one pushed up against his chest or tearing the back of his head off after hes had all the somatics of the thing going through his stomach or something like that he would not be in any condition to argue with he wouldnt be set up nicely to argue with you couldnt come up and sayi think there are several in this class right now that i dont thinki think it would be adventurous to go up to them and say well you know these masses youve been running into you know theyre just imaginary and they have existence in fact and so on they are just imaginary i think you would get rather interesting argument at that point isnt that right and in fact i dont think youd get much agreement at all i dont think that would be the way to build arc well its not on the basis theyre defending anything its just that it violates reality well whats reality well reality is not what the individual thinks reality is reality is what thethe majority agree it is and you look over this and if people can weigh these things in their hand or feel the pain of these things in the small of their back or as they hover out in front of their faces they perceive them one way or the other why i dont think you have any argument that theyre unreal or imaginary they are real within that viewpoint well its so much for that its almost as if here on broader agreement in the physical universe we were to take billiard balls and bowling balls and footballs and several other types and pile them all up on the table here just keep piling these balls up and get whole big mass of these things and so on well that would be something that would look very like goals problem mass i mean it wouldnt look much different except goals problem mass doesnt have the pretty stitching and it doesnt have orifices to blow them up otherwiseit doesnt have holes in them to pick them up with three fingers but aside from that that would look quite like goals problem mass well of course thetan is really in great position to appreciate the character of their ephemeralness once he collides with them and their ephemeralness ceases to be matter of grave interest to him their isness is great matter of interest to him his effort to notis them being combatted consistently by the isness of them causes him considerable amount of worry so that we find then that the authorities on the field of the human mind dared adventure into those areas which had been totally notised authorities on the field of the human mind do not believe in pictures do not believe in engrams do not believe in time track do not believe in masses dont believe in any of these things so we would say offhand then that they were only brave enough to adventure into those areas which had been totally notised by them so if they had successfully notised something then they were willing to look if you call that looking there is looking and then there is notising and of course notising its veryits very easy to look theres many fool has gone out in battle while the cannonballs were flying by saying i dont see any and thisthe sergeant there lying under the log says well you will presently of course they lug him off to the burial detail shortly if he keeps walking around in all this so i imagine thats whats happened to fieldof thehumanmind people who have been carefully schooled into believing it is all imaginary and then theyve walked into one of these cannonballs they probably tried to tell one another about these cannonballs and the fellow tried to say you know theres cannonballs around here and theyve said well hes gone stark staring batty henow he thinks he is napoleon or something of the sort and they probably disposed of these chaps to the local institution you see the burial detail has gotten them or theyve simply collided with them have actually seen tiny corner of one of these things and have cut and run and have said well we want nothing more to do with the study of the human mind that is about that i mean that settles the point we have now settled the point should anybody ever investigate the human mind the answer is and therefore were going to stick very very closely with freud were going to stick very very closely now with wundt now these are the boys to stay with they dont cause you any trouble they say there is nothing in the mind but meat or inhibitions or an unconscious and that nobody can see hes unconscious so thats all very safe well now you didnt know you were brave people did you but franklyfrankly there is substitute for guts when it comes to taking look at what goes on on the backtrack youre not necessarily brave people youre just people who are willing to look and there were lots of people who would have been willing to look if everybody had told them there was nothing to see and nobody is willing to look when he says theres nothing to see you know somebody goes to the window and looks out and somebody says well whats happening out in the yard and the fellow says nothing so nobody else goes to the window and thats sort of been the field of the human mind here was this terrific battle these tremendous things out there in the yard you see there were all these masses and lines of soldiers and free track and pictures and identities and madnesses and pain and everything else out there in the front yard the fellow went to the window took look outit was his job to be lookoutand he went out and he looked and he saysand they say whats at the window and he says oh theres nothing there nothing there you see blood running all over the place nothing going on theres nothing happening so nobody else bothered to look thats about what it amounts to anybody who has an operation to control people in the past has apparently tried to work this operation on the basis of keeping them from looking at the mind because all the mechanisms of control were resident in the mind and if the mind was much looked at it would asis and therefore with it would asis these mechanisms of slavery and control if you were to take superstitious peopleyou know superstition is powerful control mechanism you may run into valence sometime or another that specialized in it now if you never touch the cherry trees in springneverand if youre careful not to look at the moon during the first part of its phase and if youre awfully awfully careful never to eat your oatmeal with lefthanded spoon you get the enormous number of notlooks that theyre sowing into the thing well if youjust on that basis alone if youve sowed in enough notlooks you would render person so introverted he would be very easy to control he would be very simple to control he would be nothing but an automaton you see how its done you see militarily you see this you must not strike superior officer militarily well what is this mechanism then it means that you must not reach superior officer but superior officer can reach you it makes nice stuck flow doesnt it so after while superior officer says now the best possible survival action that this company of troops can take is to dash over that parapet into the teeth of those new machine guns the enemy has just started firing this is survival action nobody questions it at all and they go over the top of the parapet and thats the end of that nobody has to worry about that company anymore you see but the recruiting sergeants are all talking about the line and they get people in and peoplethey say the best possible thing to do is this or that or the other thing and everybody does it you know if you cant look and if you dont look and if nobody is trying to get you to look of course these mechanisms then all add up to slavery mechanisms they are mechanisms of introversion now if that is the bulk of thing which has been on the whole track and it iswhat do you expect the whole tracks condition to be like the overts of making people introverted so they could be controlledyou get this as different mechanism introverted so they could be controlled you seethe motivators are getting introverted so that one was controlled and the common denominator of the whole thing was dont look and therefore if we kept everybody from looking and if everybody kept us from looking and we get everybodys anchor points well in we of course would wind up with balls of goonk inevitably you see if the individual led twelve lifetimes as plumber and during that whole period of twelve lifetimes he was basically dedicated to keeping customers from looking at their bills or at the plumbing work he had done you see and all of his customers were basically dedicated into keeping him from looking into the bathroom or the guest bedroom at the wrong timein other words their common ground of communication was notlook he didnt want them to look they didnt want him to look well if this is very acute you wind up with ball not track now your track can be plotted against time it goes pocketapocketa pocketapocketapocketa and the seconds go on the minutes go on the days go on and so forth and all of this can be plotted out actually the track isnt vertical or horizontal or diagonal in somebodys mind but person can move from one moment of time to another moment of time the word move is used advisedly because he seems to be in different positions in location while he is in different positions in time so he gets the position change associated with the time change so therefore he thinks of himself as moving in time he does have mobility in time in all those areas except where he has mass where lifeseries of lifetimes or lifetime has become mass he longer has the possibility of moving in time or in space why because all the overts of it were introvertive and all the motivators of it were introvertive so if the overts and the motivators both had the same thing in common the commonest ground was not just dontlook between himself and other valences but introvert and this introversion or looking inward carries with it pulling inward so we have these things taking up actually the most economical geometrical shape for the maximum mass for the minimum space and that is sphere these things actually are spheres so the maximummaximum amount of contentif you want the maximum amount of content or volume of any geometric shape you get sphere and you want the minimal surface for the maximal content you get sphere in other words thats the most pullin thats got the most packed into it and these valences are very funny i heard of one one time very recently in the last three or four weeks you peeked into it and you could see all these little pictures like 35millimeter pictures and when this thing moved in on the pc it hurt and when it moved off that was very nice but when it came around he could look into it and he could see 35 millimeter pictures all color slides in it and so forth well that of course was the fellows track as that identity and you got this identity you see but all of its time track is in ball you see yesterday is tomorrow is next year is last year all time is this time and of course thereits gone down to time so because its gone down to time itll float in present time like shot see time present time whats the differencenot according to this valence so here it is in that ball if you could lay this ball out like you could ayou take ayou know you take aladies you take these bundledup tape measures youre always getting your hip measurements with to make sure that age is not creeping up on you you know lots of those things you take one of those tape measures and here it is and if you wadded it all up in ball and laid it down in front of you you see knead it in so its nice and spherical and so on that would be one of these valences all grouped see thats all time is time everything is here now it is sphere now that thing has got all the identities characteristics ideas type of machinery thinking everything its got is all in it now if you would take both ends of this tape measure if you could find them you see and you just stretch it out like that youd have yourthe lifespan stretched out well it was like that once see it was nicely stretched out but maybe about threequarters of the way through that life it started to ball up and the moment of death sure put the finishing touches on it so it went uomp and there it is all in ball now thats these things youre handling thats these things thats these masses now of course they have engrams in them now what youre facing there is package of engrams now were auditing packages of engrams now if you think of book one supposing where book onebook oneeverywhere you said engram you said valence you see thatinstead of auditing an engram your target was valence you could have transferred over then all the characteristics of valences into these engrams you see you got what im talking about im just trying to give you some kind of an idea so today were not auditing engrams were auditing packages of engrams and were auditing these packages of engrams directly with 3d criss cross and thats what audits them and these packages of engrams contain in them if audited one by one enough engrams to keep an auditor busy for about ten thousand hours of auditingjust one of these packages just one of these packages would have enough engrams in it to keep an auditor busy for about ten thousand hours and hed have to be good auditor at that all right now lets look at this more closely there are tens of thousands of these packages in what we call the goals problem mass so itd be tens of thousands times ten thousand hours you add it up and it makes an impressivelooking piece of arithmetic but it would be just trying to give you an approximate idea say ten thousand hours of auditing and theres tens of thousands of packages each one of which would take ten thousand hours of auditing youd have to multiply ten thousand times ten thousand and youd get quite few hours and i dont think youre going to be around that longi mean just auditing one pc i think youd get bored i doi donti dont think hed see enough gain because hed just be out of one engram into the next engram and on and on and on well now that all means if it were feasible to audit the engrams in these things it would take ten thousand hours but now let cap this its not possible to audit the engrams in them yeah why isnt it possible well thats because youve got the condensed tapemeasure action you could not separate out enough time in one package to audit one consecutive engram now you have seen pc that every time you put them on the time track quote unquote they got brrrrrrp have you ever noticed this youd said to them all right now go to the moment when you hurt your foot and the guy gets about fifty feet seeyou ever have this happen he gets about fifty feet and there are about fifty different times and he cant tell the difference between them and you start moving him off of this point where he hurt his foot and he gets all sorts of feet and then he gets shoes and then the next thing you know he gets foundations and it all goes rrrrrrrp and you say now come on now we just want that one foot that youre sitting there with right now and were goingwere going to audit this footbrrrrrrrp you cant audit it in other words ithis attention every time he hits anything goes brrrrrrrp well youve got fellow whose present lifetime is goals problem mass valence see his lifetimethis lifetime has gone blunk and of course all roads lead to now and all nows lead elsewhere 80 that youve just got now see and you say all right now get inget in contact with your tonsils say the guy has got sore throat you know say get in contact with your tonsils all right he gets in contact with his tonsils see well you say whats happening yeaowayeaayeooo well what happens when you do it yeooo it makes very dizzy he hasnt got an engram in his throat hes got goals problem mass valence in his throat and its an oppterm and every time he hits it he doesnt get the throat somatic he gets dizziness because it starts to move you know and it just shakes everything and this is ooooooh we dont want to have anything to do with that you see what this is so were not auditing individual pictures or individual bodies were auditing packages of pictures and packages of bodies were auditing packages of identities as far as thats concerned i defy you to go into the middle of goals problem mass you know i mean not with any 3dxx see nothing like that lets just say all right now pick up the moment you were roman senator all right thats good whats the matter well i dont find any moment when im roman senator yeaowuuuu yeooooo well go on find the moment when youre roman senator uhmm what are you looking at well its just all black well cant you find the period there where you were roman senator i get knock on the emeter hereroman senator nnaaa well you of course think youve moved him back in time of course youve run him into the goals problem mass and thats all now so he hasnt gone back in time he is right here at now and as far as the roman senator is concerned hes contacted it and if you watched him leave the session he would swing his toga but he couldnt see anything see his pictures are in total condensation thats what bars out knowledge every time you try to think like roman senator or think like plumber if youve got valence of roman senator or valence of plumber everything starts to move slightly and it goes zzzzzz and you dont want anything to do with that so you promptly dont think the kind of thoughts that roman senator or plumber would think and you get into technical school sometime or another and youre going along fine youre learning some carpentry or something like that or how to saw small rabbits out with jigsaws or something and then you have to put pipe through them to make them stand up you know and my god you cant get the pipe through you just do beautiful job of sawing out the bunny out of theout of the piece of board but getting this little piece of pipe through so the bunny will stand up you know thats just something you just cant manage you finally cut your finger on it and have to give up you see every other student in the place they got the little pipe through okay you didnt see thats because if you think or do like plumber youve had it and it isnt that you have mechanism residual which says never again shall i ever be plumber because it is failed life that thinkingness actually didnt have to take place if youve got valence as plumber that can get disturbed in the goals problem mass then every time you try to think like plumber you think like an idiot now you either can go into it wholly and with self determinism whatsoever simply be it with resistanceyoull be lousy one by the way but you could be it with resistance at all you can go on hooking up the coldwater pipes to the fridge you see and draining outdraining out all of the sinks into the freshwater line and you could just go on and people wouldnt quite find anything right with your plumbing but they really wouldnt find anything wrong with your plumbing youd be sick most of the time youd be very sickly sort of plumber but you probably could make ityou probably could make it i think probably most of the politicians that are around right now busy politicking are in the valences of politicians its one of the easiest things in the world to get into one of these valences first the individual just cant stand the thought of it and then he makes up his mind to be it and after that he sort of goes through life this way you see fixedeyed steering an erratic course self determinism nothing of the sort so that stimulus happens response b always occurs you see just bang bang and theyre very easy to handle they dont make much sense but if theyre in that statenow get thisthey dont dare think you see they can only dramatize they cant think they can only dramatize now how many pcs have you run into that you couldnt run think on have you ever run into pc you couldnt run think on you had to run get the idea or something i dont know where hes going to get this idea its evidently dragged in on an endless belt and he takes it off of the assembly line but the idea of thinking is totally foreign to his abilities he cannot think have you ever run into any like this let tell you theyre quite commonquite common you possiblybecause our processes over the last few years havent ever used this to any great extent you probably havent noticed it too much but you say put thought in that object or think thought or think of yourself as any thinkthink you know the individual has got to input thoughtcant do it thats because hes sitting in the middle of goals problem mass case that cannot do that does not really surrender on an auditing process auditing thinkingness you see you dont want them to audit thinkingness in order to get them to think now there were some thinkingness processes in the fourth london we had some thatthey worked bit what isnt thinking i think the process was look around here and find something that isnt thinking well thats very interesting because it would raise their havingness and it would move this valence off far enough so that the individual could think thought of course havingness being havingness and withholds having been pulled off he probably walked out the front door immediately afterwards had it collide with him again and was unable to think once more but it was an interesting phenomenon so there are lot of people around that cant think and they dont dare think if they think it almost kills them they can dramatize but they cant think spot that particular pc because hes of interest to you now trying to find an engram on that pc is one of the more adventurous things that you could do because the second you try to find the engram it goes zzzzzzzzt bzoooooooomswish and you say now all right now lets get the first moment you heard the news your father was dead now lets get the first moment zzzzzzzzzztbazooooooommmboomp boomp whats he got well ive got myself as pirate captain in the year 1051 oh all right now lets justlets just get that moment the first moment when you got the news that zzzzzzzzztboommumzooooooooomboom whats happened whats thatyou look kind of startled whats happened oh uhi dont know i was thinking about my little brother well uhdid he hurt hishurt his foot uhoh he had mumps and you get the idea of preclear being totally out of the auditors control and youre liable to start treating the pc as somebody who is out of control when actually the pc isnt out of control the pc is simply in valence and any time they move as the thetanits actual movement as thetan you seeany time they move slightly as thetan or as thetan put out any fresh energy something activates and it controls them more heavily than the auditor controls them you see the auditor cant hold the bank straight because theres bank to hold straight so the auditor is trying to hold the bank straight and there is bank and theres nothing there but valence now this is very amusing that case of that character cannot have engrams run on him but he can do 3d criss cross like startled gazelle nothing to it give list of people you dont like brrrrrrrrp bangbangbangbangbang differentiate the list bongbongbongbongbong null it out bubowbowbow and all of sudden particularly if you run lots of havingness with this kind of thing why youll find the individual zzzrrrrmoom its all right now you could say well now think thought think thought mmmm hed be able to think little bit you know not for long because youve still got some more masses for him to confront but he wouldnt be solidly impacted into dozen at once now they could be in one valence or they could be in three valences or they could be in valence which is combination of the oppterm and terma combination valence it has all the characteristics of the terminal and oppterm youll find this occasionally its the most maddening thing you ever had anything to do with because itll do nothing but beef up the prehav scale and itlljust wont run and euuuuuuu what it is is the waterbuck has faced the tiger until you have waterbuck you see that is thoroughly striped and has long paws and swims and youd say what is this and hed say well it is im waterbuck all right thats fine but what do you look like you know and hed say well i have theseim waterbuck i have these long stripes i roar uhand so forth in other words everything is totally collapsed into it and he would as easily call it tiger only its the same thing its waterbuck tiger and if youif he said he was in tiger valence well he was in tiger valence and goes gazoouh and hes in ahes swimming sort of tiger and he has smooth soft furonly its hair he has hoofs all his tigers have hoofs in other words its combination valencewaterbuck tiger and itactually he has lived along some goals problem mass package on and on and on and on until finally he has hit this as valence he has become this valence in life he is police officer with all the characteristics of criminal you see he is politicianhe is politicianan american politician with all the characteristics of russian dont you see you get the idea or he is criminal with all the characteristics of police officer or russian with all the characteristics of this is special kind of valence see it is one being it is not two beings but it has the characteristics of both sides and it wont run wont run i insist on this see this is the thing this is thing and youll hit that occasionally and the pc will sell this to youwill sell this to you with all of the salesmanship of dale carnegie hell give you the whole thing hell try to fiddle the can and everything else because this is the thing hell tell you this is the oh man ohohohoooah it isnt that every one he tries to sell you is combination valence but the combination valence is almost always sold hell sell it to the auditor you know well thats it i know what that is yeah ooooooh yes terrific game going on here yeah ohoh big big game ohoh yes yes we gotta run that thing the auditor ran it the prehav scale would beef up and the pc would fall in pieces and fall on his head see its late valence on any cycle usually there is combination valence toward the end of any long cycle in other words period of 60 thousand 600 thousand years and so forth of one game going on and on and onone game the spaceship officer and the spaceship crewman lets call that just one gamethe spaceship officer spaceship crewman and he will finallyyou will finally get spaceship crewman who acts like spaceship officer who is spaceship officer because hes member of the crew in other words you get your current breed of officer as it exists more or less in the armies today you see theyre not really officers theyre not really enlisted men theyre nice to all the enlisted men you see and all the enlisted men are nice and then they all do you know its all kind of messed up its very interesting state now thatsthats combination valence and cycles finish in these combination valencesquite ordinarily the guy goes on playing the game of the criminal the police official the waterbuck the tigerstandard games this is very very standard game type of thing and he finally winds up with the guy in cid the cid man who was just arrested the other day for burglarizing warehouse see hes combination valence you know hes both at the same time simultaneously in one body in lifetime quite amazing now individuals living as they come down the track live certain amount of free track and those are usually fairly happy lives when you run into engrams on those they will run them quite willingly but whats the difference not going to make any difference because actually its one engram out of god knows how many and it doesnt amount to much dont mistake it though you can change case all over the place by running one of these whole track valences you know you can practically have him growing fleas everything is wonderful and so on they say thats the exact somatics and so on you can make change in the individual in the same number of hours of 3d criss cross you would make ten times the amount of change see so dont say that yourunning engrams is good that is not true but youre running engrams off of free track and the trouble with the bloke that is going to be the long persistent trouble is this valence and theres free track in the valence to run any engram out of all right now lets go little bit further how did these valences get there why did they get there and why does goals problem mass hang up as mass now you already have an adequate answer when i say the motivators were to extrovertintrovert somebody and the overts were to introvert somebody and so on youre naturally going to get ball of introversion naturally but what makes it so persistent its because this ball which is valence in its lifetime had hates it had things it didnt like and things it had overts on so we have this fellow and hes lived this lifetime and he is this whole lifetime the temple priest thats fine the temple priest and hes gone along hes done all rightsacrificial altars have all been well bloodied and hes done everyall the nowimsupposed tos of priestcollected all the loot lied to the peasantry invented gods that everybody would be terrified of hes done all the proper things that hes now supposed to as priest hes been very successful priest lifetime after lifetime after lifetime after lifetime after lifetime after lifetime you see but somehow or another down along the line he just didnt like these temple virgins he just didnt like these temple virgins he never could quite see temple virgin actually he had few overts on them and this sort of pyramided up into more overts its not actually an overtmotivator situation fellow accidentally gets an overt on something one day he was raising one of the burning pots up before the brass god you see and one of the vestal virgins was helping him and he slipped because he was terrified of spiders or something you see he slipped and he spilled the whole ruddy lot on top of her and that burned her up to cinder well having done this overt you see he now will do overts see he tries to prevent himself from doing this so every time he gets around to burning incense pot if theres vestal virgin anywhere in the temple anyplace he of course is very careful not to let the incense pot go toward her and it takes only relatively short space of time like lifetime two or three lifetimes till just the thought of the incense pot and the vestal virgin hes hhrumhrumhrumhes holding the incense potand by the reverse flow which he is setting up he gets to point where he sees the vestal virgin he knows what hes supposed to do hes supposed to take out the incense pot and dump it on her you see this is how you handle that situation its easier to do thatto keep on restraining yourself from doing that you see and the fellow who every time he has an accident says well it oughtit had better be good accident we had better make it good accident you see hes just tired of restraining himself from having accidents so now thatthe mere thought that hes going to have an accident hes going to have good accident this is the laws of flows at work so inadvertently at first and then later on more purposefully and then more and more purposefully and more and more and more purposefully he just gets more and more and more overts on vestal virgins and temple virgins he just gets more and more overts on them you see and finally he gets up to point where hes in terrific games condition with them theyre on that side of the temple and hes on this side of the temple if he is priest in temple he knows that theres one thing that he has to be very careful about because the whole cult is liable to be overthrown by those vestal virgins he knows what theyre up to theyre plotting to dump burning incense pots on his head now of course in view of the fact that all during this period of time the vestal virgins have been accumulatingthe whole line has been accumulating overts on priests we eventually get the two sides of the temple which is the priest and the virgin and so forth and we get this awrrrr and it goes wraaaw and wow so he accumulates enough overts on one and he cant stay out of them thats advisedly stated he kicks off as priest one day the mob as usual overflowing of the dikes of the temple has eaten them up and he takes off and he goes up and he sits on cloud 19 for little while and then he knows exactly what he should do he goes right back down and picks up girl and becomes vestal virgin see now youve got real interesting game going up to this time every time one of these lifetimes as priest balled up it would find itself opposed to only thought of the existence of temple virgin and its only opposed internally into pictures he has of temple virgins but now were really going to fix him up were really going to fix this one up now he picks up this girl he knows exactly what hes supposed to do he goes downas soon as she is of any age whatsoever he wont let his parents rest you see until she is enrolled in the temple and he goes up through the lines and is very carefully virginal and goes carrying right straight on through and oddly enough has slight feeling that this virgin should be kept away from priests he just has this idea as virgin theres just something tells himyou call it intuition if you likebut that he had better not go very close to any priests so by the fact of disassociation from the priest and by the fact of communication with the priest he of course is getting himself into beautiful condition of just going into long series of overts against priests so now as temple virginas temple virgin every time the cups for the libation are served why she now goes down the line you see and somehow or another every time she comes to priestnot anot one of the local citizenry or somethingevery time she comes to priest shes liable to tripthe wine you see is liable to be dripping slightlytherell be something bit wrongand occasionally spill whole tray you see in their direction and well give her another lifetime or two running along this particular line and she doesnt just drop wine cups you see she carefully puts the hemlock into one or two at the proper occasions all for the good of the temple you understand this is well understood everybody realizes this that its nothing personal about this its justits better to get rid of the priests and everythingll be fine see so we get up to the hemlock stage and then we get up to the cutthroat stage and then go back down into the hemlock stage and then somehow or another in all temple revolts claim the citizenry was the one who murdered the chief priest and its always of course somebody else who did itand carefully puts the bloody dagger in her shirtwaist afterwards you see and says bunch of peasants came up and stabbed him to death as he knelt at the altar yes my lord that is the way it happened you see you got big withholds building up on this particular line and enough of these and all of sudden you have round ball called vestal virgin now this can drift around loose because internally its only opposed to priests and it can drift around loose on the track but kind of floating in present time and then having lived number of lives in this particular line and gotten this all balled up because its high games condition takes off one fine day after the peasantry has burned down the templewhich is the usual indoor sport of the peasantry after being oppressed and taxed for long enoughtakes off picks up boy and comes back and joins as priest now hes priest all right now lets accumulate some more overts against vestal virgins you see oh my god the first time he shoves dirk into vestal virgin all of sudden its so funny but its all thosekind of waagh thud youve got the ball in the bank which was the vestal virgin and the ball in the bank which is already the priest went together scrooo splat and there they arealmost inseparable now he can go on and live lifetimes of priest he can go on and live lifetimes of vestal virgin he eventually will come up to combination lifetime he will come up to life of an effeminate priest who has interesting habits and thats the dying line thats the combination valence he has arrived at there and eventually its just too painful to be any of these things and he wont want anything much to do with them and hell drift off but hes carrying all of that with him its all part of his baggage he doesnt want anything to do with this baggage and he doesnt quite figure out how he got this baggage but there it is now by the time hes gone through this whole cycle of the priest the temple virgin the combination valence and so forth this whole thing balls up into mass of some kind or another its composed individually of lot of individuals now if hesif hes got all thispriests and vestal virgins and the combination valenceall bunched together youd think he wouldnt have anything more to do with this you see now thats it thats finished action well he goes along for little while and he lives lot of free track he gets out hesactually gets job as water boy or something like that to camel train goes travelling around the countrysidehe gets lot of free track nothing ever happens to that free track it just stays free it gets kind of looped up and squeezed in on other things but one day hes got body as merchant and there he is as merchant and he is busy selling aladdins lamps cheap cutrate price straight from syria and somebody drifts by in canopied sedan chair and says deliver it at the temple he doesnt see anything wrong with this so he picks up the lamp and he takes it down and delivers it to the temple and as he goes out why one of the vestal virgins chucks him under the chin and he goes back and sits down its been bad day its really been bad day now he goes on as merchant gyps everybody introverts them keeps them from doing business eventually becomes the militarya military governor who is bound and determined that nobody shall ever do any business graduates up into standard incometax racket like theyve got going in some countries nowi wont mention the name ofwhere they take all and give back nothing and thishe goes on this whole line it hasnt anything to do with anything like temples or anything like that but its brandnew game you see its the merchant prince versus the tax collector versus the governor versus the army versus the government the merchant prince versus the government so hes merchant prince and hes the government and hes the government and hes the merchant prince and hes military governor and hes the collector of taxes and hes prince of merchants and he is merchant and he sells things and then hes an industrialist and then he manufactures armor and so forth for the government and weve gotten to our combination valence stage on this series of packages see he is an industrialist who manufactures only for the government has only one customer the government and of course thats combination valence ordinarily when that gets down to total thing yougenerally the political form the country has is fascism thats thegenerally the end product of fascismall production is for the government and usually by force of arms to keep the rest of the population enslaved interesting economics but regardless of that its some kind of game of this character and its run on of course as merchant he has formed these masses of course as military governor hes formed these masses and of course by the overts one another youve got whole new package here see youve got this whole new package so you had the temple priest you see and the vestal virgin and all of that game and that became package and then you had lot of free track and then youve got this other thing and they have gradually grouped together as package you see these things plotted out against time very nicely until they grouped and of course they grouped with the ne plus ultra combination valence sort of thing combination valence just groups everything anyhow you see the effeminate priest he cant do anything that doesnt restimulate being vestal virgin and he cant do anything without restimulating priest so he cant do anything without pulling his bank together its impossible so youve got this goals problem mass now that is goals problem mass you see yourthe problem that vestal virgin would have with the priest and the priest would have with the vestal virgin and all that sort of thing thats goals problem mass all by itself and up here weve got the merchant prince and the provost marshal and all that and thats goals problem mass all by itself and then one day after thathe cant sell things anymorewhat he does these days is hes night watchman in rice paddy and hes sitting there nightwatching like mad and he notices theres fire going on over in the edge of the woods someplace and he decides to go over and investigate it and he finds that somebody has set up brass idol and they are all going oowah and wumm wumm and theyre all calling out to woowoo and so he says hey what you doing there thats enough they all come over and he has to knock one of them colder than ice and he gets in trouble with the local authorities and all that sort of thing and the goals problem mass of the merchant and the military governor and the goals problem mass of the temple come together and they make one awful big mash of bthaaa see well free track sort of sits out here someplace and these two things come together and become undifferentiated from any time in them now youre really getting the mass what do you think happens after thetan has had ten thousand such games ten thousand such games on the track you see each one of these games is one whole goals problem mass see theyve got terminals theyve got oppterms theyve got everything all mixed up and of course as these things associate you see he had two association points that could have brought it together once he did visit temple as merchant but that was enough to start and then he actually knocked somebody out who was practicing rites in wood you see while operating as guard umm and that really keys him in he by the way got malaria after that and got very sick and they eventually buried him in the rice paddy thinking he was possessed of demonsand he was too so these masses just keep adding together and adding together and adding together and sometimes theyre not totally added together at the moment the auditor enters into one the auditor says to the fellow soand so and soandso and all of sudden the fellow says you know that has some vague connectiona merchant prince and temple and theres something between mer oh theres something between merchant clank and two pieces of goals problem masstwo goals problem masses go together with splash and the pc will say this has rarely happened see in other words the auditing furnished the keyin see dont let that worry you because its inevitable the thing was about to key in anyhow if it was that close see now you both key it in and separate it out again he never would have had chance of separating it out again you see so dont let that worry you because you all of sudden have these masses suddenly colliding with masses while youre auditing somebody you can sometimes group this lifetime youre going along pocketa pocketapocketapocketa auditing and you all of sudden hit whale of grouper in this lifetimeoverts and motivators and that sort of thing and this lifetime goes clank and it becomes balledup mass its nothing to worry about it would have gone in another year or two anyhow you can separate it out and so on now the odd part of it is you can take this lifetime apart if you can find the exact prior confusion to the exact moment of group and you better learn how to do that because you can always take goals problem mass and put it back into longitudinal track you can take one of these valences and stretch it right out along the track again by picking upif you wanted to audit just that valence lets take him aslets take him as ali the errand boy of baghdad and weve got valence there thats ali the errand boy of baghdad and we managed to have gotten this thing straightened out and separate weve peeled it off you see and weve got it separate and itll stay separate if you can imagine such thing it wont but lets say we could get it to stay separate we could then audit it this way we could say what is the principal problem that ali the errand boy of baghdad had and he gives it to us and we said well when did that happen and so on and we run it down and whats the prior confusion to that and what were you withholding at that time and so on and well get ali the errand boy of baghdad straightened out so that itll beitll be section of free track we could do that we dont have to do that but you could get all of these valences straightened out again and you could straighten them out along the track or you could group them up in ball you could do almost anything you want to with them with auditing theyre fairly easy to handle the best wayto do something with them of course is to differentiate them one from another both by finding them naming them getting them inspected very closely by the pc and blowing them off nulling them and winding up with those that wont budge and those that wont budge of course wont budge because they are impacted on others that are too heavily charged you just bleed charge bleed charge bleed charge now these things are dependent on one another for their own charge and the thing wouldnt hang together asnow you notice you didnt get ballup happening until the fellow had an overt on the oppterm and then you get enough overt on the oppterm you get ballup see the priest didnt get the track collapsing on himif you wanted to call it that he didnt get the track collapsing until he actually had run up an awful lot of overts on vestal virgins now that priest thing could collapse all by itself because he had overts inside it on vestal virgins without any valence of the vestal virgin being around see but frankly that will unwind very easily theres not very much to it so he had some overts against some vestal virgins thats about all it amounts to it takes the mechanics of problem to keep this thing in suspension and keep these things from straightening out now if youve got valence versus valence b you have the terminal and oppterm of 3d packagea versus b and let us suppose that both and b are heavy inflows youve got valence versus valence which is flowing away from valence while the two things are held closely together you create vacuum and you have brought later valences up into the vacuum between these two valences youve got inflowor outflow valences actually create the same thing two outflow valences flowing against each other will tend to create the vacuum at the backs of the valencestwo vacuums created so you get the thing held together really by the mechanics of opposition these things have to be in pretty close balance to hang there at all otherwise theyd asis it takes lot of doing to get one of these things persisting i mean its very delicately the way they hang together its something now once youve got these things shredded on the charge blown and the fellow has looked at them and hes discarded them and he winds up with what it was and you find some more of them and blow that and you straighten them up another step couldtwo more steps could be done with this stuffis when youre doing line let us say in the goals problem mass you could take every zig and find out what problem it had with every zag in other words you could take the zig and the zig in it is temple priest and the zag is vestal virgin and you could ask the individual now what problem would vestal virgin have with temple priest and what problem would temple priest have with vestal virgin and just state the problem the individual will usually state it that fast but you could do little assessment on that point and tend to blow these things even further than they have blown just method of differentiation this would be and then you could sayyour next one isthat happens on that opposition line is for some peculiar reason an idol maker and youve got well what problem would vestal virgin have with an idol maker now you see the vestal virgin alwaysalready had set of problems with the priest now the vestal virgin can also have set of problems with the next zig which is the idol maker see so you could then get all the problems of the zags with the zigs see consecutive you got the problems of the zigs with the zags and now you can get the problems of the zags with the zigs and you keep writing down problem and the fellow looks at these things and its like running problems on somebody only hell keep recognizing that hes had these problems and so on this thing blows blows blows blows further apart well every time you enter this thing at all you improve the persons ability to confront it and his ability to confront it as long as hes permitted to confront it it takes good auditing bad auditing inhibits his confronting of it poor auditing rough auditing keeps him from confronting it and its trying to keep him from confronting it and the two complement each other and he really gets upset but itlets say its good auditing and hes going along fine as it would be if any of you did it or id knock your blocks off thethe point were making here is that the individual is continuously confronting the phenomena of the goals problem mass you see hes continuously confronting it one after the other and what these things are and hes handling these things by the bushelbasket load and hes getting somatics here and getting somatics there and its kicking his brains in on this side and its going on and on and he gets accustomed to this sort of thing he gets used to it thats all hes blowing them hes separating them differentiating them hes seeing what they are and they frankly have less and less effect on him now all the way up the track he has only been the effect of those things he himself has been the effect of those things but now they are being the effect of him and just by reversing this cycle and doing other action but just reversing this cycle youd stretch out the whole goals problem mass and you stretch it out back down the track and your eventual product of this particularly if you added dating as step which i havent taken up with you and which i sometimes shudder at having to teach you because ive had loses on it before but if you were to date the thing and if you were to get long roller tape of some kind or another that was about four five six inches wide andso that you could put sections you know like motionpicture film on spool and you just kept writing down where these things were and you dated these things you dated these valences where they were found and so on and you got them all neatly in place on this long endless belt of tape thatnot endless belt of tapethe tape was so fixed that you could cut it out with pair of scissors and you could take another sectionbecause it looked like you had everything consecutive but all of sudden million years opens up in here that you never suspected before so you cut the tape and take some scotch tape and put another tape in the middle see you add section of tape you see because this thing will keep going that way it will keep spreading out naturally as you get more and more track dont you see eventually youd have time track of the fellow and you wouldnt do it on aon simple paper graph youd have to have an endlessbelt proposition because i think the paper required to do this sort of thing would be something like about hundred feet long i think about hundred feet of paper at wild guess just to give you some idea of the magnitude of it you see by cutting and patchingand you write up the track that youve got this whole thing he was this and then in so many years he was that and he was that and he was that and he was something or other and you put that now you find out horribly enough that this belongs in the middle of the templeandvestalvirgin game it was an excursion on the templeand vestalvirgin game you had to cut the templeandvestalvirgin game plot in half and stickyplaster the thing to the both ends and now youve got that smoothed out dont you see and you could keep on drawing time track on the individual like this as an exercise which would again just increase his ability to roll on the thing now at the same time if every time you made one of these plots you had him tell you the principal problems that were faced between these terminals and oppterms you see and the oppterms and the terminals and you had towrote the problems down on this line youd eventually have long run of problems problems problems of various kinds youd be running problems on him at the same time what would you wind up with well youd wind up with whole track well now when would these things start to unball well youll eventually find early on the track the mechanisms which made them ball up in the first place and the individual actually straightens out his postulates on this subject and you would only find his postulates by doing this and he straightens out his postulates on this subject and all of sudden all of them just go brumpbrumpbrump stretch out stretch out stretch out stretch out theyre eventually all lying out like tape measures not lying out like balls of mud now he could run on the time track and he could go the whole length and breadth of the time track he could think of anything he has ever done and remember it now the reason he cant remember it of course is too much of his existence is in areas and in valences at which he must not think if he thinks at them he goes stupid because they can think and he cant think so therefore he cannot remember his past his past is totally occluded as far as hes concerned because of theretotal areas of thinkingness do you see how that would be now thats about the only way you would ever recover persons memory on the whole track and thats about what whole track is all about and dont blame if after youve got this universe straightened out you havent straightened out the home universe yet thats your worry were talking about the whole track we normally refer to this universes track because earlier track is not in agreement with one person and another person beyond the fact that they usually agree that there was home universe and that they were building their own universe and other things were happening which were quite desirable and then those dirty dogs came with all the black muck and spread it all over everything and we stuck and thats why were in this universe see at first in discussing things with them you cannot find the identity of the dirty dogs with the black muck i have discussed this with several pcs and they keep insisting on using the they they is the most prevalent pronoun with regard to this so we havent found the fellows who did this and got this universe started and this time track going on total agreement we havent found them yet were still looking were still looking to find the people who got this universe started that way and trapped everybody in it we know it wasnt you but on the other hand you mightyou might have met one of them at one time or another and you might have some responsibility for turning him against beings or something you might have had some minor overt that took them you see and made them antisocial so that they would do this or on the other hand on the other hand on the other hand thinking it over carefully you might have been there and watched themnot intending to do it of course and not having anything to do with it but you know like people watch construction on the streetyou might have been there watching them something and occasionally you might have offered them small pebblejust to be helpful you see thats just to be helpful but responsibility of yours or on the other hand on the other hand there is some possibilitythere is some possibility that you knew one of them rather well and agreed with what he was doing you see just because you knew him well and theres another possibility if we reach little bit further that you were one of the workmenof course being driven with whip of course but you were one of the workmen that was doing this and then theres another possibility if you look very carefully on the whole track you may very possibly find yourself standing there and the picture of whip just below the level of your eye and hand holding this whip and it might come through to you as sort of dim suspicion that if you had this kind of picture at that point of the track that it might be you who was making them build universe and who trapped everybody you see thatd be pretty hard to face so im not asking you to look at that now but i am asking you to look back at that period when you might have been standing there caught total victim at the beginning of track anyway there is thetheres the whole track and the way it rolls that it exists that it is there as plot that youre still mocking it up and so forth is quite remarkable that this universe exists at all is quite remarkable and i ami congratulate you you did pretty persistent job on it okay do you see what youre handling when you handle the goals problem mass audience yes every one of the main valences has hundreds of subordinate valences and you can pull those off and theyre what you get on list theyre the things that dont hold on list theyre little incipient warts on the mainon main mass and then you know at first why you justthe pc cant tell the difference between them at variousas you go on running the pc can all of sudden even when he lists recognize what the mass is and the identity of the mass even before you null it or differentiate it he knows what it is and then that goes from there to knowing little bit more about the whole track and knowing little bit more about the game and then knowing more and more about life and knowing more and more and more and knowing more and then finally knowing all about it thats the other end that comes out there are many assistive things that an auditor could do many of these things probably wont have to be done because remember that youre auditing pc toward rather steep increase of ability and recognition thats the goals problem mass as it relates to the whole track you might find the information usefulif of course you ever find anybody with whole track if somebody comes around you know and tells you that past lives dont exist or you have reality on past lives ill give you one little tip in taking this sort of thing apart people cant think of past lives when theyre stuck in one life but they normally quite normally have had the subject of past lives itself invalidated heavily in this lifetime and if you pull that apart as invalidation and get all the ramifications with relationship to that why generally it will all straighten out this is too new subject for anybody to have too much antipathy against after all it hasnt been around since egypt and in those days if you said there was such thing as past life why you were liable to have had it because it went quite the reverse i remember vividlyone of the mechanisms and overts and uses of past lives in egypt was that the king could come back and claim his possessions and i thought that was an awfully handy mechanism did very well for number of years went many lifetimes before anybody got wise to this thing and thought well weve got better idea better idea and that is if we claim that everybody when he dies is dead dead dead then we never have to give him back any of his possessions and that settles that and the idea of one lifetime stems purely and entirely and completely out of ideas of property and that is all so you see why the popularity of it i imagine the prudential life insurance people and the bureau of statistics and the record of wills and the recorder of wills and testaments and so on would be amongst the first people to shoot you down on sight if you went around saying people have lived before and you are only living again because of course they have very vested interest in it but so does everybody have vested interest in there only being one life unfortunately unless we admit the evidence before us that thereone has lived more than one life we dont clear anybody or make him any better the only reason were interested in the subject particularly is because unless you pay attention to one lifetime as fallacy and audit past lives and whole track and so forth you make gains and were interested in gains were interested in understanding of the subject and interested in wins so therefore we have to admit something that seems much closer to the truth okay thank you very much
