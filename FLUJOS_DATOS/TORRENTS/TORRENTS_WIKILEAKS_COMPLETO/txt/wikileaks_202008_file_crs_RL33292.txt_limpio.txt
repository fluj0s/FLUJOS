the creation of global partnership which would include full civil nuclear cooperation between the united states and india this is at odds with nearly three decades of us nonproliferation policy and practice president bush promised india he would persuade congress to amend the pertinent laws to approve the agreement as well as persuade us allies to create an exception to multilateral nuclear suppliers group nsg guidelines for india india committed to among other things separating its civilian nuclear facilities from its military nuclear facilities declaring civilian facilities to the international atomic energy agency iaea and placing them under iaea safeguards and signing an additional protocol see crs report rl33016 us nuclear cooperation with india issues for congress by sharon squassoni for further details on the agreement the separation plan announced by prime minister singh and president bush on march 2 2006 and further elaborated on may 11 2006 would place 8 power reactors under inspection bringing the total up to 14 out of possible 22 under inspection several fuel fabrication and spent fuel storage facilities were declared as well as 3 heavy water plants that were described as safeguardsirrelevant the plan excludes from international inspection 8 indigenous power reactors enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing facilities except as currently safeguarded military production reactors and other military nuclear plants and 3 heavy water plants administration officials have defended the separation plan as credible and defensible because it covers more than just token number of indian facilities provides for safeguards in perpetuity and includes upstream and downstream facilities us officials acknowledge the importance of credible separation plan to ensuring that the united states complies with its article i obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt to not in any way assist nuclear weapons program in nonnuclear weapon state for almost 30 years the us legal standard has been that only nuclear safeguards on all nuclear activities in state provides adequate assurances the administration is apparently asking congress to back lower level of assurance by proposing that the separation plan take the place of comprehensive safeguards congress is likely to consider this issue as well as others when the administration eventually submits its cooperation agreement with india for approval by both chambers pl 109401 signed on december 18 2006 provides waivers for nuclear cooperation agreement with india from relevant atomic energy act provisions and requires detailed information on the separation plan and resultant safeguards this report which will be updated as necessary provides background on indias nuclear fuel cycle

partnership which would include full civil nuclear cooperation between the united states and india this is at odds with nearly three decades of us nonproliferation policy and practice president bush committed to persuading congress to amend the pertinent laws to approve the agreement as well as persuading us allies to create an exception to multilateral nuclear suppliers group nsg guidelines for india to allow for nuclear cooperation india committed to separating its civilian from its military nuclear facilities declaring civilian facilities to the international atomic energy agency iaea and placing them under iaea safeguards and signing an additional protocol which provides enhanced access and information for iaea inspectors1 the united states is obligated under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt to ensure that any cooperation it provides to nonnuclear weapon state does not contribute to that states capability to produce nuclear weapons in 1978 congress passed the nuclear nonproliferation act which strengthened the restrictions on us nuclear cooperation to include comprehensive fullscope safeguards on all nuclear material in nonnuclear weapon states specifically to help ensure that peaceful cooperation would not be diverted to weapons purposes the 1978 act followed indias 1974 peaceful nuclear explosion which demonstrated to most observers that nuclear technology originally transferred for peaceful purposes could be misused that test also provided the impetus for creating the nuclear suppliers group nsg2 in 1992 the nsg adopted the fullscope safeguards condition for nuclear exports and the 1995 npt extension conference and the 2000 npt review conference both endorsed the nsgs new requirement india shares unique status with pakistan and israel as facto nuclear weapon states outside the npt that have been treated politically for nonproliferation purposes as nonnuclear weapon states3 the three states do not have comprehensive nuclear safeguards instead they have safeguards agreements that cover only 1 for an overview of usindia relations see crs report rl33529 indiaus relations 2 the nuclear suppliers group seeks to stem proliferation of nuclear weapons through coordinating nuclear exports and nuclearrelated exports see httpwwwnsgonlineorg 3 the npt defines nuclear weapon states as those that have tested nuclear explosive devices before january 1 1967 this includes the united states united kingdom france china and russia crs2 specified facilities and materials4 presently very few of indias nuclear facilities are subject to international inspections the bush administration made credible and defensible from nonproliferation standpoint separation plan prerequisite for asking congress to create an exception to current law for nuclear cooperation with india pl 109401 the law that provides the executive branch with authority to waive restrictions under the atomic energy act with respect to india requires the president to determine that the following actions had occurred india has provided the united states and the iaea with credible plan to separate civil and military facilities materials and programs and has filed declaration regarding its civil facilities with the iaea india and the iaea have concluded all legal steps required prior to signature by the parties of an agreement requiring the application of safeguards in perpetuity in accordance with iaea standards principles and practices including iaea board of governors document gov1621 1973 to indias civil nuclear facilities materials and programs as declared in the plan including materials used in or produced through the use of indias civil nuclear facilities india and the iaea are making substantial progress toward concluding an additional protocol consistent with iaea principles practices and policies that would apply to indias civil nuclear program india is working actively with the united states for the early conclusion of multilateral treaty on the cessation of the production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons india is working with and supporting us and international efforts to prevent the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technology to any state that does not already possess fullscale functioning enrichment or reprocessing plants india is taking the necessary steps to secure nuclear and other sensitive materials and technology through the application of comprehensive export control legislation and regulations and through harmonization and adherence to missile technology control regime mtcr and nuclear suppliers group nsg guidelines and the nsg has decided by consensus to permit supply to india of nuclear items covered by the guidelines of the nsg indian and us officials engaged for several months in discussions on identification of civilian facilities us officials encouraged india to make 4 these are infcirc66type agreements they can cover nuclear material or facilities supplied under project agreements produced in safeguarded facilities or unilaterally submitted to safeguards by state see crs report rl33016 us nuclear cooperation with india issues for congress by sharon squassoni for more detail crs3 comprehensive declaration of its civilian infrastructure5 in various written and oral statements to congress state department officials seem to suggest that more facilities under safeguards would be better than fewer but critics on both the us and indian sides have suggested that some facilities would be more important to include or exclude for example the cirus reactor reportedly the source of plutonium for the 1974 nuclear test despite indias pledge to use it only for peaceful purposes is important to some critics to declare as civilian and place under safeguards because of its controversial past to us officials facilities associated with the fast breeder reactor program which could produce plutonium for weapons in the future reportedly would be key to get under safeguards particularly if the united states wants to cooperate with india in the global nuclear energy partnership program6 to indian officials however the fast breeder reactor program is key to the future of indias threestage nuclear fuel cycle and must be kept out of safeguards for maximum flexibility and energy independence7 several nonproliferation critics of the potential agreement have suggested that matter how many facilities india places under safeguards the opening of the international uranium market forbidden to india since 1992 by the nsg in effect frees up indias domestic uranium for its nuclear weapons program and therefore would assist the indian nuclear weapons program8 consequently only indias halt in the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons would ensure that us assistance does not aid indias nuclear programs9 indian officials note that the peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement is not about limiting their strategic program just about expanding their peaceful nuclear program some critics have suggested various options for placing specific facilities under safeguards to diminish the potential surplus

before the hirc oct 26 2005 hearing crs4 one observer robert einhorn has suggested that in the absence of fissile material production halt safeguards on indian facilities serve primarily symbolic role in demonstrating indias commitment to nonproliferation11 nonetheless the safeguards approach according to administration officials is key to assuring that the united states complies with article i of the npt that us cooperation does not in any way assist nuclear weapons program in nonnuclear weapon state us officials have stated that voluntary safeguards arrangement like those of the other five nuclear weapon states would not meet our npt article i obligations in their view india must accept some kind of safeguards arrangement that allow safeguards to endure in perpetuity indian officials on the other hand suggested that having the same responsibilities and practices as other advanced nuclear states translates into voluntary safeguards arrangement12 this report provides background on indias nuclear fuel cycle discussion of various issues involved in separating civilian and military nuclear facilities and potential concerns for congress as it considers whether the united states has adequate assurances that its nuclear cooperation does not assist encourage or induce indias nuclear weapons development production or proliferation background indias nuclear program from its inception in 1948 has been described as inherently dualpurpose13 with the establishment of its atomic energy commission in 1948 india pursued both civilian and military applications of nuclear energy the first indigenous research reactor apsara was developed in the 1950s canada provided early assistance under the colombo plan as did the united states under the atoms for peace program humiliating defeat in border war with china in 1962 followed by chinas first nuclear test in 1964 intensified indias drive for nuclear weapons india turned to the cirus canadaindia reactor united states reactor as the source for plutonium for its 1974 peaceful nuclear explosive test foreign assistance dwindled after the 1974 test but canada had already transferred the blueprints for heavy water reactors under an agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation as result india developed fairly independent nuclear infrastructure that supported both civilian and military purposes for example plutonium separated in indias reprocessing plants has been used both for weapons and to make mixed oxide fuel plutonium mixed with uranium for nuclear power plants 11 statement of robert j einhorn before the hirc oct 26 2005 hearing 12 from the july 18 2005 joint statement india would reciprocally agree that it would be ready to assume the same responsibilities and practices and acquire the same benefits and advantages as other leading countries with advanced nuclear technology such as the united states the indian prime ministers office issued background paper on the agreement in july 2005 that said iaea safeguards shall apply to facilities to be designated by india voluntarilyin this respect there will be discrimination between india and other nuclear weapon states see httppmindianicinpressrelhtm 13 see perkovich george indias nuclear bomb the impact on global proliferation university of california press ca 1999 for an excellent history of the indian nuclear program crs5 indias nuclear fuel cycle development has been driven by an acknowledged lack of uranium reserves in indias view energy independence could not be derived from domestic uranium reserves estimated at 08 of world reserves or 50 60000 tons but could be from production of plutonium recycling of spent fuel and utilization of thorium estimated at 32 of world reserves14 as result india planned 40 years ago to develop threestage fuel cycle to reduce its reliance on uranium and use thorium the first stage would rely on natural uraniumfueled reactors to make plutonium the second stage would use that plutonium in fast reactors blanketed with thorium to produce u233 and more plutonium and the third stage would use u233 fuel and thorium fuel in fast reactors blanketed with thorium to produce more u233 for use for future fuel india has not advanced beyond the first stage of the fuel cycle aside from running fast breeder test reactor 40 mwth fast breeder test reactor or fbtr based on french design and small research reactor that uses u233 fuel kamini the chairman of the atomic energy commission dr anil kakodkar asserted in speech in march 2005 that indigenous uranium resources would support 10 gwe of nuclear installed capacity but that breeder reactors using plutonium bred from indigenous uranium could support 500 gwe of power generation15 the current energy plan is to have 12 gwe installed capacity by 2015 and 20 gwe by 2020 reportedly the increase to 20 gwe would be achieved through mix of pressurized heavy water reactors phwrs light water reactors and fast breeder reactors including construction of 5 fast breeder reactors of 500 mwe each and the import of 8 light water reactors of 1000 mwe each16 indias indigenous pressurized heavy water reactors fueled with natural uranium are planned to provide just half of that 20 gwe capacity ie 10 gwe but some observers have suggested that indigenous supplies of uranium may not support that many reactors and that indias uranium crisis is already acute17 for example indias jaduguda uranium mill produces just 220 tons of yellowcake year whereas the 13 operating naturaluranium fueled reactors require 300 tons per year and consequently have reduced their operating capacity from 90 in 20022003 to 81 in 20032004 and 76 in 2004200518 14 see httpwwwnpcilnicinnupower_vol11_13chidambaramhtm 15 gigawatt is one billion watts of energy megawatt is one million

nuclear industry not included are indias heavy water plants and associated research facilities apart from two lightwater reactors fueled with lowenriched uranium from foreign suppliers at tarapur and two under construction by russia vvers at kudankulam indias power reactors rely on natural uranium in reactors that are cooled and moderated by heavy water known as pressurized heavy water reactors or alternatively as candu type21 canada built the first two candutype reactors at rajasthan and india built the remaining eleven most of these produce about 220 mwe whereas the new russian reactors at

research and production of radioisotopes and training cirus and dhruva are located at the bhabha atomic research center barc in trombay while kamini is located at kalpakkam the cirus reactor has been the subject of controversy between the united states and india for much of its life the united states supplied heavy water which was not subject to safeguards agreement under 1956 contract in which india pledged to use the material for peaceful purposes only yet this reactor reportedly produced the plutonium used in indias 1974 peaceful nuclear explosion many nonproliferation experts maintain that india violated its 1956 contract with canada as well as its contract with the united states most recently according to answers to questions for the record submitted by the senate foreign relations committee on november 2 2005 the state department notes that at the time the debate on whether india had violated the contract was inconclusive owing to the uncertainty as to whether ussupplied heavy water contributed to the production of the plutonium used for the 1974 device and the lack of mutual understanding of scope of the 1956 contract language on peaceful purposes several nonproliferation experts have criticized the administration for not taking this opportunity to resolve this 30yearold controversy23 the canadian 22 the fast breeder test reactor although it could technically be considered research reactor is discussed below in the breeder reactor section 23 an aide memoire presented to the indian atomic energy commission on november 16 1970 sought to clarify the us view on peaceful uses the document declassified in 1980 points out that the us contract stipulated that the heavy water was to be used only in india in connection with research into and use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and that the united states would not consider the use of plutonium produced in cirus for peaceful nuclear explosives intended for any purpose to be research into and use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes additionally the document stated that the use for the development of peaceful nuclear explosive devices of plutonium produced therefrom would continued

8000 mwe additionally by 201526 to total of 20gwe by 202027 however indias indigenous pressurized heavy water reactors will likely account for less than half of the total increase breeder reactors the breeder reactor program is integral to the second stage of indias threestage nuclear development plan breeder reactors have the potential to make more fissile material than they burn up hence the term

laser enrichment facility at the center for advanced technology in indore for research spent fuel reprocessing plutonium in india is produced for both civilian and military needs the trombay plutonium plant separates plutonium primarily for weapons purposes whereas plutonium separation for civilian uses is performed at the power reactor fuel reprocessing plant prefre at tarapur and at kalpakkam reprocessing plant karp the fast reactor fuel reprocessing plant and the lead minicell facility both at kalpakkam also perform plutonium separation heavy water production india has six heavy water production plants in operation all of which were developed indigenously such plants are not required to be safeguarded under comprehensive safeguards agreements because they do not contain source or special nuclear material but would be required to be reported under an additional protocol it remains to be seen whether india would report any of these 26 briefing by dr frederick mackie lawrence livermore national laboratory dec 14 2006 27 ts subramanian uranium crisis frontline vol 22 issue 27 dec 31 2005jan 13 2006 crs13 under an additional protocol or perhaps just portion of those that are not required for the military production of plutonium the extent to which india requires more unsafeguarded plutonium for weapons or as fuel for unsafeguarded breeder reactors would determine how many heavy water plants would remain unreported uranium recovery and conversion india has three uranium mines two coppermine tailing extraction units one mill many uranium conversion facilities and three fuel fabrication plants under comprehensive safeguards agreement the starting point of safeguards is when any nuclear material of composition and purity suitable for fuel fabrication or for being isotopically enriched leaves the plant or the process stage in which it has been produced28 in other words the material would be inspected at the end of the uranium conversion process and at the start of the fuel fabrication process under an additional protocol state is required to report on all nuclear fuel cycle activities including uranium ore mining milling and conversion it is not clear how or if india will declare some or all of those front end fuel cycle activities factors influencing the separation plan us guidelines credible defensible and transparent on november 2 2005 under secretary of state joseph told members of the senate foreign relations committee that indias separation of facilities must be credible transparent meaningful and defensible from nonproliferation standpoint further under secretary joseph told members that separation plan and resultant safeguards must contribute to us nonproliferation goals but did not elaborate which particular goals those might be he noted that the more civil facilities india places under safeguards the more confident the united states can be that any cooperative arrangements will not further indias military purposes specifically under secretary joseph said that safeguards would have to be applied in perpetuity and that voluntary safeguards arrangements would not be defensible from nonproliferation standpoint the administration also asserted that the safeguards must effectively cover indias civil nuclear fuel cycle and provide strong assurances to supplier states and the iaea that material and technology provided or created through civil cooperation will not be diverted to the military sphere29 one interpretation of those phrases suggests that credible plan would 1 be perceived to strengthen the nonproliferation regime 2 be complete and defensible declaration of its civil nuclear facilities and programs and 3 mitigate perceptions of nuclear weapons status for india30 such plan would be guided by the assumption that power reactors regardless of their potential to produce plutonium for 28 see infcirc153 at httpwwwiaeaorgpublicationsdocumentsinfcircsothers inf153shtml 29 responses by the state department to questions for the record submitted by senator richard lugar november 2 2005 30 dr frederick mackie lawrence livermore national laboratory briefing december 14 2005 crs14 weapons have civilian use and should be declared as civilian and safeguarded as well as their associated fuel fabrication and reprocessing and spent fuel storage facilities indias breeder reactors would be safeguarded in this approach because the test reactor has been connected to the electricity grid since 1997 and the prototype fast breeder reactor will have rating of 500 mwe and thus is meant to be connected to the electrical grid as source of energy31 since other advanced nuclear states with fast breeder reactors have placed them under safeguards japan and france placing indian breeder reactors under safeguards would mitigate perceptions of double standard for india given their ability to produce weaponsgrade plutonium fast breeder reactors have been proliferation concern for many years moreover safeguarding breeder reactors would limit the amount of weaponsusable plutonium worldwide that is not safeguarded which is clearly an objective of us nonproliferation policy indian guidelines credible and defensible from different view it can be argued that india also approached creating separation plan that is credible and defensible from its perspective although india had hoped for safeguards arrangement like those of the nuclear weapon states where facilities can be put on and taken off safeguards list at will the united states has said that such voluntary safeguards arrangement would not be acceptable therefore in this scheme placing facility on the civilian list would eliminate it from any potential use for the weapons program while indian officials have said that the july 18th agreement is not about their weapons program their decisions about the separation plan were fundamentally guided by their future needs in the weapons program prime minister singh told the indian parliament on february 26 2006 that in deciding on the scope of the separation plan india took into account its current and future strategic needs and programme after careful deliberation of all relevant factors consistent with our nuclear doctrinewhich envisions credible minimum nuclear deterrent to inflict unacceptable damage on an adversary indulging in nuclear firststrike32 from this perspective key factor for india is whether there is enough fissile material to meet the requirements of its minimal credible deterrent if not india must consider whether to hedge its future requirements by keeping some existing facilities out of safeguards so that they can produce plutonium or highly enriched uranium for weapons in the future or to build new production facilities in the future the july 18 agreement does not restrict india from doing so at least until fissile 31 see g balachandran on separation list january 2006 and sb bhoje and s govindarajan the

production cutoff treaty is in force but there are obvious costs to such an approach some indian observers argued to keep handful 12 or preferably 24 indigenous pressurized heavy water reactors phwrs out of safeguards for future fissile material production for weapons33 others argued that phased approach for placing phwrs under safeguards would be sufficient to give india time to determine if it could meet its minimal credible deterrent34 in controversial interview aec chairman anil kakodkar suggested that some of the phwrs could not be under safeguards because the breeder program which he recommended not come under safeguards would require unsafeguarded plutonium for fuel35 other commentators in india took different perspective on this point in december 13 2005 discussion at the india international center former defense research and development organization drdo scientist and institute of defense studies and analysis idsa director k santhanam suggested that india could continue to

subrahmanyam suggested that given indias uranium ore crunch and the need to build up our minimum credible nuclear deterrent arsenal as fast as possible it is to indias advantage to categorize as many power reactors as possible as civilian ones to be refuelled by imported uranium and conserve our native uranium fuel for weapongrade plutonium production36 indias need to exclude its breeder reactor program from safeguards appears to be based several factors chairman of the atomic energy commission aec dr kakodkar argued that the breeder program could not be put on the civilian list from the point of maintaining longterm energy security and for maintaining the minimum credible deterrent37 indias prime minister manmohan singh told the indian parliament on february 26 2006 that we will ensure that impediments are put in the way of our research and development activities we have made it clear that we cannot accept safeguards on our indigenous fast breeder programme our scientists are

safeguards only those facilities that have foreign component eg fuel or technology aec chairman kakodkar noted in august 2005 that anything coming fromexternal cooperationwill be put under facilitiesspecific safeguards and that research and development will be put under safeguards including the prototype fast breeder reactor and facilities at the indira gandhi centre for atomic research igcar39 another consideration influencing indian views are the potential financial and economic costs of separation in some cases facilities serve both civilian and military purposes gopalakrishnan former chairman of the atomic energy regulatory board suggested that certain critical plants at the nuclear fuels complex at hyderabad were not duplicated and should be kept out of safeguards until they could be replicated40 finally assumptions about indias prestige and independence may also have played role some indian officials have rejected the notion of placing any research and development facilities under safeguards because they equate such safeguards with attempts to constrain indias independence aec chairman kakodkar told the indian express in february 2006 that there is more

indian express february 8 2006 crs17 must be acceptable to parliament and public opinion42 regarding the application of safeguards india identified its overarching criterion as whether subjecting facility to iaea safeguards would impact adversely on indias national security moreover facilities were excluded from the civilian list if they were located in larger hub of strategic significance eg barc even if they were not normally engaged in activities of strategic significance43 this last criterion appears to suggest that the plan did not really seek to separate facilities the key elements

upstream facilities as well as dates they would be submitted to safeguards crs18 programme is at the rd stage and its technology will take time to mature and reach an advanced stage of development as for future reactors the document stated that india has decided to place under safeguards all future civilian thermal power reactors and civilian breeder reactors and the government of india retains the sole right to determine such reactors as civilian45 in response to question about whether it was possible for there to be noncivilian breeder reactors that india would build in the future under secretary of state nicholas burns stated that india could build reactors that would service their nuclear weapons industrybut the great majority of the growth we think will come on the civilian side46 as for research reactors cirus would be shut down in 2010 and not subjected to safeguards the fuel core of the apsara reactor would be taken out of barc and made available to be safeguarded some facilities in the nuclear fuel complex would be specified as civilian in 2008 and the tarapur and rajasthan spent fuel storage pools would be made available for safeguards tarapur 12 and rajasthan 12 reactors themselves are already safeguarded in addition india would declare 3 heavy water plants thal tuticorin and hazira as civilian but these would not be subject to safeguards 9 research facilities would be declared as civilian also but these would be considered safeguardsirrelevant indias enrichment facility would not be covered and indias offering up the tarapur power reactor fuel reprocessing plant prefre for campaign mode safeguards after 2010 is continuation of its current policy the dhruva research reactor is excluded under secretary of state burns stated that india would enter into permanent safeguard arrangements with the international atomic energy agency however the indian statement that an indianspecific safeguards agreement would guard against withdrawal of safeguarded nuclear material from civilian use at any time as well as providing for corrective measures that india may take to ensure uninterrupted operation of its civilian nuclear reactors in the event of disruption of foreign fuel suppliesraises questions about exactly what kind of safeguards arrangement is envisioned burns noted that the arrangement achieved degree of transparency and oversight and impact on the indian nuclear program that was not possible for three decades47 figure 2 shows rough depiction of how the final separation applies to indias civilian and military nuclear facilities 45 ibid 46 ibid 47 ibid crs19 figure 2 indias separation plan nuclear fuels complex sources dr frederick mackie lawrence livermore national laboratory and the congressional research service crs20 assessing the separation plan congressional views on the separation plan particularly whether it is credible and defensible from nonproliferation standpoint may have an impact on congresss consideration of the overall peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement quantity vs quality under secretary of state nicholas burns told reporters on march 2 2006 that its not perfect deal in the sense that we havent captured 100 percent of indias nuclear program thats because india is nuclear weapons power and india will preserve part of its nuclear industry to service its nuclear weapons program48 although few observers would have expected to get 100 of indias nuclear program under safeguards one question that arises is whether the 65 mark meets the administrations own standard that the safeguards must effectively cover indias civil nuclear fuel cycle49 the administration has defended the separation plan most recently as credible and defensible in this way for the separation plan to be credible and defensible from nonproliferation standpoint it had to capture more than just token number of indian nuclear facilities which it did by encompassing nearly twothirds of indias current and planned thermal power reactors as well as all future civil thermal and breeder reactors importantly for the safeguards to be meaningful india had to commit to apply iaea safeguards in perpetuity it did so once reactor is under iaea safeguards those safeguards will remain there permanently and on an unconditional basis further in our view the plan also needed to include upstream and downstream facilities associated with the safeguarded reactors to provide true separation of civil and military programs50 it should be noted that although declaring 65 of indias reactors as civilian will result in placing almost twothirds of the current reactors under safeguards power reactors constitute just one part of the nuclear fuel cycle reprocessing capabilities are key to indias threestage nuclear fuel cycle development plan and the separation plan provides nothing beyond the intermittent safeguards applied at the power reactor fuel reprocessing plant prefre already some observers could argue that strictly quantitative approach does not address the question of whether the plan is defensible from nonproliferation standpoint here too the kinds of facilities included could be key for example in terms of preventing terrorist access to fissile material safeguarding facilities like 48 white house office of the press secretary press briefing by under secretary of state for political affairs

april 5 2006 crs21 reprocessing and enrichment plants and breeder reactors would provide greater nonproliferation benefit because the materials produced by these plants are few steps closer to potential use in bomb in addition safeguards on enrichment reprocessing plants and breeder reactors would support the 2002 us national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction in which the united states pledged to continue to discourage the worldwide accumulation of separated plutonium and to minimize the use of highlyenriched uranium51 breeder reactors as noted earlier breeder reactors which are key to indias intended second stage of fuel cycle development have been generally regarded as proliferation concern because of their production of weaponsgrade plutonium52 india plans to build at least five commercialscale breeder reactors and would have the option of dedicating any one or more of those to its military program public statements by indian officials suggest that they have considered the breeder reactors usefulness in producing plutonium for the strategic arsenal and some domestic critics have suggested that india should clarify the purpose of the breeder program once and for all key obstacle may be the amount of unsafeguarded plutonium available as initial fuel raising the question of how future civilian breeder reactors would be fueled would plutonium from the 10 additional reactors india will be placing under safeguards be used to fuel the reactors or would india purchase safeguarded plutonium from other states if the latter case would this conflict with the administrations policy of discouraging the worldwide accumulation of separated plutonium other facilities prime minister singh told the indian parliament on february 26 that we will offer to place under safeguards only those facilities that can be identified as civilian without damaging our deterrence potential or restricting our rd effort53 although cirus dhruva the fast breeder test reactor and the planned advanced heavy water reactor have been described by indian facilities as being research facilities they are not included the 9 research facilities that will be declared as civilian are considered safeguardsirrelevant probably because they will have little if any nuclear material in them to be safeguarded the absence of research facilities could call into question how far indias separation plan has ventured into the mainstream of nonproliferation iaea safeguards for nonnuclear weapon states include all facilities where nuclear material 51 national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction december 2002 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200212wmdstrategypdf 52 for many years the united states discouraged plutonium reprocessing and did not engage in reprocessing in the us civil nuclear fuel cycle however with the announcement of the global energy nuclear partnership gnep the bush administration is seeking to develop recycling method socalled proliferationresistant that would not result in the separation of plutonium it is unclear how long it would take for advanced recycling technologies to become commercially available regardless it is unlikely that india could participate in the gnep program without commitment to place its breeder reactors under safeguards see httpwwwgnepenergygovgnepproliferationresistantrecyclinghtml 53 indian pm addresses parliament on nuclear pact with us bbc monitoring south asia february 27 2006 crs22 is present including research and development facilities the case of precedents in other nuclear weapon states is not applicable since the iaea tends not to inspect very many of the sites or facilities on the voluntary safeguards eligible lists likewise the absence of reprocessing and enrichment facilities on the separation plan also could be interpreted by some as falling short of the objective of bringing india into the mainstream of nonproliferation in particular the bush administration has identified enrichment and reprocessing technologies as sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel cycle that should be limited and has proposed specific arrangements for assured supplies of nuclear fuel that would obviate the need for states to conduct their own enrichment and reprocessing54 indias one operating facility at rattenhalli is reportedly used to enrich uranium for the prototype naval fuel reactor naval fuel occupies curious place in iaea safeguards fullscope safeguards agreements the kind that nonnuclear weapon states have include provision for the nonapplication of safeguards to nuclear material to be used in nonpeaceful activities and naval fuel would be one such nonpeaceful activity however nonnuclear weapon state has ever implemented this provision for the nonapplication of safeguards under paragraph 14 of the infcirc153 state is required to inform the iaea that the use of the nuclear material in nonproscribed military activity will not be in conflict with an undertaking the state may have given and in respect of which agency safeguards apply that the nuclear material will be used only in peaceful nuclear activity and that during the period of nonapplication of safeguards the nuclear material will not be used for the production of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices brazil has placed its enrichment facilities under safeguards despite having naval fuel program which also raises the question of how far indias separation plan conforms to the standards of the nonproliferation mainstream the five nuclear weapon states have not encountered this problem thus far since they have not placed any navalrelated facilities on their safeguardseligible lists it is not clear which precedent would be less desirable placing indias naval fuel facilities under safeguards and then going through steps for the nonapplication of safeguards or simply not safeguarding them at all on the grounds that they are of direct national security significance issues for congress us officials acknowledge the importance of credible indian separation plan for ensuring that the united states complies with its article i obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt to not in any way assist nuclear weapons program in nonnuclear weapon state for almost thirty years the us legal standard has been that only nuclear safeguards on all nuclear activities in state 54 white house fact sheet strengthening international efforts against wmd proliferation february 11 2004 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovnews releases200402200402115html crs23 provides adequate assurances the administration has sought and congress has provided backing for lower level of assurance by proposing that the separation plan take the place of comprehensive safeguards from broad perspective congress may consider whether opening up international cooperation to india after all these years has net positive effect on indias nuclear weapons program under secretary of state nicholas burns told reporters on march 2 2006 that the agreement will not have an impact on indias strategic program55 however some observers believe that unless india stops production of fissile material for weapons purposes nuclear safeguards will do little to ensure that assistance is not diverted from narrower perspective the text of peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement is necessary for congress to assess whether or not the united states can comply with its npt obligations not to assist indias nuclear weapons program pl 109401 which gives the president authority to waive certain requirements of the atomic energy act still requires the administration to send congress not only the text of peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement but also nuclear proliferation assessment statement npas which must address the extent to which us treaty commitments are met under pl 109401 the following sections require reports to congress related to the separation plan under the submission to congress provision of section 104 section 104 c 2 the administration will be required to provide summary of
