6210c30 shspec204 prehav scales and lists lrh comments on z unit progress see hcopl 8dec62 training saint hill special briefing course summary of subjects by units the shsbc at that time had new streamlined form consisting of v w x and z units with z being the most advanced unit the material of the z unit consisted of additional clearing data the form of the course and scientology plans auditing requirements were goal found on self and goal found on pc this would give class iv certificate if all check sheets complete class iii cert if unit complete and above auditing requirement completed class ii cert if unit auditing requirements met r212 see page 339 below cchs assists and prepchecking and only x unit checksheets complete also some general comments on rigorous training see also hcob 13oct62 processes any former data on the subject of assessing scales was prior to the experience of nulling goals we have learned that items can disappear from list without being out or appear on list without being in all nulling of lists is therefore to be done as follows we have scale or list from some source and we have lot of words verbs terminals or whatever old style assessment by elimination is superseded by new style that is much faster then tiger drilling the items it is done by reading each item in turn the ones that produce disturbance of the needle not necessarily an instant read at this point are in the time to judge whether it is proper read is when it is still in at the end keep the questionable ones in until you have eliminated most having assessed each line mark the ones that read matter how they read in this means that they disturbed the needle when the pc is in rock slam area the pc is all over the place the read can be early late etc for instance read could appear latent because the rising portion of rock slam could obscure the first part of the read if the pc is out of session you may get prior reads but goals almost always instant read in assessing scale the time to get picky about reads is when you have an item still in and it is one of the few remaining now you get nice about it rocket reads are consistent rook slams are not the item with the slam has far more authority than the auditor the to may sit there cogniting silently having forgotten the auditor altogether on dynamic assessment as you go down the list pay attention to the pcs somatics on the different levels you would be foolish to go headlong down the items list and pay attention to the somatics that the pc is getting you may find the pcs valence at one of these levels he is likely to hit an item which is where he has been for millenia and if you dont watch what you are doing you will go on leaving him there standard assessment by elimination is not likely to work except with really good auditor who maintained real two way comm with the pc inval or eval out ruds etc items on the rock slam chain must be right therefore the procedure must be revised the revised version is easy to do especially if you can see the meter read it does require precise meter reading the pc must know what you are doing and what you are trying to find or the whole list can be protest be sure you can read the list before you try to assess it so that you can give the items right if the pc is rockslammer on scientology and you give an item wrong the item could rockslam at the very least it can make the pc protest wrong or irrelevant item on list read back to the pc is being asserted by the auditor and protested by the pc therefore it will read the pc may get caught up in an oppterm and may get protest reads from that another phenomenon is everything on the list reacing that is bypassing the item all the items can stop reading too either one of these two phenomena indicates that the midruds of the session not the list are out one item in every now and then is what looks right if the midruds are out the pc is handling the outrud on down the list and everything can read on that outrud when this happens the auditors voice reading anything creates greater effect on the pc and the item has greater effect on the meter the pc is vulnerable as in bridge because partial win becomes missed withhold so the auditors voice matter what he says will produce reaction the pc really has missed withhold whichever rud is out if this phenomenon is increased further nothing will read however if you put session midruds in too often the pc will be driven out of session by cleaning cleans if you assess for awhile without noticing that nothing was reading when you see the column of xs the next time through call these items again to be sure this system is to prevent reads from being wiped out by outmidruds and to let you select the right item by tiger drilling see p 295a for tiger drill procedure it is best to err on the side of having too many items left in to be tiger drilled you should leave say five items in midruds may not be out enough to screw up the session but they may be out enough to screw up particular item so the procedure is 1 assess by elimination to few between three and eight items keeping midruds in 2 start tiger drilling using sixbutton tiger drill unless the pc is protesty in which case you can make it seven by adding protest after tiger drilling you are looking for slam if an item stays in with mere dirty needle circle it but dont necessarily buy it buy the biggest read you should get bigger read on the right item and smaller read on the wrong item after tiger drilling you dont necessarily do this with big polish operation because you dont have the same need to be precise as with goal just tiger drill it enough to make sure this should not take more than three minutes dont pay any attention to pain and sensation while you are doing this just dust them off if you cant make up your mind tiger drill them harder
