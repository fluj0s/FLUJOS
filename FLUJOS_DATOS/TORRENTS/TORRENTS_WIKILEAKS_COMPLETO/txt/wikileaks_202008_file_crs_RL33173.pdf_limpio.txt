from their homes by hurricane katrina many of the displaced families lacked economic means before the storm others may have become disadvantaged because of the storm the role of the federal government in helping to meet both the short and longterm housing needs of displaced families remains under debate within the administration in congress and in the news media and questions persist regarding the appropriate role of the nations largest housing assistance program for the poorthe section 8 voucher programin the wake of the storm this report focuses on three questions what impact did the hurricane have on existing voucher holders to what degree did the program serve displaced families who had not previously received voucher and should the program play larger role in serving displaced families in the future the voucher program played minor role in serving the overall population of affected families the department of housing and urban development hud focused primarily on serving the estimated 44000 displaced families who had alre ady received hud assistan ce or were homeless before the storm initially public housing authorities phas in other parts of the country were encouraged to give these families priority fo r existing vouchers ter hud and the federal emergency management agency fema announced new katrina disaster housing assistance program kdhap under kdhap fema funded hud to provide vouchers to displaced hudassisted families most recently supplemental funding measure transferred funding for kdhap from fema to huds section 8 tenantbased rental assistance account hud renamed the program the disaster v oucher program dvp the majority of displaced families however did not receiv hud assistance before the storm to serve these families some phas allowed otherwiseeligible families displaced by the hurricane to jump to the top of local waiting lists other phas considered adopting such policy but decided that the need was too great in their own communities the demand for vouchers nationwide is greater than the supply thus few existing vouchers are available to new families advocates from across the political spectrum called for the creation of new vouchers for displaced families they claimed that vouchers are more costefficient provide more family choice and can avoid many of the problems associated with such policies as the temporary provision of trailers some members of congress introduced bills in the 109 th congress to authorize and fund new vouchers s 1637 s 1765 and s 1766 or to make changes to the current program hr 3894 but none were enacted in lieu of vouchers the administration chose to provide families with short term stays in motel rooms cash grants and trailers through fema this approach came under criticism and administration reviews postkatrina have recommended major changes to the way housing assistance is provided including transferring temporary housing re sponsibilities to hud in july 2007 hud and fema entered into an interagency agreement to transfer responsibility for ongoing housing assistance for katrina evacuees from fema to hud this report may be updated as necessary

devastation to the nations housing stock was unprecedented the 2005 hurricanes katrina rita and wilma and their related flooding were estimated to have damaged 12 million units of housing of those over 300000 were seriously damaged or destroyed1 the congressional research service crs estimated that 700000 people may have lived in the areas most adversely affected by hurricane katrina and were most likely to be displaced2 data provided to crs by fema in june 2006 showed that at peak approximately 125 million people were living outside their original zip code because of hurricanes katrina and rita3 these displaced families fell into range of categories some were homeowners whose property sustained only minor damage and who quickly secured loans to begin repair some were homeowners whose property sustained massive dama ge and who were left waiting even year later for information on their insurance settlements and options some were renters whose dwellings were quickly repaired while others were renters whose dwellings will never be rebuilt some were homeless before the stormabout thes people little is known even within these categories there is variation some of the families found permanent homes in new communities others stayed with friends and family temporarily but were able to make their way back and still others year after the storm are still displaced nd unsure whether they will ever return some of these families were economically stable had sizeable savings good insurance and were able to maintain their employment others were economically unstable before the disaster and lost what little they had many probably fell somewhere in between the full effect of hurricane katrina and the circumstances of the families affected may never be fully known however existing data provide some insights for example crs estimates that the poverty rate in the katrinadamaged areas was 21 in 2000well above the national poverty rate of 12and the rate of homeownership in katrinadamaged areas was 55 compared with 66 nationally in 2000 4 in light of the characteristics of the damaged communitiespoorer than average and more likely to rentit is not surprising that many questions arose about the role of the nations primary housing assistance program for the poor the section 8 housing choice v oucher program these questions generally fall into three categories first what was the effect of the hurricane on existing voucher holders in the damaged regions second to what extent is the program being used to serve displaced families regardless of whether they previously received vouchers or other hud assistance third to what extent if at all should the program be modified and expanded to serve additional displaced families this report also reviews the forms of assistance fema has provided to displaced families in lieu of section 8 vouchers 1 us department of housing and urban development office of policy development and research current

important first to understand what the section 8 voucher program is and how it works section 8 vouchers are rent subsidies that poor families can use to reduce their housing costs in the private market to an affordable level6 families with vouchers pay 30 of their incomes toward rent and the federal government pays the difference between the families contributions and the actual rent up to limit7 that limit is called the payment standard and its value ranges between 90 and 110 of the local fair market rent fmr8 very lowincome families are eligible for vouchers and extremely lowincome families are given priority for vouchers9 the subsidies are portable meaning that families can move anywhere in the country with their vouchers the demand for vouchers is greater than the supply in some communities waiting lists are many years long in others the waiting lists are closed the department of housing and urban devel opment hud oversees the section 8 voucher program at the federal level but the program is administered at the local level by quasi governmental public housing authorities phas more than 2000 phas participate in the program and each receives an allocation of the more than 2 million vouchers currently authorized and funded by congress phas run their programs on fixed budget determined by formula developed annually by congress10 they also receive administrative fees that in recent years have been based on what they received in the prior year

path of the storm temporarily ceased operations including the housing authority of new orleans hano and the housing authority of the city of slidell others took in displaced voucher holders most notably the housing authority of the city of houston an unknown number of families in the hurricanedamaged areas were receiving federal help with their housing costs either through section 8 housing voucher or by living in federally subsidized rental housing such as public housing before the storm hit while these families retain their assistance the process of using this assistance in other areas can be cumbersome hud developed several polic ies and procedures for stormaffected agencies and families to follow 11 5 for more information about the section 8 voucher program see crs report rl32284 an overview of the section 8 housing programs by maggie mccarty 6 housing is generally considered affordable if it costs more than 30 of familys income 7 the formula is more complicated than presented here for more information see crs report rl32284 an overview of the section 8 housing programs by maggie mccarty 8 the fmr is set annually by hud for every community in the nation it is calculated as the 40th percentile rent for twobedroom apartment and is adjusted for bedroom size it is meant to represent the cost of modestly priced housing the national average fmr for twobedroom apartment in 2005 was 786 per month although that average masks wide variation for list of national fmrs see httpwwwhuduserorgdatasetsfmrhtml 9 very low income is defined as income at or below 50 of area median

august 31 2005 hud posted on its website list of immediate and pending actions it would take in response to the hurricane immediate actions included the identification of vacant public housing units available for displaced families and the issuance of regulatory waivers12 longer term actions included the establishment of redevelopment corporation13 and proposed new residentialhomes tax credit for developers14 on september 3 2005 hud announced that it had established tollfree number for displaced public housing and voucher residents to call for assistance15 guidance issued that same day informed phas on how to serve displaced families under existing authority phas could use vacant public housing units for either displaced public housing residents or displaced voucher holders and they could provide available vouchers to displaced public housing residents however in order to prioritize displaced hud families for assistance phas must first amend their pha plans if preference for disasteraffected families is not already included 16 phas board must approve any changes and can determine whether they are significant enough to warrant public hearing the same guidance reminded phas that they must accept families with vouchers who wish to move or port17 into their jurisdiction the phas can then choose whether to take family into their own programs and fund the vouchers themselves process called absorbingor administer the voucher on behalf of the predisaster pha process called billing there are pros and cons to both options billing requires more complicated paperwork payments can be delayed and the receiving housing authority is entitled to only 80 of the originating phas administrative fees billing can also present problems for originating agencies when families move to more expensive areas since the phas are required to pay the increased subsidy absorbing is simpler administratively however it requires the receiving pha to allow porting families to jump ahead of other families on the waiting list for available vouchers huds september 3 2005 guidance encouraged phas to show utmost flexibility stating continued role of hud housing programs in response to hurricane katrina by maggie mccarty et 12 following any disaster hud has the authority to waive certa in statutory and regulatory requirements in the voucher program for phas in disaster areas as well as those serving families affected by the disaster phas must request waivers and not all program rules are eligible for waiver see federal register notice regulatory and administrative waivers granted for public and indian housing programs to assist with recovery nd relief in hurricane katrina disaster areas september 27 2005 httpwwwhudgo vofficespihpublicationskatrinapihadminwaivpdf 13 on november

gulf coast region were published in the federal register 14 legislation creating redevelopment tax credit has not been enacted as of this update 15 hud news release 05117 hud establishes tollfree number for section 8 voucher holders and public housing residents september 3 2005 16 phas must complete two plans fiveyear plan which each pha submits to hud once every fifth year and an annual plan which is submitted to hud every year these plans spell out the agencies policies programs operations and strategies for meeting local housing needs and goals for more information see 24 cfr 9033 et seq 17 vouchers are nationally portable meaning that they can be used anywhere in the country where voucher program is being administered when families move from the jurisdicti on of one pha to another the process is referred to as porting and vouchers that have moved from one jurisdiction to another are often referred to as portability vouchers the agency from which the family moves is typically referred to as the originating agency and the agency to which the family moves is typically referred to as the receiving agency

differs from kdhap in several ways first dvp is governed by section 8 rules unlike kdhap although the secretary is permitted to waive income and eligibility requirements the amount of subsidy provided is capped at level set by local phas for the voucher program called payment standard rather than the fair market rent as under kdhap security deposit and utility depo sit assistance which was guaranteed under kdhap is provided at the discretion of the pha under dvp initially not all families that were eligible for kdhap assistance were eligible for dvp assistance although congress later amended dvp to cover l kdhape ligible families 21 finally kdhap was limited to hurricane katrina evacuees whereas dvp is available to both hurricane katrina and rita evacuees

assistance22 dvp provides monthly rent subsidy equal to the lesser of the phas payment standard or the actual rent for the duration of the program23 families are not required to make minimum payment although 18 the agreement between fema and hud is called mission assignment mission assignme nts are contracts between fema and other federal agencies through which these agencies agree to provide some form of essential assistance and fema agrees to reimburse them for their costs the term is defined at 44 cfr 2062a18 19 katrina disaster housing assistance program interim operating requirements

for many families this will mean reduction in their housing costs since under most hud rental assistance programs families are required to contribute at least 30 of their incomes toward their housing costs families must pay the costs of utilities not included in the rent although phas can provide utility allowance to families like the section 8 voucher program dvp is administered by phas phas that choose to participate are paid flat fee of 1500 for each dvp family that they house up from 1000 under kdhap plus an ongoing admi nistrative fee equal to 10 of the voucher the dvp process differs for families depending on whether the family requested assistance after the dvp program was announced the family received kdhap assistance prior to the announcement of dvp or the family received assistance under normal portability procedures before either kdhap or dvp were announced new families enter the program after they apply to pha or call national tollfree intake number established by hud the pha or the intake worker at the call center first screens the family for eligibility by crossreferencing them with database of eligible families maintained by hud if the familys original projectbased assistance unit is available for occupancy the family is given the option to move back if the family chooses not to move back they are instead given dvp voucher although they forfeit their right to return to their original housing and will have to reapply for assistance at the end of their dvp eligibility if the familys original housing is not available then the family is given dvp voucher with the right to return to their original unit when it becomes available or at the end of their dvp eligibility additional families will be admitted to the program after september 1 2007 once family is awarded dvp voucher the family is either admitted by the pha or referred to participating pha in the area of the country where the family wishes to relocate phas heavily affected by the hurricanes can choose to serve their returning families under the dvp program rather than the regular voucher program and hud has encouraged them to do so noting that dvp is more flexible than the regular voucher program and that it permits phas to combine dvp funds with public housing funds families with k dhap vouchers were to be transitioned over to dvp by march 1 2006 the transition required phas to file lease addendums both with landlords and tenants since dvp uses pha payment standardswhich can be set between 90 and 110 of fair market rentto determine families subsidies rather than 100 of fmr used under kdhap some families may have to pay less in rent under dvp and some may have to pay more depending on whether their rent is higher or lower than the payment standard those families who evacuated and began receiving assistance under regular portability procedures prior to the announcement of kdhap could have chosen to transfer to kdhap or stay within the rules of the current voucher program regardless of the familys choice the receiving pha was required to bill kdhap for the cost of the assistance up to 100 of fmr rather than the originating pha if the family chose to stay in the regular voucher program and continued 18 months were up before that day they were to receive dvp assistance under regular voucher program rules until september 30 2007 that deadline has since been extended to june 30 2008 however huds waiver authority the ability to administer dvp differently from the voucher program will expire in december 2007 at that time phas will be required to certify tenants inco and calculate their rent using re gular voucher procedures see hud notice pih200717

then the receiving pha was to bill the originating pha for the difference in cost under dvp families can still choose between dvp and the regular voucher program rules however the pha bills hud for the entire cost of the voucher the 7600 voucher families in the dvp program will return to the regular voucher program on december 31 2007 for hudassisted families without section 8 vouchers for example families who had lived in public housing before the storm if their previous housing is not rebuilt then the family is to receive voucher if their previous housing is rebuilt but they want to continue to receive voucher assistance then they must apply for voucher in the community in which they want to live huds dvp guidance states that stormdamaged phas whose clients are being served under

additional guidance in december 1 2005 notice 24 and later made operating requirements available on its website25 homeless families then became eligible for dvp when the new program took effect on february 1 2006 homeless families are eligible for the dvp if they were living in presidentially declared disaster area in the week immediately prior to hurricane katrina or rita and either sleeping in place not meant for human habitation or residing in an emergency shelter transitional housing or housing provided through the supportive housing program shp shelter plus care sc program or hopwa program26 to receive dvp housing assistance homeless families must first verify their eligibility if families lived in shp sc or hopwa housing the housing provider must confirm their residency if families were living on the street or staying in emergency shelters homeless service provider must provide written records or statements to confirm that families were homeless in the weeks prior to hurricanes katrina and rita once families are found to be eligible for dvp they may attempt to find housing within the jurisdiction of any participating pha hud recommends that phas contract with local homeless service providers to assist families in finding nd maintaining housing in addition an initiative called katrina aid today made up of ten social service and voluntary organizations is to provide case management assistance to those displaced by hurricane katrina if katrina aid todays services are available where previously homeless families live hud requires that phas use their

some phas were reluctant to participate because they were required to shelter and transport families until they found housing and the phas argued that the costs to do so were higher than the fees they received lowincome housing advocates criticized the program because it did not include utility payments which can pose heavy cost burden on very poor families kdhap was also criticized as too complex while the benefit calculation was simpler than the calculation under the section 8 voucher program the interaction between the two forms of voucher was complicated many voiced concern about what will happen at the end of 18 months and how smoothly families will be able to transition out of dvp and into other assistance or out of assistance altogether the 390 million supplemental for dvpadministered by hud largely under existing rules helped address the concerns raised within kdhap about participation utility costs and interaction with regular vouchers however dvp does not address the issue of transition at the end of the program the hud assistant secretary for public and indian housing testified before the house financial services committee on december 14 2005 that as of that date 12500 households had been processed under kdhap although potentially 75000 evacuees were eligible he noted that it has been difficult to reach eligible families which is why such small percentage have actually been served 27 the presidents february supplemental request revised down the estimated number of dvp eligible families to 44000 one year after the storm hud reported that more than 27000 families have been assisted28 according to information provided to crs by hud as of august 31 2006 hud had obligated 110 million of the supplemental funding for dvp assistance and 97 million of that amount had been spent as of that same date the department had obligated 46 million for k dhap under its ssion assignment with fema and 44 million of that amount had been spent

kdhap and dvp congress did not fund and hud did not provide additional section 8 vouchers for families displaced by hurricane katrina displaced families could apply for existing hud assistance including section 8 vouchers if they were otherwise eligible however in most communities waiting lists for vouchers are very longin some cases up to 10 years in response to the disaster some phas chose to give waiting list preference to families displaced by hurricane katrina in order to offer such preference phas must generally modify their existing pha plan such changes require board approval and are generally subject to public scrutiny the decision to prioritize displaced families can be controversial given the limited supply of vouchers prioritizing evacuees from other communities requires preempting other poor families 27 congressional quarterly congressional transcripts congressional hearings house financial services subcommittee on housing and community

families may also have budget implications in recent years phas have received fixed budget based on their inflated costs in 2004 since costs are driven by the difference between the rent and income of the families served increases or decreases in either can change the cost in ways beyond what is captured in the aforementioned inflation factor given that many displaced families were very poor before the storm and many were at least temporarily unemployed after the storm they may have qualified for larger subsidies than phas typical caseload since phas budgets do not adapt to changes in their caseloads it may be more expensive to serve displaced families if phas budgets are squeezed they may either have to reduce the amount of assistance they are able to provide to families or reduce the total number of families served also because vouchers are portable displaced families may leave the jurisdiction of the pha that issued the voucher and move back to devastated areas after they are rebuilt if families leave with their vouchers unless the vouchers are absorbed in the new community they will effectively be lost to the communities that issued them database of pha preferences exists so the num ber of phas that changed their preferences to prioritize katrina evacuees is unknown since revisions to plans require public process search by crs of newspaper articles in early november found some reports of activity in local communities several phas chose to prioritize evacuees others considered making changes but ultimately decided not to and still others did not consider changes given the need in their own communities even if given top priority for existing vouchers some families displaced by hurricane katrina were ineligible to receive assistance because their incomes were too high recognizing this concern on september 26 2005 members of the louisiana house delegation introduced the hurricane katrina emergency housing act of 2005 hr 3894 the bill would have waived number of the rules in the section 8 voucher and projectbased programs including those regarding income eligibility and subsidy determ ination for families displaced by hurricane katrina the bill did not include additional appropriations for the section 8 program nor did it authorize any additional vouchers hr 3894 passed the full house on october 6 2005 but similar legislation was not introduced in the senate and it was not enacted before the close of the 109 th congress g5g155g142g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g16g142g160g561g24g152g158g140g145g142g155g156g561 after hurricane katrina

knowledgeable about local markets and can help families locate housing since vouchers utilize the existing housing stock they may cost less than trailers which often need basic infrastructure to be developed before they can be installed arguments against using vouchers include the complexity of the eligibility and benefit calculation although both can be modified by congress when authorizing and funding new vouchers also sufficient rental units may not exist in the areas where families wish to live and unlike trailers vouchers cannot expand the stock to address that problem finally once voucher is authorized it can be difficult to eliminate this was the case after the northridge earthquake many families with temporary vouchers were still using them when the assistance was set to expire and fearing the social and political implications of evicting families congress extended the assistance several times before it was eventually made permanent given recent concerns voiced by congress about the cost of the section 8 program and administration initiatives to replace it with new program there may be political reluctance to expand it g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 several pieces of legislation were introduced to create new temporary vouchers for families displaced by hurricane katrina although none was enacted before the close of the 109th congress on september 8 2005 senator reid introduced the katrina emergency relief act of 2005 s 1637 title iii of the bill includes the helping to house victims of hurricane katrina act of 2005 the bill would have provided 35 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations to hud to fund temporary vouche rs for families displaced by hurricane katrina the vouchers would be authorized for six months but would be extended for an additional six months unless the hud secretary determined that they were longer needed funding would also be available to provide related assistance to families such as security deposits and relocation assistance many of the rules regarding eligibility and tenant payments would be waived and the upper limit on the amount of available assistance would be raised from the current standard of 110 of the local fmr to 150 of the local fmr also on september 8 senator sarbanes offered the same helping to house victims of

senators from louisiana introduced identical bipartisan relief and recovery bills the hurricane katrina disaster relief and economic recovery act s 1765 and s 1766 called for new programs and additional funding in areas ranging from defense to energy to health care to the environment the housin g section would have provided 35 billion for emergency section 8 vouchers in much the same form

after the storm the president did not request section 8 vouchers for displaced families outside of the limited kdhapdvp assistance instead fema provided cash grants to families to use for housing costs referred to as transitional housing assistance these payments are governed by the individual and household assistance auth ority provided in the stafford act32 the first of these payments at the amount of 2358 was made in september 2005 the grant amount was meant to represent three months of housing costs and was calculated using the national average fair market rent for twobedroom apartment families who received the assistance were required to show receipts to prove that it was used for eligible housing expenses however those rules were loosened for the first grant because fema acknowledged that families were given payments without sufficient direction as to how it was to be used the grants count against femas 26200 limit on assistance provided to an individual household fema indicated that the housing assistance could be extended for up to 18 months and that future amounts might be adjusted to reflect regional rent variations families eligibility for this assistance was determined when they registered with fema and was based on the amount of damage to their homes as of august 14 2006 718976 applicants had received rental assistance and as of august 23 2006 632808 of those applicants at their last recertification were still eligible for ongoing rental assistance 33 in addition to transitional housing assistance payments fema can provide several other forms of housing assistance fema can provide trailer homes to families for up to 18 months after disaster as of august 29 2006 fema had provided more than 116000 trailers and mobile homes to hurricane victims of which more than 115000 were occupied34 fema can also pay the cost of hotel rooms for hurricane evacuees at its peak fema was paying for 85000 rooms35 for katrina and rita evacuees by the end of february 2006 the agency was making payments for 10000 rooms36 fema announced that hotel payments were only temporary solution and initially stated that it would cease such payments by december 1 2005

unprecedented housing disaster it affected the lives of hundreds of thousands of people many of them poor before the storm and many who may become poor because of the storm the nations largest housing program for the poor the section 8 voucher program played minor role in aiding displaced families despite calls for its use from across the political spectrum instead the administration s relied on fema emergency provisions and to limited degree the marshaling of existing hud resources in some parts of the country local housing authorities prioritized hurricane evacuees for the limited supply of available vouchers in september the kdhapdvp program was created to serve the relatively small number of hurricane evacuees who previously received hud assistance to rve other displaced families fema developed number of interim policies ranging from the provision of trailers to the awarding of cash grants some cities and states developed their own voucher programs with the expectation of fema reimbursement the administrations approach to housing families displaced by the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes has come under intense criticism generally the response was criticized as disorganized and inefficient the final report of congressional review of the governments response to the disaster failure of initiative found that the government plans for shelter were far from adequate 52 lowincome housing advocates voiced concerns that some families could not find ways to use their transitional housing funds both because rental markets have become very tight in the areas immediately surrounding the most h eavily damaged areas and because families were unfamiliar with the rental markets in the areas to which they had relocated advocates also contended that fema did not make it clear to families that the transitional housing payments were to be used only for housing stories surfaced of families who used the funds for purposes other than rent and are now facing eviction and possible sanctions from fema some argued that the mix of trailers cash payments and mission assignments is not cost effective when compared to vouchers 53 in light of these criticisms and others the administration undertook review of its katrina response the final report the federal response to hurricane katrina lessons learned 54 recommends that hud be designated as the lead federal agency for the provision of temporary housing in future disasters it noted that hud has extensive experience in providing housing resources for those in need and that it must use its extensive network of regional offices and state and local housing agencies to prepare for potential relocation emergencies it further notes that the provision of trailers should not be the default means of temporary housing offered to evacuees leaving shelters the congressional panels review in failure of initiative found that fema failed to take full advantage of huds expertise and perspective on largescale housing challenges such as the agencys experience with the voucher program nearly two years after the storm the administration decided to transfer administrative responsibility for ongoing housing assistance from fema to hud whether these findings and recommendations will mean that vouchers will play larger role in future disasters is yet to be determined 52 failure of initiative final report
