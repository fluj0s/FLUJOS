for fy2008 covering the remaining 11 regular appropriations acts as well as emergency funding for military operations in iraq and afghanistan congressional leaders also decided to avoid conference procedures that often are used to bring the house and senate into final agreement on measure instead congressional leaders decided to reach final agreement by means of an exchange of amendments between the two chambers on december 17 the house began final action on the measure by agreeing to two amendments to the senate amendment to the housepassed bill the senate concurred the next day december 18 in one house amendment providing omnibus appropriations for the 11 regular appropriations bills and amended the second house amendment with the mcconnell amendment adding iraq war funding

used by congress and the president to wrap up action on the regular appropriations acts in late 2007 at the end of the first session of the 110th congress this report provides brief overview of the measure including discussion of the context for legislative action the legislative history of the bill summary of its structure and content and information on the use of across theboard spending cuts to offset part of its cost the context for legislative action each year congress and the president enact discretionary spending in the form of regular appropriations acts as well as continuing and supplemental appropriations acts1 discretionary spending which accounts for more than onethird of total federal spending is spending that is under the control of the house and senate appropriations committees for the most part discretionary spending funds the routine operations of the federal government it is distinguished from direct spending which is controlled by the legislative committees in substantive law and funds such mandatory programs as social security and medicare discretionary spending and direct spending together make up total federal spending the number of regular appropriations acts had been fixed at 13 for several decades2 realignment of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees at the beginning of the 109th congress reduced the number of regular appropriations acts considered each year to 11 and further subcommittee realignment at the beginning of the 110th congress increased the number to 123 in the late 1970s and continuing into the 1980s continuing appropriations acts sometimes took the form of omnibus legislation often incorporating the full text of multiple regular appropriations acts for fullyear funding instead of providing short

budget act of 1974 as amended budget resolution policies are enforced by points of order that may be raised during house and senate consideration of spending revenue and debtlimit legislation6 on occasion budget policies may be modified by agreements reached between congressional leaders and the president such modifications may be accommodated during legislative action through the use of waivers of points of order emergency spending designations and other budgetary or procedural devices in his budget submission for fy2008 president george w bush requested total discretionary budget authority for the fiscal year of 9298 billion as well another 1452 billion in discretionary budget authority for emergency funding for the global war on terror7 the presidents request excluding emergency spending was reestimated by the congressional budget office at 9328 billion in budget authority8 conference report on the budget resolution for fy2008 sconres 21 was filed on may 16 2007 hrept 110153 the two chambers reached agreement on the budget resolution the next day by vote of 214209 in the house and 5240 in the senate under the plan congress proposed total discretionary budget

following the failure on november 15 to override the presidents veto of the laborhhseducation appropriations act for fy2008 democratic leaders in congress signaled their intent to consider an omnibus appropriations act in december that would split the difference with regard to 22 billion in additional spending to which president bush objected14 on december 8 office of management and budget director jim nussle issued statement indicating that the president would veto the omnibus appropriations act being developed in part because according to press reports it would include 18 billion in additional domestic and emergency spending above the presidents budget15 in response to the veto threat the democratic leaders abandoned their split the difference plan and developed an omnibus appropriations act that adhered to the presidents limit of 933 billion with limited additional emergency funding16 legislative history the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 hr 2764 originated
