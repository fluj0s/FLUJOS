nonsufficientfunds nsf fee as penalty the check would be returned unpaid to the merchant or other third party the customer could be charged another fee by that third party the management of financial institution does have the discretion to cover the overdraft not return the check and charge an overdraft fee consumers can often make an arrangement with their bank for an overdraft to be covered by funds held in another account the consumer holds with the institution for example savings account crs2 financial institutions have offered overdraft lines of credit for protection against account overdrafts customer must apply for this credit product and meet creditworthiness criteria set by the institution the lines of credit are subject to the disclosure requirements of the truth in lending act1 implemented by federal reserve regulation z lines of credit usually charge an annual interest rate generally around 18 to 20 and allow repayment as the customer chooses within the terms of their agreement with the institution more recent option for consumers is the bouncedcheck protection or courtesy overdraft protection service these services vary among institutions but most share basic terms and conditions participating institutions offer this type of overdraft protection as feature of their accounts and customers do not have to apply and qualify for the service an account normally qualifies if it has been open for specified period and if there are regular deposits to the account ceiling is set for overdraft coverage usually between 100 and 500 flat fee generally the banks standard nsf fee is charged each time an overdraft item is covered and daily fee may be charged for each day the account remains overdrawn the service may extend beyond check transactions to other transactions including withdrawals at automated teller machines atms online httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22874 banking and debit card point of sale transactions specified time period may be set for overdraft repayment some institutions offer closedend loans to customers who cannot meet the repayment deadline many programs are offered with the caveat that payment of an overdraft is discretionary on the part of the institution and therefore they may not pay all the overdrafts that customers incur some institutions employ automated systems to handle overdraft accommodations 2005 federal regulatory response guidance issued by federal regulators in february 2005 guidance was issued by federal regulators addressing the risks presented by bouncedcheck or courtesy overdraft protection services the guidance also incorporated best practices list to assist financial institutions in developing responsible disclosure and program administration policies the guidance was issued to assist depository institutions in the disclosure and administration of overdraft programs in general failure to comply with regulatory guidance may cause regulatory concern that financial institution is not adequately protecting itself against risk two guidance documents were issued the documents are similar but not identical on february 14 2005 the office of thrift institutions issued guidance separately2 on february 18 2005 joint guidance was issued by the office of the comptroller of the currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal deposit insurance

httpwwwfdicgovnewsnewspress2005fil1105html crs3 institutions should adopt written policies and procedures to address operational and other risks associated with overdraft programs the joint agency guidance included an overview of legal risks both guidance documents informed institutions purchasing automated bouncedcheck protection programs from thirdparty vendors that due diligence review should be conducted prior to entering into contract both documents stated that clear disclosures and explanations to consumers of the operation costs and limitations of an institutions overdraft program are essential the guidance highlighted examples of disclosure and marketing practices that raised concern for instance some institutions did not clearly illustrate all the types of transactions atm withdrawals debit card purchases telephone transfers besides checks that may be covered by overdraft protections some marketing practices appeared to encourage consumers to overdraw their accounts by using the service to meet shortterm credit needs some institutions did not clearly distinguish how the bouncedcheck or courtesy overdraft service differed from traditional line of credit other institutions included overdraft protection amounts in the sum they disclosed as the consumers account balance without clearly distinguishing the funds that are available for withdrawal without overdrawing the account httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22874 the guidance provided best practices list to be taken into consideration by institutions with or those establishing bouncedcheckoverdraft protection programs the list was divided into two categories 1 marketing and communications with consumers and 2 program features and operation included were clear disclosure of program fees and an optout feature the office of thrift supervision added best practice to not manipulate transaction clearing rules to inflate fees amendments to regulation dd the board of governors of the federal reserve system began to study bouncedcheck and courtesy overdraft services in 2002 to determine the need for regulatory guidance andor revisions to board regulations the board solicited public comment and information on the issues on may 19 2005 the federal reserve issued final rule amending its regulation dd to provide consumers with uniform and adequate disclosure information concerning bouncedcheck or courtesy overdraft protection services4 regulation dd implements the truth in savings act tisa5 which requires depository institutions to provide disclosures to enable consumers to make meaningful comparisons of deposit accounts regulation dd also contains rules for advertising deposit accounts the board stated that the revisions to regulation dd are consistent with the joint guidance issued previously by board and other regulators compliance with the amendments to regulation dd became mandatory on july 1 2006 compliance is enforced by the appropriate federal banking agency failure to comply can result in administrative sanctions the board chose to amend regulation dd because an overdraft service is provided as feature and term of deposit account and that the fees

the deposit account6 the board stated that the adoption of these amendments did not rule out possible future determination that regulation z truth in lending disclosures would be appropriate the amendments to regulation dd addressed accountopening disclosures periodic statement disclosures and advertising rules institutions must now include in the account opening disclosures required by the tisa the categories of transactions for which an overdraft fee may be imposed examples of categories include checks in person withdrawals and electronic withdrawals new periodic account statement disclosures are required for institutions that promote the payment of overdrafts in an advertisement the added information fields are the total amount of fees or charges imposed on the account for paying overdrafts and the total amount of fees charged for returning items unpaid the added disclosures must be provided for both the statement period and for the calendar year to date communications that are defined as advertisements as well as those that are excluded from the definition are described in detail the advertising requirement is also triggered if the periodic statement includes message stating the overdraft limit for an account or by disclosing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22874 an overdraft limit or including the amount of that limit in an account balance presented on an atm receipt an atm screen an institutions internet site or telephone response system the regulation dd revisions include changes to advertising rules bounced checkoverdraft protection advertisements must include the applicable fees or charges the categories of transactions covered the time period consumers have to repay or cover any overdraft and the circumstances under which the institution would not pay an overdraft specific situations where some or all of the added disclosures are not required are covered in addition advertisements that are misleading or that misrepresent the overdraft service are prohibited specific examples of what is prohibited are provided legislation and ongoing concerns bouncedcheckoverdraft protection legislation the consumer overdraft protection fair practices act hr 946 was introduced on february 8 2007 by representative carolyn b maloney and others and referred to the house committee on financial services the legislation would define overdrafts as short term extensions of credit extend the protections of the truth in lending act tila to bounced checkoverdraft protection programs and provide for other consumer protections on july 11 2007 hearings were held by the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer credit of the house committee on financial services7 the legislation would define overdraft protection programs or services as shortterm extensions of credit the legislation would amend tila implemented by federal reserve regulation z to extend 6 truth in savings final rule issued may 19 2005 p 8 available at httpwwwfederalreservegovboarddocspressbcreg200520050519defaulthtm 7 testimony presented at the hearings can be found on the committees website httpwwwhousegovappslisthearingfinancialsvcs_demhr0705072shtml crs5 its coverage to these programs fees associated with overdraft protection programs if imposed more than three times year would be considered finance charges and must be disclosed as both dollar amount and in terms of an annual percentage rate apr the legislation would provide for additional restrictions specific to overdraft protection programs and services before depository institution could initiate bounced checkoverdraft service an account holder would have to provide written consent to an agreement detailing the terms and conditions of the service an optin feature as opposed to an optout the legislation addresses restrictions on the advertising of overdraft programs the restrictions would include prohibition on advertisements that are misleading or that misrepresent the overdraft protections or services hr 946 would also require depository financial institutions to warn customers at electronic terminals that requested electronic fund transfer would trigger an overdraft protection fee and permit the customer to cancel the transaction additionally the bill would prohibit institutions from manipulating the process of posting checks and debits against an account to increase the account holders overdraft fees industry response to hr 946 at the hearings industry representatives httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22874 expressed general opposition to hr 946 it was stated that the recent actions taken by federal banking regulators concerning bounced checkoverdraft programs were providing consumers with adequate disclosure and protection it was argued that the additional tila disclosure requirements and program restrictions required by the legislation would impose considerable costs and would likely result in the discontinuance of this beneficial service for many consumers transmitting the notifications required by the legislation at electronic terminals would necessitate potentially prohibitive technical changes to the terminals and software financial institutions have worked to make it easier for consumer to check an account balance online or by telephone but providing real time account balance information presents difficult challenges industry representatives argue that the consumer is in the best position to know if authorized but possibly not yet processed cleared transactions would change the balance provided by the bank if an account holder carefully keeps track of all their transactions including checks debit card purchases and preauthorized automated payments they have the best information to avoid overdrafts consumer advocate response to hr 946 the hearings testimony from consumer advocates was supportive of hr 946 stating that the legislation would provide many of the protections they have sought the general belief is that financial institutions have transformed beneficial occasionally employed backup system for consumer checking accounts into an automated system that triggers high cost bank overdraft loans direct deposit electronic payments and advances in technology have made it more difficult for consumers to track their account balance to avoid overdrafts consumer advocates have urged the federal reserve to revise its regulation z which implements the truth in lending act to require institutions to treat courtesy overdrafts as loans the tila disclosures required by hr 946 would enable consumers to make more informed decisions and would require consumers to actively choose to participate in bounced checkoverdraft protection programs by signing up optingin warning notifications at electronic terminals would prevent unintentional overdrafts proposed enhanced protections on may 2 2008 the board of governors of the federal reserve system the national credit union administration and the office crs6 of thrift institutions working jointly proposed rules to address ongoing concerns with aspects of the marketing disclosure and implementation of overdraft services the banking regulators stated that concerns with overdraft services continue despite the issuance of the 2005 guidance and regulation dd amendments the banking regulators used their statutory authority to address unfair or deceptive practices provided by the federal trade commission act8 the federal reserve also proposed complementary additional amendments to regulation dd9 the enhanced protections include substantive optout notice requirement for bouncedcheckoverdraft services the proposal would require that consumers receive an optout notice before financial institution assesses any fees in connection with paying an overdraft the proposal sets forth content and timing requirements in addition consumers would be able to choose the option of partial optout for example by directing their institution to pay overdrafts resulting from checks but opting out of overdraft services for atm and debit card transactions the proposal would require all institutions to provide aggregate cost information for overdraft services on periodic statements to facilitate the consumers ability to make httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22874 informed judgements about using these services currently periodic account statement disclosures are required for institutions that promote the payment of overdrafts in an advertisement when account balance information is provided in response to consumer inquiry including those made at electronic terminals this proposal would prohibit financial institutions from including in the disclosed balance any additional amounts of funds that may be provided to cover an overdraft generally institutions would disclose only the amount of funds available for immediate use the institution would not be required to provide realtime balance disclosures finally financial institutions would be prohibited from charging an overdraft fee if the overdraft results solely from debit hold amount placed on an account which exceeds the actual cost of the purchase 8 15 usc 4158 9 detailed information on the statutory authority provided by the ftc act the proposed rules and
