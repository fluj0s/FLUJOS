issues summary according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 67 of the 246 million people in the united states who receive their water from public water system received fluoridated water in 2000 one of the cdcs national health goals is to increase the proportion of the us population served by community water systems with optimally fluoridated dri nking water to 75 by 2010 the decision to add fluoride to water supply is made by local or state governments the us public health service phs has recommended an optimal fluoridation level in the range of 07 to 12 milligrams per liter mgl for the prevention of tooth decay the fluoridation of drinking water of ten generates both strong support and opposition within communities this practi ce is controversial because fluoride has been found to have beneficial effects at w levels and is inten tionally added to many public water supplies however at higher concentrations it is known to have toxic effects the environmental protection agency epa regulates the amount of fluoride that may be present in public water supplies to protect against fluorides adverse health effects fluoridation oppone nts have expressed concern regarding potential adverse health eff ects of fluoride ingestion nd some view the practice as an undemocratic infringement on individual freedom the medical and public health communities generally have recommended water fluorida tion citing it as safe effective and equitable wa to provide dental health protection communitywide because the use of fluoridat ed dental products and th consumption of food and beverages made with fluoridated water have increased since the phs recommended optimal levels for fluoridati on many people now may be exposed to more fluoride than had been anticipated consequently questions have emerged as to whether current water fluoridation practices and levels offer the most appropriate ways to provide the expected beneficial effects of fluoride while avoiding adverse effects most commonly tooth mottling or pitting dental fluorosis that may result from ingestion of too much fluoride when t eeth are developing also scientific uncertainty regarding the health effects of exposure to higher levels of fluoride add controversy to decisions re garding water fluoridation although fluoride is added to water to strengthen teeth some communities must treat their water to remove excess amounts of fluoride that is present either naturally or from pollution in 1986 epa issued dr inking water regulation for fluoride that includes an enforceable standard maximum contaminant level mcl and an mcl goal mclg of 4 mgl to protect agains t adverse effects on bone structure epa acknowledged that the standard did not pr otect infants and young children against dental

necessary and offer the most appropriate way to provide the beneficial effects of fluoride while avoiding adverse effects such as tooth mottling or dental fluorosis that can result from exposure to too much fluoride moreover research gaps regarding the potential health effects of exposure to increased amounts of fluoride and among different age groups continue to add controversy to decisions regarding water fluoridation although many communities add fluoride to drinking water to strengthen teeth some communities must treat their wate r to remove excess amounts of fluoride which often is present naturally in water the environmental protection agency epa regulates the maximum amount of fluoride that may be present in public drinking water supplies to protect agai nst certain adverse

and is present in virtually all water usually at very low levels higher concentr ations of naturally occurring fluoride often are associated with well water where fluoride has dissolved from the rock formations into the groundwater1 community water fluoridati on began in 1945 after scientists discovered that higher natu ral levels of fluoride in community water supply were associated with fewer dental caries cavities among the residents2 in 2004 the surgeon genera l reported that more than 170 million 67 of the people in the united states who receive d their water from public water system received fluoridated water3 this represented 5 increase from 1992 when 62 of individuals served by public water syst ems were provided with fluoridated water4 many public health agencies and pr ofessional health organizations have advocated the addition of small amount of fluoride to drinking water to help strengthen teeth and prevent dental car ies although this practice has been controversial in various communities the cdc the american medical association the american dental asso ciation ada the american academy of pediatric dentistry and others have recommended fluoridation of public water supplies as an effective way to protect dental health this approach has been advocated for its ability to provide communitywide benefits particularly in poorer communities where children may be less likely to receive adequate dental care5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33280crs3 5 continued report vol 48 41 october 22 1999 pp 933940 available online at

in 2002 the cdc reported that during the second half of the 20th century major decline in the prevalence and severity of dental caries resulted from the identification of fluoride as an effective method of preventing caries fl uoridation of the public water supply is the most equitable costeffective and costsaving method of delivering fluoride to the community7 one of the cdcs national health goals for 2010 is to increase the proportion of the us population served by comm unity water systems with optimally fluoridated drinking water to 758 the optimal fluoridation level recommended by the us public health service for decay prevention is in the range of 07 to 12 milligrams per liter mgl the world health organization who has identified dental caries cavities as worldwide epidemic and recommends dding fluoride to drinking water where naturally occurring levels of fluoride are below optimal levels9 the who states that the goal of communitybased public health programs should be to implement the most appropriate means of maintaining c onstant low level of fluoride in as many mouths as possible10 according to the who water fluoridation in low fluoridecont aining water supplies helps to maintain optimal dental tissue development and ntal enamel resistance against caries attack during the entire life span peopl of all ages including the elderly benefit from community water fluoridation for example the prevalence of caries on root surfaces of teeth is inversely related to fluoride levels in the drinking water in other words within the nontoxic range for fluoride the higher the level of fluoride in water the lower the level of dental decay this finding is important because with increasing t ooth retention and an aging population

obtained from variety of sources other than water eg fluor ide toothpastes rinses and supplements however health officials historically have recommended fluor idation of community water supplies citing socio economic reasons that may vary among countries and communities the who explains this preference as follows the consensus among dental experts is that fluoridation is the single most important intervention to reduce dental caries not least because water is an essential part of the diet for everyone in the community regardless of their motivation to maintain oral hygiene or their willingness to attend or pay for dental treatment in some developed c ountries the health and economic benefits of fluoridation may be small but particul arly important in deprived areas where water fluoridation may be key factor in reducing inequalities in dental health12 despite such recommendations fluoridation remains far from universally practiced worldwide an estimated 350 million people receive ar tificially fluoridated water and another 50 million drink water that is naturally fluoridated at or near the optimal level13 overall some 40 countries pr actice water fluoridation and the

mgl and higher 18 ibidquestions about the safety and benefits of fluoridation water fluoridation has ge nerated less opposition in the united states than in europe however notwithstanding reco mmendations from many governmental and professional health organizati ons this practice continues to generate controversy in some us communities research gaps regarding the effects of longterm exposure to increased levels of fluoride fuel this debate and decades into this practice the safety and efficacy of water fluoridation continues to be stioned debated and studied dental fluorosis some oppose water fluoridati on because of concern that even recommended optimal levels of fluoridation may cause some dental fluorosis in children dental fluorosis is caused by excessive fluoride intake while teeth are developing and it is during th is period before teeth erupt that dental tissues are very sensitive to fluoride typically during childs first eight years16 mild dental fluorosis is characterized by opaque white or stained patches in the dental enamel more severe fluorosis is characterized by pitting of tooth enamel since the 1960s the us public health service has recommended an optimal fluoride concentration in water of 07 to 12 mgl this level was designed to maximize prevention of caries while limiting the preval ence of dental fluorosis to about 10 of the population virtually all of it mild to very mild17 because of the increased use of fluoridat ed dental products and the tendency for young children to swallow these products concern over dental fluorosis and other potential effects of fluoride ingestion has increased questions have arisen as to whether current fluoridation practices and vels offer the most appropriate ways to provide the expected beneficial effects of fluoride while avoiding adverse effects that can result from ingesting too much fluoride as noted by the national research council nrc of the national academy of sciences in 1997 in addition to fluoride in drinking water people also can ingest fluoride in toothpaste mouth rinse and dietary fluoride supplements or in beverages and foods prepared with fluoridated water as result many americans might ingest more incidental fluoride than was anticipated by the phs public health service and by epa in recommendi ng standards for drinking water18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33280crs6

effects of ingested fluoride 1993 pp 4748 23 in setting standard for fluoride in drinking water epa considered dental fluorosis to be cosmetic effect not an adverse health effect and set the standard at level that was not intended to protect against mild dental fluorosis this issue is discussed below in the section on the federal regulation of fluoride in drinking wateraccording to 2002 study fluorosis prevalence among schoolchildren in the 1980s ranged from 18 to 26 depending on th analytical index used the authors further estimated that appr oximately 2 of us sc hoolchildren may experience perceived esthetic problems that could be attributab to currently recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water comb ined with fluoride toothpaste consumption19 however the authors noted that data were not available for other potential fluoride exposures resulting from the ingestion of fluoridated toothpaste and diluted infant formula consumption and that consequently the risk of fluorosis attributable to fluoridation of public water supplies may be overestimated if fluoride consumption was higher in fluoridated areas20 the researchers concluded that in determining the optimal fluoridation policy the prevalence of dental fluorosis should be weighed against fluoridations lifetime benefits and the feasibility and associated costs of alternative solutions such as educating parents of preschoolers about appropriate toothpaste use and wering the current fluoride content of childrens toothpaste given that fluor osis results from fluoride exposure during narrow age range and that the benefits accrue over the entire life span educating parents as to the appropriate use of fluoride toothpaste or reducing the fluoride content of childrens toothpaste as some have suggested may be more efficient than altering current fluoridation policy21 in its 1993 fluoride health effects report the nrc agreed with this conclusion in principle but determined that this approach may not be feasible in practice the most effective approach to stabilizin g the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis without jeopardizing the benefits to oral health is likely to come from more judicious control of fluoride in foods processed beverages and dental products rather than reduction in the recommended concentrations of fluoride in drinking water but applying such policy would be formidable reduction of fluoride concentrations in drinking wate r would be easier to administer monitor and evaluate22 although mild to moderate ntal fluorosis had been c onsidered by agencies to be cosmetic effect not health effect it may be objectionable to many and if severe enough may adversely ffect tooth health therefor this issue has factored in the fluoridation debate23

middle east north africa and other parts of africain response to the widespread use of bo ttled waters and availa bility of variety of fluoridecontaining products the cdc issued new recommendations for fluoride use in 2001 the recommendations are intende d to guide healthcare providers and the public on the appropriate use of fluoride from various sources such as tooth paste and baby formula made with fluoridated water the recommendations specifically address fluoride intake among children aged younger than six years to decrease the risk for enamel fluorosis24 the cdc also suggested areas for further research similarly in 2006 the american dental association issued interim guidance on infant formula and fluoride while ffirming its support for fluoridation the ada recommended that infant formulas be mixed with water that is fluoride free or has very low levels of fluoride to decr ease the risk of dental fluorosis25 health effects researchers continue to study the potential health effects associated with exposure to fluoride in dr inking water many of the studies have focused on ingestion of higher naturally ccurring levels of fluoride rather than on artificial fluoridation levels the studies generally have shown that fluoride ingestion at elevated levels primarily produces eff ects on skeletal tissues skeletal fluorosis and that these effects are more severe as exposure to fluoride increases above threshold very mild skeletal fluorosis is characterized by slight increases in bone mass the most severe form of this cond ition crippling skeletal fluorosis involves bone deformities calcification of ligamen ts pain and immobility in 1993 the nrc reported that few cases of this condition d been reported in the united states and that it was not considered public health concern26 bone fracture incidence related question that has been the subject of scientific research concerns whether artificial water fluoridation increases the risk of bone

mortality raised health concerns and heightened controversy over the practice of fluorida tion some researchers had reported that cancer mortality was higher in areas with fluoridated drinking water than in nonfluoridated areas29 these findings were refuted subsequently by other investigators who identified problems w ith the studys research methodology30 however because of the importance of th is question researcher s have continued to examine the possibility of an association between artificially fluoridated water and cancer in humans independent expert panels conducted reviews of the av ailable scientific studies in 1982 and 1985 the panels concluded that the studies provided credible evidence for an association between fluoride in drinking water and risk of cancer31 however according to the 1993 nrc fluorid review all but one of these studies were ecological studies that is they were either geographic correlation or timeline studies that looked at exposures at the community level rather than individual exposures32 consequently the interpretation of the data was limited by an inability to measure individual fluoride exposures over long periods of time or to measure exposure to other known risk factors ch as smoking or other cancercausing substances33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33280crs9 34 national cancer institute cancer facts fluoridated water 2000

and to evaluate the scientif ic basis and adequacy of epas drinking water standards for fluoride42 in march 2006 the nrc released fluoride in drinking water scientific review of epas standards 43 because the nrc committees charge was to evaluate the adequacy of epa drinking water sta ndards the nrc did not address questions regarding the benefits or ri sks of artificial fl uoridation however after reviewing the available studies the nrc committee concluded that the evidence on the potential of fluoride to initiate or promote cancers particularly of the bone is tentative and mixed and that overall the literature does not clearly indicate that fluoride either is or is not carcinogenic in humans the committee noted that the harvard school of public health was expected to publish large

difference between fluoridated and nonfluoridated areas increased to 25 acco rding to the nih researchers the results suggested that fluoridation continued to play major role in the decline in caries47 in 2000 british researchers published the re sults of their systematic review of 214 studies on the safety and effi cacy of water fluoridation the researchers found that water fluoridation was associated with an increased proportion of children without caries and reduction in the numbe r of teeth with caries but the overall reductions were smalle r than had been reported in earlier studies48 the review also concluded that at fluoride level of 1 mgl an estimated 1 25 of exposed individuals would have fluorosis that coul d be considered aesthetically concerning49 in reviewing the 214 studies the authors found other adverse effects associated with the fluoridation of drinking water however they noted that overall the studies were of low to moderate quality and recommended

disinfectants such as chlorine generally have been accepted as necessary to protect public health by eliminating pathogens in this view decisions regarding dental healthcare practi ces should be made by i ndividuals and families and not imposed by the government to the extent that research gaps exist regarding potential adverse effects of increased exposures to fluoride because of its presence in

fluorosis53 the promulgation of the 4 mgl standard was controversial as it replaced stricterinterim standard of 14 to 24 mgl that was established in 1975 to protect against objectionable moderate dental fluorosis which epa previously had considered an adverse health effect 54 by comparison the world health organization guideline for fluoride in drinking water is 15 mgl when promulgating the new regulation epa estimated that nationwide 282 public water systems serving roughly 184000 people had fluoride levels that exceeded the new standard of 4 mgl more recently epa has estimated that

however epa llows water systems one year to notify customers when the secondary standard is exceeded this notification lag has been criticized because infants and children can have sustained exposure

of the current drinking water standard the nrc had concluded in 1993 that the nationa l primary drinking water standard for fluoride 4 mgl was appropriate as an interim standard to protect public health however the nrc noted that since ep had promulgated the drinking water regulation for fluoride in 1986 the use of fluoride in dental products had increased and as result many americans might inge st more incidental fluoride than was anticipated by the public health service and by epa when recommending standards for drinking water56 moreover the nrc found inc onsistencies in the fluoride toxicity data base and gaps in knowledge and it recommende d further research in the areas of fluoride intake dental fluorosis bone strength and carcinogenicity the nrc further recommended that epas fluorid standard should be reviewed and if necessary revised when results of new research become available57 toward that end in 1998 epa commissi oned an evaluation of the exposure data for fluoride including data on amount s in water foods and dental products moreover in 2002 epa published the results of its statutorily required review of existing drinking water standards and noted that new studies on fluorides effects on bone had been published since the fluoride standard was estab lished in 1986 epas literature search had identified various reports on the clinical toxicological and epidemiological data on fluoride and the sk eletal system and ep concluded that review of the new data was justified as part of the regulatory review process consequently epa asked the nrc to conduc t

mclg of 4 mgl should be lowered and that inform ation gaps regarding fluoride prevented the committee from making some judgments about the safety or the risks of fluoride at concentrations of 2 to 4 mgl60 because the nrcs charge was to evaluate the scientific basis and adequacy of epas drinking water standards for fluoride the committee did not address questions concer ning the risks or benefits of artificial fluoridation the nrc committees major findings are reviewed below dental fluorosis when epa promulgated the fluoride regulation in 1986 it did not differentiate between mild and severe dental fluorosis and broadly considered fluorosis of the dental enamel to be cosmetic effect in contrast 10 of the 12 nrc committee members concluded that severe enamel fluorosis is an adverse health effect not simply cosmetic effect the committee members explained that severe amel fluorosis involves amel loss and that loss compromises the function of tooth enamel the purpose of which is to protect the tooth against decay and infection because vere enamel fluorosis occurs in roughly 10 of children in communities with water fluoride concentrations at or near the current standard of 4 mgl the committee unanimously agreed that the mclg should be set to protect against this cond ition and that epas standard of 4 mgl is not adequately protective61 skeletal fluorosis as noted epa set the fluoride mclg and mcl to protect against the adverse health effect of crippling skeletal fluorosis stage iii skeletal fluorosis in this latest review the nrc committee concluded that stage ii skeletal fluorosis the symptoms of which include sporadic pain joint stiffness and abnormal thickening osteosc lerosis of the pelvis nd spine also constitutes an adverse health effect based on comparis on of bone ash concentrations of fluoride and related evidence of skeletal fluoros is the committee further found the data to suggest that fluoride at 2 or 4 mgl might not protect all individuals from the adverse stages of the condition however th is comparison alone is not sufficient evidence to conclude that individuals xposed to fluoride at those concentrations are at risk of stage ii skeletal fluor osis there is little information in the epidemiologic literature on the occurrence of stage ii skeletal fluorosis in us residents and stage iii skeletal fluorosis appears to be rare c ondition in the united states therefore more research is needed to clarify the relationship between fluoride ingestion fluoride concen trations in bone and stage of skeletal fluorosis before any firm conclusions can

results of the bassin study and to wait for the results of the full study the results of the larger study have not yet been publishednrc reported that clinical studies indicat ed an increased risk of nonvertebral bone fracture and slightly decreased risk of vertebral fractures in populations exposed to fluoride at 4 mgl the consensus of the committee was that under certain conditions fluoride can weaken bone and in crease the risk of fractures moreover the majority of the committee concluded that lifetime exposure to fluoride at drinking water concentrations of 4 mgl or higher is likely to increase fracture rates in the population compared with xposure at 1 mgl particularly in some susceptible demographic groups that are more prone to accumulate fluoride in their bones however three of the 12 members judged that the evidence only supported conclusion that the mclg might not be protective against bone fracture the committee finds that the available epidemiologic data for assessing bone fracture risk in relati on to fluoride exposure around 2 mgl are inadequate for drawing firm conclusions bout the risk or safety of exposures at that concentration63 carcinogenicity the nrc noted that the question of whether fluoride might be associated with bone cancer continues to be debated and analyz ed and that further research should be conducted most committ ee members held the view that the 1992 cancer bioassay that found increase in teosarcoma rare bone cancer in male rats lacked sufficient power to count er the overall evidence of positive dose response trend found in the 1990 rat study64 after reviewing the studies available to date the nrc committee concluded that the evidence on the potential of fluoride to initiate or promote cancers particularly of the bone is tentative and mixed and that overall the literature does not clearly indicate that fluoride either is or is not carcinogenic in humans65 the nrc noted that the rvard school of public health was expected to publish large hospital based casecontrol st udy of osteosarcoma and fluoride exposure in 2006 and that the resu lts of that study might help to identify research needs the nrc review did incl ude an assessment of prepublication data from an exploratory analysis of subset of the harvard da ta that found an association between exposure to fluoride in drinking wa ter and the incidence of osteosarcoma in young males the authors of this research noted several limitations with the study and concluded that further research was need ed to confirm or refute the results66 other potential

an association between fluoride exposure and adverse effects the committee generally concluded that the research on these topics was insufficient to assess their significance overall the committee noted that more research was needed to determine what risks fluoride exposure at 4 mgl might pose in these areas67 research needs noting that research gaps prevented the nrc committee from making certain judgments regarding the safety or risk of fluoride the committee made specific recommendations for further studies that the committee felt would help fill data gaps and facilitate epas re vision of the fluoride standards the recommendations covered wide range of topics including exposure assessment pharmacokinetic studies studies of enamel fluorosis studi of stage ii and stage iii skeletal fluorosis bone fract ure studies and studies on ot her health effects eg endocrine effects nd brain function68 nrc recommendations regarding the maximum contaminant level goal the nrc concluded that the mclg of 4 mgl should be lowered the review committee specifically recommended that to develop an mclg that is protective of severe enamel fluorosis clinical stage ii skeletal fluorosis and bone fractures epa should update the risk assessment of fluoride to include new data on health risks and better estimates of total exposure relative source contribution in individuals and to use current approaches to quantifying risk considering susceptible subpopulations and characterizing uncertainties and variability69 for the cosmetic effectsbased seconda ry maximum contaminant level the committee noted that the current smcl does not completely prevent the occurrence of moderate enamel fluorosis in 1986 epa set the standard to keep the occurrence of moderate enamel fluorosis to 15 or less of the exposed population the committee noted that although this goal is being met the degree to which moderate enamel fluorosis might create an adverse psyc hological effect or an adverse effect on social functioning is not known the committee recommended additional research on the prevalence and severity of enamel fl uorosis in us communities with fluoride concentrations greater than 1 mgl specifically the studies should focus on moderate and severe enamel fluorosis in relation to caries and in relation to psychological behavioral and social effects among affected children among their parents and among affected children after they become adults70httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33280crs19 71 ibid 72 42 usc 300g1 sdwa section 1412b3 73 67 federal register 19069 april 17 2002conclusion although the nrcs new review of fluorid in drinking water did not address questions of artificial fl uoridation the nrc did dete rmine that epas maximum contaminant level goal for fluoride shoul d be lowered assuming that lower mclg would lead to lower enforceable mcl the nrc concluded that this would prevent children from developing severe enamel fluorosis and reduce the lifetime accumulation of fluoride in bone which mo st committee members agreed is likely to put individuals at greater risk of bone fracture and possibly skeletal fluorosis71 even if the nrc had conf irmed epas previous asse ssment of fluorides health effects the agency still might revise the healthbased primary standard and the estheticsbased secondary st andard one reason for poten tial revisions is that when epa developed the current sta ndards the agency considered drinking water to be the only source of exposure for fluoride si nce then sources of potential fluoride exposure have increased and now when reviewing its standards epa would consider fluoride intake from sources other than drinking water this consideration alone may lead to lowering of the primary and secondary standards for fluoride second reason that epa might revise the standard is that the 1996 sdwa amendments pl 104182 dir ected epa to evaluate the effects of contaminants on groups within the general population such as children that might be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects due to exposure to contaminants in drinking water72 another possible revision to the fl uoride regulation involves the public notification requirements for the secondary standard dental fluorosis occurs while tooth enamel is developing and epa s acknowledged that waiting 12 months to provide public notification ma result in young children being exposed to high levels of fluoride during the time at which they are most vulnerable73 epa has considered revising the public notification requi rements but has not yet done so the nrc committee conducted an extensive review of the available science and epa now has significant foundation to support an update of its risk assessment for fluoride revised risk assessment pot entially could become the basis for new more protective fluoride sta ndard however in additi on to health effects epa considers compliance cost risk reduction be nefits contaminant occurrence technical feasibility and other factors when setting standards consequently it remains to be seen exactly how these factors when taken together might influence new standard although the purpose of the nrc study wa s to advise epa on the adequacy of its drinking water standards for fluoride the evaluation of the available science is likely to be of interest to those who are interested in evaluating the currently recommended levels for water fluoridation and to states and communities that are assessing whether or not to fluorid ate their public water supplies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33280crs20 74 safe drinking water act 1412b11 42 usc 300g1opposition to water fluorida tion often has been driven by concerns about the potential health risks of exposure to fluorid in drinking water however social and political concerns also influe nce decisions about water fl uoridation central issue for some fluoridation opponents is lack of choice and they oppose the addition of any chemicals to the water supply other th an those needed to make water safe in contrast many public health professionals and g overnment officials have held the view that water fluoridation offers the most equitable and costeffective way to protect dental health across socially and economically diverse communities the conflict between individual liberty and social policy is one that is unlikely to be fully resolved by more research additional scientific evidence can help inform the decision to fluoridate communitys wate r but such choices often are not made purely on the basis of science because artificial fluoridation decisions have been made at the state and local levels congress has not been at the fore front of the water fluoridation debate nonetheless congress has expr essed interest in water fluoridation issues in the past particularly as questions have arisen regarding the benefits and risks of this practice since first enacted in 1974 the safe drinki ng water act pl 93523 has stated that national primary drinking water re gulation may require the addition of any substance for preventive health care purposes unrelated to contamination of drinking water74 the nrcs recent finding that epas drinking water standards for fluoride should be lowered to protect against dverse health effects may generate new congressional oversight and gislative attention as might any forthcoming research results issues that might attract particular interest might include the health effects research gaps identified by the nrc and the status of epas review and potential revision of the fluoride standards under the safe drinking water act
