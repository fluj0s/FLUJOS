anyone has preclearsound versions of these tapes please check the others and post differences statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heretics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judaism form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association shsbc10 renum 10 8 jun 61 question and answer period ending an intensive question and answer period ending an intensive lecture given on 8 june 1961 based on clearsound only thank you all right you havent lets see what is this this is the 8th of june 1961 solar system have to keep you oriented you havent had any opportunity to ask any questions the last couple of lectures i have simply decided what you didnt know anything about and filled you in so now i want some questions of course its kind of cowardly asking you for questions in the first place because this assumes that i dont know what youre fogged up on yes female voice exactly how and when the havingness and confront commands and where are fitted into run on sop goals just where they go in relation to running the level when do havingness or where do havingness and confront commands get fitted into sop goals actually ill answer it for all sessions female voice yeah if you have the pcs havingness and confront commands you start the session with them after the rudiments and end the session with them when this room situation goes when you ask about the auditing environment the point there is you run them backwards at the end you run the confront and then you run the have you just run them at the beginning have confront that is after the beginning rudiments and at the end rudiments you run them confront and then have this actually is quite mechanical you can take these two processes and throw the guy into his bank see you bring him into the room and then throw him into his bank just look at it that way you see he comes into the auditing room and you say is all right if i audit you in this room you know you say something like this and he says all right and you say all right far as youre concerned its all right but you havent got him in the room yet now if youve got his havingness and confront you move this over into his first process in other words you bypass the rudiments you ask him if its all right to audit in this room and we dont care what he says if youre going to run his havingness and confront process the first thing you do what does it matter whether its all right to audit in the room or not youre going to straighten this up shortly anyhow well why isnt it all right to audit in the room well he probably has pt problem and arc break and withhold thats why its not all right to audit in the room so who cares its there in the rudiments mostly to call attention to the fact that there is an auditing room which might have been missed by the pc you get the idea all right so thats not anything that you handle although there is process given to handle it but that process assumes tr 10 in model session that you dont have the pcs havingness and confront processes so you say is it all right to audit in this room and it goes whaaaam crash and you say fine and go right on to your next rudiment dont use that as an excuse to waste auditing time you got the idea theres point in it if youve got his havingness process all right now lets finish up the rudiments and our first process is now going to be have process and of course that nnhummp was mainly an arc break pt problem and withhold or one of them so youve taken care of that now now you can bring him here see present time problem has got him out there somewhere so you can knock that out of course hes more here isnt he so you run your rudiments and then you saw into the have and confront processes immediately after the rudiments your have first and then your confront well youve handled his pt problem his withhold and his arc break and so forth so therefore hes more willing to be in session you run the havingness process and of course he tends to leave where he has been and arrive where he is at and now you run the confront and you say youre saying just the same as just between you and i think you ought to take look at your bank it is time you ceased to avoid all this its question of how can thetan live in this much mush you got the idea so you say well lets now take look at your bank lets take look at your case you could say this you see very splendiferously theoretically you could do that you could you say well here you are in the room and youve straightened it up so the guy can be audited and here you are in the room and now what do you think about your case see well instead of saying well what do you think about your case you run confront process all right confront processes cycle they go out of pt and into pt so if you are very clever you will run just one cycle out of pt and into pt see if youre very clever out he goes and back he comes you say look it is safe to leave present time in this room 1 the room is safe weve just run havingness on it and 2 we are now demonstrating to you that it is very safe for you to slide down the track little bit and when you come back youll still find the room here what do you know youre saying that in essence then when youre running the confront process so all of the processes today all security checks all everything when if in doubt about how to say good morning to the preclear say it in model session use model session for everything that pertains to auditing this does not apply to johannesburg security check given for purposes of security only there you dont even bother to clear the commands you try to clear the commands and if you dont clear the command you look at the fellow and say well now listen if i have to leave this one with it still falling off the pin you realize youve failed security check are you sure there is nothing you wish to tell he thinks this over for minute and he says well maybe id better tell him about the bank robbery you know the illicit diamond buying and so he sometimes gives up like that but you wouldnt work day and night on and on and on and on and on to clear somebodys security check you see if it were to be given for an employment security check in the first place somebody whose security check is so bad that particularly on the subject the original question by the way have you ever cooked companys books it sounded just little bit slangy to it outcreated on the subject have you ever cooked companys books and you now have that under the heading of falsified i think it is and you strike that one you see while youre security checking somebody for employment and it goes clang and what do you want to clear it for you wouldnt have the guy on bet all right so we finally find out well he only falsified them little bit hes just been entering everything into the petty cash column and sticking it in his pocket or hes been doing something innocent here that should never be reprehended anyhow when youre security checking as security check just passant here you must know what meters talking about it takes good auditor to do security checking you cant teach somebody in ten minutes how to do security check and then trust any result he gets because whats he do he gets somebody on the meter and theres theres meter responses of any kind whatsoever you know that the person is totally irresponsible anyway dead thetan reading properly at the clear read and it all says there thats all right with that he asks all the way through the security check rapidly he gets reaction of any kind whatsoever so he says the persons secure the person just got out of dartmoor scrubs you know just that day so you have to know something about pcs and meter in order to size up the person and if theyre not getting any reactions anyplace on johannesburg security check you know this is impossible anyway your auditing experience but you dont run that in model session and you finish the check in any event matter who youre running it on you always finish the check but you dont necessarily spend four hours clearing up one level you just want to know if hes hotter than pistol on these various levels and one of the ways to do it is go right on through the check whammitywhammitywhammitywhammitywham getting all the withholds that he gives you as you go by and then youve marked several that didnt null and go back over these and ask searchingly about them something on the polite nonauditing attitude of well you realize that if these levels retain withholds as they apparently do and you have not told all which you obviously havent that if you fail to do so that is it you have failed security check and will be rated here as an insecure person now do you want to tell about it and the fellow says well the meter must be wrong and so forth and so forth you say okay youve had it reach down to the bottom of the page and say failed check suchandsuch date unemployable thats it dont monkey with it thats not true in auditing you see you run that in model session and you get those questions just as clean as wolfs teeth you see theres tremendous difference between giving processing check and security check even though youre using the same list of questions now you just take those things apart so in passant i mentioned that all right havingness and confront is run after beginning rudiments in the order of the have and then the confront and before end rudiments in the order of the confront and the have okay female voice thank you right any other question female voice yes yes female voice youve told us this before but it hasnt sunk in and id like for you to tell us again okay female voice if youve got something which has been restimulated by the questions in security check but it doesnt seem to be on the first ones would you go on through and then check back on them afterwards not in processing female voice in doing security check for employment or loyalty or something of this sort some other purpose yes you would do it as you said it but not for processing you do not leave falling level behind you leave nothing falling behind you thats pretty hard to do you very often get them falling on later things and in the panic about withhold but remember if its been carefully given in model session you will have the opportunity to ask the pc if hes withholding anything in the model session and the reason youve got withhold in there at beginning and end rudiments is because you get two cracks at the pc every session so if question were hanging up in that particular fashion and you couldnt seem to get anything out of the pc or get it clear you might suspect because of the sporadic reaction of the needle if its not on the button you see it doesnt act constantly it acts sporadically that means youre near something but youre not on it it falls and it theta bops and it rock slams and then it goes null and it falls and then it goes null and then it rock slams and youre just not asking the right question thats all and if you were to get i didnt say that you should get baffled at this point but if you were to get baffled you know about the whole thing good thing to do is take break well youd take break by ending your session wouldnt you so that gives you crack at the withholds doesnt it and then you take threeminute break and then you start new session and this gives you another crack at the pcs withholds when youre clearing that rudiment you see and this time youd clear the rudiments real hard the end rudiment and the new beginning rudiment and by the time you got back to the question again youve probably gotten the withhold that he kept ticking or tacking on and that question now will probably be free and that is the really the right way to handle it im sure you can see the sense of that and the other point to make here is your pc if hes doing this is probably having trouble and theres another corelated factor of this if pc is having trouble his attention span is poor if his attention span is poor the best remedy for that is shortsessioning which in itself is technique if you were to take pc who was having lot of trouble and you were to begin session and run tr 10 as the sole body of the session just ten minutes of it you see and then run end rudiments and end the session and then begin session and run some more tr 10 and end rudiments you would oddly enough get lot of cases with formal auditing that are really cch cases so its well worth knowing how to do that so it is not waste of time to do that it is beneficial to do that and id recommend that if you are having an awful lot of trouble giving processing check that you also add in this thing called shortsessioning you could go at it like this session per question if he was having too hard time then youd sure get it every time but that would be the extremity the reductio ad absurdum okay that answer your question female voice yes all right any other question yes reg male voice on the assessing for goals we have the goal the terminal and the level fine and you tell us that they each reaction should be the same for each rock slam rock slam rock slam throughout mmhm male voice now if on the primary scale you get your same reaction is it then necessary to go on to the secondary scale this is matter of judgment male voice mmhm let clear upclarify up some things like this this is the same reaction on the goal the same reaction on the terminal the same reaction on the primary now would you go over into the secondary scale would it really be necessary to assess the secondary scale well weve gotten here our first question that tells us actually secondary scale at this stage is too complex there actually will one of these days be tertiary scale and rather than spend the next two months keeping you from having something resembling complete scale i relegated my final sortout to after the first publication so therefore at this stage of the game you find the secondary scale rather clumsy there wont be anywhere near as many words as that on your present secondary scale when i finally get them all sorted you see lot of those words will be over on the tertiary scale so your question then in the future will also apply to if you find it on the primary scale is it any reason to go on to the secondary scale if you find the same reaction all right it would also apply then well if you found the same reaction on the secondary scale would there be any reason to go over into the tertiary scale you get the idea so the question would be could be broadened to include the whole future formation of the prehav scale and ill answer it in that particular fashion i myself had wonderful luck with the original issue and the only ones that i missed arent now on the primary scale except under motion and misemotion the emotional states of pcs are missing on the primary scale so what i would do what i would do would be to take certain selected levels as necessary levels if somebody has an original prehav scale i will read you what those levels are and i would say that if they fell on these levels go to the secondary scale as necessity and if they dont fall on these levels take it see i can give you qualified answer because its matter of judgment im not trying to be complicated with you now any level here that was on the original scale if that fell as much as the terminal good heavy reaction i would go ahead and run it and i wouldnt much bother with going over into the secondary scale but those levels here which really werent on the original it would be safest to assess them again over on the secondary scale even though they fell as hard as the terminal for the excellent reason that they are too pervasive with this odd exception overts overts now youve got an overt situation that if you get the general form overt falling as hard as the terminal nothing has been told you except the person has an attitude and you can go ahead and run what have you done to and what have you withheld from but youve already substituted an auditing command for this word overt or youve done one substitution so you for sure had better find out what kind of an overt and the overt is the longest list apparently the english language has specialized in ways and means of overting and for that reason pcs have enormously odd categories for these types of overts and from one pc when they fall on the word overt this means refraining to think an unkind thought about them so as to put them right or something very complicated and to another pc it means hitting them over the head with brickbat and that is the only overt there is you get the idea and this is peculiar to the whole list of overts each pc has different type of overt that he considers an overt so its such matter for judgment that i for sure would move over into the overt list even though overt fell like mad i wouldnt then just automatically run do because youve already done one substitution what kind of do lets find out because it will fall on overt but what does he classify as an overt that is singular the way that stands out so youd say well if you fall on overt assess the secondary scale that one for sure now looking over the rest of these levels there are two more which if they fell would leave you with recourse but to do the whole secondary scale and you sure better had and thats emotional and misemotional you better find out what is misemotion is it standing woodenly or is it screaming at the top of his voice or what so again it requires the secondary list to qualify the term let forget what i said there at first i can give you good test i just thought of one here any time you yourself would have to make wild substitution for the level assess the secondary scale that would be the rule yeah any time youd have to make wild substitution to find out what it was all about well just move into the secondary scale and you wont be guessing then youd be safe but if that is not the case you can run any other of these levels let say it that way if thats not the case you can run any others now let give you one further piece of data on that that is interesting and that is the goal fell certain consistent amount or reacted certain amount the terminal then in its turn fell or reacted certain amount all right that terminal is going to remain falling that amount but when you check it back against the goal youre checking it back as to how much the goal now falls and this is not not whats meant its how much did the goal fall because the second his attention comes off of the significance of goal and onto the solidity of terminal you get change on the goals reaction your goals reaction on your assessment sheets must be noted very precisely as to how many divisions of rock slam put it down in inches if youre not sure in some guesstimate of inches how much theta bop how consistent how much fall how consistent you put that down about your goal because youre now going to lose it and youre not going to see that reaction on the goal until youve got terminal cleared off of it now you may be able to go back and find lot of reaction on the goal again and you might not be able to so let clarify that just as long as its part of this clarification yes the terminal must fall as much as the goal the level must fall as much as the terminal but the terminal and the level alone can be measured against each other you cant measure all in one breath the goal the terminal the level you cant say to pick gooseberries general macarthur and failed withhold and compare them one against the other you couldnt do an operating condition of this character in auditing because to pick gooseberries is lost back in the limbo someplace you see and youd have to get that one from your notes now is the terminal falling as much as you found the goal falling in your notes because this goal is now only falling in your notes its not falling on the pc this much it still will react but not as much so checking your terminal against the level can be done however directly you say general macarthur failed withhold general macarthur failed withhold general macarthur failed withhold you wouldnt do that but i say you could do that and youd get the same reaction for general macarthur as the right level and that would be the only test but if anything leaves you in doubt just to answer your direct question if anything leaves you in doubt as to what auditing command to shove into this on this primary list here there are several here inverted communication you get this awful fall on inverted communication you see well whats inverted communication of course one of the phrases that you can use for it is intend notto not communicate but nevertheless this could be other inverted communications peculiar communications communication on via is also peculiar communication you could ask would you communicate to cat on via and the terminals cat you know and you get an awful fall on this thing well maybe you could run it directly communicate to cat on via but youve got an inverted communication secondary scale that clarifies the whole thing for you so it has practical use as well as pedantic one okay male voice yes thank you okay any other questions yes female voice well its still the query on the havingness and confront originally the thing on havingness and confront was you assessed for them after the first terminal was flying yes female voice now i know of three cases you know that had them added in yeah female voice while on their first terminal when you just at what point now on running sop goals do we look for the havingness and confront that isnt the question you asked if thats the question you mean female voice well thats the one i intend to ask thats the one i intend to ask all right all right okay female voice when you ask when to run them female voice when to assess one and start including them in their sessions as regular part of auditing sop goals all right all right i will also answer that answered it yesterday female voice yeah how many parts or stages or stops or pause points are there in routines 1 2 and 3 female voice well one at the end of beginning rudiments maam female voice oh yeah now you track with female voice you mean the other separate rudiment yeah yeah if youre going to insist this exact question be answered you track on this one now take look at it now female voice all right yeah how many places in the process of intensives female voice yeah would be pause points where you could use your power of choice on what you were supposed to do to the pc are there in routines 1 2 and 3 consecutively female voice as you finish each section of the routine theres certainly pause point every ah yes as you finish each and every section any level any security check any cch step any anything female voice yeah have and confront can be located female voice all right theres point in being pedantic about something itd be stupid to be pedantic about you can find them anywhere anytime as long as youve got done what you were doing female voice all right so you do case assessment you can find the pcs havingness and confront female voice in other words theres particularly optimum time to start using oh yes well now thats different question female voice yeah ah but thats different question female voice all right youve asked can all right now you write down his name rank and serial number and finish off with how many of his parents deserted how many of his grandparents or whatever see and youve got that all taped you could turn right in find his havingness and confront process you could do this case assessment and you could find his havingness process then you could go ahead and run joburg security check and find his confront process oddly enough you could find his confront process and now were getting unoptimum immediately after you did this check without damaging the pc in the least or you could do it when he was totally finished with routine 1 wait until then to find his confront you could find his havingness process actually at the time he flattened his first terminal on sop goals running by that time youve got to have it female voice ah all right and that happens to be just about your last hung dog going from there on without finding the havingness and confront processes is expensive in auditing time because the pc never gets chance to orient his bank or orient himself in the physical universe as he is running so therefore great deal of auditing time is devoured from that point on if his havingness and confront are not present less auditing time is devoured proportionately to your being toward the beginning of his auditing the closer you are to the beginning of the auditing the less auditing time is at stake for instance you find that immediately after your case assessment youre wasting time so when we get that close to the beginning were becoming silly because one joburg is going to change his have and going to change his confront so you found them for what purpose for their use in one session two sessions three sessions now youre going to have to find another havingness and confront process and youre also liable to get all balled up on well lets see his needle keeps tightening and the tone arm keeps going stiff here on his confront and i dont know what this is all about its just getting awfully confusing i guess the pc is confused hes changing and you are going to have harder time finding the havingness and confront the earlier you find them in pcs intensives not sessions the earlier you look for them the harder time youre going to have finding the havingness and confront processes and the more time youre going to use doing it and the less use they will be to the pc because theyre going to change anyhow so you can get silly about this see it ceases to be just precautionary and it becomes simply flagrant waste of auditing time all right now lets move in to the cchs lets say that this pc was going to be scraped all the way off the bottom all right all the way up the line all the way through all routines got the idea all right during the cchs locating his havingness and confront is of benefit of any kind because you are not running in model session youre running cchs so when are you going to use the havingness and confront so once more you dont need the havingness and confront but it would be perfectly all right to assess for them and get them you got the idea all right now we get up to point of where they become useful they are now useful and that would have to do with your general runs and joburgs you see that would be useful now in view of the fact that youre going to run joburgs along with the cchs you nevertheless havent got too many sessions going there so it and your joburg and the havin and the cchs are going to change the case lot and youre going to have to find new havingness and confront process so you can just go on treadmill of wasting auditing time by finding havingness and confront processes practically any time through routine 1 you can just mark that right down in the book thats practically waste of time because the case is going to change all over the place and youre going to have to find new one every time you turn around so the pcs havingness runs down so hes uncomfortable well hes been uncomfortable for couple of hundred trillion years well it wont hurt him to be uncomfortable little while longer in terms of auditing time its rather wasted to try to find havingness and confront processes during the cch and joburgs that make up routine 1 all right general prehav runs and joburgs at that level ah now were getting somewhere but the first run flattened is sort of the pc getting used to whats going on and getting his feet under him hes already grasping too much you know whats this i i my all all my life goodness gracious could this be true uh huuh i uh you know hes terribly interested its these levels are running at absolute obsessive interest you know practically because youve got him of course right where he lives all right lets say well lets stop being interested pc and lets stop talking about all the things youre trying to tell about and lets throw all this away because its not much importance to haha haha haha and were going to find your havingness and confront process weve got lots of time to waste here youve bought two hundred hours well thats just about how it would sound to the pc all right but lets get that first level flat and lets get that good and flat and lets get our first joburg done at routine 2 lets get our first joburg done and lets get another level run and flat now the pc feels like he can breathe and right about then it becomes economical to run your havingness and confront processes and its economical and continues to be economical right up to the point where it ceases to be adjudicative and becomes an absolute utter necessity and thats in routine 3 first level run on the pcs goal terminal and if you havent found the havingness and confront by that time your pc is now going to start to run very slowly and youre going to wonder why now thats the whole story so possible anytime optimum sometime in the middle of routine 2 oh id say in any time during the first third of the totality of routine 2 its kind of wasteful but after that it becomes quite economical to find them now youre saving auditing time and during the cchs oh man are you wasting auditing time but you can find them and its perfectly okay and the pc will tell you he feels marvelous and isnt it good thing and his havingness is way down and youve just set him up so that he can come into every session and hes learned new trick now he hasnt got anything to think about youre running the cchs see hes learned this new trick my havingness is way down how do people act lets see it says in the textbook here how do people act when their havingness is down see its new trick then hell say oh gee ive just found out there are whole bunch of things i cant confront this is big cognition so he obsessively wants to try to confront them see youre starting to get process in the road of your processing and the pcs interest becomes unduly absorbed any time during routine 1 with havingness and confront thats all there is to it of course im talking about raw meat pc running in right from the beginning that fairly clean clear and cool and collected well im glad i finally answered your question female voice thank you very much all right any other questions okay what day is today female voice june 8th yeah i know its the 8th but what day is it this is thursday lets see id better talk to you something about leveling off case in just few minutes ill just give you few minutes of how do you level off case this would be true in an hgc itd be true in your private auditing and so forth case is not going to get any processing for while what do you do it is sequitur to exactly what weve been talking about with have and confront processes so i might as well add it in here it is not just unkind it is stupid not to end an intensive just as you would think it was stupid to fail to end session similarly it is very dull not to end an intensive well an intensive of twentyfive hours is relatively uneconomical but it nevertheless has to be ended i mean its uneconomical to get twentyfive hours of auditing now person just gets off the launching pad and hes just going over the end of the runway lights and the control tower says its time to whipstall thats about what it sounds like too you see the guy has just taken off you know and he just gets the idea that he might go someplace and he whipstalls fifty hours thats fairly economical he gets chance to go someplace all pcs could be compared to the frog who climbs out of the well at the rate of three inches up in the daytime and falling back two every night but this is proportionate the deeper he is in the well and the earlier he is in auditing the more gain he makes up in the daytime and the further he falls at night and so when we say ending an intensive it is better to cleanly and properly end even twentyfivehour intensive it is better to do that than to say well its waste of auditing time because hell feel better for it if you do end it right fifty hours its economical to end them because you practically stabilize the persons gains you bring him out of the woods and so on you end an intensive depending to large degree on what has been run during the intensive what has been run during the intensive and you would end the routine 1 differently than you would end routines 2 and 3 two and 3 could be ended almost exactly in the same way let say what would be an optimum twentyfivehour intensive even though its uneconomical joburg complete one cch flat if you havent accomplished those in the twentyfive hours be rough you see all right how would you end this intensive well youd better end this intensive by making sure both of those are ended the one cch which you got flat lets make sure that thats flat and lets make sure that joburg is now standing up and saying okay and thats how youd end the intensive got the idea i mean you do more than just check over these two items of course you check over that cch rather briefly because you can unsettle any process processes come to temporary flat points and then unflatten all right thats about the best you could do except during the last hour or so it would be very beneficial to run tr 10 without model session or with it it doesnt matter but to run tr 10 all right now lets take routine 2 or 3 how would you end the intensive id say during the last few hours of the intensive do nothing but run the havingness and the confront processes of the pc now in routine 2 intensive of twentyfive hours you should certainly have had one level one general level flat and one joburg completely completed and the persons havingness and confront process found and you would spend at least the last three hours of the intensive preferably five which would make the last hgc day of that intensive doing nothing but running the have and confront process just run the have process to loose needle run the confront to slowed tone arm you know tone arm doesnt look like its wobbling very much right this minute so now were going to run some have and then were going back to the confront now were going to run some have were going to run some confront and it stabilizes the case most gorgeously and he walks out of that intensive feeling marvelous if you do that and you do good job you stabilize the gains otherwise hes still kind of stuck in the intensive hes still wishing he had some more auditing hes still fixated on all kinds of little factors and the kind thing to do to him is let him gain from his gains and you level him out with your have and confront have by the way is never run further than loosened needle i see people running ten minutes of havingness this is incredible unless theyre only getting in five commands in ten minutes or something this is incredible thats an awful bogged havingness these days all youre trying to do is run it from needle test to needle test can squeeze to can squeeze is it looser thats it thats youve had it thats it and its only about twelve commands if youve got the right havingness process its twelve commands thats it now you can get fancy with the confront process and run it to what is called blowdown and that is to say the needle rises and blows down you come off of it see one cycle of needle of the tone arm pardon one cycle of the tone arm it will rise little bit and blow down and you run it until the tone arm rises largely or slightly and continue to run it until it goes thoomp or slides back down bit and you come off of it and you run twelve commands of have see but somebody running ten minutes of havingness is somebody just like somebody eating sugar you see i think ill have some sugar would you hand that hundredpound sack its very hard on the digestion and this is factual you see the have process can run the case and you dont want it to run the case you want it to orient the pc in the environment please get its purpose see you start running have and you run more than twelve commands of have and what happens the pcs bank starts fluctuating and the next thing you know he can run have against the bank and hes running youre running the bank with have process and youre not supposed to do that youre supposed to run the bank with confront process so its misuse of the process its something like using pair of shears to dig up garden not quite clever and you run ten minutes with it and youve got the guy going through engrams and his somatics turning on thats havingness oh yeah you can do fantastic things with havingness it isnt that havingness doesnt work and it isnt that havingness wont run the bank because it will boy will it but youve now started new process known as running the bank with havingness and you go more than about twelve commands with it and youve started that new process and youre going to get tone arm motion and youd better run it now till the tone arm motion gets out of it and but its misused process it isnt for that purpose at all its to tell the pc hey look physical universe and he says well what do you know oh physical universe thats pretty good and you say good im going to give you two more commands and then end this process and pow thats it and then you got the confront and you move right into the confront get jiggle out of the tone arm end of lecture
