pays john blodgett environment and natural resources policy division summary recurring issue in environmental policy is the cost of pollution control imposed on individuals businesses and governments to inform policymakers about these costs number of surveys and analyses have been conducted over the years consistent basic sources have been an annual survey of costs to manufacturers conducted by the bureau of census boc and an annual analysis of total costs prepared by the bureau of economic analysis bea overall the bea analysis showed the nation spent 122 billion for pollution abatement and control in 1994 or about 176 of gross domestic product personal consumption expenditures for pollution control were 22 billion government 35 billion and business 65 billion these 1994 data represent the end of the annual series the boc survey and bea analysis have been discontinued background while debate continues over defining environmental protection costs and what they mean for society as whole1 every year individuals communities businesses and industries pay billions of dollars to control pollution they pay both directly for pollution control technologies and services eg catalytic converters on autos and sewerage fees and indirectly for pollution control costs embedded in goods and services eg the price of electricity may include the costs of electrostatic precipitators and fluegas desulfurization units to reduce air pollution efforts to measure those costs at the national level began shortly after national environmental protection programs emerged in the 1960s beginning in the 1970s several general sources of cost data were widely available key sources were annual surveys by the boc and mcgrawhill regular analyses by the bea and the council on 1 for an overview of literature on the relationship between federal regulations including pollution control requirements and the economy see robert w hahn and john hird the costs and benefits of regulation review and synthesis yale journal on regulation vol 8 233 1990 233278 for spirited debate reflecting divergent views of pollution control costs see david gardiner and paul r portney does environmental policy conflict with economic growth resources 115 resources for the future spring 1994 1923 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 environmental quality ceq and various studies by the environmental protection agency epa2 these sources of information varied in coverage but taken together they provided multifaceted picture of pollution control costs the mcgrawhill surveys ended in 1988 epas reports have appeared irregularly3 and the ceq ceased analyzing data in the 1980s and recently has merely reproduced data from the boc and bea reports now the boc survey and the bea analysisboth basic sources to many studies of environmental protection costsare being discontinued the bea explains it is reallocating resources toward more urgent priorities for maintaining and improving the us economic accounts4 the survey data and analysis series running from 1972 cease with 1994 published in 1996 so the 1994 data will be benchmark for pollution control costs pending future surveys and analysis pollution abatement expenditures by us industries the boc survey report pollution abatement costs and expenditures 1994 is the last of series that has been primary source of data on the costs of pollution control for manufacturing industries surveying manufacturing establishments with 20 or more employees the boc collects data on capital and operating costs by industry sector the data also distinguish expenditures by media air water solidcontained waste and nonmedia and by state additional details are also provided for example breakdown of operating costs and capital expenditures are presented for three nonmanufacturing sectors mining petroleum and electric utilities5 despite the thoroughness of the survey the figures probably underreport actual costs in report on competitiveness in 1994 the congressional office of technology assessment ota analyzed the bocs cost data and concluded that the survey may underreport costs by as much as 256 2 for list and

opportunities otaite586 washington dc us govt print off 1994 pp 222225 crs3 from the extensive data reported in the boc survey two kinds of figures stand out firstand often the only question asked of these dataare the total costs of pollution abatement the bocs 1994 survey identified pollution abatement capital expenditures of 788 billion for manufacturing establishments and 892 billion for nonmanufacturing establishments see tables 12 plus operating costs for manufacturing establishments amounting to 2067 billion see table 1however boc included depreciation in operating costs net operating costs7 for us manufacturers totaled 141 billion see table 3 this gives grand 1994 total of 309 billion second within these totals expenditures concentrate in few geographic areas and industrial sectors for 1994 texas california and louisiana accounted for approximately 35 of pollution abatement capital expenditures at the same time four major industry groupschemicals and allied products petroleum and coal products paper and allied products and primary metal industriesaccounted for approximately 73 of new capital expenditures similarly pollution control costs were significantly higher for number of subsectors than for an industry groupfor example the proportion of capital expenditures table 1 manufacturing pollution abatement costs and expenditures 1994

including recovered costs and depreciation also vary substantially among industries the ota analysis suggests that share of value added may be the most accurate measure of environmental regulatory burdensince it measures the level of economic activity performed by the establishment and does not include the cost of materials purchased8 by this measure petroleum refining bears the largest burden of pollution control requirements table 3 national pollution abatement and control expenditures beas annual pollution abatement and control expenditures analysis which appeared in survey of current business takes broader look at the nations pollution control costs it examines spending for pollution abatement across all sectors of the economy including personal consumption business and government it also breaks down data by mediaair water solid wastes and other surveys including the boc survey of manufacturing costs are sources of nearly twothirds the data indirect sources and estimates account for the remainder the primary values of the bea analysis have been its comprehensiveness and its consistent timeseries data which cover the period 1972 1994 overall the bea analysis shows the nation spent 1218 billion for pollution abatement and control in 1994 or about 176 of gross domestic product this represented an increase of 31 over 1993 the largest increase was for air pollution control largely to implement the 1990 clean air act amendments caaa in terms of evaluating who pays for pollution control one characteristic of the bea analysis can be misleading it attributes pollution control costs to the sector that performs rather than pays for the air or water pollution abatement or the solid waste collection and disposal in response to questions about who bears the costs of pollution control both crs and ota have in earlier years reanalyzed the bea data to transfer certain costs from those who performed pollution control to those who paid for it the primary shift was to move costs of private septic systems and sewer connections to personal consumption from business this reanalysis has been repeated here adapting slightly the method used by ota9 see table 4 this indicates 1994 personal consumption expenditures for pollution control were 222 billion government 35 billion and business 647 billion pollution control cost data in the future the end of the boc survey and the bea analysis diminishes the limited data on pollution control costs and adds to the difficulty of fulfilling mandates for improved cost analyses of environmental regulations for example epas report the benefits and costs of the clean air act 19701990 1996 the first in series required by the 1990 caaa relied heavily on boc and bea data sources of cost data when epa extends its analysis beyond 1994 are problematic congress has recently enacted requirements for costbenefit analyses of other regulations as well even if new data sources for pollution control costs emerge demonstrating reliability and establishing continuity will take time 8 ota p 191 9 ota table 71 p 190 crs5 table 3 manufacturing pollution abatement costs expenditures by industry 1994a millions of
