interrupt court operations judicial branch policymakers and administrators have given renewed attention to crisis response emergency planning and continuity of operations coop issues coop planning in the federal judiciary is an extension of court security and emergency preparedness plans designed to safeguard lives and property during emergencies1 while much of the current focus on contingency planning grows out of the aftermath of the autumn 2001 attacks continuity of operations planning is an ongoing effort that predates the attacks and grows out of efforts to prepare courts to withstand disasters and other unforeseen occurrences2 at the federal level judicial coop planning is related to efforts established during the cold war to preserve the continuity of government cog in the event of nuclear attack on the united states3 cold war era cog planning reportedly focused on preserving the senior leadership of each branch of government including the chief justice of the united states and associate justices of the supreme court these plans reportedly included locating and evacuating these individuals to secure alternative operational facilities outside of the district of columbia

disruption of operations in several courts in gulf coast states due to hurricane katrina7 one of the issues raised is whether congress might consider legislation authorizing courts affected by natural and manmade disasters to meet outside the geographic boundaries of their circuits or districts in emergency conditions created due to natural or manmade disaster federal court facility in an adjoining district or circuit might be more readily and safely available to court personnel litigants jurors and the public than facility within the district the judicial conference of the united states which makes policy for the federal courts asked congress in june 2005 to pass emergency legislation to allow courts to shift court proceedings temporarily into adjacent judicial districts when emergency circumstances require it and again in september following hurricane katrina the proposed legislation is similar to language contained in section 15 of hr 1751 the secure access to justice and court protection act of 2005 hr 3650 introduced on september 6 2005 would allow us courts to conduct business during emergency conditions8 actions by the administrative office of the us courts prior to september 2001 the federal judiciary engaged in routine efforts to improve physical security in court facilities under guidance by aousc it was recommended that each judicial district convene security committee that would be responsible for developing districtwide plans and procedures in conjunction with usms additionally aousc recommended that each court facility should maintain an occupant emergency plan that outlines procedures to be followed in the event of natural disaster or security problem9 the extent to which these recommendations were implemented in judicial districts varied and specific details regarding security changes are not publicly available following the attacks aousc took several steps to prepare the courts to respond to potential interruptions aousc created an office of emergency preparedness to assist courts in the development of their own crisis response and coop plans also the office supplied courts with guidelines for handling mail to minimize potential exposure to anthrax acting on policies adopted by the judicial conference aousc staff made arrangements for contractor to test courthouses for potentially dangerous biological and chemical hazards10 7

federal emergency management agency fema11 and local federal executive boards associations and councils12 contacts with local police fire and public health officials also were suggested13 the memorandum recommended that courts ensure that an occupant emergency plan be established by the relevant authority and that judicial coop plan be put in place for each facility occupied by judicial

property during emergencies in particular facilities because the federal judiciary frequently is tenant in the gsaowned or leased buildings it occupies including federal courthouses oep planning is typically instituted under the auspices of gsa referring to the federal property management regulations fpmr issued by gsa the memorandum indicated that an oep might address two main issues involving the development of procedures to protect life and property and the formation of local occupant emergency organization oeo designated to undertake certain emergency response duties in the event of an incident among the responsibilities of gsa is the identification of designated official responsible for the oeo and oep in gsa owned or leased facilities the mecham memorandum notes that in court

operations plans coop planning refers to the internal effort of an organization such as branch of government court or office to assure that the capability exists to continue essential operations in response to comprehensive array of potential operational interruptions while much of the renewed impetus for coop planning focuses on responding to potential attacks the highly decentralized nature of the federal courts suggests that all but the most widespread interruptions are unlikely to disable the entire judiciary nevertheless localized operational interruptions that could necessitate the activation of coop in the judiciary might include routine building renovation or maintenance mechanical failure of heating or other building systems fire and inclement weather or other acts of nature other events that may interrupt federal judiciary activity include failure of information technology it and telecommunications installations due to malfunction or cyber attack15 the mecham memorandum established three purposes for judicial branch coop planning these were designed to ensure safety and wellbeing of employees visitors and the public essential functions and activities are conducted without unacceptable interruption and normal operations are resumed as quickly safely and efficiently as possible the memorandum also specified several topics that might be included in contingency

threats attacks and natural disasters in june 2002 aousc awarded contract to booz allen hamilton to develop model coop plans for the federal judiciary beginning in the second circuit court of appeals and the southern district of new york the contractors gathered information through interviews and questionnaires to develop series of templates that the courts could use to develop their coop plans the second circuit and the district court for the southern district of new york were chosen because of their experiences following september 11 2001 when they successfully reestablished normal court functions in the aftermath of attacks on the world trade center16 three model plans covering appeals district and bankruptcy courts were developed to assist court administrators in their coop planning these plans were distributed to circuit and district courts in november 2002 each sample plan identified 10 essential matters to be considered in developing an effective judicial coop plan these matters include the following identification of all essential activities and functions identification and protection of vital records systems and equipment determination of succession and delegations of authority identification and preparation of alternate work sites identification and training of team of employees to perform essential activities in an emergency development of system of warning to

consider establishing court operations support center located outside of washington dc based on the findings of the report this leased facility to be located at least 20 miles outside of washington dc would help ensure continuity of operations in the event that administrative and automation support functions are shut down as result of the closure of the thurgood marshall federal judiciary building

have been provided with enhanced emergency communications systems and tools in addition an instructional cdrom is being developed to guide court security planning and testing24 in the 2004 yearend report on the federal judiciary chief justice william rehnquist reported that emergency preparedness and continuity of operations remained high priorities for the aousc and that significant progress was made in 2004 in making courts safer and in ensuring their continued and effective operation in the event of crisis25 issues policy questions and issues will likely arise as congress examines the status of coop planning in the federal courts and the implications of that planning for overall judiciary emergency preparedness some of the issues regarding judicial coop planning include the following role of the courts in an emergency the constitution mandates the supreme court of the united states and prescribes the statutory establishment of inferior federal courts it is however silent regarding the continued functioning of the federal judiciary during or after an incapacitating operational interruption if localized interruption occurs courts in the affected area could move judges and other court personnel to judicial facilities in unaffected areas or reassign cases to other districts or circuits26 in more wideranging situations where federal courts could not function due to an extended interruption the president could temporarily declare martial law and vest trial court authority in military tribunals convened by commanding officers in the field dispatched to enforce federal law27 congress might explore through oversight what legislative and administrative mechanisms might be available in situations of extended interruption to provide for the administration of civilian judiciary 24 ibid william h rehnquist 2003 yearend report on the federal judiciary the third branch vol 36 1 jan 2004 at httpwwwuscourtsgovttbjan04ttbivindexhtml visited sept 8 2005 25

success of contingency planning is dependent on current planning and regular drills simulations or other testing budgetary constraints the current budgetary environment is characterized by limited resources coupled with increased demand for variety of homeland security protective measures including judicial branch emergency preparedness and coop planning possible consequence of the acquisition of technology infrastructure and supplies such as those that might go into aouscs operations support center is the likelihood that such an allocation might reduce resources available for routine court operations policy and oversight questions judicial branch oep and coop planning raise several questions related to the oversight of underlying policy matters some of these questions include the following how are judicial coop plans maintained where are they physically located and what provisions are in place for accessing plans in the event of an interruption what is the general level of preparedness in the judiciary to carry out coop plans what is the capacity for gsa to support the establishment and deployment of oep plans in court facilities what plans do courts have in place to ensure that they can continue to carry out their constitutional and statutory duties in the event of an incident that could potentially disrupt those operations for undetermined periods of time which circuits or districts have established effective coop programs to what extent have those plans been implemented or exercised and practiced how have various plans been upgraded in the aftermath of the autumn 2001 attacks have those plans been evaluated and by what organizations because coop plans are typically customized to preserve an organizations unique operational needs how can effective emergency planning in the courts be evaluated what standards are to be imposed what are the costs of relocating courts to alternate facilities or other court houses crs11 what procedures are in place
