miranda background of the controversy over pretrial interrogat ion and selfincrimination summary although an i nvoluntary confession has been inadmissible in federal cases since the nineteenth century the supreme c ourt did not denounce physically coercive abuses in state cases until its decision in brown v mississippi the brown case established the basis for the fourteenth am endment voluntariness standard as the due process test for assessing the admissibility of confessions in state cases under this standard the admissibility of confession was evaluated on case by case basis which would be governed by the totality of the circumstances which included the facts of the case the background of the accu sed and the behavior of the police during the interrogation in miranda v arizona the court established several procedures to safeguard the fifth amendment rights of persons durin g custodial interrogations the court reasoned that the suspects needed the sa feguards because the circumstances surrounding incustody interrogation can opera very quickly to overbear the will of the suspect and without them stat ement can be considered the product of hisher free will miranda was controversial among policyma kers and academics who debated its legitimacy and desirability over thirty year s after its judicial creation one of the major arguments offered for overruling miranda was that it had caused great difficulty to law enforcement efforts in controlling crime the ruling in dickerson v united states 530 us 428 2000 struck down 18 usc 3501 federal law that allowed confessions elicited without police advisory to be used at trial as long as the totality of circumstances demonstrated that they were given voluntarily dickerson made miranda s constitutional status clear the miranda decisions announced during the courts 20032004 term however suggest that continued vitality of seemingly conficting pre dickerson caselaw is less clear united states v patane divided the court so that single rationale united majority of its members although five justices joined in plurality decision that declined to overrule its pre dickerson decisions concerning the admissibility of physical derivate evidence on the other hand missouri v seibert likewise resulted in plurality opinion but in spite of contrary suggestions in the pre dickerson caselaw five justices found inadmissible confession intentionally wrung from the defendant before miranda warnings and reelicited thereafter five justices did agree in yarborough v alvarado that the state courts did not unreasonably apply federal law when without considering the inexperien ced suspects age 17 years old they determined that miranda s custodial threshold had not been crossed and they all agreed in fellers v united states that the lower courts should not have addressed mirandadickerson implications raised out of an interrogation that offended sixth amendment requirements httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97645contents

control act of 1997 contained provisions designed to overrule miranda this is review of the controversy sparked by this as well as other proposals governing the use of defendants confession against him at his criminal trial this report reviews the development of the law regarding pretrial interrogation and selfincrimination from the late nineteenth century to the time of the miranda decision and the period covering the af termath the topics covered include an historical overview of the case law of pretrial interrogation prior to miranda that barred use of confession during defendants criminal trial if he had not been given certain warnings before confessing the miranda decision and related supreme court cases the mcnabbmallory rule that barred certain confessions made while the defendant was being illegally held in custody 18 u sc 3501 that addressed the issues raised by miranda and the mcnabbmallory rule proposals to replace miranda with further amended version s ection 3501 and the courts decision in dickerson which appears to have left the miranda rule stronger than at any time in its controversial history historical overview and case law of pretrial interrogation prior to miranda in spite of the fifth amendments limitation on the use of coerced confessions1 the supreme courts early decisions on the admissibility of confessions in federal courts relied upon the common law rule2 in the 1897 case of bram v united states 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97645crs2 bram replied he could not have seen where was he he states he was at the wheel the detective said well bram replied he could not have seen from there id at 562 in holding brams incriminating st atement inadmissible the court reasoned that when the statement was made to him that th other suspected person had charged him with the crime the result was to produce upon his nd the fear that it would be considered an admission of guilt id therefore the court believed that brams statement was not wholly voluntary because the answer wh ich he gave and which was required by the situation was influenced by the force of hope or fear id at 56263 4 united states v cardigan 342 us 36 72 1951 5 266 us 1 1924 the case concerned the admissibility of statements obtained from seriously ill suspect who had been detained and interrogated relentlessly until he finally confessed to three murders id at 11 replying to the pr osecutions argument that the incriminating statements were voluntary be cause there was police coercion the court held that the requisite of voluntariness is not satisfied by establishing merely that the confession was not induced by promise or threat id at 14 although the police did not perform any overtly coercive action the fact th at they persistently questioned the suspect while he was

base exclusion upon violation of the priv ilege against selfincrimination but the court in subsequent decision appear ed to withdraw from that viewpoint4 nonetheless the bram voluntariness appro ach was affirmed in zhang sung wan v united states5 and it influenced the court to state the rule of exclusion more broadly so that it was not merely matte r of whether the confession was reliable or whether forbidden inducemen t had been used but rath er whether the confession was in fact voluntarily made6 according to this doctrine confessions were admitted only if they had been given voluntarily confessions were excluded if the suspects will was subject to police duress due process prior to miranda it was not until brown v mississippi7 that the supreme court applied the due process standard for use of confession in state criminal proceedings prior to that time the court had consistently held that the fifth amendment did not apply to the states and considered the admissibility of incriminating statements in state proceedings as issue of fourteenth amendment due process relative to those standards regarding the conve ntional rule of evidence which prohibits involuntary confessions8 in brown three black defendants were beaten by sheriffs deputies investigating the murder of white male the deputies hung one of the suspects from tree let him up and down

they confessed10 since the fifth amendment privilege was then not deemed applicable to the states the court struck down the confessions based on the theory that interrogation is part of the process by which state acquires conviction and thus is subject to the requirements of the fourteenth amendment due process clause11 the court unanimously reversed the convictions of all three suspects deciding that the police tactics violated the due process clause of fourteenth amendment12 having established in brown that due process was violated when conviction rested exclusively upon confession which was obtained in this manner later cases made it clear that the admission at trial of such confession was unconstitutional13 in brown the court held that although state might be able to do away with the privilege against self incrimination completely state could not exact confession by torture14 subsequently this was commonly referred to as the fourteenth amendment due process volunt ariness test requirement and it was the standard used by the court in articulating the due process requisites for its admissibility15 under this standard the admissibility of confession was evaluated on case by casebasis according to the tota lity of the circumstances 16 surrounding each confession four years after brown the court in chambers v florida 17 reversed state conviction based on c onfessions obtained after five days of interrogation during which the suspects had contact with their friends advisers or counselors18 the court went further than brown and held that even where there was

to confess the s upreme court again ruled for reversal22 in these and other similar cases23 where the convictions we re reversed the court indicated its concern for the integrity of the process used for extracting the confession and noted that there was almost evidence against the defendants the court therefore relied on the fourteenth amendmen t to reverse the convictions of what it believed were innocent men the court was also protecting minorities from brutality which was being tolerated by the states24 between the time of brown v mississippi25 and miranda v arizona 26 the due process standard was applie d in dozens of cases during these years the court designated certain police practices which weighed the totality of the circumstances against finding of voluntariness and

confessions beginning in the late 1940s that provided th basis for significant changes in criminal law investigations and adjudication up to the present time these changes were designed to impose among other things uniform federal standards upon the states which up to that time had many variations in their pretrial procedures29 mcnabbmallory decisions in the area of police interroga tions which had distinct relationship as precursors to miranda are as follows mcnabb v united states30 involved the murder of federal revenue agent during raid on an illegal still veral tennessee mountaineers with limited education were arrested by federal agen ts between one and two oclock in the morning and were subjected intermittently to prolonged questioning over the next several days which re sulted in confessions by three of them the confessions were admitted as voluntary and the fendants were convicted the court decided that it was not necessary to reach the constitutional issue pressed upon us31 because the case can be resolved by the exercis of its supervisory authority over the administration of criminal jus tice in the federal courts32 since the record left doubt that the questioning of the defendants did not take pl ace before judicial officer in timely fashion as required by procedures which congress commanded the court concluded that the convictions cannot be allowed to stand without making the courts themselves accomplices in wilful disobedience of law congress has not explicitly forbidden the use of evidence so procured but to permit such evidence to be made the basis of conviction in the federal courts would stultify the policy which congress has enacted into law33 mallory v united states34 involved decision by unanimous court which held that the

at 78provision in the federal rules35 to the effect that an arrested person must be taken before committing ma gistrate without unnecessary delay36 mallory is significant because it defined in detail what is considered unnecessary delay the police may not arrest upon mere spicion but only on probable cause the next step in the proceeding is to rraign the arrested person before judicial officer as quickly as possible so that he may be advised of his rights and so that the issue of probable cause may be promptly determined the arrested person may of course be booked by the police but he is not to be taken to police headquarters in order to carry out process of i nquiry that lends itself even if not so designed to eliciting damaging statements to support the arrest and ultimately his guilt the duty enjoin ed upon arresting officers to arraign without unnecessary delay indicates that the command does not call for mechanical or automatic obedience circumstances may justify brief delay between arrest and arraignment as for instance where the story volunteered by the accused is susceptible of quick verification through third parties but the delay must not be of nature to give opportunity for the extraction of confession37 in every case where the police resort to interrogation of an arrested person and secure confession they may well claim and quite sincerely that they were merely trying to check on the information given by him38 application to states the fifth amendment to the constitution guarantees the criminal suspect the right against selfincrimination39 in malloy v hogan40 the court incorporated the fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination into the fourteenth amendment thereby requiring the state governments to recognize the constitutional privilege against selfincrimination41 the court pointed out that the fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination demands that the accused be free of any improper influence when he is considering whether to remain silent or make statement42 the court stated that under the fifth amendment test the constitutional inquiry is not whether the conduct of state officers in obtaining the confession was shocking but whether th confession was free and voluntary thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97645crs7 43 id at 7 44 id at 8 45 see mcnabb v united states 318 us 332 34546 1943 46 162 us 613 1896 47 223 us

following the decisions by the court in two early cases wilson v united states46 and powers v united states 47 it was generally established that warnings were not required during pretrial interrogations as requirem ent for the admission of defendants statements48 in the wilson case the court held that the defendants statements depended on their voluntariness and since they were

was held to apply where the defendant was asked to enter only nonbi nding plea at the preliminary hearing but his nonbinding plea of guilty though later withdrawn was still used against him at trial subsequent to the hamilton v alabama and white v maryland decisions which recognized the right to counsel in we ll defined situations in pretrial judicial proceedings at the state level the court took considerable step by extending the sixth amendment right to counsel to so lely nonjudicial pretrial situations54 in massiah v united states55 massiah was indicted for federal narcotics violations for which he retained counsel pled not guilty and was released on bail the codefendant who unknown to massiah was cooperating with the authorities when he with radio transmitter in his car invited massiah to discuss the pending case and during their conversation in th car massiahs admissions were overheard by federal agent who testified with respect to the statements at massiahs trial the court reversed massiahs conviction on the ground that obtaining information from him in this manner violated his sixth ame ndment right to counsel the central point behind the decision was that statements obt ained by federal agents from an indicted defendant who has counsel ar as matter of course inadmissible against him if obtained without counsel present56 the decision is significant inasmuch as it is the initial expansion of the right to counsel to police interrogations and investigations in escobedo v illinois 57 five weeks after massiah escobedo was taken into custody and questioned concerning the fata l shooting of his brotherinlaw but his attorney obtained his releas digerlando who was already in police custody and who was later indicted for the murder along with escobedo told

station but was barred from seeing him after the police arranged confrontation between di gerlando and escobedo esc obedo incriminated himself in the killing which was admitted at his trial deciding

basis for an adverse inference60 the prohibition of adverse comment regarding defendants decision to remain silent was rejected by most informed professional opinion this was re flected in the formulation of the model rules of evidence61 during the 1960s six states allowed adverse comments to be made which stemmed from the silence by the accused62 there were decisions by the court on this issue regarding the application of the fifth amendment for the reason that the amendment was not applicable to the states63 until the court incorporated the fifth amendment and made it applicable to the states in malloy v hogan64 during the following year the c ourt addressed the fifth amendment in reviewing state case65 when it struck down the provisions of californias constitution permitting

however in estelle v smith 451 usa right not to be questioned the accused could not cut off pretrial interrogation inasmuch as the right was not recognized by the court prior to its decision in miranda for example in crooker v california 67 the accused claimed his vol untary confession should be withheld because it was obtained after the police denied his request to contact his lawyer the majority rejected this cont ention asserting that such rule would effectively preclude police questioningfair as well as unfairuntil the accused was afforded opportunity to call his attorney68 the

outweighs the need for the prophylactic rule protecting the fifth amendments privilege against selfincriminati on also statements obtained in violation of miranda may be admissible to impeach fendants contradictory testimony at trialwhich could occur at that time during cu stodial interrogations because of the incommunicado nature of the proceedings74 the court noted that while police brutality of the early 1900s75 was longer the standard practice the community still needed protection against the psychological rather than physically oriented interrogation76 the court believed that it was necessary to give this protection to suspects because all police interrogation manuals emphasized the need for privacy during the interrogation so that in effect the subject was deprived of every psychological advantage77 the court referred to techniques and psychological tactics interrogators are instructed to use during an interrogation to obtain evidence from the suspect78 the court reasoned that the suspects needed the safeguards because the circumstance surrounding in custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of the suspect 79 and without them statement can be considered the produc t of hisher free will the rules are designed to safeguard the privilege against selfincrimination and must be followed in the absence of other procedures which are at least as effective in apprising accused persons of their righ t of silence and in assuring continuous opportunity to exercise it 80 these rules apply at the outset when the person is first subjected to interrogation while in custody at the station or otherwise restricted in the freedom of his her actions in any meaningful way81 the specific rules safeguards enuncia ted by the court were as follows 1 regardless of his prior awareness of his rights if the accused in custody is to be subjected to questioning he must first be informed in clear and unequivocal terms that he has the right to remain silent so that those unaware may learn of this right and so that they will be able to overcome the inherent pressures of the interrogation atmosphere82httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97645crs12

accompanied by the explanation that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court so as to make sure that the suspect will be aware of the consequences of forgoing it83 3 because this warning is an absolu prerequisite to interrogation the suspect must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation regardless of the circumstances which may indicate that the person may have already been aware of this right 84 4 the individual must be warned that if he is indigent lawyer will be appointed to represent him otherwise t he admonition of the right to consult with counsel would often be understood as meanin g only that he can consult with lawyer if he has the funds to obtain one85 5 if the individual indicates in any manner at any time prior to or during questioning that he wishes to remain silent the interrogation must cease and if he states that he wants an attorney the interrogation must cease til an attorney is present86 6 if during an interrogation statemen t is taken without the presence of an attorney heavy burden rests on the govern ment to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his priv ilege against selfi ncrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel nd valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that confession was in fact eventually obtained87 7 any statement obtained in viola tion of these guidelines may not be admitted into evidence inasmuch as the rules do not distinguish degrees of incrimination and it is without regard as to whether it is only an admission of part of an offense or whether the statements are inculpatory or exculpatory88 8 it is impermissible for one to be penalized for exercising his fifth amendment privilege and therefore the prosecution may not use at trial the fact that the accused stood mute or claimed hi s

illingness to be interrogated in the absence of ansubsequently the court made two things very clear in miranda which made it unique 1 based upon the courts interpre tation there is requirement under the fifth amendment that suspects must know ingly and voluntarily waive their rights which in effect places an affirmative duty on police officers to inform the accused of hisher rights90 2 decision prior to miranda in construing the fifth amendment had stated that any of the rules imposed by miranda were required for compliance with the amendment91 case law developments after miranda 1 the right to counsel in 1975 the court seemed to ta ke more limited view of the miranda safeguards in michigan v mosely 92 the court in rejecting the strict application of the miranda safeguards to bar new interrogations reviewed the circumstances leading to the incriminating statements to determine when suspect waives his rights93 the court concluded that the ad missibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under miranda on whether his right to cut off ques tioning was scrupulously honored94 as for the application of the scrupulously honored st the majority c oncluded it was met on the facts of the case because the poli ce here immediately ceased the interrogation resumed questioning only after the passage of significant period of time and the provision of fresh set of warnings and re stricted the second interrogation to crime that had not been subject of the earlier interrogation95 hence the court appeared to move towards less rigid approach permitting limited renewed interrogations rather than an all inclusive miranda coverage in 1977 the court appeared to extend the miranda rights in brewer v williams 96 in deciding that the police violated the suspects rights to counsel underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97645crs14 attorney instead he stated several times th at when i get to des moines and see my lawyer i am going to tell you

103 id the defendant was given his miranda rights orally at the time of arrest and later at the fbi he read an advice of rights fo rm which he said he understood after which he said he would talk to the agents but would not sign the waiver at the bottom of the form the state supreme court excluded the defendants incriminating statement on the ground that waiver of miranda rights will not be recognized unless such waiver is specifically made after the miranda warnings have been given but the court disagreed id at 372 104 id at 373 105 id the court said an express written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually st rong proof of the validity of that waiver but is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver the question is not one of form but rather whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the miranda case as was unequivocally said in miranda mere silence is notmiranda the court stated that courts should indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver97 the court noted that the right to counsel granted by the sixth and fourteenth amendments means at least that person is entitled to the help of lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against himwhether by way of formal charge preliminary hearing indictment information or arraignment98 being aware that warrant had been issued for his arrest he had been arraigned on that warrant before judge and he had been committed by the court to confinement in jail the court concluded there can be doubt in the present case that judi cial proceedings had been initiated 99 the state has the burden of proving that susp ect actually relinquished his rights and not merely that he comprehended them100 hence the court appeared to be giving expanded miranda protection by making waiver of the right to counsel more difficult in 1979 the court appeared to change its position again in north carolina v butler 101 rather than making waiver more difficult the court appeared to make it easier by allowing implicit waivers102 disregarding the rule that only explicit waivers either written or oral are effective the c ourt placed emphasis on whether the accused waived his rights knowingly and voluntarily rather than the form of the accuseds waiver103 therefore according to butler words and action may be sufficient to waive suspects rights but the presumption by the courts must still be against waiver104 however the court ultimately decided that all the circumstances will be reviewed in order to determine if the waiver was voluntary105httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97645crs15 enough that does not mean that the defendant s silence coupled with an understanding of his rights and course of conduct indicatin g waiver may never support conclusion that defendant has waived his rights the courts must presume that defendant did not waive his rights

requirements for an effective waiver the arizona supreme court in deciding the issue of voluntariness applied the totality of the circumstances test in finding that edwards waived his rights when he vol untarily spoke with police after he had invoked his right to counsel during an interrogation the day before107 the court reversed holding that an accused ving expressed his desire to deal with police only through counsel is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him unless the accused himself initiates further communication exchanges or conversations with the police108 the court further stated that police cannot reinterrogate an acc used in custody if he has clearly asserted his right to counsel109 it would appear as if the clearly asserted language was an indication that there will be requirement for clear and precise statement in order to invoke the right to counsel which has the effect of overruling the in any manner guidelines in miranda it also reveals the significance that the court attaches to protecting the right to counsel by requiring more than an incognizant waiver of that right th accused himself must initiate further communication110 opting for the stricter knowing and intelligent waiver over the broader totality of circumstances test the court appeared to be seeking way to affirmatively protect the accuseds right to have counsel during the interrogation111 in 1983 the court had another opportunity to review the edwards test in oregon v bradshaw 112 the court agreed in bradshaw that the admissibility of confession given by defe ndant who earlier invoked his miranda right to counsel is to be determined by twopart test it first must be determined whether the defendant initiated further

standard of clarity for such requests and have held that requests falling below this threshold do not trigger the right to counsel still others have adopted third approach holding that when an accused makes an equivocal statement that arguably can be construed as request for counsel all interrogation must immediately cease except for narrow questions designed to clarify the earlier statement and

determined if the accused waived his ri ght to counsel and silence that is whether the purported waiver was knowing and intelligent and f ound to be so under the totality of the circumstances including the necessary fact that the accused not the police reopened the dialogue with the authorities116 in 1984 in smith v illinois 117 the supreme court was presented with its first opportunity to address an quivocal request for counsel the court noted that the issue was whether the accused had invoked his right to counsel so as to come within the edwards test118 the court recognized the three approaches for determining the consequences of such ambiguitie s but declined to adopt one119 the court stated that where nothing about the request for counsel or the circumstances leading up to the request would render it ambiguous all questioning must cease120 hence there appears to be the implication that only unambiguous requests will be sufficient for the recognition of the right to

standard was the per invocation standard146 under this standard each postwarning reference to an attorney by the suspect was considered per invocation of the right to counsel and any questioning initiated by the police had to cease147 the third approach was the clarification standard148 here the courts permitted the police to pursue the interrogation for the purpose of clarifying the accuseds intent following an ambiguous invocation of the right to counsel149 2 the miranda rules non constitutional status although the miranda rules appear to be inflexible and unyielding neither the court nor the lower courts appear to ve applied strict approach in their application while compliance with miranda is constitutionally required under all circumstances the court stated in michigan v tucker150 that the miranda decision recognized that thes procedural safeguards were not themselves rights protected by the constitution but were instead measures to insure that the right against compulsory selfincrimination was protected the suggested safeguards were not intended to create constitutional straightjacket but rather to provide practical reinfo rcement for the right against compulsory selfincrimination151 the deviation from miranda in the tucker case appears to be the courts pronouncement that the fifth amendment had not been violated in spite of the fact that the police did not completely comply with miranda nor did they implement any substitute procedural safeguards152 thus the tucker case appears to represent weakening of the miranda procedural safeguards inasmuch as it ignores significant amount of the language in the miranda case in new york v quarles153 police officers were approached by woman who informed them that she had been raped by an armed man who had

was excluded under miranda was not an issue however the defendant was questioned again at the sheriffs headquarters there after being given the miranda warnings and after waiving his rights he made full statement expl aining his involvement in the burglary the defendant argued that his statement should be excluded as the fruit of the poisonous tree however the court held that the poisonous fruit doctrine did not apply nearby supermarket the police located the suspect in the supermarket where they arrested him frisk uncovered an empty shoulder holster and the arresting officer asked him where is the gun the suspect gestured toward stack of soap cartons and said the gun is over there nd the police found the revolver behind the cartons the state courts excluded quarles response identifying the location of the gun he had discarded because he had not been given the miranda warnings154 the court reversed and conclude d that on thes facts there is public safety exception to the requirement that miranda warnings be given 155 similar to michigan v tucker the court rejected the notion that the lack of miranda warnings implied that violation of the fifth amendment had occurred156 the court described miranda as majority which was willing to impose procedural safeguards when the primary social cost of those added protections is th possibility of fewer convictions which should be distinguished from the quarles case whereby the harm would be the incapability to insure that further danger to the public did not result from the concealment of the gun in public area157 thus the court concluded that the need for answers to questions in situation posing threat to the public safety outweighs the need for the prophylac tic rule protecting the fifth amendments privilege against selfincrimination158 to hold otherwise the court in quarles said police officers would be in the untenable position of having to consider often in matter of seconds whether it best serv society for them to ask the necessary questions without the miranda warnings and render whatever probative evidence they uncover inadmissible or for them to gi ve the warnings in order to preserve the admissibility of evidence they might uncover but possibly damage or destroy their ability to obtain that and neutralize the volatile situation confronting them159 in oregon v elstad160 the court rejected the narrow interpretation of the tucker case and held that tuckers reasoning applies with equal fo rce when the alleged fruit of noncoercive miranda violation is neither witness nor an

rejected the concept that violation of miranda necessarily involves viola tion of the fifth amendment162 as in michigan v tucker the court in new york v quarles rejected the contention that the absence of warnings imp lied that compulsion in violation of the fifth amendment had taken place hence these cases suggest that circumstances may exist such as public safety which may justify an

to the undercover agent he countered the officers testimony as to the sale with testimony that he had sold the officer what appeared to be heroin but the bags contained only ba king powder the prosecutor was allowed to impeach the defendants credibility by refe rring to statement made by him to the police which concededly made th at statement inadmissible under miranda the court held that the pretrial stat ements obtained in violation of miranda can be used at trial for impeachment regardless of the contrary dictum in the miranda case164 this raised the issue of whether defendants silence during custodial interrogation can be used for impeachment purposes in view of the dictum in miranda165 advancing the concept that the prosecu tion cannot use this silence at trial in doyle v ohio 166 the court held that impeachment by the defendants post arrest silence after he had received the miranda warnings was impermissible the court said not only is every postarre st silence insolubly ambiguous because it may be nothing more than th arrestees exercise of hisher miranda rights167 but also use of the silence to imp each would be f undamentally unfair and deprivation of due pro cess considering the fact that the warnings carry the implicit assurance that s ilence will carry penalty 168 the court distinguished doyle v ohio in three subsequent cases in anderson v charles

weeks likewise in fletcher v weir 174 the court followed the rationale of jenkins and made distinction between doyle in allowing impeachment by the use of post arrest silence which was not proceeded by miranda warnings reasoning that this was not case where the government had i nduced silence by implicitly assuring the defendant that his silence woul d not be used against him175 in effect the court held that the silence of suspect in custody prior to his receipt of miranda warnings can be admitted for impeachment based upon the following reasoning the significant difference between the present case and doyle is that the record does not indicate that respondent weir received any miranda warnings during the period in which he remained silent immediately after his arrest176 in jenkins as in other post doyle cases we have consistently explained doyle as case where the government had induced silence by implicitly assuring the defendant that his silence w ould not be used against him177 in the absence of the sort of affirmative assurances embodied in the miranda warnings we do not believe that it violates due process of law for state to permit crossexamination as to postarrest silence when defendant chooses to take the stand178httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97645crs24 179 section 3501 governs the admissibility of conf essions brought in criminal proceedings under federal

that they constituted the basis for the rigid mechanical exclusion of an otherwise voluntary and competent confession and it is very high price to pay for constables blunder182 the rationale of 18 usc

traditional right of the people to have their prosecuting ttorneys place in evidence before juries the voluntary confessions and incrimin ating statements made by defendants simply must be restored183

the committee is convinced that the rigid and inflexible requirements of the majority opinion in the miranda case are unreasonable unrealistic and extremely harmful to law enforcement the unsoundness of the majority opinion was forcefully shown by the four dissenting justices who also predicted the dire consequences of overruling what theretofore had been the law of the land185 the miranda decision was an abrupt depart ure from precedent extending back at least to the earliest days of the republic up to the time of the rendition of this 5to4 opinion the totality of circum stances had been the test in our state and federal courts in determining the admissibility of incriminating statements mr justice whites dissent demonstrat beyond question that warnings as to constitutional rights were not required by the constitution and that the sole test of admissibility should be tota lity of circumstances as bearing on voluntariness186 the committee is of the view th at the proposed legislation would be an effective way of protecting the rights of the individual and would promote efficient enforcement of our criminal laws by the express provisions the proposed legislation the trial judge must take into consideration all the surrounding circumstances in determining the issue of voluntariness including specifically enumerated factors whic h historically enter into such determination whether or not the arrest ed person was informed of or knew his rights before questioning is but one of the factors187 the committee is aware that few have expressed the view that legislation by congress restoring the voluntariness test to the admissibility of confessions and incriminating statements would be declared unconstitutional on the ground that the provisions do not measure up to the rigid standards set forth in miranda the committee is also aware that the opinions of the four dissenting justices clearly indicate that neither of them would c onsider these provisions unconstitutional188 the committee feels that it is obvious from the opinion of justice harlan and other dissenting justices that the over whelming weight of judicial opinion in this country is that the voluntariness test does not offend the constitution or deprive defendant of any constitutional right one can predict with any assurance what the supreme court might at some future date decide if these provisions are enacted the committee has concluded that this approach to the balancing of the rights of society and th rights of the individual served us well over the years that it is constitutional and that congress should adopt it after all the miranda decision itself was by bare majority of one and with increasing frequency the supreme court has reversed itself the committee

in plurality opinion concluded that the postwarning stat ements were not admissible the test used by the plurality was whether the intervening miranda warnings when considered in conjunction with the police officers prewarning questions and the admissions already made by the defendant were effective in advising the suspect regarding her postwarning rights in applying this test the plurality focused on the defendants position and emphasized several of the most excessive events during the twostep interrogation the interrogation took place in the station house the questioning was systematic exhaustive and managed with psychological skill the prewarning interrogation caused the suspect in substantial manner to incriminate herself and the interrogating police officer did nothing to remedy the defendants likely misimpression that her prewarning statements would be used against her these facts said the plurality served to distinguish this case from oregon v elstad 221 the plurality held that their approach was not an application of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine222 however justice breyer in concurrence wrote that the pluralitys approach in practice will function as fruits test223 justice breyer would also apply the following simp ruleto the twostage interrogation technique courts should exclude the fru its of the initial unwarned questioning unless the failure to wa rn was in good faith224 concurring in the judgment justice kenne dy would apply narrower test in which the twostep interrogation technique was used in calculated way to undermine the miranda warning225 the admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by the principles of elstad unless the deliberate two step strategy was employed if the deliberate twostep strategy has been used postwarning statements that are related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measur are taken before the postwarning statement is made curative measures should be designed to ensure that reasonable person in the suspects situation would understand the import and effect of the miranda warning and of the miranda waiver226 in other words the court left the door open for police to use some confessi ons obtained after double interviews by proving the interrogation was not done in calculated way to undermine the miranda

subjective intent of the interrogating officer cannot be easily deter mined and may be more comp licated in other situations which are likely to occur and th erefore should be irrelevant228 this would make it difficult for lower courts to determine if officers had gone too far future courts deciding on admissibility of such statements she wrote will be forced to conduct the kind of difficult state ofmind inquiry that we nor mally take pains to avoid229 as opposed to the test adopted by the pl urality the dissent w ould adopt different test if the prewarning admissions were involuntary the postwarning admissions should only be excluded under two circumstances following elstad if the first statement is shown to have been involuntary the court must examine whether the taint dissipated through the passing of time or change in circumstances and b if the postwarning statements were involuntary despite the miranda warnings230 the court in affirming the ssouri supreme courts ruling in seibert in which the interrogating officer testified that he deliberately violated miranda upheld its ruling in dickerson v united states231 which affirmed that miranda rights are constitutionally

the defendants voluntary statement that he possessed it the defendant interrupted the police before they could finish giving him his miranda rights asserting that he knew his rights the court

questioning the 10th circuit ruled in patanes favor conc luding that the confiscated gun could not be used as evidence in court the 10th circuit based its decision on the landmark 2000 supreme court

the government appealed arguing th at the poisonous fruit doctrine does not apply to physical evidence obtained thr ough an unmirandized confession the supreme court was asked to settle disagreement that had arisen between the 10th circuit and other circuit cour ts over the past few years justice thomas writing for plurality which included justice scalia and chief justice rehnquist concluded that suppre ssion was not necessary the opinion is based on the courts last term decision in chavez v martinez234 which held that the selfincrimination clause in the fifth amendment is not violated until defendants selfincriminating statements are sought to be admitted at trial235 because the failure to provide miranda warnings is not itself constitutional violation there is justification for fashioning fruit of th poisonous tree doctrine in this context in order to deter nonmi randized questioning236 justice kennedy with whom justice oconnor concurred in the judgment opined that the practical justifications for admitting the physical evidence in this case were stronger than the justifications for admission in prior cases in which the court had permitted the admission of evidence obtained during an unwarned interrogation however unlike the plurality justice kennedy found it unnecessary to decide whether the detectives failure to give the defendant the full miranda warnings should be characterized as violation of the miranda rule itself or whether there is anything to deter so long as the unwarned statements are not later introduced at trial237 dissenting justice souter writing for justices stevens and ginsburg described as beside the point the majoritys denial that the fifth amendment self incrimination clause addr esses the admissibility of nontestimonial evidence238 the real issue justice souter wrote is whether fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine should be applied lest we create an incentive for the police to omit miranda warnings239 in closing their eyes to the consequences of giving an evidentiary advantage to those who ignore miranda the majority adds an important inducement for interrogators to ignore the rule in that case240 justice

this time comstock questioned michael about the night of september 22 1995 which left francisco castaneda dead from bullet wound comstock never told michael that he was under arrest and did not give

michael first explaine d his version of the events of the night in question he did not mention the shooting or his role in hiding the gun when comstock expressed disbelief at michaels story nd told

detective comstock informed him he would be free to go home after the interview michael eventually explained the ev ents that took place after midnight on september 22 he paul soto and some others went to shopping mall in santa fe springs california there they saw castanedas truck and attempted to steal it soto went to the drivers side of the tr uck while michael approached the passengers side

directly whether michael alvara do was in custody or not but whether the state courts decision that he was not was unreasonable the majority in considering all of the facts believed th at it was not unreasonable for the courts to conclude that he was not in custody the police did not transport him to the station require him to appear at particular time threaten him or suggest he would be placed

decide how far those rights extend overview since the fifth amendment right against selfincrimination did not apply to the states until 1964257 its relevance to the admissibility of pretrial statements was limited to federal proceedings in the earliest cases beginning in the late nineteenth century issues of admissibility were decided on the basis of the rule excluding involuntary confessions during the early 1940s to the late 1950s these issues were viewed in terms of an exclusionary rule that the court created to enforce the requirements of federal statutory law that the accused be brought promptly before magistrate the inapplicability of the fifth amendm ent to the states prior to 1964 did not mean that the interrogation process was fr ee of federal judicial scrutiny those coercive practices that were considered extreme were held to be inadmissible pursuant to the fourteenth amendment due process clause the germinal case brown v mississippi in which the court overturne d murder conviction based upon confession that had been obtained thr ough torture hanging and whipping was considered violation of the fourt eenth amendment due process clause in the area of police procedures two deci sions had very close and significant relationship to the miranda decision massiah v united states and escobedo v illinois the massiah decision was notable for the ex tension of the right to counsel to police interrogation the escobedo case while gro unded upon the sixth amendment right to counsel spoke without reservation of the right of the accused to be advised by his lawyer of hi s privilege against selfincriminationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97645crs37 258 see supra text accompanying notes 14449 259 see missouri vseibert 124 sct 26012004two of the most famous elements of miranda are the courts creation of per right to consult with counsel durin g interrogation and its creation of per right to be informed that the privilege applies at the police station the third most famous element of miranda is the courts determination that prophylactic rules are necessary to reduce the inherent coercion which is prevalent in majority of the custodial interrogations since the miranda decision set forth the right to counsel in 1966 the court had not defined with sufficient clarity what wa s required in order to invoke the right to counsel the lower courts have adopted one of three approaches the thresholdof clarity standard the per invocation standard and the clarification standard258 when the court addressed the issue in davis v united states many observers were surprised when it chose the clarification standard which allowed the police to ignore an ambiguous request for counsel and continue their interrogation section 3501 of 18 usc was enacted as result of the congressional reaction to miranda the legislation was designed to overrule miranda and certain other decisions that were perceived to be detrimental to law enforcement the courts decision in michigan v tucker appeared to declare that the miranda safeguards are longer viewed as rights protected by the constitution they were considered as court imposed pro cedural rules in view of the courts decisions in dickerson v united states which held that miranda announced constitutional rule that congress may not supersede legislatively nor may strategists drain the substance out of the warnings by training instructors259 the miranda warnings appeared to be stronger than at any time in their controversial history however considering the decisi ons in the four cases seibert patane fellers and alvarado which were deci ded during the 20032004 term of the court with two favoring law enforcement and the other two placing additional restrictions on the police it is difficult to determine what the current limits are with regards to the guarantees under the miranda decision
