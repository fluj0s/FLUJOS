has preclearsound versions of these tapes please check the others and post differences statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heretics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judaism form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association shsbc3 renum 3 19 may 61 emeter emeter lecture given on 19 may 1961 based on clearsound only thank you well now weve gotten ourselves few cases moving along and every time i see you why youre less plowed in this is operation reverse the furrowing okay lets see what is this this is the 19th of may 1961 this is saint hill special briefing course now once upon time there was knucklehead once upon time and he kept doing things to people kept doing things to people and then few trillion years later he said theyd all been done to him ill give you an example of this in moment but right now i want to talk to you something about emeters and assessments this is very very important then ill tell you more about this knucklehead the emeter is very peculiar instrument it is absolutely accurate but when somebody is so knuckleheaded as not to ask the right questions of course it apparently gives wrong answers an emeter is as accurate as the auditor asks the right questions it itself is totally accurate but you have to find out what it is talking about and it is not necessarily talking about what you are talking about as the auditor but it is talking about something and the probability is that it is very close to what youre talking about when its talking sporadically but not quite it and when you ask the right question the emeter then reads hard and consistently but the nearright question reads inconsistently so when you get inconsistent reads your question is not quite right that is general rule not quite right but when you ask the right question the emeter will then tell you its the right question by reading consistently you can ask for withhold something on this order you can say well are you withholding anything about your house and the emeter will go flick and now this fellow who comes down the track all these trillennia having burned houses massacred the inhabitants of houses having chewed up the landscape of houses in general in many wars in many lives knows very well that its house and he becomes completely fixated on the idea that he must ask the question about the house the house the house and the emeter goes flickflew flickflew read read read all right what about this house are you withholding and the emeter goes flick and then flick and then it theta bops and then it goes answer at all and then it goes totally null and this fellow who knows very well that it is about house he says is it big house or little house and the emeter goes flick and it goes flew and it goes null and it goes this and that just nothing seems to happen thats all nothing seems to happen and then the d of p or somebody whose specialty was burning down barns gets the pc in and says well now you seem to have withhold here and we dont seem to find out what it is is it about barns and theres flick and flew and null and the d of p says you see now you knuckleheaded auditor you you you you missed it its about barns and there it goes but the thing doesnt clear and the pc says ive never done anything to barns oh its must be barns must be barns its just come on confess what is it barns barns it must be barns has to be barns everybody knows what you do with barns you burn them down when theyre full of stock always produces hell of an arc break in the vicinity when you do that sort of thing leave the house alone but burn the stock up ughhu thats best and nothing is going to happen either way because they havent learned this rule the emeter reacts and clears on the exact right question thats what it reacts and clears on but it will give you an indicator it is nice enough to tell you youre getting warm but when you dont get consistent read on an emeter you are just warm youre not red hot when youre right on it it will read consistently and it will clear at once that the pc comes up with what it is that is on security check and if it is the chain on which the pc is totally plowed in on from one end of the track to the other it will just go on reading and reading and reading until its audited the rule is you have to audit the things that dont clear on question that is the rule general rule where it comes to auditing or where it comes to clearing rudiments you say to the pc something or other something or other and you get fall on the rudiments and you say well do you have withhold is this what thats falling on you withholding anything and the pc says the emeter goes clinkclank itll go falling on just about what its falling on on just exactly what its falling on and you start probing for this thing and all of sudden you say well is it something about your fall becomes steadier and more consistent and then the pc says well yes last night i told somebody you were bad auditor the fall disappears but the knucklehead then audits it having cleared the meter he now goes into what have you done what have you withheld you got the meter clear on rudiments why are you trying to do anything else the rule about rudiments is simply this rudiments are there not to run the case but they are there solely and only to set up the pc so that he can be audited and will stay insession definition of which is willing to talk to the auditor and interested in own case and that is what youre trying to get him to do and if the rudiments are too flagrantly out it wont happen but setting the meter on thirdofadial drop and going over the rudiments if you do not get wild or significant fall you just leave them alone you know with thirdofadial drop you cant see some of the meter reactions so you just blind yourself to that much meter reaction that is that meter reaction which you cannot see at thirdofadial drop will not get the pc out of session have you got that it will not take the pc out of session so advancing the sensitivity knob to point where you get sixteendial drop on can squeeze and then clearing the rudiments of every flick on that enormously expanded scale youre just wasting auditing because clearing them all up youre running the case with rudiments but if you clear rudiments on thirdofadial dropand mind you do that carefully when you set the meter with thirdofadial drop why you dont see any fall any theta hop or anything mind you therell be falls and theta hops are there but theyre obscured by the fact that youre reading from the still needle you follow you told the guy to squeeze the cans cans squeezed you got thirdofadial drop you just leave the sensitivity knob right there ask for the rudiments it doesnt move now little flick while you got it set at thirdofadial drop youd investigate if it did move it you would investigate it but usually little flick like this just blows up i mean do you have present time problem yes i have present time problem im worried about going out and putting in pound note into the parking meter or whatever the police are demanding these days well do you have to do that now well i dont have to do it for half an hour well would it be all right if at half an hour i remember it and send you down there yes thatll be fine drop disappears do you have withhold yeahno noooo you get fall get flick get theta hop ah you better find out what it is but thats on the sensitivity knob set at thirdofadial drop now if your sensitivity knob was set at 16 and you got the equivalent of you know the can squeeze drives the needle across and it bounces off the pin you know well thats actually probably set for about five or ten dials of drop on one can squeeze see now you ask him do you have withhold why hell you can even read his heart beating see itll register this closely are you withholding anything and 42 trillion years ago he shot down pilot in flames and was very careful not to let his own body drop or get burned up so he was withholding his own body you see so are you withholding anything yes youd get reaction on the needle but look that reaction is his case and it is not adequate to stop pc from going into session you got it the purpose of the rudiments 100 percent the purpose of the rudiments are only these to set up the case so that it can be audited the purpose of the rudiment is not this to run the case thats not the purpose of the rudiment there are numberless things i could tell you about rudiments but ordinarily in ordinary auditing it totally suffices to make sure you get all of the falling or observable arc breaks problems withholds off and objections to the room you see thats totally adequate they fall get them off with the sensitivity now set for third of dial oh well how about the emeter that cant be retreated on its sensitivity im afraid youve got rebuild coming there isnt anything you can do to the meter apparently i was experimenting with it last night but put new sensitivity rheostat in it that can be done rather cheaply hco will do it for you but after person gets about halfway clear can squeeze on old meters at zero old british meters is what it mainly is when the sensitivity knob is set way down all as low as it can be set you get dial drop and youre running somebody like that now what are you going to do now what are you going to do this rule longer is observable well what youre going to do is get new rheostat put in the emeter that can be turned down to thirdofadial drop okay simple huh and meanwhile before you do that if it falls on rudiment sigh and clean it up because youre not going to be sure whether it needs cleaning up or not so you have to use judgment as to whether or not it needs much cleaning up in the first place people who fall well on can squeeze they arent bothered as much as some other people by arc breaks unless theyre being audited by some auditor on whom they have lot of charge then theyll arc break but the usual cottonpicking arc breaks that dont amount to anything ah they dont really terribly disturb them the better off case gets the less its disturbed by the environment definition of clear is he can handle the environment and isnt disturbed by it so of course as you start progressing toward clear the can squeeze gives you greater and greater fall for the test and the nearer person gets to clear why the more drop you will see on can squeeze with the sensitivity knob set as it used to be originally the fellow comes in and you turn the sensitivity knob up to 16 you put the cans in his hands and he gives can squeeze and it falls thirtysecond of dial well this fellow is going to endure hes obviously built out of solid oak the same setting if you care to observe meter running sop goals supposing you did long and thorough assessment you wouldnt do thorough assessment on this guy you wouldnt do an assessment at all you would do joburg security check and then you would give him general run on the prehav scale and youd clear up some levels on the prehav scale just general you see and then when you got it so it was looking much better and the tone arm was reading much better and you knew you werent reading dead thetan and you did get little bit of drop on the can squeeze and so forth you could go ahead and assess him so you go ahead and you complete your assessment and youll notice suddenly that its sitting at fairly low sensitivity setting and the thirdofadial drop occurs very easily the case is much looser the needle is much looser you follow this female voice yes all right thats the way you handle rudiments and handle an emeter but mr emeter will tell you that you are close if its answering sporadically but if you re answering dead on youll have this interesting experience you are running joburg security check and you ask the level you ask the precise level have you ever raped anyone and the needle falls in response to that question that joburg security question falls something on the order of about quarter of dial and the pc says and it falls quarter of dial and you say to him well have you ever really raped anyone and it falls quarter of dial now listen you can go down the list of all the things he might possibly have raped or done sexually that might be considered rape or anything of the sort and if its not exactly on the exact same fall will continue on withhold youve got reversal of the rule the emeter falls in response to the question in this case it continues to fall if the question isnt asked so there are two phenomena in which youre involved here one is you have to ask the right question to get the fallthe exact right question to produce the consistent fall and the other one is to get rid of the fall you understand and that requires communication from the pc and in failure to communicate it wont go away dont think your meter is busted because you were asking this question and hours later he just never seemed to get through joburg security check he will always get the same fall always always always forever practically till the end of the world would he get the same question have you ever raped anyone you can ask him is it this lifetime and you get the fall did you rape somebody in this lifetime you get the fall did you rape somebody in your family you get the fall you understand he has raped somebody that is it you have asked the right question now having asked the right question you see is one part of this comment the only way youll get rid of the fall is for the thing to be answered so first theres the right question that produces the fall and the second phase of it is the answer that eradicates the fall and it must be surprise surprise the exact answer the precision instrument called the emeter depends then upon the exact question to get the response and the exact answer to clear it now do you follow now the individual who continues to fall on certain terminal is so involved in electrical masses exchanges energies and so forth in the mind that that terminal has to be audited only then do you get rid of it so it is not in that case just the one right answered its enough thousand right answers to clear it therefore when the preclear does not give you the exact answer to the auditing command every time you will continue to get it to read and auditing will continue to infinity you must get an answer for every auditing question and it must be the answer to the question you asked otherwise it continues to read on the meter well youre not fighting the meter the meter only indicates whats still banging in the fellows mind in other words preclear could be audited for ten thousand hours without ever answering the auditors question and still be reading the same way on an emeter how do you like that you got that so that case that hangs fire falls into just these categories present time problem is there consistently and forever this is what you call hidden standard sort of thing the guys got long duration present time problem and he knows when he will get better its when his hair stops standing up when he sees horse and he waits for this endlessly to start happening he tests out his auditing results he has an intensive and he goes and he finds horse and he very carefully puts his hand back here and he looks at the horse and if his hair doesnt stand up he says i got some progress and if his hair does stand up he says well that auditors bum you think im joking but that is true of every case that walks the street that is having rough time its by hidden standard so part of your goals assessment must always get out these hidden standards into view hidden standard is our technical term the pc will call them problems of long duration if theyre fairly sane but they also respond to things of difficulties in life word i commend to you as very useful are you having any difficulties in life now what difficulty would have to change for you to know that the auditing was working or more broadly what difficulty would you longer have if scientology worked on you what difficulty would have to happen in order for you to know that auditing was working you got that this is the hidden standard ill show you what happens when you dont address the hidden standard the individual very nicely goes through whole auditing session gets along just dandy through the auditing session gets along splendiferously seems to be making progress and at the end of session said i didnt make any part of my goals well maybe the goal that he gave you at the beginning of session was just to sit there throughout the session and you look at this in utter amazement he did sit there throughout the session he must have made his goal for the session but he tells you he didnt make any part of his goals well youre an utter knucklehead if you dont consult your emeter and say do you have any particular gains that you will have to make or establish in order to know that auditing is working and if so what would they be oh the fellow would say oh well yeah if you ask that yes as matter of fact yes yes i do have you see every time i look at horse my hair stands up on end and i feel right now actually that if i did look at horse my hair would still be standing up on end when i looked at the horse hes got every single auditing command you have given him circuited this way he audits women so that he will correct his relationship with horses he puts via on every command answer one man we found had actually for something on the order of five or six hundred hours at least of auditing he addressed every auditing command through this electronic engram in the firm and utter and complete belief that it would change him from being man to woman and what was the answer to this question what would have to happen in order for auditing to work this fellows answer was i would have to become woman now thats what youre going up against when you ask the pc are you making any progress and dont let catch any of you going out of here and auditing anybody after this up against bunch of hidden standards that are utterly unknown to you just dont let that happen because that is silly it means that the pc violates this emeter thing he is not giving an answer to the auditing command he is taking the auditing command fitting it to something else and then answering his impressions of course your needle doesnt clear not only does your needle doesnt clear your tone arm doesnt move the case does not progress the dead thetan reading at 20 never reads any place else than 20 your emeter characteristics dont change your needle does not get looser your sensitivity knob does not have to be set lower if your emeter isnt shifting during the course of auditing the first thing to suspect is that you yourself have got the wrong curve on this see theres something wrong youve goofed somehow you did prehav assessment said well the fellow is obviously resisting everything so the obvious level is resist and you just went on by knew it was barns and you went right on by and ran resist and the tone arm didnt change and nothing changed and wrong level bum assessment you get the idea bum assessment will give you that you arent asking the right questions or the individual has one of these hidden standards of long duration and so forth and he addresses everything around it pc will not improve if he has present time problem of long or short duration which is absorbing all of his attention he will not improve in auditing so you might as well take care of it and get it out of the way right now he will not improve if he has withholds poetically god elp him he will not not not not not not exclamation point improve if he has overts on his auditor he is not disclosing if he has overts on scientology hes not disclosing if he has overts on the principals of scientology for some reason not because we dreamed it up because it happens to be true i scouted this out the first time many many years ago about 1954 most of the returns were in for the people who had attacked dianetics there were about twentyone of them in the united states who had well lot of them had actually taken money to do us in and were still with us with the exception of seventeen who were either in jail or dead and as they made up primary death list for that particular time and primary difficulty list i looked for some common denominator amongst them to find out what this was all about and it was only one common denominator some of them had literally had in the period of four years hundreds and hundreds of hours of auditing in the case of joe winter over thousand hours im sure maybe even two thousand hours of auditing and the common denominator of all those people is theyd never made single case gain in all their auditing that was the first time this one showed up its grim and ghastly thing its builtin automatic protective mechanism in dianetics and scientology the fellow who accepts money or goes out of his way to injure auditors organizations the subject principals in it has just plain condemned himself to eternity thats all hes just condemned himself to an eternity of there he is going on down honest sometimes it makes gasp because ive gotten so much data on this by this time at the actual adventurousness of how some of these characters will swap couple of quick sixpences for the next two hundred trillion doesnt look to like good bargain now oddly enough strangely enough primary fault i have is honesty i will tell you what i know or what i think i know when i know it and if i find out it isnt true i will tell you it isnt true and if it happens to be discreditable along the line im afraid i will tell you along with that goes the necessity i would say better has gone the necessity to keep enough hope going to get the job rounded up that has been part of the responsibility to have not done so would have been an overt act now i frankly tell you i would not tell you that there was selfprotective mechanism in dianetics and scientology out of an anxiety to protect scientologists organizations and the principles of scientology and the people at the top of it i just wouldnt tell you that thats all in the first place i dont believe im so weak that i would need such mechanism to protect it or to protect you you see and for this other thing to be built up as an inside builtup completely arranged boobytrapped mechanism is always filling with little surprise i think if you listen to lot of tapes youll hear being surprised about this in other lectures its the darnedest thing i ever saw its just horrible its utterly horrible gracey zilch goes out and does in an auditor busts up his marriage and spoils his repute and for the next thousand hours of auditing gracey zilch is right where she is or worse and nobody seems to be able to do single thing for gracey zilch isnt that remarkable it is just fantastic now religious organizations have tried desperately to protect themselves with things like blasphemy and protect themselves with other youmustnots and thoushaltnots you know everybody talks about the ten commandments have you ever counted them in an actual original old testament there arent ten commandments columns of them thou shalt not eat pork that has been uncleanly raised or something of the sort thou shalt sell it to traveler instead what it amounts to is you cant look for help from quarter on which you have tremendous overts even though the help were given you matter how gratuitously it wouldnt be accepted by you because its always looked on as betrayal why is it looked on as betrayal because one has betrayed that help so of course when one is audited under these conditions he has this remarkable frame of mind that everything anybody is saying or doing to him is calculated to betray and destroy him so the more he is treated the worse he gets now that happens to be our little builtin selfprotective mechanism now because we are the only science of mind that has ever come up the line and sat back on its haunches and proved itself across the board we can also undo that if we want to take enough trouble we can also save gracey zilch one auditor sits on her head and the other straps the cans to her feet and third as shes being held down locates what she has been doing on an emeter you see something like joburg or something like this you see and actually gets the thing taped out and then finally says well gracey weve got the goods on you and now why dont you go off someplace and realize that if you dont do something decent about this youre sunk and i dont care it might take two hours two years or two lifetimes sooner or later shes going to come in and tell all fascinating huh we can undo it so in little tiny microscopic way not accepting half million dollars from the communist party of america to do in central organization that of course killed man i bet you right now hes tagging around in schoolroom someplace or another wondering what is wrong with him and why he feels so spinny fellow by the name of don purcell he died he did this and for three years he just went on toboggan and died one of the reasons was is nobody was interested enough to even try to do anything for him and the other thing was he had made it impossible to arrive at that data earlier by causing such tremendous disturbance that he slowed up research i felt like telling him one time i just sort of felt it in my bones i felt like telling him once or twice look maybe someday your wife is going to get sick or your kids are going to get sick or something is going to go really wrong in your existence and youre going to need us like mad you see and here you are doing nothing but getting us so upset and disturbed that we actually cant do very much in the way of research and youre slowing us down maybe someday we will know something that you really need to know desperately and sure enough it happened to work out of course there is this there is this i would say that it wasnt totally probably the overtwithhold mechanism i think suzies postulates had something to do with it because if she ever wanted to see man dead it was that man anyway lets get over to lets get over to some more about this emeter now do you see that if this on much more dramatic basis can exist your failure to find out your auditor has pardon your pc has been nattering about his auditor between sessions your failure to find this out while running rudiments is to throw away session do you see that because just as it isnt very terribly important so it isnt very hard to pick up but it is important enough to knock whole session out or maybe whole intensive out so when theyve got withholds in life in general which separates them from the human race and all livingness or in particular when they have withholds on the auditor auditors central organizations people in the central organizations you see there goes the case there goes the intensive there goes the session you want to do something for this guy this guy will give you failure why not because of anything that you did to him particularly but because he just goes around nattering about it when people are not clear if they know this perfectly they actually go around sort of holding themselves in frozen dont think anything bad dont think any bad thoughts you know and then when they get little bit better they relax and they think real vicious thoughts and then they give them up as withholds thats sort of revenge in itself and then later on if they happen to have done something that they found out the auditoryou know and realized suddenly that the auditor wouldnt like it or something like this why you ask him for it and they give it to you so overts are more difficult to clean up that is withholds overts which are withheld are more difficult to clean up the worse off case is its proportional they go down into not realizing what an overt is and they will go out and do some of the wildest things the psycho band will go out and do some of the most incredible things and not consider them overts at all they wont fall on meter so heres modification on your thirdofadial drop you set it for thirdofadial drop and run the rudiments but your thirdofadial drop only goes for those rudiments and the assessment which dont consist of getting off withholds so when you get that withhold reach over here crank up your sensitivity ask for the withhold and strip it good you see but if it is too active on withholds and its going bang bang bang bang and you dont clear it right away by asking what it is joburg security check you dont run anything further than the rudiments and that in other words run the rudiments and then enter into joburg security check by the way joburg security check is done in model session form its not done outside of model session form nothing is these days there isnt anything done outside of model session these days nothing so your rule about the sensitivity knob is that the only exception to thirdofadial drop and i tell you this very advisedly the only exception in running sop goals and its preparatory steps to the thirdofadialdrop setting is when you are after withholds and of course that includes at once the joburg security check and it includes the withholds in the rudiments you got it hm that makes it very easy doesnt it magnify your read when youre after withholds if youre not after withholds and youre just generally assessing thirdofadial drop if youre auditing and running thirdofadial drop if your meter insists on dropping more than thirdofadial drop get new sensitivity rheostat installed in it im afraid there is other answer i am going to be in very very hot communication with our manufacturers making sure that it can be cut down to where it would almost read in reverse on badoff case you know just read in reverse you know by the way its because you cant get your sensitivity up high enough that you get the reverse can squeezes that is the usual action it reads backwards did you ever see guy rise when you squeeze the cans well you just havent got enough sensitivity on it you can get the sensitivity up up and if the sensitivity cant be gotten up high enough he will still reverse get the sensitivity up high enough i think now i suppose youll get rid of that one all right now in assessing for goals assessment by elimination you of course then set the meter for thirdofadial drop why is this if it is set for more than thirdofadial drop you are auditing the case not assessing him you are auditing process known as erasing goals by repeater technique you see that itd be erasing goals by repeater technique and its not very good process isnt necessarily harmful as matter of fact itll benefit case but its very lengthy and it can go on for very long time now what youre trying to do in assessment by elimination is get them so they dont read with the meter set for thirdofadial fall once more if your meter cant be retarded far enough on the sensitivity knob why youll just have to get your meter fixed so it will because an assessment by elimination is not process by which you seek to reduce the goal to electronic reaction in the mind it is only this it seeks to null the goal so that it only does not act on an emeter which is set for thirdofadial drop you got it and it permits you then to get the goal which will fall and fall and continue to fall and go on and fall that has to be addressed by auditing the only thing youre trying to do is that now we have proved out this fact that if you erase all of persons goals the person still has goal which falls still one goal that falls if its erased you see thats valuable datum lets not lose it if you erased by repeater technique every goal the person came up with the person would still have one goal thats interesting isnt it all right you dont have to erase them all to have just one goal you have to null them on meter set with thirdofadial drop and if you do you will still have the goal the one goal you understand see its different it isnt actually erasing them it is actually erasing them as far as the meter is concerned you see you just take the edge off so they dont fall well thats it and it gives you fast assessment rapid assessment this is mainly in the interest of speed thats all its in the interest of i imagine if this were 1325 when people had great deal more time or something like this or on some planets like jupiter wed probably be trying to find out how could assessment take more time if the psychoanalists were doing this of course at sixty pounds the hour or something like that theyd try to figure out how to stretch the assessment well the way you stretch the assessment is very simple all you have to do is turn up your sensitivity knob to about 16 and every time the person comes up with goal or every time you ask for any more goals you of course get read see you go over the goal and with the thing set up very high why you say all right you wanted set of paper dolls and the thing falls quite well but if you turn the sensitivity knob down for thirdofadial drop youre reading from still needle and the impact in the mind on the subject of acquiring paper dolls is inadequate to move that from still needle so for your assessment purposes it is null you got it so you can go over in that wise you can go over literally dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of goals now part of the i mean in one session you get lots of them and you get down to the end and because your sensitivity set is low you say do you have any more goals well obviously for gods sakes if the person has any more goals realize that its limited question its limited in its application its not true question do you have any more goals well now look this person has been around for the trillennia every life they had several hundred goals well all right what are you going to do multiply five hundred times two hundred trillion and what is that thats your goals list all youre after is nofall at the end of the list with the sensitivity knob set for thirdofadial drop thats the only thing youre after you can go over the various kinds of goals you say got any childhood goals are there any more childhood goals are there any more withheld goals secret goals are there any more antisocial goals have you thought of anything that would have to happen for you to know that scientology worked are there any difficulties you havent mentioned to and look by the time you got all of those that i just gave you practically in order listed and you get down to the end of the list and you ask all those categories again and you get fall to your naked eye you see twitch and dont tell that if the needle rises you go on because thats getting to be very sore point keeps coming in over the lines and so forth the needle was rising so i had to continue to run the rudiments and somebody just today spotted that its because its in the trs the emeter tr has in it rise as reaction how many reactions there are to needle and rise is one of them and then you say if you run the rudiments and you get needle reaction you must flatten the rudiments and the auditor applies these two things just bing bing when we say reaction for the rudiments or reaction for an assessment we mean rock slam theta bop or fall in order of importance it is rock slam fall or theta hop theta hop is the least important fall is the most ordinary and if youre getting rock slams watch out because the whole bank is grouped remember the old dianetic grouper well the old dianetic grouper if wed had people on emeters in those days would always have registered as rock slam its just grouper in time and grouper in place and grouper in mass and grouper in this and that and so you get rock slam in passing just while im thinking about it i better tell you something about running rock slam if youre assessing and getting rock slams on the prehav scale for terminal lets say the goal rock slammed you know what rock slam is now its an irregular wobbly large or small shiver and shake across the thing theta hop is very regular one of any width but rock slam is shiver and shake and it dances around and its very jerky and its quite unmistakable once youve seen rock slam they are theyre quite weird when you see these things turn on you say what in the name of god is that these little tiny needle shivers that you see are probably microscopic rock slams i dont really think they are different read theres point of adjudication here do you just run the rock slams off do you assess it as long as you dont have rock slam and run it as long as you dont have rock slam assess it for the rock slam run it until you dont have the rock slam you could do that you know this is not hard and fast point because the rock slam is going to turn into fall its going to turn into theta hop its probably going to go null the liabilities of doing that is youve got rock slam left someplace else on your prehav scale theres matter of adjudication well have more data on this someday in the very near future but i would say knowing the nature of rock slam that if you just followed rock slam and ran the rock slam off so that you didnt get rock slam in twenty minutes or something like that the case might make better progress but well find out more about that thats not hard and fast rule at this time its just this when youre running rock slam remember youre running probably very short duration if you could hold rock slam with your tone arm so that the needle continued to sit solidly at set what would the tone arm be doing yeah itd be quite wild tone arm wouldnt it huh well that would be the one thing you cant read on tone arm you have to read it over on the needle because just because you cant do that with tone arm you see theoretically when i say process by the tone arm i mean keeping the needle somewhere in the vicinity of set and that gives you your tone arm motion well rock slam you cant keep the needle in the vicinity of set you see the tone arm would be slamming well certainly youre going to run tonearm slam you cant set meter for tonearm slam so thats what youd run flat you got the idea you could run the tonearm slam flat and if you assessed again youd find the rock slam has now gone elsewhere its matter of adjudication its matter to be proved out its matter to be settled but that is point and id better tell you what points really dont exist in clearcut silhouette relief now what do we get into here when we ask the wrong question on an emeter were asking the fellow for goals and its the wrong goal well therefore its the wrong question and you get sporadic read and the goal seems to peel off and disappear meter actually will react only as long as things are bunched up and as youre assessing for goals when you first grab ahold of the pc the goals are all in one terrific mauledup ball you see and so any goal is doing dance but as you repeat these goals with the thing set for thirdofadial fall the goal peels off the main mess it comes free and becomes itself and as you go over goals list over and over and later same way with terminals terminals list over and over youre going to find this is persistent and continuing manifestation that the wrong questions peel off and the right question remains so that is true of an emeter if you always knew the right question to ask you would always get the same fall but at the same time the assessment has therapeutic value something for you to remember if you just assess somebody maybe hes in lousy condition and really isn t ready for assessment and so forth if you just assess him and you do good job of assessment on him youre going to get an improved case and hes going to feel better about things an assessment cannot then be classified as something which must be done to set up an intensive similarly joburg security check if run well by the auditor with nice gunnedup sensitivity knob is terrifically therapeutic terrific and once more could not be considered something by which you set up case to audit it these things all fall within the perimeter of auditing because they are therapeutic they are beneficial they advance cases let tell you that just this one thing of joburg security check has advanced cases that have never before moved why did they never before move they were sitting there holding on to their cottonpicking withholds and their withholds were so heavy that they couldnt communicate to the auditor so they were never insession so auditing never worked so you cant call joburg security check then something that occurs outside of intensives or outside of auditing unless it is being used for purposes of security and then of course you dont do it in model session form youre just finding out whether this guy is safe to have around thats all and if the questions all clear up voila hes safe to have around providing you know how to do joburg security check thats the other little proviso that you must be awfully sure of some of you or maybe all of you will someday have the experience in scientology of you got new hgc admin or youve got clerk or something like that and youve taught them the thiss and thatas of things and youre too busy to give this new applicant security check yourself or everybody else is too busy and you cant turn him over to good auditor to do this security check and you say well you know the rudiments and you know how to do this so you just go ahead and give him security check and youre going to find out where my viewpoint sometimes is in total bafflement of how anybody can invent as many ways of doing something wrong and my viewpoint is very often on that total bafflement i know why it happens so that it doesnt continue to baffle very long and it doesnt upset but it is still something to marvel about if you were to take somebody and give them an hours instruction on the emeter show them about the needle and then turn over some raw meat off the street and tell them to give this person security check so youd know whether the person could be hired or not your usual response is not the person is all right the usual response is he couldnt possibly be hired if inept people were running emeters at all sides to do security checks for the purpose of employment you could guarantee this the whole world would at once be out of work various things happen but the category of them are utterly in the thousands and theres sense in going over the number of things they can do wrong except those things which are rather common errors or which can be used to clarify the right way then you can go over things that are wrong but otherwise if you list all the things that are wrong or could be done wrong with an emeter youd probably be up around ten fifteen thousand items its colossal for instance simple error like this the person theyre checking breathes this is rather strange and peculiar amongst the human race particularly people in london they know better but they breathe so every time they take breath the meter isnt set right probably and every time they take breath or deep breath or even if the meter is set right every time they sigh youre going to get fall and if the person were doing it they wouldnt even realize they had to repeat the question again or anything like that and they would be saying at that time have you ever embezzled the funds of an employer you see or some such thing and the person says hes getting kind of bored with this you know and he says aheww you know it falls and theyd write down embezzled funds of employer and go on to the next question now an idiocy of this character let tell you some more about this instrument an idiocy of this character is going on in the united states at this moment if it werent so sad and tragic one could laugh about it and you will laugh too you probably wont laugh so well until you yourself conduct this experiment and this is what is known as compartmenting questions and something you will have to know in doing goals assessments the compartmentation of questions the fellow turns in goal i would like to be fireman and crawl up ladders and rescue beautiful women thats the goal so you come to it on the goals list and by the way these goals are always put down in the fellows own words hell amend them but when he wants to amend them you amend them and add that amendment as new goal so you are reading along his goals list to him and you come down to this one you come down the list and youve covered now maybe seventyfive goals and twenty of them are still registering after brief repetitive read and youve gone on and the remainder the fiftyfive have sort of dropped out and youre just feeling fine you come to this one you want to be fireman and crawl up ladders and rescue beautiful women only you read it this way you want to be fireman crawl up ladders and rescue beautiful women and you get fall and you say it again you want to be fireman and crawl up ladders and rescue beautiful women fall you say well that one stays in give it slant mark that ones in you read it few more times you see but it looked like it was getting stronger read lets say it after you read it two or three times it was getting pretty it was getting tougher more reaction more fall more theta bop more rock slam more something so you just left it in and you said that was it and you went on to the next goal and the next time you come by this thing you read it and by george its still in and you go tell somebody you say you know what his goal is is to be fireman nuhuh the way you handle these category goals is you pull them apart and you go over them like this youve read the whole goal you see you do read that the whole goal couple three times thing continues to read now lets find out whats wrong with this thing you say you want to be fireman you want to be fireman you want to be fi thats the end of that thats the end of that read it just disappeared you say good to crawl up ladders you want to crawl up ladders crawl up ladders crawl up ladders thats the end of that one thats the end of that one rescue beautiful women rescue beautiful women rescue beautiful women ah thats what we were falling on you want to rescue beautiful women ah thats good thats good now because it fell apart otherwise lets be just little cleverer and lets say to rescue to rescue to rescue that disappears and what was he falling on beautiful women beautiful women beautiful women beautiful women as what healthy male wouldnt so this whole goal disintegrated except beautiful women now usually the pc will now volunteer yes id sure like to know some beautiful women you put that down as new goal got it thats getting rid of them by compartmentation got it now some real i wouldnt even dignify them by calling them knuckleheads wogs drifting around in various places have been let loose with an emeter over in the united states and theyve got it all figured out now that everybody has been pdhed and that everybody has pdhed everybody and theyre spreading it all over the place and telling everybody that everybody has been pdhed and they prove it this way they put the person on meter and they say have you ever been victim of pdh and the person says whats that well have you ever been victim of paindrughypnosis and you had nice fall wwahoohahooahoowahoowahoo here we go well who did it who did it who did it was it ron was it di diego was it dick halpern peter hemery do it all of sudden they say frank sullivan do it get big fall ah weve got pdh here by frank sullivan hohohoho well believe we might have teaching is not implanting but teaching on the whole track often came to implanting you never had time to teach somebody where all the leads were in tube room of spaceship and there were eight hundred thousand different leads and connectors to all the electronic equipment so you said zip with the needle and you turned on the super tape recorders and it went off at high whine and you played it over to them hard and after youd done it few times what do you know theyd be able to go up and hit lead this and lead that and theyd be so on and so on and fix up this and put it in that and actually there are people around whove gotten so used to being trained that way that we have today thing called dormaphone which by the way doesnt work on anybody who didnt ever teach anybody this way doesnt work learn the spanish language overnight well now if i know all about this why dont i sock some sodium pentathol in my arm or something of the sort or take couple of nembutol sleeping tablets and put pair of earphones on and turn on record that repeats how to speak the spanish language when i do this it happens right now because theres ship down at palmas ill have to repair using the spanish language that i picked up some linguaphone records and i happened to be listening to them wide awake im brushing up my spanish when i first listened to the records they were terrible blur i couldnt tell one word from another now its getting so that i actually can differentiate the difference between the alumno and the professor trouble with and spanish is i have enough overts against the spanish people that i have hard time hearing them thats true any young roman officer back in the old days had hard time this way anyhow i dont mean to restimulate anybody all right well why dont i use this type of education well i just never got used to it why dont we use this type of education in scientology well nobody it scientology is an education of reason not an education of location auditing is practice of understanding judgment and application it is not practice of locating and repairing bunch of leads you understand it isnt teaching some soldier the gun parts it leaves him with the initiative to handle weapons big difference there you see so all somnolent education is limited to the pat solutions or locations to the questions now if they were all pat solutions and everything was all pat in all directions it was mostly locational nomenclature and category and where found you can do it thetans have been doing it on the whole track forever i mean as long as weve had time this process has been going on but some people have become very specialized in doing only this and those people set up machine that furnish an implant for any given situation and will answer with name rank and serial number exact date time location situation and text five or six times over the last nine years there have been big fads going around with this and anybody who has used this as consistent and continual means of education nothing vicious about it theyve just used it as means and method of education thats all can set up machine thatll respond itll give an implant for any given situation but that is much rarer lets go back to how you use an emeter on this other thing and this will amuse you far more if ive stepped on any toes while ive been saying this i am very sorry but it is simply usually used for educational purposes you got new crew aboard the spaceship and not single cottonpicking one of them knows anything about space flight what is the best way to handle this crew you shove them underneath the proper speakers and you give them the proper drug and it all runs off at high roar and all of sudden you have totally educated spacecraft crew right now you could probably get visio of lying in nice bunk on spaceship and its got speaker over your head and its playing violin music that is very soft and soothing and at the same time giving you the regulations and identity and so forth which you exactly were supposed to occupy all of the duties regulations pertaining to these duties your relationship to other crew members everything that has to do with your job and finally you get lazy enough and you say well thats good thing and you get up out of there and say im the first mate as matter of fact you have society right here at the present moment which is going into this particular line so dont feel abusive about it because every time you even captained spaceship youve had something to do with this but im talking about somebody who has made good specialty out of it whos figured them out who has used it consistently and continually or who has practically never done anything else along whole and enormous stretches of track those people will develop an identity which gives implants theyll implant themselves they can come up with an implant for any given situation that is rarer that is rarer but it is not rarer than 5 percent of the human race well you wouldnt call that terribly rare then youd just say its bit scarce and almost anybody could be restimulated with auditing up to point of where theyd produce some kind of reaction on this thing almost anybody but lets take the compartmented question and look this thing over have you ever been victim of paindrughypnosis fall who did it to you frank sullivan fall thats our proof thats all youd have to do isnt it now actually itd clear up and get kind of mucky and its awfully hard to read and if you really dont know an emeter very well you dont notice the sporadic falls that you get on this repeated question have you ever been victim of paindrughypnosis who gave it to you frank sullivan did frank sullivan give you this if youre not used to an emeter you dont notice that the thing reads kind of weirdly if youve got hold of an individual seeing the meter or something of the sort whos got good machine on this particular basis itll date it itll make it all reasonable and logical and set the whole thing up where do you get an engram bank from huh actually you yourself are making the engram bank but you wouldnt have to erase it if it wasnt being made on via if it was being made directly and created directly by you itd just blow blow blow blow blow youd never have to erase an engram would you factually its produced by machine there are machines that produce pictures the thetan has got them theyre invisible hes got them stuffed away under his left armpit or something of the sort and they produce these pictures and its machine all right all you have to do is specialize that machine little bit and itll produce pdh at will i could take one such person and actually get pdhs until it became foolish to the person see and one of the cures of it is to date other people and other pdhs until we find out that their mother and father both pdhed them and everybody else has pdhed them all the way up the line you could rework this machine until you made the machine practically go goofy giving you new pdhs you got it in other words it dubs in pdh thats all and thats dubin just as such whereas the person is actually giving you perfectly valid engrams when it comes to this particular type of engram its dub you got the idea do you know that lot of young girls walking around right now you say well get mental image picture of your father and they get hairy ape or they get something else see in other words they got machine thatll dub in fathers well so there are machines thatll dub in pdhs but that isnt really what im talking to you about because thats more advanced curiosa and that isnt really what im talking about at this particular time the advanced curiosas im talking about emeters and this single question have you ever been victim of paindrughypnosis who did it frank sullivan listen if youre an auditor and you know your business you know theres such thing as ow and you know this that an emeter reacts to the auditors questions and any question that is near the truth of anything will cause reaction on the machine and it is up to you to get consistent read you have to ask the smarter question you have to ask the varied question to polish that read up and all of sudden its reading like mad and you know exactly what its reading on and everything else that it might have been reading on disappears all right victim how many people do you think will get reaction on the word victim how many people do you think will get reaction on the word pain how many people will get reaction on the word drugs how many people will get reaction on the word hypnosis or hypnotism or hypnotists and if theyve had few overts or if theyve read some of his literature how many people do you think would get reaction on frank sullivan all question proves when it reacts on an emeter is that it or some part of it has charge on it or the question is near some question which will have charge on it got the idea now by varying your question you can smooth out the reads and as you become used to the instrument youll notice that it reacts sporadically and occasionally on something well you just shape your questions around and change it around until you get it consistent consistent consistent always the same read always the same read you can only keep it reading the same however if you practically muzzle the pc the second he starts imparting information the read blows up because if he answers the right auditing question the read blows up but of course because he answered it and the read blew up entirely you also know what you were asking dont you see you know what was right so with the pc totally gagged you could by questioning pc not permitted to talk actually with gag on and you have to gag pc if you want to carry this thing out to its extremities its good drill and they get too interested my favorite mechanism for newspaper reporters these days by the way is to find an automobile accident theyve been in they evidently theyve all been in automobile accidents where the accident occurred who was hurt in the accident where they were hurt in the accident and find out the whole lot such as the make of the car and all this sort of thing without letting the reporter say word to and man does it make citizens out of them the somatics turn on and everything turns on and they say well how did you know but actually you cant get much further than them being hurt or someone in the car being hurt than they all of sudden start going off like small firecrackers you know and they say well yes well how did you know that well you havent actually had chance to prove that you were total wizard theyre now convinced of it see how did you prove that well what do you know yes as matter of fact it was an old rollsroyce and it went off the edge of cliff down in devonshire and uhuhthats right there were other people in the car all right girls they were and uh so forth and i i didnt ever realize this before but i must have gotten jammed under the dashboard you know ive got terrible pain here uh yeah and i must have been jammed under the dashboard i never realized that before you know and they go limping out of course such thing dies out in the course of about three days but they dont go back to the office and write that story that the editor told them to write to clobber scientology mostly because they cant now sit down comfortably it restimulates them this is very effective way of handling reporters by the way its its real convincer similarly this other drill is marvelous convincer to somebody who believes he has been pdhed have you ever been victim of paindrughypnosis well now just as you would in goals compartmentation you say the word victim you ever been victim you ever been well he says ahhahayeahhaha ive been victim yeah well thats the end of that read how do you feel about pain oh i dont want anything to do with pain read read read read read and they say i dont want anything to do with pain im having an awful lot of trouble and during my early youth i was in agony most of the time they had my teeth in braces and so forth and that one drops out and then say well how do you feel about drugs oh god eheptuh every time you see medico they never treat anything they just shoot you full of drugs and you stagger around and if theyd only have gone away in the first place or you never called them why you probably could have died peaceably or gotten well or something of the sort yeah i dont care much for drugs thats gone all right hypnotism you ever been hypnotized there wasnt any change on it in the first place and its dead now say the question have you ever been victim of paindrughypnosis the needle is needle is totally motionless now you say frank sullivan and it falls you say have you ever had any overts on frank sullivan you ever thought any unkind thoughts and they say well who wouldnt yes yes yes i have because as matter of fact frank sullivan has been talking about being pdhed from the 1st acc he was telling all about pdhs and he goes around and talks to people about pdhs and upsets people and they dont like to get their own pdhs terribly restimulated only hes so convincing about it but his message is you have been pdhed you have been the reason you are being selfdetermined right this minute is because you have been pdhed so with this kind of thing of course guy gets unkind thoughts he says this guy is nuts you know although he might continue to be pleasant and the person says yes ive got lots of overts in that line ive thought lot of unkind thoughts in that particular line and you say well how do you feel about frank sullivan you get motion to amount to anything on the needle youve kind of blown it now you say well has frank sullivan ever pdhed you now youll get another surge well have you ever thought anything bad about sullivan going around telling everybody that youve been pdhed well yes i have well has frank sullivan pdhed you and thats now null now you say to the person now you say to the person have you ever been victim of paindrughypnotism null have you ever been given paindrughypnotic implant by frank sullivan and its null what was it falling on it was falling on connected restimulators and as soon as you blew off and the pc actually answered directly what you were talking about now supposing he had been pdhed and he told you an awful lot of stuff well yes and he answered all these things yes ive been worried about those things and that sort of thing and the fall cancelled off on all of them and you said well have you ever been pdhed by frank sullivan and you got hell of fall you know youd never be able to clear that fall never be able to clear that fall at all if the person had recollection of ever having been pdhed by frank sullivan if he had been it would continue to fall that would be that now this becomes case for auditing how do you audit it you put frank sullivan on the general prehav scale and you simply run him flat you assess him for level just as you would an sop goals terminal you find out where that level it falls you put together an auditing command on frank sullivan and you just run that out and then when that tone arm stops moving as it very well might after about four or five waggles see it might only be few dozen commands see you find your new level and you flatten that and you find your new level and flatten that and all of sudden you cant get any reaction of any kind either on being pdhed or anything else it will have blown that is the magic of the prehav scale marital scientology just going from the ridiculous to the sublime as i said before this thing about pdh would be amusing if it werent so kind of sad its kind of knuckleheaded you know its kind of terrible thinking of some people running around madly trying to tell everybody and convince everybody that they have been pdhed because theyre simply dramatizing their own overts whether now in this life or on the backtrack and they are worried about them dont you see and when theyve got to sell bill of goods of this particular character and make it their life work they might as well be writing out confession and putting it in the hands of every scientologist they talk to the guy says ive been pdhed ive been pdhed ive been pdhed and yap yap yap and youve got to believe and all this sort of thing if hes making this hes not telling an auditor this hes not going and getting auditing hes just telling everybody this hes all the same as writing out confessions and signing them and putting them in scientologists hands i have pdhed the living christ out of people for ages you see im pro thats what hes doing thats what hes doing well thats all right but people who have done pdhs ordinarily on the whole track in the best of thought that was the best possible thing to do at the particular place and time so as result if theyve got machine that will produce pdhs so what itll all come out in running sop goals why worry about it furthermore if some guy did pdh somebody lets say lets say that sullivan did go ahead and hold down somebody and slap him and cuff him and put him under drugs and shock him and put in hypnotic commands and run some patched together tape to him that told him to go and take hca courses that wouldnt be bad implant by the way and if he did this ah look look look nothing can happen to you in one lifetime not even pdh ofnot even an electric shock from psychiatrist and so forth that you cant handle now all you got to do is find out locate the fellow who did it and run him on the prehav scale and flatten the various levels and thats the end of the pdh interesting huh or just in the course of running sop goals clear the guy and itll blow off its nothing to worry about and im sure that smart scientologist now that weve got clearing going and weve got cases running so well would waste his time pdhing anybody look at all that hard effort that would just blow off in short auditing session were actually getting faster today than they can be laid in used to be that we took them out much more slowly than you know an engram in general was erased much more slowly than it was laid in well you look at the number of engrams just count the number of engrams that must blow in the process of clearing person and it is some binarydigit factor the factor you could start at up on this wall here and write 1 and then column after column after column the whole length of that wall and so forth clear down to the bottom of it and you would not have stated number large enough to give the person the number of engrams that hed have that number would not be large enough and when you can take and blow this up in the course of ah at the outside couple of hundred hours of auditing holy cats how many engrams is that per minute of auditing of actual effective auditing its some fantastic number it must be billions and billions of engrams in fact so who would waste their time but once more going from the ridiculous to the sublime what im about to give you is the birth of marital scientology not really its birth but its grown up and got some pants and skirts on it we had marital scientology the day we had the husband and wife sit down across from each other with an auditor auditing both of them and getting off their overts and withholds against each other that did an enormous amount to patch up marriages and actually could be considered its birth now you can put pants and skirts on marital scientology and some auditor setting himself up this way could do absolute marvelous things all you do is take the husband by name and run him on the prehav scale take the wife by name and run her on the prehav scale and thats the end of the difficulties of that marriage of course if the fellow doesnt want to be married thats his idea and he doesnt have to be run this way at the same time if he wanted to get unmarried this would also be the smoothest way to get him unmarried got the idea either way either way but it would certainly patch up the marriage you got the idea itd take the difficulties off the lineup because in the course of running it would run the ows off and what do you know its such tiny tiny tiny short track what is it theyve been married for ten years wow ten years against two hundred trillion doesnt sound like much so its track and what youre doing is instead of getting these little tiny two and half horsepower outboard motors and attaching them to the queen mary that used to be auditing see and these little tiny outboard motors are running mad and heating their bearings and so forth to push the queen mary instead of doing that now we have tenthousand horse mercedes benz pushing rowboat one of the precautions we have to take is it doesnt crush the rowboat the precaution we take is do technically perfect job of auditing and keep your rudiments cleaned up the way ive been talking to you about all right how long do you think itd take to clear up that much track on couple damn short period of time with little experience and knowing your business you could absolutely guarantee to set up somebody as far as this is concerned you could absolutely guarantee youd say leadpipe cinch what would you do youd take the husbands name or the wifes name or something like that now you could assess this out one way or the other but now youd be getting into another project all were going to do is nonassess on the terminal beyond just the identity of the terminal you got the idea see this is the light brushoff husbands name is joe thompson all right we just take joe thompson and we assess joe thompson up on the prehav scale and down on the prehav scale and going up and down the level failed endure knocked both times we make up an auditing command about the failed endurance of joe thompson and our pcs relationship to him it may flatten in ten commands it may flatten in ten or twenty commands but as soon as the motion goes out of the tone arm reassess and then take the motion out of that tone arm and then reassess it on the prehav scale were not talking about very much auditing are we of course the case has got to be in the kind of shape where they will talk to the auditor and interested in their own case before you do that you can do that too you can run them general prehav scale and make them do joburg security check and theyll be talking to you you know doing joburg security check is not an overt some people will look on it as such its about the nicest thing you can do to anybody all youre giving him is his life now lets take little brief summary of this mr emeter is precision instrument mr auditor is sometimes imprecise mr emeter registers on anything the pc hears the auditor sometimes doesnt adjudicate what the pc has heard the emeter clears on everything the pc answers absolutely right and it remains muddled on everything the pc doesnt answer absolutely right its as clear as that the emeter is precision instrument but auditors and preclears are prone to error now you in your study of cases and emeters and so forth have certain drills which you must undertake even though they seem to be silly drills they may seem to be silly but i want you here to make sure that you do these all right end of lecture
