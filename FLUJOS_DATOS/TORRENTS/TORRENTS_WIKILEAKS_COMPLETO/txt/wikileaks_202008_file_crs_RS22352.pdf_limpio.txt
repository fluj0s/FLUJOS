paymen t was about 5 of the outstanding balance by 2000 it was around 23 the decline in minimum payment requirements is usually attributed to competitive pressures in the credit card industry thousands of depository financial institutions offer bank cards to consumers downward trend in credit card interest rates aggr essive marketing efforts by mail phone and internet and product innovations such as th elimination of annual fees and creative balance transfer offers have made it easier for consumers both to obtain credit cards and switch among issuers lower minimums reward progra ms and enhanced customer service are examples of practices used by card issuers to maintain customer loyalty easing minimum payment requirements can also be viewed as technique similar to new penalty fee structures and shortened grace periods employ ed to maintain portf olio profitability by preserving outstanding balances consumer advocates have long been concerned about the growth in credit card debt revolving consumer credit outstanding which is made up primarily of credit card debt totaled 2386 billion at year end 1990 by year end 2000 the total had grown to 6785 billion from 2000 to 2007 consumer revolving debt increased an additional 260 billion plus rising to 9418 billion4 consumer advocates argue that the aggressive marketing campaigns launched by credit card issuers in the 1990s contributed to an increased dependence on consumer credit in this vi ew too many households are holding level of debt that could easily cause major financial difficulties if the family experienced an unexpected occurrence such as an illness or job loss low minimum payment requirements can encourage cons umers to take on more debt and consistently paying the minimum greatly extends the time and cost of paying off that debt policy issues and actions recently both congress and the federal regulators of depository financial institutions have questioned how well c onsumers

four federal regulators of depository financial institutions6 jointly issued interagency guidance on credit card lending7 the guidelines stated that recent examinations of financia l institutions by the regulators found credit card account management practices that raised safe ty and soundness concerns the guidelines described the concerns and the corrective ch anges for practices deemed inadequate or imprudent the guidelines also recognized that the time required to implement changes could vary among individual credit card issuing institutions section of the january 2003 guidelines dealt with minimum pa yment requirements the agencies recognized pattern of genera l easing of these requirements in recent years noting that new formulas can have the effect of delaying principal pa yment of particular concern were accounts experiencing nega tive amortization situation where the monthly minimum payments consistently fall short of even covering all of the finance charges and fees and that therefore the out standing balance continues to grow the situation can be exacerbated by programmatic recurring overlimit fees and other charges the regulators view these fees as inappropria if they are primarily intended to increase recorded income for the lender rather th an as tool to enhance the borrowers cardholder performance or their access to cr edit liberal repayment programs can
