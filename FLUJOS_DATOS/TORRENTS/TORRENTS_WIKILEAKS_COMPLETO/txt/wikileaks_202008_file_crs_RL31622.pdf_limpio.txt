group of non participants credits earned increased by 125 and retention increased by 7 percentage points the small size of these effects was attributed to the fact that at such an early stage of the evaluation most students had only modest amount of services provided importantly the third year report indicates that students who were more disadvantaged tended to experience greater positive effects as result of greater sss participation that is these students tended to have greater amount of services provided and consequently showed more benefits from program participation the sixyear evaluation

participants drop out of the program before completing high schoolresulting in an average length of exposure of 19 months conversely the study found that ub has large positive impact on the subgroup of students with low income lower educational expectations and serious academic problems this positive impact was manifested in variety of educational outcomesmost notably high school completion rates

other hea programs adequately promote this objective will be central issue during the reauthorization process this section addresses several prominent aspects of trio and gear up as they pertain to access and other issues and discusses relevant legislation that has been introduced to date g5g152g152g155g141g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561 as the number of trio programs has grown and gear up was enacted debate has developed around issues of program coordination and consolidation the focus of this debate can be framed by the following two questions 1 to what extent do the similar objectives of the various programs produce overlap and duplication of effo rt and 2 to what extent do the distinct activities of these programs produce disjointed set of services that should be coordinated to support students at all points in their academic career as has been described gear up seeks to addr ess the problems of high school completion and college access for disadvantaged students through holistic approach should this approach be replicated through the array of trio programs arguably one of the strengths of gear up is that it sticks with the same cohort of students from start to finish trio might be criticized for the way in which the various programs lack coordination and therefore followup for students at risk of terminating their education at any point on the other hand focusing on single cohort limits the ability of these programs to adequately and individually serve large numbers of students moreover providing services to group of students who enter seventh grade at particular school in one particular year and not providing the same services to those entering seventh grade at the same school in the following year may raise concerns about fairness and efficiency although there is some evidence that some gear up programs back fill by taking in students in subsequent cohorts there is requirement to do so trio advocates like the council for opportunity in education coe push for two steps in program coordination 1 ts should be refocused to serve only high school students and gear up should be refocused to serve middle school students and 2 gear up be consolidated as one of the trio programs 11 coe argues that this would eliminate duplication between the two programs because under the current structure they serve similar populations and have similar objectives 11 council for opportunity in education policy options regarding trio for th upcoming reauthorization of the higher education act of 1965 january 22 2002

program continuity could be improved by better ensuring continuity from grant to grant by placing greater weight on prior experience extending the length of grants and adjusting minimum grant amounts for inflation and cost increases g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 several funding issues are likely to be raised during the reauthorization process three general areas of concern are the overall funding authorization the mechanisms for awarding and distributing grants and the aid offered to students in recent hearing held by the house committee on education and the workforce panelist suggested that trio and gear up funding amounts be determined as formulabased proportion of federal student aid appropriations 12 pegging trio and gear up funding to federal aid would help ensure that low income students nonfinancial issues are addressed to the same degree as their financial needs but in fact in the last decade trio appropriations have remained relatively stable percentage 73 of appropriations for federal needbased grants ie pell grants and supplemental educational opportunity grants the importance of prior experience as factor in the trio grant award process has long been matter of disagreement some feel that past success in winning grants should positively influence the likelihood of continued awards because it provides for the kind of continuity discussed in the previous section others assert that given the limited number of grants relative to the vast number of students in need of services competitions should be more open to those without prior experience further disagreement exists over other priorities expressed in the funding mechanismmost notably whether preference should be given to certain racialethnic groups or geographic areas trio offers little in the way of direct monetary aid to students and some assert that the stipends offered are inadequate coe argues that ub stipends be increased to 60 per month during the school year and 100 per month during the summer coe also advocates for raising the maximum allowable stipend for summer research under mpa gear up scholarships offer much more substantial funds for students who attend college however financial aid administrators object to statutory language requiring that these scholarships supplement not supplant regular needbased aid 13 in recent regulations ed specified conditions under which colleges and universities may be exempt from this requirement14 stipend amounts and regulations aside these concerns raise larger question about the intent of these programs namely should the financial aid component of these programs be expanded thereby linking aid to broader program of college preparation or should the financial aspect of access to postsecondary education remain the purview of traditional sources of monetary assistance 12 testimony of lawrence gladieux an independent education and public policy consultant to the house committee on education

provided by these programs have come under attack in recent years the counseling services component of upward bound is good example15 those in the current administration focused on program performance as defined by specific outcome measures see these services as ineffective16 since one of the goals of ub is to improve college completion rates among firstgeneration and lowincome students the preliminary impact program evaluation results referred to earlier may be viewed as damaging at the same time others argue that nonacademic services such as those that improve self esteem have been part of trio programs since their inception and go to the heart of their intended purpose in this light the evaluation re sult that ub encourages wouldbe twoyear students to attend fouryear schools is notable accomplishment nonetheless reauthorization debate over the academic and nonacademic priorities of the trio and gear up programs seems likely one possible outcome might be to narrow the large array of services currently allowable g7g159g138g149g158g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 in response to the administrations negative interpretation of the ub evaluation trio advocates also caution against drawing premature conclusions about college completion from an unfinished longitudinal study while the preliminary results from the evaluation of sss are more positive the lack of recent evaluations of other trio programs may itself become reauthorization issue g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g156g561 through the 1992 amendments institutions or agencies were permitted to submit more than one trio application if the additional applications describe programs serving different populations or campuses 17 some assert that subsequent ed regulations defined different populations and different campuses too narrowly and thereby undermined congressional intent to provide services to disadvantaged students another problem with trio eligibility arises from the definition of lowincome individual in section 402a current language stipulates that such an individual come from family whose taxable income for the preceding year did not exceed 150 percent of an amount equal to the poverty level coe argues that this unfairly excludes students who would be classified as low income based on current income but not on the previous years income their proposed solution to this problem is to give trio directors the discretion to consider eligibility and documentation on casebycase basis similar to the discretion provided financial aid administrators however the evaluation results discussed above indicate that loosening of the definition of low income students may weaken program outcomes the preliminary findings from the ub and sss evaluations suggest that these programs have the greatest impact on those most disadvantaged that is students with lower income greater academic problems and lower educational 15 richard morgan upward bounds slippery slope chronicle of higher
