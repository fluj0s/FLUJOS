provision applie s only to products lia bility actions or to other tort actions as well product seller liability under state law the manufacturer and any seller in the chain of distribution may be held strictly liable liable even in the absence of negligence for injuries and deaths caused by product defect that was present at the time of manufacture the potential harshness of this rule as applied to innocent sellers is mitigated by the fact that seller who was subsequent to the ma nufacturer in the chain of distribution and who is held liable for an injury caused by defect that existed at the time of manufacture may recover from previous seller of the produc t so that ultimately the manufacturer if it still exists and is solvent will be the only liable party nevertheless even if they can recover i nnocent sellers would prefer not to be sued in the first place and some states have accommodated them in the list below strict liability means that the state follows the traditional rule that the seller may be held liable to the same extent as the manufacturer strict liability means that the seller may be held liable only for its own negligence or breach of warranty with
