role in the contemporary operational environment for exam ple interdicting insurgent activity as well as complementing other security measures in c oin operations section b to afm vol 1 pt 9 covers the general techniques and procedures for establishing and conducting roadblocks and checkpoints 2 the use of cr2 in vcps is not an activity that is routinely pr actised the vehicle size attracts attention and t he l94 chain gun cg and l30 main armament ma are not optimised for accurate clos engagements under 200m and 400m respectively without the risk to friendly forces andor non combatants oper ating in the near vicinity the use of the l30 ma is not considered suitable for the i mmediate vcp area therefore the gunners primary sight gps and comm anders primary sight cps should only be used for observation an l94 cg 200m line must be established by vehicle commanders and identified by gunners on immediat set up of the vcp for fire control measures although targets under 200m can be engaged1 gunners and commanders mu st be aware of the effects of gun sight offset and the associated l94 characterist ics of dispersion and rapid rate of fire2 in addition the limited manpower in tank troop makes the protection of dismounts difficult therefore if cr2 troops are required for vcp oper ations they should only be used in an emergency situation snap vcp or as part of planned deliberate operation using at least half sqn the inclusion of additi onal dismounts should be considered at the ear liest opportunity snap vcp 3 fig 1 page 5 illustrates how snap vcp is configured using cr2 troop to form chicane to provide cover to the controller and searcher use of dismounts for close protection and cutoffs forward of the check point to deter suicide bombers and to assist in traffic

environment half squadron operation may be required to mount single vcp in order to achieve the necessary force protection levels the follo wing tasks will need resourcing 1 the l94 chain gun can be fired with relative accuracy using the fire control system from 200m to 1100m ranges below 200m will cause the fire control system to default to 400m and reduce the accuracy of the first burst g10221

cr2 tp and crew should be used in consideration with t he capabilities weapon ranges and characteristics of those weapons systems 9 tank is used to give local protection to the dismounts using the best combination of the l37 l94 chain gun at minimum distanc of 200m from the vcp only and sa80k as bare minimum there should be 2 personnel on the ground one to stop and search and one to cover if there is requirement fo r 2 personnel to be used as searchers the loaderoperator should man the l37 and have his sa80k to han d in the event that stoppage occurs on the l37 th gunner should use his weapo n system for observation activities drivers should also ensure that when dismounted their hatc hes are closed each vehicle is also to be used by the dismounts fo r immediate blast and small arms

must have communications with his vehicl crew to ensure two way flow of information troop net should be set up to allo w all vehicles to be all informed using the personal role radio4 11 hand signals must be considered in the event of communications failure 12 the use of cr2 in vcps is not norma l task for cr2 troops therefore it is essential that time in the orders process and battle preparation is given to rehearsals for vcps rehearsals should be considered key activity to ensure success of the vcp operation vcp training must be c onducted during predeployment training 13 vcps should only last for maximum of 20 25 minutes before collapsing and moving on regardless of threat additional equipment 14 consideration should be given to the use of additional equip ment not normally provided to cr2 troops such as caltrops barbed wire etc when undertaking vcps as part of deliberate operation considerations 15 considerations for t he use of cr2 in vcps the use of cr2 1 to form chicanes

ssm sqms staff if possible the use of inf antry soldiers should be considered to carry out the stop and search process allowing the cr2 troop to give cover and overwatch 4 where possible an

collapsing the vcp to move to another area d ecm the use of ecm must be consider ed in the planning stage of any vcp operation in theatre ttps will dict ate the type of ecm coverage required rules of
