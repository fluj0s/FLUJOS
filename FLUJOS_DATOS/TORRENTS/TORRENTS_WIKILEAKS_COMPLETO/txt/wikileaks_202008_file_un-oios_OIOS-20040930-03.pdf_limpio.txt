concentrated on the activities implemented by the malawi red cross soci ety mrcs expenditure of us 340000 the jesuit refugee service jrs expendi ture of us 206000 and the department of disaster preparedness relief and rehabilitation ddpr expenditure of us 267000 we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 600000 2 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th office of the chief of mission in lilongwe with administrative budgets totalling us 294000 for the years 2002 and 2003 and assets as recorded on headquarters assettrak with an acquisition value of us 663000 and current value of us 13000 the number of staf f working for the unhcr operation in malawi was 11 this included staff on regular posts staff on temporary assistance and united nations

records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 9 for the three partners reviewed reasonable assurance could only be taken that unhcr funds provided to ddpr were properly accounte d for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements 10 audit certificates for 2002 were received from all partners with the exception of mrcs for jrs their international global audit cer tificate covering unhcr projects was available and an unqualified opinion was expressed government audit certificate was also available for ddpr however qualified opinion was expressed due to budgetary overruns and ineligible expenditure charged to the subproje ct ocm explained that they had followed up with mrcs on the submission of the audit certifi cate but it had not yet been received recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission should eng age an audit firm directly to ensure audit certificates ar obtained for subprojects 02abmlwcm201b and 03abmlwcm201b implemented by the malawi red c ross society rec01 malawi red cross society 11 mrcs had not implemented an accounting sys tem for unhcr projects and all that was available was list of payments there was analysis or details of the expenditure incurred against the budgetary provision and from the documentation available it was not clear on what basis the spmrs were prepared and the refore they could not be relied upon also from the payment vouchers presented to suppor t the expenditures it was not always evident that it was unhcr expenditure given the fa ct that mrcs had over 15 other donors oios could not exclude that some of the payment vou chers may have related to other donors 12 due to lack of proper budgetary monito ring system there were numerous budgetary overruns ranging from 40 per cent to ove r 200 per cent internal controls were found to be deficient with cheques issued without due regard of the available bank balances this resulted in several of the cheques bouncing nd subsequent bank charges 3 13 ocm explained that they had frequently drawn to the attention of mrcs the lack of an appropriate accounting system which caused phazard way of posting expenditures workshop on programme management was organized to ddress implementing partners lack of adherence to accounting and reporting stand ards ocm stated that they would again impress upon mrcs to design proper accounting sys tem 14 oios found that mrcs had loaned unhcr fu nds for use in other donorfinanced projects however they did not have an accounting mechanism to track the loans or their subsequent reimbursement moreover some of the l oans had not been recorded as such but instead charged as expenditure in the final spmr due to the total lack of reliable accounting system to track such transactions oios could not exclude that some of the loans had not been properly accounted for ocm explained that they had more than once queried mrcs about expenditures that did not relate to unhc r activities and had informed them to discontinue such practice 15 further under the budget line for income generating activities mrcs loaned total of us 21000 to the refugees loan recovery sys tem was established and from the records maintained by mrcs there was not evidence that the amounts had been recovered according to mrcs the reimbursement rate of the ans was very low less than one per cent as most refugees assumed that the loans were actually grants ocm explained that due to the lack loan recovery system the incomegene rating sector was taken away from mrcs and given to new partner already successful ly administering similar programme in mozambique recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission lilongwe should prior to entering into any new subproject agreemen t with the malawi red cross society mrcs assess whether mrcs has implemented an acceptable accounting system which meets unhcrs financial reporting and budget monitoring r equirements rec02 b jesuit refugee service 16 oios found that jrs had not correctly repo rted the expenditures in the final spmr and we found that each budget line item had either been overstated or understated thus the final spmrs could not be reconciled to jrs summary records according to jrs the discrepancies resulted from their calculations of t he summary expenditure which were made manually rather than using the accounting software jrs informed oios that their international accounting system could not produce s ummary accounts according to unhcr budget coding structure given the unreliability of the financial records oios recommended that revised final spmr be submitted for subproj ect 03abmlwcm201 correctly reflecting the actual expenditure action is being taken to obtain this information nd revised spmr will be submitted 17 oios assessed jrs internal controls as ficient with the same individual involved in the entire expenditure cycle the director assum ed most of the financial management functions with certifying authorizing and approvi ng responsibilities he also assumed many 4 of the accounting functions of accountant was the petty cash custodian and was the sole bank signatory ocm stated that jrs has hired an assistant accounta nt and that the jrs director would be asked to be involved in financial matters only in an advisorysupervisory role recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission lilongwe should obtain from jesuit refugee services revised final spmr for sub project 03abmlwcm201 which reflects the ac tual expenditure incurred rec03 b supply management procurement 18 the unhcr procurement procedures were gene rally complied with albeit the filing system required some improvement oios found vario us instances of procurement totalling some us 90000 for which there was evidence th at proper competitive bidding procedures had been applied ocm has now retrieved and submitted the missing documentation 19 in 2003 ocm spent over us 40000 on trav of which some us 25000 was paid to the current travel agent this companys service s had been used for several years there was evidence that the agent was selected competi tively biding despite the availability of several other travel agents in one instance oios noted that return air ticket to european city was purchased at some us 5000 while other tr avel agents would charge less than half of that amount ocm explained that the travel agent was also used b most of the agencies but they indicated that the market would be revisited to draw the most economical fares b asset management 20 oios found that the assettrak system was n ot operational and that the data available at unhcr headquarters was considerably out of date in addition physical inventory had been carried out for number of years and most of the assets were not barcoded including those in the custody of implementing partners acco rding to ocm the assettrak software was removed from computer that was transferred to an implementing partner and was never reinstalled ocm indicated that the updating of the assettrak is scheduled to commence during the first week of june 2004 recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission lilongwe should conduct comprehensive review of asset management all assets including those with implementing partners should be physically verified barcoded and registered on as settrak assistance should be requested from the asset manag ement unit if deemed necessary rec04 5 c security and safety 21 unhcr was rated as moss compliant all hcr staff members had successfully completed the mandatory security training and rece ived the field security handbooks d administration 22 in the areas of administration and finance ocm complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and trols were operating effectively during the period under review albeit improvement was require d in some areas 23 the unhcr delegation of financial signing authority as required under iom 672000 fom 692000 dated 9 october 2000 had t been implemented also the rules over the use of the budget for hospitality were not always adhered to oios recommended that proper administrative and financial procedures be implemented to strengthen internal controls ocm explained that the delegation of signing auth ority charts has now been established and that financial rules and regulatio ns would be better observed in future 24 there was backlog of advances mostly tr avel advances totalling some us 10000 most of these advances had been outstanding since 2 000 with valid justification for this positive steps needed to be taken to ensure these mounts are cleared ocm explained that some staff members failed to lodge their claims aft er the completion of travel the situation was exacerbated by the lack of staff but the clear ing of the outstanding receivables is currently underway 25 the names of several former staff members and their dependents longer members were still included in the mip system and needed to be withdrawn ocm explained that the nonremoval of inactive participants constitutes pa rt of the backlog that has accumulated over time in the adminfinance unit the exercise f editing the system and the enrolment of new staff members will soon commence v acknowledgement 26 i wish to express my appreciation for
