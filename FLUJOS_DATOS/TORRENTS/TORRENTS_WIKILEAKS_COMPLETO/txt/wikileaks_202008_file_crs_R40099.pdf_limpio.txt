established statutory offices of inspectors general igs in many executive and legislative branch agencies as well as two special igs for programs and operations funded with amounts appropriated for the reconstruction of iraq and afghanistan1 the four principal responsibilities of igs are 1 conducting and supervising audits and investigations 2 providing coordination and recommending policies for activities designed to promote economy and efficiency in agency programs and operations 3 preventing and detecting fraud waste and abuse and 4 keeping the agency head and congress fully and currently informed about problems and deficiencies relating to such programs and recommending corrective actions 2 the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa hr 1424 which was enacted as pl 110343 on

g507g21g11g9g561g22g3g20g18g508g561 the provisions in eesa establishing the sig tarp are similar to the ig provisions for sigir and sigar in many respects however there are important substantive distinctions between these three igs which this report will refer to collectively as the special igs as well as between the sig tarp and statutory igs created under the ig act 7 due to the ambiguous nature of the statutory language in eesa the scope of the powers and authorities of the sig tarp is not clear as discussed below g3g153g153g152g146g151g157g150g142g151g157g496g561g5g152g151g143g146g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g496g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g150g152g159g138g149g561 the sig tarp is presidentially appointed and senate confirmed ig selected on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting auditing financial analysis law management analysis public administration or investigations 8 unlike statutory igs under 3 of the ig act who are also presidentially appointed and senate confirmed there is provision in eesa that requires the sig tarp to be appointed without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of the skills listed above although the absence of the additional ig act language regarding political affiliation and appointment based only on job qualification skills does not change the legal protections that the ig act and eesa afford to the sig tarp the sig tarp may be less independent than other igs as practical matter given that the sig tarp is not subject to the same appointment constraints the nomination of sig tarp was required as soon as practicable after the establishment of the tarp and the troubled assets insurance financing fund 9 the sig tarp nominee appeared in hearings before the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs and the senate committee on finance in november although the finance committee hearing was not an official nomination hearing senate standing order approved on january 9 2007 provided for sequential referral for nomination to an office of inspector general to the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee after proceedings in the committee with primary jurisdiction over the department agency or entity that order did not refer to special igs however and both sigir and sigar are not senateconfirmed positions so there was controlling precedent for the nomination of special ig prior to the sig tarps nomination the parliamentarian determined that the senate banking committee would be charged with 7 the treasury inspector general for tax administration tigta which was carved out of the treasury ig and covers distinct entity within the treasury departmentthe internal revenue service irsis another comparable though not identical ig tigta is currently the only statutory ig that exists within an establishment or entity that also has an agencywide ig in place 8 pl 110343 121b2 for comparison sigar is the only presidentially appointed but not senate confirmed ig while sigir is appointed by the secretary of defense in consultation with the secretary of state 5 usc app 8g note however the president may appoint the sigir to serve as the sigar in which case the sigar shall have all of the duties responsibilities and authorities set forth with respect to such appointed position id 9 pl 110343 121b3 sigir and sigar were required to be appointed not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of their respective acts see eg pl 110181 1229c

confirmed by the senate on december 8 2008 like other presidentially appointed and senateconfirmed igs the sig tarp can be removed only by the president and the president must notify congress of the reasons for the igs removal11 the presidents reasons need not be given in writing and time limit is set g21g158g153g142g155g159g146g156g146g152g151g561 unlike igs in other agencies who shall report to and be under the general supervision of the agency head 12 the sig tarp will not be required to report to or be supervised by the head of any agency including the secretary of the treasury the ig act does not explicitly define the meaning of general supervision and its legislative history does not appear to address the scope of the agency heads supervisory role court case relying on the legislative history of the ig act described the agency heads supervisory authority over the ig as nominal 13 instead under one interpretation of the sig tarps duties and responsibilities discussed below the sig tarp will report only to congress and not the agency head14 this reporting arrangement would be unique among statutory igs15 additionally as discussed further below in the section entitled eesa authority to conduct investigations and audits the sig tarp will have complete discretion in pursuing audits and investigations and in issuing subpoenas the sig tarp appears to possess greater latitude in pursuing audits and investigations than the treasury ig as the treasury ig is one of six igs that may be prevented by an agency head from initiating carrying out or completing an audit or investigation or from issuing subpoena for specified reasons such as preventing disclosure of national security matters 16 in contrast to the sig tarp the other special igs report to and are supervised by the secretary of state and the secretary of defense sigir and sigar are also required to keep the secretaries of state and defense fully and currently informed about problems and deficiencies in program administration and the need for and progress on corrective action 17 additionally sigir and 10 press release max baucus chairman senate committee on finance baucus questions

and defense and the united states agency for international development ig in carrying out the duties responsibilities and authorities of the inspector general the provisions for the sig tarp do not

inspectors general under the inspector general act of 1978 on one hand this provision could mean that the sig tarp would be responsible for all of the ig duties outlined in the ig act presumably as amended even those that reference interaction with the head of an establishment or those that reference responsibilities not specifically delineated in eesa yet it appears more likely that 121c3s reference to duties and responsibilities may be limited to those under 4 of the ig act which is entitled duties and responsibilities report of criminal violations to attorney general the provision that grants the sig tarp the same duties and responsibilities as those of igs under the ig act also appears in the acts that created sigir and sigar this provision seems to bridge some but not all of the differences between the authorities of the special igs and igs created under the ig act if interpreted broadly this provision will likely encompass the powers duties and responsibilities in certain sections of the ig act including but not limited to 4a2a5 which encompass general ig duties and the responsibility to keep the head of such establishment and the congress fully and currently informed by means of the reports required by section 5 and otherwise concerning fraud and other serious problems abuses and deficiencies relating to the administration of programs and operations and 4d which requires igs to report expeditiously to the attorney general when there exist reasonable grounds to believe there has been violation of federal criminal law the and otherwise language in the requirement that igs keep congress fully and currently informed has come to be understood in practice to include testifying at congressional hearings direct communications with members and staff various selective or specialized reporting techniques and responses to congressional inquiries for information audits and reports both verbal and written depending on how 121c3 is interpreted it is possible that the sig tarps responsibilities will not encompass 4a1 of the ig act that section provides that igs are to provide policy direction for and to conduct supervise and coordinate audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of such establishment since the provisions creating the sig tarp contain specific language with regard to conducting supervising and coordinating

reports required by section 5 in 4a5 of the ig act appears to subject the sig tarp to the ig act 5 reporting requirements as well however it is not clear as to whether the sig tarp would need to submit the reports in 5 of the ig act in addition to the reports required in eesa or whether the sig tarp would only be responsible for the required reports set forth in eesa for example 5d of the ig act requires establishment igs to immediately report particularly serious or flagrant problems abuses or deficiencies to the head of the establishment whenever the ig becomes aware of such issues the head of the establishment then must send the report to the appropriate congressional committees within seven days along with the establishment heads comments in his or her own report since eesa requires the sig tarp to report to congress only and not to an establishment head it is not clear if the sig tarp would be required to comply with those reporting requirements in 5d of the ig act if eesa is interpreted to include the reporting requirements in 5 of the ig act then the sig tarp could be required to submit certain reports to the establishment head which would appear to be the secretary of the treasury as tarp itself has not been designated an establishment eesa 121f specifies certain reporting requirements for the sig tarp including report 60 days after the sigs confirmation by the senate and every quarter thereafter the report must include detailed statement of all purchases obligations expenditures and revenues associated with the tarp the specificity of the language of this report provision could be interpreted to imply that the duties and responsibilities provision in 121c3 would not extend to the reporting requirements set out in 5 of the ig act which provides that the ig office must prepare semiannual reports and submit them to the head of the establishment who in turn must transmit them to appropriate congressional committees with his or her own report 18 alternatively the ig act 5 reports could be required in addition to the reports set out in eesa there is explicit requirement in eesa that the treasury secretary or anyone else be allowed to comment on the reports that the sig tarp submits to congress although there may be other reporting requirements with respect to tarp they would not be intended to respond to sig concerns or criticisms sigar and sigir have such requirements enabling the secretaries of state and defense to submit comments to the appropriate congressional committees as well as requirements that the reports be made public and even published on website 19 the ig act also provides that the head of the establishment must make the semiannual ig reports and the 18 5 usc 5ab 19 see eg pl 110181 1229ik the

is important to note that eesa 121c3 will not necessarily encompass the whistleblower protections in 7 of the ig act these provisions address complaints or information provided by whistleblowing employee the disclosure of whistleblowers identity and reprisals threatened or taken against whistleblower under the ig ac t not every complaint must be investigated and the ig has discretion in accepting complaints from individuals other than employees however it appears that igs are willing to accept complaints from anyone not just employees and the legislative history of the ig act does not prohibit igs from receiving and acting on information or complaints from any source on related note eesa provides that the financial stability oversight board as established by the legislation will be responsible for reporting any suspected fraud misrepresentation or malfeasance to the sig tarp or the attorney general 21 however whistleblower with information concerning the possible existence of illegal activities or mismanagement regarding the purchase or insurance of troubled assets could conceivably be covered by the ig act 7 protections if he or she reported the information to the treasury ig as opposed to the sig tarp the acts that created sigir and sigar do not contain whistleblower protections either in view of the fact that the current tarp approach is concentrating on banking concerns it is interesting to note that federal law providing whistleblower protection to employees of insured depository institutions and federal banking agencies applies only to information turned over to federal banking agencies or the attorney general22 g20g142g156g152g158g155g140g142g156g561 section 121d of eesa states that the sig tarp wi ll have the authorities of 6 of

establishment in which the tarp is located as 112 of the ig act defines establishment to include the treasury in addition 6a3 of the ig act provides that the ig is authorized to request information or assistance as may be necessary for carrying out the duties and responsibilities provided by the ig act from any federal state or local government agency or unit thereof it is not clear if assistance would cover office space however if it does the sig tarp would appear to be able to request facilities and resources from the treasury department in contrast eesa specifically provides that the secretary shall provide the comptroller general with appropriate space and facilities in the department of the treasury as necessary to facilitate oversight of the tarp until the termination date established in section 120 23 the provisions in the act creating sigar enabled that special ig to rely on the personnel facilities and resources of another special ig sigir24 sigir in turn could rely

in the competitive service and the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter iii of chapter 53 of such title relating to classification and general schedule pay rates this provision mirrors the language

for the sig tarp eesa 121e3 provides that the sig may enter into contracts or other arrangements for audits studies analyses and other services with public agencies and with private persons and make

their federal regulators who have access to virtually all the records of the institutions and are required to examine them periodically35 some of these records may be subject to laws preventing

necessary or desirable41 as with other references to ig act 6 this provision applies to the sig tarp courts have also held that the igs investigative authority extends to private contractors the legislative history of the act clearly indicates that congress specifically intended to extend the oigs power of review over private entities working closely with government agencies because such entities are privy to highly confidential information and are paid large sums of federal funds for their services creating potential risk for abuse both inside and outside government agencies 42

documents papers recommendations and other material available to the applicable establishment which relate to programs and operations with respect to which that inspector general has responsibilities under this act43 there is limitation on this right of access in the ig act the igs ability to have access to all records indicates that the igs investigative and audit powers extend into the private sector and to individuals outside the agency for instance when the ig audits contracts with industry or investigates suspected fraud in agency purchases or other wrongdoing by private individuals in connection with agency operations and programs the sig tarp retains these powers as well as eesa 121d provides that the sig tarp shall have the authorities provided in section 6 of the inspector general act of 1978 as result it appears that the sig tarp would be able to access records of thirdparties that participate in the tarp program and that relate to eesa funds however additional legislation could make the sig tarps authority in this area more explicit in the event that private entity would not voluntarily yield its records to the sig tarp th ig would have the option of using

existence or specifics of subpoena issued under this authority the sig tarp retains these subpoena powers as well as eesa 121d provides that the sig tarp shall have the authorities provided in section 6 of the inspector general act of 1978 the legislative history of the ig act addresses the subpoena as an investigative tool intended for use in both administrative and criminal investigations subpoena power is absolutely essential to the discharge of the inspector and auditor generals functions there are literally thousands of institutions in the country which are somehow involved in the receipt of funds from federal programs without the power necessary to conduct comprehensive audit of these entities the inspector and auditor general could have serious impact on the way federal funds are expended the committee does not believe that the inspector and auditor general will have to resort very often to the use of subpoenas there are substantial incentives for institutions that are involved with the federal government to comply with requests by an inspector and auditor general in any case however knowing that the inspector and auditor general has recourse to subpoena power should encourage prompt and thorough cooperation with his audits and investigations the committee intends of course that the inspector and auditor general will use this subpoena power in the performance of is statutory functions the use of subpena power to obtain information for another agency component which does not have such power would clearly be improper 47 the justice department reports that the the inspector generals administrative subpoena authority is mainly used in criminal investigations48 and the courts have held that the act gives the inspectors general both civil and criminal investigative authority and subpoena powers coextensive with that authority49 the legislative history of the ig act also discusses subpoenas of thirdparty bank records the committee recognizes that there is substantial ongoing dispute about the propriety of socalled third party subpoenas ie subpoenaing records of an individual which are in the hands of an institution such as bank since us v miller 425 us 435 1976 individuals have been regarded as having protectable right of property with respect to their bank records law enforcement agency can obtain such records from bank without any showing of cause to neutral magistrate or any notice to the individual involved the committee notes that progress has been made on legislation concerning financial privacy which would require notice to be given to an individual whose bank records are being obtained by law enforcement agency hopefully this progress will lead to legislation of continued 46 5 usc app 6a4 which subpena

igs and the sig tarp through the authorities in ig act 6 as provided by eesa 121d have the authority to administer to or to take from any person an oath affirmation or affidavit whenever necessary in the performance of the functions assigned by this act51 the phrase any person indicates that the igs investigative powers extend into the private sector and to individuals outside the agency oaths administered by igs shall have the same force and effect as if administered or taken by or before an officer having seal52 false material statements made to an ig under oath may subject an individual to criminal prosecution or perjury charges53 several court cases discuss an oigs ability to conduct interviews in the course of investigations in united states nuclear regulatory commission v federal labor relations authority flra the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit noted that the ig act facilitates the igs auditing and investigative functions by giving each inspector general access to the agencys documents and agency personnel54 the court held that four proposals by union regarding procedures to be followed during investigatory interviews of the agencys employees by the inspector general were not consistent with the ig act because congress intended that the inspector generals investigatory authority incl ude the power to determine when and how to investigate 55 to grant the unions proposals regarding interviews would directly interfere with the ability of the inspector general to conduct investigations56 the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit echoed the fourth circuits remarks regarding ig independence in united states department of justice v flra 57 the court stated there cannot be the slightest doubt that congress gave the inspector general the independent authority to decide when and how to investig ate that the inspector generals authority encompasses determining how to conduct interviews under oath58 although both this case and united states nuclear regulatory commission v flra dealt with oig interviews of agency employees the dc circuit noted that anyonewhether union member management official or an individual not employed by the federal governmentwould be prudent to secure legal representation if they are to be questioned under oath59 50 srepno 951071 at 34 1978footnote 7 of the committee report in brackets 51

60 the united states supreme court detailed the independent characteristics of oigs and their authority to conduct audits and investigations the court held that in the context of federal labor relations statute the nasa oig investigative interviewer was representative of the agency and found that those independent ig act characteristics do not make nasaoig any less representative of nasa when it investigates nasa employee as far as the ig act is concerned nasaoigs investigators are employed by act on behalf of and operate for the benefit of nasa 61 the court also noted two limitations of the ig act 1 it grants inspectors general the authority to subpoena documents and information but not witnesses62 and 2 there may be other incentives for employee cooperation with oig investigations but formal sanctions for refusing to submit to an oig interview cannot be pursued by the oig alone63 rather the oig may request assistance from the agency head insofar as is practicable and not in contravention of the law which has been interpreted to mean that the agency head could direct the employee to appear at an oig interview64

investigations this means that the ig may decline request to conduct an audit or investigation for instance other investigative priorities might take precedence in the igs judgment or the ig might determine that indications of wrongdoing or lax enforcement are insufficient to warrant the office of inspector generals commitment to investigate them additionally the ig might consider that an investigation now could prove disruptive to delay or compromise any ongoing administrative and judici proceedings an immediate ig investigation might also prove counterproductive to future inquiries including an effort by the office of inspector general itself along these lines an investigation started after the conclusion of administrative and judicial proceedings could benefit from the possible presentation of additional information finally certain practical considerations might delay or prevent an investigation possibilities include already existing commitments for specific investigations and audits competing priorities for new audits and investigations limitations on office of inspector general resources now and for the remainder of the fiscal year and the need to rely on contracting out for relevant expertise which could delay the start of an investigation if inhouse capabilities are lacking 60 527 us 229 1999 61 id at 241 see id at 231 234 246 62 id at 242 see also united states
