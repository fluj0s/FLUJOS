appropriations bills s billions for nearly two decades the foreign operations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and for congressional involvement in foreign policy making congress has not enacted comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 l eaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizati ons originating from the legislative oversight committees as result foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded thei r scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been key tool used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration ma nagement of foreign assi stance actions that have frequently resulted in executivelegislative clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy

foreign operations funding trends as shown in figure 2 below foreign operations funding levels expressed in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation have fluctu ated widely over thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31311crs5 2 some of these swings however are not the result of policy decisions but due to technical budget accounting changes involving how c ongress scores various programs for example the large increase in fy1981 did not repr esent higher funding levels but rather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations rather than as off budget items part of the substantial rise in spending in fy1985 came as result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of m ilitary aid loans rather than only the partial appropriation required in the past beginning in fy1992 congress changed how all federal credit programs are scored in appropriati on bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded in foreign operations all of these factors make it very difficult to present precise and consistent data trend line in foreign operations funding levels nevertheless the data shown in figure 2 can be regarded as illustrative of general trends in congressional decisions regarding foreign opera tions appropriations over the past 25 years figure 2 foreign operations funding trendspast 25 years2 after peaking at over 33 billion in fy1985 constant fy2003 dollars foreign operations appropriations began peri od of decline to 138 billion in fy1997 with only brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due to special supplementals for panama and caragua 1990 countries affected by the gulf war 1991 and the form er soviet states 1993 arguing that declining international ffairs resources seriously undermined us foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events clinton administration offi cials and other outside groups vigorously campaigned to reverse the decadelong dec line in the foreign policy budget foreign aid spending increased slightly in fy1998 but beginning the following year and continuing to the present foreign oper ations appropriations have trended upward due in large part to the approval of resources for special and in some cases unanticipated foreig n policy contingencie s and new initiatives while funding for regular continuing foreign aid programs also rose modestly during this periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31311crs6 3 the entire 40 billion terrorism emergency appropriation was appropriated in fy2001 but was divided into

recent trend of increased spending on foreign aid however by historical standards the amounts between fy2000 and fy2003 in real terms are relatively low except for the lowest point in foreign aid

subcommittees will operate when they m eet to mark up thei r annual appropriation billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31311crs8 complicating the committees ability to set section 302b allocations and

divided during the 107th congress however over which budget resolution level to use nevertheless in the meantime house and senate appropriation committees issued section 302b allocations on june 21 and june 27 2002 respectively in order to allow the committees to begin marking up some of the spending bills overall the allocations differed significantly with the house approving 759 billion including the 10 billion defense reserve while the senate distributed total of 768 billion foreign operations received 1635 billion allocation from each committee about 230 million higher than th presidents request at that time subsequently president bush propos ed on september 3 an additional 350 million for foreign operations but without identifying any offsets the house foreign operations

recipients as they have been for many years in the aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks foreign aid allocations have changed in several significant ways the administration has used economic and military assistance as an add itional tool in effo rts to maintain cohesive international coa lition to conduct the war on terro rism and to assist nations which have both supported us forces and face serious terrorism threats themselves pakistan for example key coalition pa rtner on the border with afghanistan had been ineligible for us aid other than humanitarian assistance due to sanctions imposed after india and pakistan conducte d nuclear tests in may 1998 and pakistan experienced military coup in 1999 since lifting aid sanctions in october 2001 the united states has transferred over 15 billi on to pakistan india the philippines turkey jordan and indonesia also are am ong the top aid recipients in fy2002 and fy2003 as part of the network of front line states in the war on terrorism most recently the enactment of the fy2003 iraq war supplemental appropriation has added sign ificant amounts to many of these same countries in recognition of their support in the conflict the supplemental also provided nearly 25 billion for relief and recons truction programs in iraq the other major cluster of top recipients are those in the andean region where the administration maintains large counternarcotics initiative that combines assistance to interdict and disrupt drug production together with alternative development programs for areas that re ly economically on the

admissions by north korea that it had resumed its nuclear program the administra tion suspended deliveries of fuel oil and food aid to north korea the legislation permitted the president however to

pakistan 145 million and jordan 125 million it distributed as shown in table 6 considerable amounts of aid to central asian states that would not receive substantial increases in fy2003 and to other nations outside the region policy issues the supplemental request included severa l general provisions that would change current policy regarding the distribution of military aid assistance to

receives funding through the foreign m ilitary financing f mf account of the foreign operations appropr iations and provides broad policy direction for us military assistance programs dod frequently administers fmf activities but under the policy guidance of the state departme nt the administration proposed in the fy2002 supplemental to grant dod authority to use up to 30 million to support indigenous forces engaged in activities combating terrorism and up to 100 million to support foreign government efforts to fight global terrorism the 130 million total would come from defense funds

defense fy2002 supplemental request to continue the global war on terrorism march 2002 page 28 for web version see httpwwwdticmilcomptrollerfy2003budgetfy2002_supppdf dod officials said that these provisions were essential to help reimburse countries for costs they incur in assisting us forces engaged in the war on terrorism the united states had to delay paymen ts to pakistan for support provided in operation enduring freedom because of competing demands on regular military aid funds and the absence of agreements between dod and the pakistan military that would allow such transfers out of the fense budget neverthe less critics charged that such change would infringe on congressional oversight and the state departments traditional role in directing foreign aid policy and resource allocations by including notwithstanding provis the request further would remove human rights and other conditions that must be obs erved by countries in order to qualify for us security assistance at house hearing on april 18 deputy s ecretary of state armitage told the foreign operations appropriations subcommittee that although the state department supported the intent of the provisions th administration drafted the legislation in rather poor way and that the aut hority was little broade r in scope than we really intended secretary armitage pl edged that both state and dod officials would work with congress to adjust the pr ovisions in way that would protect the prerogatives of the secretary of state as the overseer of foreign policy and foreign aid9 colombia aid restrictions an additional provision in the supplemental sought to broaden dod and state department authoritie s to utilize unexpended plan colombia fy2002 and fy2003 appropriations to suppor t colombias unified campaign against narcotics trafficking terrorist activities and other threats to its national security10 the provision would allow funds to be used not only for counter narcotics operations but also for military actions against colombian insurgents and any other circumstances that threatened colombian national security although the most immediate effect of the change would be to permit the united states to expand intelligence sharin g with colombian security forces the provision would also allow helicopters and other military equipment provided over the past two years to fight drug production to be used against any threat to colombias security the administration however did not ask congress to soften two other colombia aid restrictions 400person limit on us personnel inside colombia and the prohibition of aid to colombian military and police units that are engaged in human rights violations leahy amendment despite the inclusion of clause that past and future aid be ava ilable notwithstanding any provision of law see below except for the two restrictions noted bove administration officials said they were not seeking to remove other enacted conditions on colombian aid such as those related to human rights and aerial coca fumigation coupled with pending fy2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31311crs25 98 million military aid request to help prot ect colombias oil pipeline and other infrastructure against guerilla activity critics argued that the us objective in colombia was shifting from one of comba ting narcotics producti on and trafficking to counterterrorism nd insurgency strategy removal of restrictions fo r other economic and military assistance the administrations supplemen tal submission asked congress to provide most of the econo mic and military aid funds notwithstanding any other provision of law such language is usua lly reserved only for situations where humanitarian assistance or aid in support of the highest us foreign policy interests would be prohibited due to existing gislative restrictions on assistance to governments that violate human rights engage in weapons proliferation came to power through military coup do not cooperate in counte rnarcotics activities or series of other similar aid conditions because of the sweeping and broad natu re of notwithstanding provisions congress has often been reluctant to enact such waiver without fully understanding the implications of excluding foreign aid re strictions more of ten congress prefers to waive specific legislative constraints rather than approving acrosstheboard waivers administration officials said that such waiver was needed in the supplemental because of impediments that apply to afghanistan yemen ethiopia and cote divoire these first three countri were overdue in making debt payments to the us in violation of the brooke amendment section 512 of the foreign operations appropriations fy 2002 cote divoire is in eligible for aid because of the military coup against democratically elected government in 1999 in violation of section 508 of the foreign operations appropriations fy2002 congressional action on the administrations supplemental foreign operations request house senate and conference action increased foreign aid funding proposed by the president but limited to some extent policy provisions and waivers sought by the white house the enacted measure also added new issue into the supplemental debate additional funding to fight global hivaids but dropped senate added provision concerning the status of u s contributions to the population fund unfpa as passed by congress the suppl emental included 1818 billion in new foreign operations funds nearly 500 milli on above the request this total was offset by 269 million in rescissions for net total of 155 billion for foreign operations the house had included 182 billion while the senate measure provided 178 billion new ite ms added by both the house and senate and contained in the final bill included 200 million in assistance to israel 50 million for the palestinians and 200 million to combat hivaids malaria and tuberculosis the hivaids money could be used to support the presidents new international mother and ch ild prevention initiative but conferees stated that 100 million of the total should be used as an additional contribution to the global fund to combat hivaids tuberculosis and malaria httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31311crs26 both versions increased aid to afgh anistan for reconstruction and security support above the presidents 250 million request the house by 120 million and the senate by roughly 110 million the conf erence agreement did not set specific amount for afghanistan but with the 134 million designated for afghanistan within the international disaster assistance account 40 million requested the final allocation for afghanistan would likely be hi gher than the request the senate bill added 15 million to create an internationa l exchange program for students from countries with large muslim populations and conferees set the total at 10 million in most cases the conference agreement did not set specific country allocations leaving that to the discretion of the president as noted above however the additiona l funds added by congress over the presidents request aid to israel the pa lestinians for hivaids and some of the assistance to afghanistan and the philippines were designated as contingent emergency the president said he did not agree with the emergency designation and did not make these funds available only 12 billion of the 18 billion total in new foreign aid funds would be spent acco rding to the white house nevertheless on september 3 the president amended his fy2003 foreign operations request seeking the contingent emergency funds for israel the palestinia ns and international hivaids programs in late september the state department released the final country and program allocati ons of the supplemental f unding making reductions not only to levels assumed for afghanistan nd the philippines but also to requested amounts for pakistan nepal colombia yemen several african nations and middle east economic initiative see table 6 above on policy issues the final bill removed the requested notwithstanding any provision of law provisos but waived the brooke amendment regarding debt payments in arrears this permitted most waivers the administration sought on colombia the final bill included langua ge similar but less sweeping than the administrations request it allowed colombia to use american foreign aid money managed by the state department for unified campaign against narcotics trafficking against organizations designat ed as terrorist groups and for humanitarian rescue operations all curre nt restrictions on colombia n aid however remained in effect the bill further added requirement regarding the newly elected colombian president and policies regarding human rights military reforms and financial commitments to implement other reforms congress denied dods request for authority to use 30 million to s upport indigenous forces engaged in activitie s combating terrorism but approved 390 million for payments to pakistan jordan nd other cooperating states for logistical and military support provided hr 4775 as passed by the house had approved dods request for 100 million to support foreign government effo rts to fight global terrorism but with significant changes transfers would be limited only to reimbursements for the costs of goods services or us of facilities by us milita ry forces and any proposed commitment of funds must be submitted jointly to the committees by the secretaries of state and defense 15 days in advance for committee approval the senate measure and the final bill did not include provision related to this issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31311crs27 during house committee markup another c ontentious foreign aid policy issue was introduced between midjanuary and midjuly 2002 the white house had maintained hold on us contributions to the population fund unfpa because of allegations that unfpa is participating in the management of coercive family planning practices in china for fy2002 congress provided not to exceed 34 million for unfpa and some members cr iticized the white house for delaying decision regarding unfpas eligibility state department investigation team spent two weeks in china during may after initially adopting an amendment by representatives lowey and kolbe 3231 that would require the presiden t to transfer the full 34 million to unfpa by july 10 if the state department team concluded that unfpa was not involved in coercive family planning practices in china the committee approved further amendment by representative tiahrt that overrode the loweykolbe provision the tiahrt amendment required the president to determine whether unfpa participated in the management of coercive family pl anning practices by july 31 2002 but said nothing about how much the president must contribute prior to final passage of hr 4775 however the second rule hres 431 under which th bill was debated deleted both amendments from the legisla tion as such the housepassed measure did not include any language regarding unfpa the senate bill however included language nearly identical to loweykolbe text under any of these amendments dete rmination that unfpa was involved in coercive practices would ve resulted in the termina tion of us support without such determination however the sena and loweykolbe amendments would have required the president to transf er the full 34 milli on under the tiahrt provision however the president could ve reduced the us contribution to something less than 34 million to express displeasure over alleged coercive family practices in china and unfpas involve ment the white house strongly opposed the senate language conferees agreed to drop all unfpa language from the final bill leaving the decision entirely up to the president subsequently on july 23 the white house announced the us would withhold the 34 million transfer major policy and spending issues for fy2003 while the foreign operations appropriations bill can include virtually any foreign policy issue of interest to cong ress the annual debate usually focuses on several major policy and sp ending issues issues for fy2003 have included the following foreign aid as tool in the war on terrorism as discussed above since the septembe r 11 terrorist attacks and the initiation of military operations in afghanistan combating global terrorism has become one of the top priorities of american foreign assistance while there is disagreement regarding the extent to which foreign aid can directly contribute to reducing the threathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31311crs28 of terrorism most agree that economic and security assistance aimed at reducing poverty promoting jobs and educational opportun ities and helping stabilize conflict prone nations can indirectly attack some of the factors that terrorists use in recruiting disenfranchised individuals for their cause more than 6 billion was extended to frontline states in fy2002 through regu lar and two supplemen tal appropriations while the fy2003 budget proposed about 4 billion foreign aid can be programmed in numbe r of ways that contribute to the war on terrorism assistance can be transfe rred as has occurred in pakistan and afghanistan to bolster co alitionpartner government efforts to counter domestic dissent and armed attacks by extremist groups and to promote better health care education and employment opportunities to its people security assistance can finance the provision of military equipment and training to nations facing threats from their own internallybased terrorist movements while there has been substantial congressional support for add itional foreign aid resources aimed at counterin g terrorism some warn that the united states needs to be cautious about the risks of creating cl ose aid relationship with governments that may have questionable human rights records are not accountable to their people and are possibly corrupt as noted above mbers have been especially critical of administration efforts to include in aid pr oposals for frontline states legislative language that would waive all existing rest rictions and prohibitions on the transfers instead these critics argue the adminis tration should specifically identify any obstacles to proceeding with country ai d program and seek congressional waiver for those particular problems for exam ple in late 2001 when the administration wanted to provide pakistan with 600 million in fastdisbursing ec onomic aid congress approved pl

request of the roughly 4 billion request ed for fy2003 in aid for the frontline states the administration has allocated 41 b illion to these 26 c ountries the approximate 100 llion increase is the result of congressional earmark for afghanistan that is well in excess of the assumed executive proposal for nearly all other frontline states aid llocations are at or near levels proposed in the

in resources for terrorismrelated activities comes in the capital investment fund the new usaid account that will finance security upgrades and construction of new missions the fy2003 enacted spending

between the executive branch and congress is how to allocate the roug hly 3 billion core budget for usaid development assistance programs among the top congressional development aid funding priorities

congressional proponents of separate child surviv alhealth account however continued to argue that special attention needs to be drawn to child and maternal health programs and said they would

family planning abortion r estrictions and unfpa funding us population assistance and fa mily planning programs overseas have sparked perhaps the most consistent controversy dur ing foreign operations debates for nearly two decades the primary issues addre ssed in nearly ever annual congressional consideration of foreign operations bills focus on two matters whether abortion related restrictions should be applied to bila teral usaid population aid grants and whether the united states should contribut to the population fund unfpa if the organization maintains program in china where allegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years unfpa funding the most contentious issue usually concerns the abortion restriction question but r ecent attention has been focused on unfpa and white house decision in july 2002 to block the 34 million us contribution to the organization during the reagan and bush administrations the united states did not contribute to unfpa because of concerns over practices of forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations in china wher unfpa maintains programs in 1985 congress passed the socalle d kempkasten amendment wh ich has been made part of every foreign operati ons appropriation since barring us funds to any organization that supported or participat ed in the management of program of coercive abortion or involunt ary sterilization in 1993 pr esident clinton determined that unfpa despite its presence in china was not involved in the management of coercive program in most years since 1993 congress has appropriated about 25 million for unfpa but added directive that required that amount reduced by however much unfpa spent in china consequently the us contribution has fluctuated between 215 million and 25 million for fy2002 president bush requested 25 million for unf pa as part of larger package concerning various international family planning issues congress provided in the fy2002 foreign operati ons bill not more than 34 million for unfpa while members of the appropriations committees say it was their intent to provide the full 34 million the language allowed the president to allocate however much he chose up to 34 million ceiling according to february 27 testimony by arthur dewey assistant s ecretary of state for population refugees and migration before the senate foreign relations committee the

team found in october 2001 absolutely evidence that the population fund suppor ts coercive family planning practices in china or violates the human righ ts of chinese people in any way14 while most observers agree that coercive family planning practices continue in china differences remain over the extent to which if any unfpa is involved in involuntary activities and whether unfpa s hould operate at all in country where such conditions exist given the conflicting reports the state department sent its own investigative team to china for tw oweek review of unfpa programs on may 13 2002 the team which was led by fo rmer ambassador william brown and included bonnie glick former state depa rtment official and dr theodore tong public health professor at the univers ity of arizona made three findings and recommendations in its report dated may 31 findings there is evidence that unfpa knowingly supported or participated in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in china china maintains coercive elemen ts in its population programs chinese leaders view population c ontrol as high priority and remain concerned over implicati ons for socioeconomic change recommendations the united states should rel ease not more than 34 million of previously appropria ted funds to unfpa until china ends all forms of coercion in law and practice us government funds should be allo cated to population programs in china appropriate resources possibly from the united states should be allocated to monitor and eval uate chinese population control programs

abortions they would not otherw ise undergo the state department analysis concluded that unfpas involvement in chinas family planning program allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion15 critics of the administrations decisi on oppose it not only because of the negative impact it may have on access to voluntary family planning programs by persons in around 140 countries where unfpa operates but also because of the possible application of the determination for other international organizations that operate in china and to wh ich the us contributes for fy2003 the president proposed funding for unfpa although 25 million was requested in reserve for the account from which unfpa receives its funding presumably this could be made av ailable to unfpa if it is found not to be in violation of kempkasten mexico city policy the debate over international family planning policy and abortion began nearly three decad ago in 1973 when congress added provision to the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibiting the use of us appropriated funds for abortionrelated activities and coercive family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy because it was first announced at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan administrati on and later the george h w bush administration restricted funds for fore ign nongovernmental organizations ngos that were involved in performing or prom oting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activ ities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippflondon became ineligible for us financial suppor t in some years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohi bition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding fo r all family planning organizations so long as us money was used by those involved in abortion related work during the past six years the hous and senate have taken opposing positions on the mexico city issue and thus have repeatedly held up enactment of the final foreign operations spending measur the house position articulated by representative chris smith nj and othe rs supported reinstatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in fo reign countries the senate on the

incorporated into hr 3194 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 because the president could waive the restrictions for 15 million in grants to organizations that refused to certify

waiver authority when congress again came to an impasse in fy2001 lawmakers agreed to allow the new president to set policy under the fy2001 foreign operations measure none of the 425 million

1993 memorandum from president clinton and directing the administrator to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 the president further said that it was his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad16 separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated that president bush was committed to maintaining the 425 million funding level for popul ation assistance because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services the press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions for example post abortion care17 on february 15 2001 the day on whic h fy2001 population aid funds b ecame available for obligation usaid issued specific policy

that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the rest rictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding this they contend will lead to higher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possi bly more abortions oppone nts also believe the new conditions undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating s ituation in which the united states challenges their decisions on how to spend their own money they further argue that us policy imposes socalled gag order on the ability of ngos and multilateral groups to promote changes to abortion laws and regula tions in developing nations this would be unconstitutional if applie d to american groups working in the united states critics note supporters of the certification requireme nt argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible organizations receiving american taxpayer funding can simply use usaid resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abor tion laws and regulati ons the certification process they contend stops the fungibility loophole congressional action both house hr 5410 and senate s 2779 fy2003 foreign operations bills as reporte d in 2002

the program compared to plan colombia assistance approved in 200020 are that larger portion of the assistance is directed at economic and social programs and that more than half of the assistance is directed at regional countries experi encing the spillover effects of illicit drug and insurgency activities another aspect of the initiative was president bushs request for the extensi on and

at the time strictly limited to counternarcotics into problematic counterinsurgency one critic s who emphasize human righ ts considerations argued that such role would inevitably involve tolerance of

of colombia such change would allow the administration to expand the scope of us assistance particularly military assistance to colombia allowing state and defense department funds to assist the colombian government to counter any threat to its national security the immediate and widely discussed effect of this change would be to allow the us government to broaden the circumstances under which it currently shares intelligence with colombia n security forces providing intelligence not only for counterdrug operations but also for military operations against the colombian guerrillas and paramilitaries the change would also permit the plan colombia helicopters and othe r equipment that the united states has provided to be used for such purposes the administrations proposal would c

foreign economic assistance beginning in fy2004 so that by fy2006 american aid would be 5 billion higher than three years earlier if the ai d budget rises in thr ee equal installments of 167 billion each year the initiative could provide as much as cumulative 10 billion in additional economic assistance above what might be assumed for the three year period without the presidents initiativ the funds would be placed in new millennium challenge account mca and be available to developing nations that are pursing political and economic reforms in three areas ruling justly promoting good

healthy population fostering enterprise and entr epreneurship promoting open markets and sustainable budgets if fully implemented the initiative would represent one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in half century outpaced only by the marshall plan following world war ii and the latin americafocused alliance for progress in the early 1960s the concept is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to free market economic and democratic principals and policies conditioning assistance on policy performance and accountability by recipient nations is not new to us aid programs since the late 1980s at least portions of american development assistance have been allocated to some degree on performancebased system what is differe nt about the mca is the size of the commitment the competitive process that will reward countries for what they have already achieved not just what is promised for the future the pledge to segregate the funds

sponded to special middle east economic stabilization and african famine requireme nts but using fy2003 as baseline rather than fy2000 the percentage of incr ease especially in real terms counting inflation between fy2003 and fy2006 will be less than the 50 figure used by some administration officials the nomin increase would be about 41 while in real terms fy2006 funding would be nearly 32 more because of the size of the us economy and continued growth projected over the next several years the mca increases will have little impact on the amount of us aid as percent of gdp according to current projections assist ance would rise from the current 011 of gdp to 013 during the first year of the mca pa rticipants will be limited to the 74 poorest nations that are eligible to borrow from
