agriculture business and public advocacy groups may prompt renewed inte rest in congress all briefs from petitioners epa and supporters were filed with the c ourt by march 7 2008 and oral argument occurred september 15 2008 although tightening of the standard s the 2006 particulates naaqs are not as stringent as recommended by epa staff or the independent scientific advisory committee mandated under the clean air ac t clean air scientific advisory committee or casac the divergen ce from the casacs recommendations proved controversial as di d several other elements of the 2006 particulates naaqs including the decision not to exclude rural sources from the coarse particle standard some have also questioned the epas strengthening of the standard for all fine particles without distinguishing th eir source or chemical composition the epa found that the evidence conti nued to support associations between exposure to particulates in ambient ai r and numerous significant health problems including aggravated asthma chronic bronchitis heart attacks and premature death based on several analytical approaches the epa estimated that compliance with the revised naaqs will prevent 1200 to 13000 pr emature deaths annually as well as substantial numbers of hosp ital admissions and missed wo rk or school days due to illness based on these findings epa revi sed the pm naaqs by strengthening the preexisting 1997 standard for fine pa rticulate matter 25 mic rometers or less in diameter pm25 by lowering the allowable daily concentration averaged over 24 hour periods of pm25 in the air the annual pm25 standard which is set in addition to the daily standard to address human h ealth effects from chronic exposures to the pollutants is unchanged from the 1997 standard the 2006 particulates naaqs also retain ed the 24hour standard and revoked the annual standard for slightly larger but still inhalable particle s less than or equal to 10 micrometers pm10 the epa abandoned its proposal to replace the particle size indicator of pm10 with range of 10 to 25 micrometers pm1025 the forthcoming implementation of the 2006 naaqs which includes designating areas typically defined by counties or portions of counties as not attaining the standard and adopting measures to achieve compliance may generate interest in congress although epa is not requiring new nonatta inment designations for pm10 the tightening of the pm25 standard will increase the number of areas in nonattainment in its preliminary recommendations sub mitted to states and tribes in august 2008 epa

aggravated asthma chronic bronchitis reduced lung func tion irregular hear tbeat nonfatal heart attacks and premature death the casac found that the numerous epidemiological studies epa reviewed have shown statistically significant associations between the concentrations of ambient air pm25 and pm10 including levels that are lower than the 1997 particulates naaqs and exce ss mortality and morbidity13 further the epa concluded and most of the casac panel concurred that the scientific evidence supported modifying the pa rticulates standards the 1997 primary naaqs for both pm25 and pm10

pm10 daily standard of 150 µgm3 the proposal also included narrowing the focus of the pm1025 standard to urban and industrial sources and excluding par ticles typical to rural areas including

of the pm25 standards is expected to increase the number of areas typically defined by counties or portions of c ounties in nonattainment in response to recommendations sub mitted by states in august 2008 epa identified 169 counties and portions of 46 additional counties for designation as nonattainment only for the revised 2006 24hour pm25 standard while many of these counties identified for c onsideration overlap with the final nonattainment designations for the 1997 pm25 naaqs most designations for the 1997 naaqs were based on nonattainment only for the annual standard epa expects to finalize the nonattainment designations based on 20052007 monitoring data for the 2006 pm naaqs by the end of 2008 with an effective date of april 200916 following formal designation the stat have three years until april 2012 based on the current schedule to submit state implementation plans sips which identify specific regulations and emission control requirements that will bring an area into compliance in addition to requiring states to submit implementation plans epa acts to control naaqs pollutants thr ough national standards these may be in the form of regulations of products that

is tr ansformed in air to form another air pollutant contributing to the formation of both ozone and pm25 concentrations epa has concluded that so2 and nox emissions through the phenomenon of air pollution transport contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the pm25 and 8hour ozone naaqs 70 federal register 25162 may 12 2005nevertheless the epa released regulatory impact analysis ria on october 6 200618 to meet its obligations under executive order 12866 and in compliance with guidance from the white house office of management and budget19 the ria only analyzed the benefits and costs of implementing the pm25 naaqs citing time data and modeling limitations the epa did not analyze the benefits and costs of retaining the pm10 standard the epa emphasized that the october 2006 ria differed from typical rias in that it did not analyze the regulatory impact of an action and that it is primarily for illustrative purposes the basis for the benefits calculations are reductions in ambient concentrations of pm25 resulting from reasonable but speculative array of costeffective state implementation strategies selected by the epa for purposes of analysis the analysis does not model the specific actions that each state will undertake in implementing the 2006 pm25 naaqs the epa includes detailed discussion of the limitations and uncertainties associated with the analysis in its impact analysis epas estimated baseline case incorporated expected impacts of other national regulations that contribute to lowering pm25 concentrations in future years these other regulations included those addressing emissions from the power generation sector namely the 2005 clean air interstate rule cair20 however in july 11 2008

engineering costs emissions inventories and sources and regional variability the epa emphasized that the technologies and c ontrol strategies selected for analysis only illustrate one way for nonattainment areas to reach attainment and that states will compile and evaluate va riety of programs and adopt those attainment strategies best suited for their specific local conditi ons for purposes of comparing costs with monetized benefits the epa estimated that the total nnual mean soci cost of attainment of the revised pm25 naaqs incremental to attainment of the 1997 standards would

generally representing industry associations and businesses opposed revising the 1997 pm25 standards in some cases highlighting differe nt aspects of the same research cited by the casac and others supporting tighter standards42 some who opposed more stringent particulates naaqs ca lled attention to more recent studies of health effects attributable to particulates that demonstrate risk estimates are lower and less statistically significant than they were in 1997 when the last standard was set43 in section ii of the preamble of the fi nal october 2006 revisi ons rationale for final decisions on primary pm25 standards the epa disc ussed its final decision with respect to the casac recommendations regarding the pm25 annual standard the administrator differed with the casac with regard to the level of uncertainty associated with the agencys quantitative risk assessment and whether the results appropriately served as primary basis for decision on the level of the annual pm25 standard the administrator further stressed the emphasis placed on the longterm means of the levels associated with mortality effects in the two key longterm studies44 in determining the level of the

its objections to the epa s final 2006 particulates naaqs in its september 29 2006 letter to administrator johnson45 with regard to pm25 the letter stated casac is concerned that the epa did not accept our finding that the annual pm25 standard was not protective of human health and did not follow our recommenda tion for change in that standard46 the letter noted that there is clear and

nationwide monetized human health and welfare benefits of attaining two suites of pm25 naaqs 1 the revised pm25 naaqs which include the 35 µgm3 daily 24hour standard and the unchanged 15 µgm3 annual standard and 2 an alternative standard similar to the least stringent of the casac recommendations that includes tig hter annual standard of 14 µgm3 and the same 35 µgm3 daily 24hour standard as discu ssed previously the epa presented variety of benefits estimates based on several epidemiological studies the american cancer society acs study48 used in previous rias the harvard sixcities study49 and an expert elicitation study conducted by the epa in 200650 the epa estimated that attainment of the more stringent alternative pm25 naaqs would result in 26 billion to 30 b illion of total annua l benefits in 2020 based on the acs mortality function this compares to range of 15 billion to 17 billion estimated for compliance with the 2006 pm25 naaqs see table 2 and discussion earlier in this

have replaced the existing particle size indicator of 10 micrometers pm10 with an indicator range of 10 to 25 micrometers pm1025 referred to as inhalable or thoracic coarse particles and setting pm1025 daily standard of 70 µgm3 rather than the current pm10 daily standard of 150 µgm3 at the time of its proposal the epa concluded that the scientific evidence supported the standard based on short term exposure to certain coarse particles pa rticularly in urban and industrial areas in the final 2006 particulates naaqs th epa decided to maintain the pm10 indicator citing the limited body of eviden ce on health effects associated with thoracic coarse particles from studies that use pm1025 measurements the agency also determined that the only studies of clear quantitative relevance to health effects most likely associated with thoracic coarse particles used pm10 measurements the 2006 particulates naaqs retained the pm10 indicator and the daily 24hour standard of 150 µgm3 in its september 29 2006 letter the casa c said it was completely surprised at the decision to revert to the use of pm10 as the indicator for coarse particles noting that the option of retaining the existing daily pm10 standard was not discussed during the advisory process and that casac vi ews this decision as highlyproblematic since pm10 includes both fine and co arse particulate matter the casac did agree that having standard for pm10 was better than standard the epa indicated that it is promulgating new federal reference method frm for measurement of mass concentrations of pm1025 in the

in the january 2006 proposal was based on th findings reported in the criteria document the pm staff paper and the casac conclusion that the evidence for the toxicity of pm1025 comes from studies

health effects is more compelling than when the standards were revised in 1997 exclusion of rural sources fro m the coarse particle pm10 standard would not be sufficiently protectiv of human health and would be difficult to distinguish and implement more stringent standards ensu re continued progress toward protection of public health with an adequate margin of safety as required by the caa in
