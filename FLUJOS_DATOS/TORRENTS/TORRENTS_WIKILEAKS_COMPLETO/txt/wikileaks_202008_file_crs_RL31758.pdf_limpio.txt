finance division updated february 12 2004 abstract when the 108th congress revisits the preemption provision this year there will be two key issues to consider first given the potential consequences for the ﬁnancial services market and consumers in the absence of an extension should congress extend the preemption provision of the fair credit reporting act second if congress decides to renew the law and continue to set federal standard it could consider retaining the current optout requirement of adopting an optin policy this report focuses on the second issue by examining the economics of ﬁnancial privacy in the context of the optoutoptin debate and considers the implications of regulatory changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31758congressional research service the library of congresscrs

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31758financial privacy the economics of optin vs optout summary rapid financial sector re structuring and accelerating technological change over the past decade have propelled the issue of financial privacy to the forefront of the legislative agenda recently the 108th congress addressed c oncerns regarding the sharing of consumer information among ffiliates of the same corporate group with the enactment of the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 fact under the fact act financial institutions are prohibited from sharing information for the purpose of marketing unless the c onsumer has been notified and provided an opportunity to opt out economic theory suggests that there are distinct benefits to information sharing in perfect market theory holds that competitive forces will deliver an economically efficient outcome however this conclu sion is contingent upon several assumptions that underlie the theoretical model if one or more of these assumptions are absent then the market can be said to have fa iled in these cases public policy can play an important role in prom oting economic efficiency in the market for financial information the two most releva nt types of market failures are externalities nd imperfect information if externalities exist and transaction costs are zero economic theory indicates that an efficient allocation of information sharing will occur when property rights over information are well defined optout effectively assigns the property rights to financial institutions while optin awards ownership to consumers in terms of economic efficiency theory holds that it is irrelevant who owns the pr operty rights to the information however if there are significant transaction costs then an economically efficient outcome can still be achieved when costs are minimized in this case an optout policy would more likely deliver an efficient allocation of information sharing in world with imperfect information economic theory asserts that an optout policy will fail to produce the most efficien t outcome since financial institutions will receive the economic gains from informati on sharing without paying consumers its true value therefore theory predicts that an optin policy would promote more economically efficient outcome if financial institutions have to obtain the explicit consent of their customers then they will have an incentive to offer some sort of compensation to their customers fo r the use of their information this report will be update d as events warrant

the forefront of the legislative agenda recently the 108th congress addressed c oncerns regarding the sharing of consumer information among ffiliates of the same corporate group with the enactment of the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 fact1 under the fact act information used for marketing purposes may not be shared unless the consumer has been notified and given the opportunity to opt out2 prior to the enactment of the fact act wh ich amends the fair credit reporting act fcra consumers could only opt out of having nontransaction nonexperience information shared during the fact act debate the fina ncial industry argued that there are numerous consumer benefits to the free fl ow of information thus advocating for information sharing policies to remain opt out meanwhile consumer groups argued for an optin policy that would require financial institutions to obtain consumers explicit consent before sharing certain information with their affiliates this report examines the economics of financial privacy in the context of the optoutoptin debate and considers the imp lications of both policies3 background according to the federal reserve americans made 715 billion

usc 34013422 the telephone cons umer protection ac t 47 usc 227 the grammleachbliley act 15 usc 68016809 and the fair credit reporting act 15 usc 16811681t 6 15 usc 1681d2a the fcra states that the definition of consumer report excludes any i report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report ii communication of that information among persons related by common ow nership or affiliated by corporate control or iii communication of other information among persons related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control if it is cl early and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer that the information may be communicated among such persons and the consumer is given the opportunity before the time that the inform ation is initially communicated to direct that such information not be communicated among such persons 7 the fcra does not provide any guidance as to what types of information may be included in the term transactions or experien ces furthermore none of the federal bank regulators nor the federal trade commission have promulgated regulations regarding the definition of information solely as to transac tions or experiences or what information may be included in such information every financia l transaction whether withdrawing money from an atm or settling purchase with credit card generates an electronic information trail as byproduct these data are collected by financial institutions and may be compiled into consumer profile data bases that potentially may be shared among corporate affiliates and other third parties in order for any noncash financial trans action to be comple ted consumers must willingly release their personal informati on to the other parties involved for example purchasing groceries with credit card requires the release of financial information to the grocery store the credit card company and the financial institution but then the critical question becomes who owns the rights to that information once the transaction has been completed in this regard there are several federal laws pertaining to consumers right to financial privacy including the fair credit reporting act fcra which regulates the collection use and disclosure of consumer credit information5 the fcra excludes the communication of certain types of information from the definition of consumer report including information shared among affiliates of the same corporate group6 the law distinguishes between transactions or experiences information and other information7 transactions or experiences information between an institution and consumer may be shar ed with affiliates nontransacti on non experience information obtained from third parties or from cons umer applications may not be shared unless the consumer has been notified and given the opportunity to opt out from having such information shared the recently enacted fact act amends the fcra to

in this ction are applicable to both affiliate and non affiliate information sharing marketing unless the consumer has been notified and given the opportunity to opt out8 the financial industry favor s federal privacy laws that leave the responsibility to consumers to opt out from having certain types of information shared in support of the optout view financial services providers argue that there are numerous consumer benefits to the free flow of information including enhanced customer service and better financial product design in addition there is evidence to suggest that these benefits are monetary as well in study conducted for the financial services roundtable fsr promin ent industry lobby group ernst and young estimated that the practice of information sharing saved 17 billion per year for the customers of the fsr members9 thus the financial industry argues that an optout policy ensures that consumers will receive these benefits ev if they do not realize they exist10 however many consumer advocacy gr oups have voiced concerns about the potential erosion of financial privacy associated with informationsharing activities among corporate affiliates in st consumer advocacy groups claim that financial privacy should be protected by restricting such informationsharing activities11 these groups argue that advances in information technology have caused an erosion in consumer privacy leading to more junk mail and telemarketing calls as well an elevated risk of identity theft thus consumer groups advocate an opt in policy that would require financial institutions to obtain consumers explicit consent before sharing certain information among their affiliates the economics of financial privacy12 the economic value of information economic theory suggests that there are benefits to information sharing for example producers might be able to expend fewer resources on marketing and product development when they have access to detailed consumer information that translates into lower prices and enhanced consumer choices similarly consumers will spend less time searching to identify products that meet their demands at ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31758crs4 13 for more detailed explanation of this economic argument see hal r varian theory of markets and privacy in privacy and selfregulation in the information age washington dc us department of commerce june 1997 online wwwntiadocgovreportsprivacyp rivacy_rpthtm visited feb 12 2004 competitive price therefore information sharing can play positive role in economic transactions to illustrate this point suppose one want s to buy new car the dealer has many different types of cars on the lot ranging from economy to luxury it is in ones own interest to let the salesman know what type of car is desired search costs are reduced since the salesman can immediately direct the buyer to that type of car on the dealers lot thus the transaction is made more efficient by releasing detailed information about ones pref erences to the salesman the same rationale can be applied to the market for financial services for consumers junk mail is equiva lent to the car salesman presenting sales pitch for every single vehicle on the lot in other words there exist excess search costs because seller has too little in formation about the buyers pr eferences if financial institution knows whether customer is interested in purchasing insurance or applying for new credit card then the financial institution can make better decisions on whether or not to supply that customer w ith informational materials just like the car example it is in the best interest of both parties to ve the seller know the customers preferences therefore consumers have an incentive to provide this information to financial institutions and financial institutions have an incentive to solicit this information from consumers13 economic efficiency although financial information sharin g can generate economic benefits consumer valuations of these benefits might differ depending on each individuals preferences over privacy some consumers might not feel comfortable sharing their personal information with financial companies either due to concern of identity theft or dislike of intrusive solicitati on while other consumers are less opposed to giving up degree of financial privacy in exchange for improved products or services similarly the magnitude of economic value generated by information sharing could differ across financial institutions thus it might be more costly to some financial services providers to offer gr eater degree of privacy to their consumers since it means forgoing potential economic gains under the traditional economic model competitive market forces will generally deliver an economically efficient outcome applying this theory to the market for financial information suggests that an fficient amount of information sharing will occur up to the point where the economic benefits of information sharing are balanced against the associated costs specifically if the economic value created by information sharing exceeds the value derived from financial privacy theory maintains that the economically efficient outcome would be to share informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31758crs5 14 public goods and imperfect competition are also often referred to in economics literature as market failures however financial information is excludable so it cannot be considered public good furthermore since th ere are few regulatory restrictions on entry and geographic expansion the financial serv ices industry is often considered to be competitive 15 for more information on this view see jeffrey m lacker the economics of financial privacy to opt out or opt in economic quarterly federal reserve bank of richmond volume 883 summer 2002in contrast if the economic value genera ted by financial institutions from access to consumer information does not exceed the consumer benefit from financial privacy then economic efficiency dictates that information not be shared market failures the conclusion that competitive markets will produce an efficient allocation of information sharing is contingent upon the assumptions that underlie the theoretical model the conditions for market to deliver an efficient outcome include freedom of entry and exit of producers the absence of external effects or externalities and perfect information however economists agree that these conditions often do not exist in practice for instance economic actors usually do not share symmetrical and complete understanding about the market including the economic impact of law or the market value of financia l information the absence of one or more of these conditions is said to result in market failure that is the market fails to deliver an economically efficient outcome in these cases prudent mix of government legislation and marketoriented policies can approximate the forces necessary to produce an efficient allocation of information sharing in the market for financial information the two most re levant types of market fa ilures are externalities and imperfect information14 externalities an externality occurs when transactions impact third parties without due compensation for example wh your neighbor paints the exterior of his or her house this action in turn raises the property value of your own home this is an example of favorable externality to you since you incur an economic gain without having to compensate your neig hbor for the expense of the improvements some economists have argued that there are externalities in the market for financial privacy since the information sharing that occurs between consumers and financial institutions does not affect other parties15 however this view does not consider the benefit financ ial institutions receive from accessing the information that is shared between consumers and nonfinancial companies recall the example of consumer purchasing groceries with credit card in order to settle the grocery bill the consumer must share credit card information with the store clerk but in todays technologydriven world every financia l transaction generates an electronic information trail financia l information is byproduct of noncash transactions and when compiled into databases generates value for financial institutions when shared among their affiliates therefore th economic benefit accr ued to financial institutions is analogous to the benefit you receive when neighbor paints his or her house since financial institutions do not purchase this information they arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31758crs6 16 the economics literature commonly refers to th is result as the coase theorem named after the nobel prizewinning economist ronald h coase who first proposed this idea the term property rights is general concept used in economics to represent ownership or control over good and s hould not be interpreted literally as legal definition of an individuals property rights 17 note that this argument depends upon the assu mption that transaction costs are zero the next section will show how the existence of transaction costs could affect the assignment of property rights 18 pl 106102 title v 113 stat 14361450 15 usc 68016809 for more information see crs report rs20185 privacy protection for customer financial information 19 the statements also describe an instituti ons policy about sharing financial information with other nonaffiliated third parties 20 wa lee optout notices give one thrill american banker july 10 2001receiving favorable externality from bein g able to access nd use the financial information when market externalities exist economic theory dictates that an efficient allocation can still be reached when property rights are well defined16 public policy effectively assigns the property righ ts over information through the choice of opt out or opt in under the current optout policy financial institutions have the right to share certain types of informati on about consumer wi th their affiliates consumers will choose to opt out when the value of their financial privacy exceeds the value derived from information sharing in this case competitive financial institutions will have an incentive to compete for those depositors by bidding up compensation for the use of their information similarly under the alternative optin policy consumers effectively hold the property rights to their information in this event financial institutions will have an incentive to purchase this information up to the point where the economic gain to them equals the cost of compensating consumers therefore regardless of how property rights are assigned the market can still deliver an economica lly efficient outcome17 imperfect information under the grammleachb liley act all financial institutions are required to send custom ers an annual privacy policy statement18 this document includes detailed scription of financial companys policies related to information sharing among affiliates19 therefore many economists would argue that all parties have full and complete information but some consumers claim that privacy notices are confusing and complex and consumers might therefore be inadequately informed bout their financial privacy rights further it is possible that consumers do not fully understand the potential market value of their financial information to the same extent as financial institutions that may explain why surveys reveal that majority of consumers place high value on their financial privacy yet banking industry estimates show that optingout rates hover around 5 percent20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31758crs7 21 lacker the economics of financial privacy to opt out or opt in p 11federal reserve economist jeffrey lacker di smisses this view he suggests that the reason for the inconsistencies between consumer privacy preferences as identified in surveys and their optout rates is because the value they place on financial privacy does not exceed the inconve nience of exercising their right to opt out21 lackers argument raises an interesting point but it remains possible that not all consumers are fully aware of their right to opt out therefore financial institutions could be benefitting from asymmetric inform ation about the rules of the game as well as the market value of c onsumers financial information in either case the economically efficient outcome w ould not be realized if consumers do not fully understand the market value of their financial information then they might not opt out even when given the opportunity nd financial institutions could be receiving economic gains from sharing this informa tion without paying consumers its true value if there is imperfect information pub lic policy might promote an efficient allocation of information sharing by assigning property rights to the consumer through an optin policy competitive financial institutions would presumably compete for depositors information by bi dding up the compensation for financial information to its true economic value in this environment an optin policy largely obviates the need for consumers to unders tand the actual market value of their information simply put if financial in stitution has to obtain the explicit consent of its customers then it will have an incentive to offer compensation to its customers for the use of their information thin margins and transaction costs although it is important to identify the ty pes of market failures that may prevent an efficient allocation of information sharing there are other important factors to consider when deciding upon the optimal policy solution for example if thin margins exist between the economic benefit to financial institutions from sharing information and the cost of doing so then an optin policy will cause the market for financial information to unravel the additional cost requi red by financial institutions to compensate consumers might eliminate the economic surplus from collecting and sharing financ ial information as result value would be lost as financial institutions ceased to share info rmation that would be detriment to financial sector profits as well as to c onsumers who might not receive the benefits of better choice in financial pr oducts and services in this event the effective control of financial information would more efficiently remain with the financial institutions by retaining the optout restricti on as provided in the current law another example is transaction costs in the previous section on externalities it was shown that in terms of economic effi ciency the assignment of property rights is irrelevant however this conclusion assumes that negotiation and transaction costs are zero which might not always be tr ue in practice there could be costs in terms of inconvenience and time to cons umers who want to opt out similarlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31758crs8 financial institutions could find it costly to solicit permission from every customer in order to use their information if th ere are significant transaction costs then economic theory suggests that an efficient allocation would be one in which the costs are minimized if transaction costs are likely to be greater for financial institutions than consumers in this case theory hol ds that the current optout policy would deliver the most economically efficient outcome conclusion economic theory suggests that there are distinct benefits to information sharing in perfect market competitive forces will generally deliv er an economically efficient outcome however this conc lusion is contingent upon several conditions that underlie the theoretical model if one or more of these conditions are absent then the market will fail to deliver an econo mically efficient outcome in these cases public policy plays an important role to promote an efficient outcome in the market for financial information the two most releva nt types of market failures are externalities nd imperfect information if externalities exist and transaction costs are zero then economic theo ry indicates that an efficient allocation of information sharing will occur when property rights are well defined optout effectively assigns the property rights over information to financial institutions while optin awards ownership to consumers in terms of economic efficiency it is irrelevant who owns the property rights to the information
