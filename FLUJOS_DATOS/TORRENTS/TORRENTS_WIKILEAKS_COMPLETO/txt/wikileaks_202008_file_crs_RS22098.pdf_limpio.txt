reconciliation is twostep process first reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directing the appr opriate committees to develop legislation achieving the desired budgetary outcomes second the resultant legislation is merged together by the house and senate budget committees into an omnibus reconciliation measure that is considered in the house and senate under expedited procedures in some instances instructed committees may report their legislation directly to the floor reconciliation was first used by the house and senate during the administration of president jimmy carter in calendar year 1980 for fy1981 as an optional procedure it has not been used every year during th period covering budget resolutions for fy1981 fy2007 18 omnibus reconciliation measures we re enacted into law and three were vetoed from 1980 into th 1990s reconciliation was used to reduce the deficit through reductions in mandatory spending increases in revenues or combination of the two in

increased the defi cit by an estimated 31 billion table 2 provides more detailed information on the nnual deficit impact of the acts over fiveyear period as figure 1 indicates the annual deficit impact of the reconciliation measures varied considerably for the three years in which the reconciliation acts reduced the deficit over the five year period in two instances 1990 and 1993 the acts were estimated to yield reduction in the deficit in the first applicable fiscal year in the other instance 1997 deficit increase 21 billion was estimated in the fi rst year thereafter deficit reduction occurred in each year in all three instan ces and the amounts escal ated over the period the largest amount of deficit reduction occurre d in the fifth and final year of the estimating period for each of the acts in th three years and amounted to 160 billion for the 1990 act 143 billion for the 1993 act and 91 billion for the 1997 actshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22098crs4 in each of these three cases the reconc iliation legislation imp lemented deficit reduction policies agreed to by congress and the president involving both spending and revenue changes in the case of spending in addition to mandato ry spending reductions in reconciliation the deficit reduction policies assumed reduction in the growth of discretionary spending over the ensuing years although discretionary spending is provided in annual appr opriations acts statutory limits on discretionary spending were established and extended in the three reconciliation acts accordingly cbo included estimates of the savings expected to occur in discretionary spending pursuant to the statutory limits in its assessments of the deficit impact of the reconciliation legislation the pattern differs for the two reconcilia tion measures enacted in 2006 under the legislation the deficit increased in each of the first three years ranging from 3 billion increase fy2008 to 26 billion increase fy2007 although the measures reduced the deficit in the fourth and fi fth years by 3 billion and 1 billi on respectively the deficit impact did not reflect the escalating decreases in the deficit that were estimated for the 1990 1993 and 1997 acts figure 2 shows that net savings in manda tory spending were an important component of the reconciliation legislation in all four year s amounting over five years to an estimated 75 billion in the 1990 act 77 billion in the 1993 act107 billion in the 1997 acts and 39 billion in the 2006 acts w ith regard to revenues the 1990 and 19932001000100 1st year 2nd year 3rd
