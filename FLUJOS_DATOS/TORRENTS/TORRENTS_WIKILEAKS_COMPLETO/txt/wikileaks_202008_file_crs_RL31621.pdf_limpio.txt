divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31621florida everglades restoration background on implementation and early lessons summary several complex water resource systems are receiving increasing intergovernmental and private sector effo rts to balance human and broader ecosystem values examples include the flor ida everglades san francisco bay sacramentosan joaquin river delta and the chesapeake bay among others the florida everglades is especially prominen t because of its inclusion of everglades national park and because human impacts in and around the park have caused substantial erosion of th balance and diversity of the original ecosystem government and private sector efforts to mitigate the effects of largescale human change in the broader everglades ecosystem are complex and sometimes contradictory undertakings complexities and c onflicts arise because of definitions and goals because of uncertainty about ach ieving desirable goal s because of costs and because of likely tradeoffs with tablished economic nd business activities the restoration initiative in the south florida ecosystem which includes the everglades is recent intergovernmental effort that attempts to address the ecological and socioeconomic factors i nvolved with ecosystem restoration an examination of what has been effective nd what has been less effective in ecosystem restoration efforts in the florida everglades may give insights on how to proceed in the implementation of othe r restoration projects after being reduced to half its original size by flood control projects agriculture and urban development the florida everglades is now targeted for large restoration effort by an unusual partnership among federa l state tribal and local stakeholders major step in this restoration effort was the authorization of the comprehensive everglades restoration plan cerp in the water resources development act of 2000 pl 106541 the objective of cerp is to restore the quantity quality distribution and timing of water supplies to natural areas without disrupting existing sources of water for agricultural and human needs there are several policy components within cerp that may be applicable to other ecosystem restoration efforts they include multiagency committees for coordination progra mmatic regulations for proj ect implementation adaptive assessment and

society for ecological restora tion science and policy working group the ser primer on ecological restoration 2002 9pflorida everglades restoration background on implementation and early lessons1 introduction in the last few decades the united states has devoted enormous effort and billions of dollars towards restoring some of our most important ecosystems such as the great lakes florida everglades everglades and chesapeake bay restoration efforts have originated in part from controversies surrounding water supply and quality federal laws ie laws that protect endangered species or regulate water quality and others sport and commercial fishing and environmental degradation ecosystem restoration initia tives have typically been accompanied with high expectations and publicity funding fo r these initiatives can amount to billions of dollars for each and the duration of these initiatives can be 25 years or more for example in the san francisco baysacramentosan joaquin river deltas california baydelta restoration prog ram known as calfed is expected to cost more than 78 billion with more than 24 billion exp ected from the federal government just for the first stage 7 years of 30year restoration effort issues such as the coordination of multiagency task forces public participa tion allocation of ecosystem resources eg water supplies and the science behind restoration projects have all been debated in ecosystem restoration efforts perhaps the greatest issue in ecosystem restoration efforts is that restoration can create losers people may lose or perceive loss of property income nd potential income among other things as result of restoration activities in some cases the threat of stakeholder loss has resulted in controversies or even barriers to restoration work definition ecosystem restoration is process or activity that initiates the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health integrity and sustainability2 ecosystem restoration implies the recognition of impairment or disturbance to an ecosystem to the extent that remediation is necessary in most cases ecosystems that require restoration have been degrad ed destroyed or transformed directly or indirectly by human activities for example an ecosystem can deteriorate from polluted waterways endangered species transformed landscapes eg forests to agricultural fields and human development eg urban areas roads or housinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31621crs2 3 preceding the time before the discovery of america by columbus ie before the development of european settlements in the americasecosystem restoration attempts to reverse the deterioration of an ecosystem and to some extent return it towards its predisturbed or precolumbian state3 ecosystem restoration does not necessarily mean the restoration of an ecosystem to its original state rather ecosystem restoration means human management that allows desirable uses without the ne gative impacts being incurred under the pre restoration regime once an ecosystem is recovering under desired trajectory human management is impor tant management may be required to counteract invasive species the impact of human activities climate change and other unforeseeable events one primary unknown of ecological restora tion is the actual process of how to do it studying and monitoring current restoration initiatives and recording the lessons from these initiatives can provide insights for restoration policy makers creating or changing ecosystem restor ation legislation may benefit from an understanding of the positive and negative asp ects of previous ecosystem restoration projects in this paper key policy compone nts of the ecosystem restoration effort in the south florida ecosystem which includes the everglades are examined to provide potential lessons for other ecosy stem restoration efforts government role ecosystem restoration effort s pose several challenges for governance in most cases largescale ecosyst em restoration initiatives cross political boundaries communities and agency jurisdictions generally several stakeholders ranging from environmentalists to users to government agen cies have an interest in restoration and its benefits restora tion efforts can result in changes to farming practices and urban development alterations in water supplie s and access to other natural resources eg minerals and timber and laws that create programs to mitigate environmental damage and improve infrastructure because of the diverse interest in restoration past restoration efforts have often been fragmented in dealing with specific problems or consequences of ecosystem degradati on instead of working on the root causes affecting the entire ecosystem the federal government has special role in coordinating multijurisdictiona l ecosystem restoration effo rts in large part because of its involvement in ltering natural systems eg flood control in the everglades and water transfers to the central valley in california the federal government also must respond to legal obligations under laws that protect endangered species and water quality additionally it has the capac ity to create multiag ency task forces employ the expertise of multiple federal agencies eg fish and wildlife service with respect to endangered species or the us army corps of engineers for construction and pr ovide funds for restoration projects congress plays key role in largescale ecosystem restoration efforts congress is generally responsible for authorizing fe deral agency involveme nt in restoration efforts and establishing guidelines for managing and implementing restoration projects in some cases such as in the everglades congress has role in authorizing individual restoration projects and thei r guidelines for implementation andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31621crs3 management ecosystem re storation efforts are gene rally based on improving or rehabilitating one or more ecosystem services eg water supply or habitat recovery for plant and animal populations congre ss can create guidelines for allocating ecosystem services eg regulating water supplies for farmers and the environment or in some cases congress may ensure the delivery of ecosystem services through legislative provisions eg water supply assurances for farmers lastly congress is responsible for authorizing and ppropriating federal funds for ecosystem restoration ecosystem restoration efforts in south florida after nearly 40 years of individual envi ronmental restoration projects in south florida the federal government along with state local and tribal entities has begun collaborative effort to restore the entire south florida ecosystem the comprehensive everglades restoration plan cerp authorized in the water resources development act of 2000 w rda 2000 pl 106541 was major step toward coordinated mu ltiagency ecosystem restor ation title vi of wrda 2000 outlines the coordination among va rious stakeholders involved in the restoration process identif ies funding responsibilities nd authorizes the creation of programmatic regulations which will detail the implementation process of restoration projects title vi of wrda 2000 also contains veral policy functions intended to facilitate interagency coordi nation satisfy stakeholder demands and ensure the goal of ecosystem restoration in some cases these policy functions are complex and have potential drawbacks ye t in other cases these functions have potential benefits and could be used as policy models for other ecosystem restoration projects the restoration of the everglades repres ents recent effort to deal with the myriad of issues related to ecosystem restoration described as the largest environmental project in ameri can history the restoration effort in the south florida ecosystem is expected to cost more than 14 billion and last 30 years restoration efforts in south florida have several attributes similar to restoration elsewhere multiple stakeholders are involved incl uding the federal state and local governments water supply and distribution is central issue the effort is considered solution to standing controversies or legal obligations and environmental restoration is promoted as the main goal experiences in restora tion efforts in south florida might be viewed as test case for future restoration projects indeed an examination of what has been effective and what has been less effective in restoration efforts in south florida may give insights on how to proceed in the successful development of other ecosy stem restoration projects factors threatening th florida everglades like many wetlands in the united st ates the wetlands of south florida including the everglades have been alte red by the growing demand for urban and agricultural water the encroachment of development into sensitive areas attempts to control flooding by state and federa l governments and invasion of nonnative species httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31621crs4 4 the south florida ecosystem is estimated to be 50 of its original size today 5 everglades national park was accepted for designation as world heritage site an international biosphere reserve and wetland of international significance 6 the everglades ecosystem includes everglades national park as well as many other areas in south florida that are low evation partially flooded wetlands 7 the us environmental protection agency s designated the biscayne aquifer which provides fresh water to over 35 million people as sole source aquifer sole source aquifer is the principal source of drinking water for community 1424e of the safe drinking water act pl 93523 42 usc 300h3 8 the act of june 30 1948 ch 771 62 stat 1171 authorized the first phase of the plan corresponding legislation was subsequently passe d by the state of flor ida florida statute chapter 378 1949 9 the central and southern florida flood contro l district was replaced by the south florida water management district which is under supervision of the florida department of environmental protection the south florida ecosystem suppor ts six million people huge tourism industry large agricultural economy and wide array of unique flora and fauna the south florida ecosystem covers 18000 s quare miles and consis ts of network of subtropical wetland landscapes which once stretched from orlando to florida bay approximately 200 miles see figure 14 it is also home to the everglades which are regarded as one of the worl ds most valuable and unique wetlands5 the everglades are located in the southern portion of the south florida ecosystem that consists of disjointed freshwater mars hes between the southern tip of lake okeechobee and the florida bay6 an important ecological process in the south florida ecosystem is the movement of freshwater from lake okeechobee south to the florida bay in moving sheet that replenishes marshlands and sw amps this shallow sheet of water moved across the everglades few inches per second and in addition to rainfall was responsible for recharging the biscayne aquifer and nourishing plant and animal life7 human development and manipulation of water flows have disrupted the natural flow of this sheet of water partly in response to flooding and the n eed for agricultural lands the us army corps of engineers corps was asked by c ongress to divert water in the everglades specifically water flow in the everglades was altered to cont rol flooding to open land for agriculture and to provide water supplies for urban areas the cornerstone of this effort was the fl ood control proj ect act of 19488 this project initiated several years of cons truction by the corps and the central and southern florida flood control district to cr eate nearly 1000 miles of canals 720 miles of levees and over 200 water control structures eg dikes dams and pumping stations9 in addition nearly 700000 acres of land were dr ained and designated for agricultural use in what is now called the everglad agricultural area eaa another 900000 acres were used to construct five wa ter conservation areas wcas which werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31621crs5 10 water conservation areas are shallow reservoi rs of water that filter agricultural waters from the eaa before they head to urban areas or everglades national park figure 1 the south florida ecosystem past and presentdesigned to recharge well fields prevent flooding and provide habitat for plant and animal life10 source adapted from map created by the south florida ecosystem task force the manmade water distribution syst em created in south florida led to environmental degradation this system reduced water flow to the everglades by nearly twothirds by channelizing water to agricultural and urban areas and the atlantic ocean the alteration of water flow to the everglades is widely believed to have degraded the environment for exam ple studies have shown that the wading bird population has declined by 90 since alterations to the south florida ecosystem were implemented further there are more than 69 species in south florida including the loggerhead turtle florida pa nther and wood stork which are listed as endangered or threatened species under the federal endangered species act 16 usc 15311543 pl 93205 as amended the everglades also suffer from mercury contamination i nvasive plants and high levels of phosphorous httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31621crs6 11 similar evolution led to the creation of the calfed baydelta program and to lessor extent the chesapeake bay restorati on effort at roughly the same time 12 the florida warren henderson act of 1984 au thorized the protection of state wetlands and the florida surface water improvement and management act of 1987 authorized the creation of plans to clean state tuaries bays lakes and rivers 13 the working group was initiated by the secretary of the interior to coordinate restoration efforts in the everglades that were expected to modify the effects of engineering projects that had diverted water from the everglades and to reduce agricultural pollutants in water entering the everglades 14 the south florida ecosystem restorati on task force has 14 members one each from the department of the interior department of justice department of transportation

series of individual activities by various state and federal agencies to coordinated multistakeholder effort in the late 1990s11 restoration efforts in the south florida ecosystem were initiated by state and federal programs before the authorization of cerp in wrda 2000 for example florida passed laws that authorized the cleanup of its bays estuaries lakes and rivers and authorized the protection of certain wetlands in the public interest12 restoration projects that involved construc tion and regulation of hydrology in the south florida ecosystem began in 1992 with partnership between the state and the corps to restore natural water flow th rough the kissimmee river and its floodplain later in 1994 the state authorized othe r construction and re gulation projects to restore portions of the s outh florida ecosystem federal involvement in re storing the south florida ecosystem originated with projects aimed at restoring specific waterw ays or wetlands one impetus for federal involvement began in 1989 when the federal government sued the state of florida for not enforcing state water quality standards for agricultural runoff entering everglades national park this lawsuit resu lted in pledge that created federal and state partnership with local agriculture to improve water quality increase water quantity and construct artificial wetlands to filter pollutants from agricultural run off it also led to an understanding th at improving water quality in the everglades was an ecosystem problem that cro ssed property boundaries and required the cooperation of various stakehol ders to coordinate this ffort to restore water quality in south florida commission termed the working group consisting of representatives from various federa l and state agencies was created13 the water resources development act of 1996 wrda 1996 pl 104303 33 usc 22012330 changed the working group into task force by expanding its membership to include state local and tribal

legi slation related to the restoration efforts directing the corps to develop compre hensive plan known as the restudy for restoring protecting and preserving the south florida ecosystem the choice to involve the corps in restoration efforts st emmed from the realiza tion that restoration problems in south florida had hydrolog ical solutions since the corps was responsible for constructing and operating the existing wa ter distribution and supply infrastructure and had expertise in hydrol ogical projects it was deemed the best agency to lead the restoration process the restudy represented the first attempt to address environmental restoration in south florida in multiagency ecosystemlevel framework congress authorized the implementation of portion of the restudy in title vi of wrda 2000 this portion was entitled the comprehensive everglades restoration plan cerp15 and focused on restoring the natural hydrological functions and water quality while maintaining water supplies for natural agricultural and urban needs16 cerp contains 68 components that are expected to be implemented over 35year span cerp seeks to vastly increase the storag capacity and water supply for the natural system as well as for agricultural and urban needs increased water flow to natural areas as result of cerp is also expected to improve the environment by restoring and increasing habitat fo r native flora and fauna parties involved in the restoration effort one of the advancements in restorati on planning and implementation is the understanding that all stakeholders eg environmentalists farmers must be involved and committed to sustain restora tion efforts stakeholder involvement creates the possibility for consensus fac ilitates coordination nd provides an arena for discussion and interaction among stakehol ders with different interests several stakeholders are involved in the restora tion effort in south florida including environmentalists agriculturalists and federal state tribal and local governments most stakeholders have expr essed their desire to restor the south florida ecosystem but differ on their views of who should pay for restoration the priorities of project implementation water alloca tion assurances and the ba lance of water supply for natural and human needs federal government in restoration initiatives the federal government can play role in establishing framework for governance providing partial or full funding and coordinating st akeholder participation th rough advisory committees the federal government is often partner in ecosystem restoration activities because of the numerous federal agencies with jurisdiction in areas of fish and wildlife water allocation and construc tion and federal lands further if federal laws are applicable within an ecosystem eg endangered species and water quality the federal government and certain agencies usually b ecome involved the federal role in the everglades restoration effort is

place agriculture benefits from ecosystem services that provide water supplies and healthy soils however agriculture may contribute to ecosystem degradation by converting natural habitats to agricultural fields and by contaminating water supplies with fertilizers and pesticides as well as sediments in recen t years farmers and ranchers have generally responded to ecosystem re storation efforts by incorporating best management practices bmps and using technologically improved crops that require less fertilizer or pesticides the dominant agricultural activities in th everglades are sugarcane production livestock ranching and vege table farming sugarcane production considered the largest agricultural commodity in terms of value in the everglades25 requires an abundant water

water to natural areas they believe that restoration efforts shoul d give equal priority to th natural agricultural and urban water needs26 some agriculturalists also want certainty in water allocation amounts and would like targets established for future water needs27 according to some farmers if water deliveries fluctuate annually obtaining credit for farm operations may become difficult and the uncertainty of future crop production and personal income may increase28 to support restoration activities farmers and ranchers in south florida have begun to adopt bmps to reduce phosphorous and pesticides into water supplies these practices are employed voluntarily and have been developed by researchers to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture while not threatening

decades in south florida to restore parts of the south flor ida ecosystem restoration of the ecosystem progressed slowly in part because restor ation projects focused on specific problems in localized areas in some cases agenci have disagreed on how to operate and implement restoratio n activities and overlapping fforts became apparent in an effort to reduce conflicts and foster interagency dialogue the south florida ecosystem restorati on task force sfertf was cr eated in 1993 by the secretary of the interior the purpose of sfertf is to coordinate stra tegies policies and plans for restoration efforts in south florida this task force was formalized into law by wrda 1996 and includes representatives from 12 federal agencies the state of florida the miccosukee and seminole trib the south florida water management district and local governments the task force resolves conflicts among stakeholders tracks and assesse s restoration projects and fosters public participation the task force is assisted by various committees that have specific functions in the restoration effort see table 1 some committees focus on stakeholder coordination management and policy nd others focus on the science and the impacts of restoration activities the ta sk force and the wo rking group sub committee of the task force oversee these committees and in some cases committees oversee issue teams or subgroups of their own creation see figure 2 as authorized by 520f of wrda 1996 these co mmittees are exempt from the federal advisory committee act faca pl 92463 5 usc appendix32 and have members appointed by fede ral state tribal local nd private stakeholders sub committees to sfertf are either temporarily or permanently created by the working group and generally have specific tasks

future water supplies may result in farmers not being able to plan for future crops and scientists not being able to estimate the recovery potential for natural areas the programmatic regulations do not hold any agency accountable for delays and do not guarantee the expeditious completion of restoration projects monitoring and adaptive management ecological systems are complex and understanding how they may respond to management efforts will always carry an expected level of uncertainty for these and other reasons ecosystem restor ation generally is undertaken with range of expected uncertainty in the restorati on process eg scientific uncertainty in the proficiency of some restoration projects specifica lly restoration effo rts may require the application of untested technologies nd may uncover unforeseen circumstances that may warrant change in the initial restoration strategy indeed some argue that identifying and eliminating all uncertainties i nvolved with restor ation is probably impossible trying to address all potential uncertainties some argue may delay the restoration process consume time and money and lead to further ecosystem degradation others argue that uncertaintie s must be reduced as much as possible with sound scientific studies before funds are devoted to restoration activities funds and time should not be spent on projects that are

tailed studies will be restricted to requests made by the task force summary of pote ntial benefits an expected high level of scientific uncertainty is common criticism of cerp monitoring and adaptive management can allow agencies to learn lessons from th restoration process and projects and incorporate them into cerp the programmatic regulations are expected to provide guidelines and mechanisms for incorporating adaptive management with these guidelines in place the process of implementing new information and changes could reduce delays in project implementation an independent panel monitori ng the progress of cerp may enhance the scientific integrity of the restoration effort through adaptive management pilot projects are expected to be created and tested to measure the potential for larger projects with high scientific uncertainty summary of potential disadvantages adaptive management may allow the corps and the sfwmd to change estimated goals of water supplies or distribution this can increase uncertainty in water supplies for farmers and local governments who need assuran ces for water deliveries restoration goals may lose some value and integrity since technical uncertainties can be used to expl ain why restoration projects may not reach their goals the responsibility for successful restoration can be diluted if adaptive management is used to explain shortcomings of restoration projects and activities the promise of adaptive management can be used to justify the implementation of restor ation projects with high level of scientific uncertainty

restore the ecosystem 48 existing legal sources of water have not been defined in wrda 2000 or the programmatic regulations some believe that this term needs to be clarified so that values of water supplies before wrda 2000 was enacted can be quantitatively determinedstakeholders eg california baydelta and klamath basin as well as the everglades water allocation strategi seek to identify compromises between competing stakeholders and generate commitments to water allocation plan components of water alloca tion strategy may include ssurances for the delivery of future water supplies or the maintenance of current water supply levels water assurances could be tied to rainfall and snowmelt levels from the previous year or be based on quantitative values eg 70 of water flow diverted to agricultural areas water assurances are important b ecause they can justify plans for ecological restoration allow farmers to securely invest in cultivati on or ranching and increase the security of water supplies for urban areas the expected result of cerp will be to deliver sufficient water to the natural system without sacrificing the current wa ter needs of agricultural and urban areas cerp is expected to accomplish this by primarily capturing and storing excess freshwater currently being discharged to the ocean via canals and using it to restore the natural hydrological functions of the south florida ecosystem to accomplish this cerp must control the quantity quality distribution and timing of water deliveries to stakeholders the corps estimates that 80 of the additional water supplies ie water beyond the existing needs ge nerated from restor ation efforts will be used to benefit the natural system and the remaining 20 will be used for agricultural and urban needs45 to deliver these demands for water cerp will rely on assurances specified in wrda 2000 and strategy for alloca ting water supplies that will be specified in the programmatic regulations46 water assurances assurances for water delivery serve to meet concerns that existing water supplies and flood prot ection will be lowere d when restoration projects are implemented in addition assura nces seek to guaran tee that newly re allocated water from restoration projects will first be distributed to natural areas47 there are three primary policy mechanisms that attempt to provide assurances forwater delivery in the everglades firs t title vi 601h5 of wrda 2000 states that existing legal sources and amounts of water cannot be depleted by cerp unless substitute source of water equivalent in quantity and quality is found to replace the original 48 second an agreement that new wa ter generated from cerp first will be allocated to the natural system for restor ation purposes before being

system is to be guaranteed under state water laws for each project 601h4 water allocation strategy determining the quantitative allocation of water for environmental agricultural and urba n needs is controversial issue in the everglades and many other places most stakeholders want to know what quantitative values of water they can ex pect to receive annually although wrda 2000 assures stakeholders that water levels will not fall below existing levels some stakeholders notably farmers and municipal water utilities are concerned that future demands for water may exceed current demands this issue is addressed by the corps and the sfwmd in the proposed programmatic regula tions water made available from restoration projects will be quantified according to guidelines established by guideline memorandum the programmatic regulations provide direction for the development of guide line memoranda yet do not provide specific formulas for determining water allocation values water allocation values are expected to be calculated according to the pre cerp baseline the precerp baseline is the estimated hydrological conditions in south florida before the enactment of cerp this baseline is expected to be determined through models nd hydrological records and take into account seasonal variability in water supplies land use popul ation and water dema nd as well as other factors relating to water di stribution in south florida49 after water allocation values are determined from the guideline memo randum and the precerp baseline the project implementation report is expected to identify the appropriate quantity timing distribution of water allocated to the environment other uses eg agriculture and urban areas and storage the reservation of water for the environment will be implemented by florida water management districts under the authority of state law based on values listed in the project imp lementation report project cooperation agreement between the corps and the nonfe deral sponsor is to be made before project construction can take place the project cooperation ag reement is expected to serve as contract between the co rps and the nonfederal sponsor that the allocation of water to the na tural system from each project will be available for the duration of the project summary of pote ntial benefits restoration is the primary federa l objective for the south florida ecosystem water assurances support this objective by seeking to channel reallocated water from restoration projects to natural areas assurances that existing

that address future water needs for farmers and cities lack of quantitative assurances for water allocation in the programmatic regulations may create uncertainty in how much water is going to be allocated for ur ban agricultural and environmental needs50 the assumed flexibility of water allocation values may increase uncertainty the precerp baseline will be based on models and data which may include uncertainties uncertainty in the precerp baseline will create uncertainty in the amount s of water expected to be re directed from restoration projects funding initial and longterm funding is generally viewed as critical aspect of implementing large ecosystem restoration project some advocates of ecosystem restoration initiatives believe that f unding must be guaranteed for the longterm duration of the initiative if re storation is to be successful funding for large scale ecosystem restoration efforts is generally distributed among stak eholders however in most cases the majority of the funding has come fro m federal and state governments from federa l perspective funding for re storation efforts is typically given to specific agencies to carry out restoration activities or given
