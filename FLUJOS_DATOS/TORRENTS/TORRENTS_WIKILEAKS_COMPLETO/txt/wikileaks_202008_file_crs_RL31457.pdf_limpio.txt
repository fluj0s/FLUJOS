division march 27 2008 abstract state and local governments issue debt for most large public capital projects such as new schools public buildings and roads on occasion state and local governments will issue debt for projects whose purpose is less public in nature such as privately owned and operated multifamily residential housing nevertheless these projects are often aﬀorded the same tax privilege as debt issued for strictly government owned and operated projects congress limits the use of taxexempt bonds for private activities because of concern about the overuse of taxexempt private activity bonds the taxexempt bonds issued for qualiﬁed private activities are limited by the type of activity ﬁnanced and the volume of debt used for such activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31457g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

bonds as either governmental bonds or private activity bonds governmental bonds are for projects that benefit the general public and private activity bonds are for projects that primarily benefit private entities the federal tax code allows state and local governments to use taxexempt bonds to finance certain projects that would be considered private activities the private activities that can be financed with taxexempt bonds are called qualified private activities congress uses an annual state volume cap to limit the amount of taxexempt bond financing generally and restricts the types of qualified private activities that would qualify for taxexempt financing to selected projects defined in the tax code although this report does not include comprehensive economic analysis of taxexempt private activity bonds it does provide some background on the reasons for the federal limitation on tax exempt bonds for private activities in addition this report explains the rules governing qualified private activity bonds describes the federal limitations on private activity bonds lists the qualified private activities and reports each states private activity bond volume cap since private activity bonds were defined in 1968 the number of eligible private activities has been gradually increased from 12 activities to 21 the state volume capacity limit has increased from 150 million and 50 per capita in 1986 to the greater of 262095 million or 85 per capita in 2008 because of the 262095 million floor most small states 21 states and the district of columbia are allowed to issue relatively more private activity bonds based on the level of state personal income than larger states 29 states also more recent additions to the list of qualified activities have been exempt from statebystate cap and subject to national aggregate cap for more on taxexempt bonds generally see crs report rl30638 taxexempt bonds description of state and local government debt by steven

bonds or private activity bonds generally the interest on state and local governmental bonds is exempt from taxation whereas the interest on private activity bonds is not taxexempt 1 however the federal tax code allows state and local governments to use taxexempt bonds to finance certain projects that would otherwise be classified as private activities2 the private activities that can be financed with taxexempt bonds are called qualified private activities3 the current tax exemption for qualified private activities has evolved over time two events however critically shaped the current treatment of private activity bonds first in 1968 congress passed the revenue and expenditure control act of 1968 pl 90364 which established the basis for the current definition of private activity bonds after persistent challenges to the right of the federal government to restrict state and local government debt following the 1968 act the supreme court agreed to hear case in 1988 that changed the nature of the federal tax treatment of state and local government debt in that case the state of south carolina challenged the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 pl 97248 the 1982 act required that state and local government taxexempt debt must be registered 4 the registration requirement was viewed by the states south carolina in particular as an unconstitutional intrusion on the ability of states to issue debt the supreme court held that the registration requirement for nonfederal government though federally taxexempt debt was constitutional in somewhat of surprise to observers at the time the court went beyond the registration ruling and also held the following 1 the taxexemption is provided for in 26 usc 103 2 the internal revenue service irs uses two part test to classify an activity as private activity this test will be explained in more detail later in the re port generally activities are classified as private because private individuals and businesses benefit directly from debt issued by the state or local government 3 26 usc 141 describes requirements for qualified private activity bonds 4 before this act was passed state and local government usually issued bearer bonds that paid principal and interest to whomever presented the bond to the issuer or the issuers agent usually bank in contrast registered bond includes the owners name on the bond and change in ownership must be registered with the issuer or the issuers agent for full discussion of the impact of the south carolina vs baker case on taxexempt bonds see bruce davie and dennis

to pay taxes on income they earn from the bonds and states have constitutional entitlement to issue bonds paying lower interest rates than other issuers 5 the ruling confirmed that congress can restrict issuance of state and local taxexempt debt and could even rescind the taxexemption altogether6 nevertheless outright repeal of the tax exemption is unlikely instead congress has limited legislative action to modification of the existing rules and definitions governing taxexempt bonds for private activities generally congress limits the amount of taxexempt debt that can be used for privateactivities and restricts the type of private activities that can be financed with taxexempt bonds congress can and does encourage selected private activities by exempting the activity from the volume cap or by allowing taxexempt financing for the private activity g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 as noted above congress uses two primary means to restrain the use state and local debt for private activities an annual state volume limit or separate national aggregate limit and restrictions on the type of qualified private activities the private activity bond volume limit which originated in the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 was implemented because congress was extremely concerned with the volume of taxexempt bonds used to finance private activities 7 the limit and the list of qualified activities were both modified again under the tax reform act of 1986 tra 1986 pl 99514 at the time of the tra 1986 modifications the joint committee on taxation identified the following specific concerns about taxexempt bonds issued for private activities8 the bonds represent an inefficient allocation of capital the bonds increase the cost of financing traditional governmental activities the bonds allow higherincome persons to avoid taxes by means of taxexempt investments and the bonds contribute to mounting federal revenue losses the inefficient allocation of capital arises from the economic fact that additional investment in taxfavored private activities will necessarily come from investment in other public projects for example if bonds issued for mass commuting facil ities did not receive special tax treatment the bond funds could be used for other government projects such as schools or other public infrastructure the greater volume of taxexempt private activity bonds then leads to the second joint committee on taxation concern higher cost of financing traditional government activities investors have limited resources thus when the supply of taxexempt bond investments increases issuers must 5 state of south carolina vs ja baker secretary of the treasury supreme court of the united states april 20 1988 485

government activities in economic terms issuers raising interest rates to attract investors is analogous to retailer lowering prices to attract customers the final two points are less important from an economic efficiency perspective but do cause some to question the efficacy of using taxexempt bonds to deliver federal subsidy taxexempt interest is worth more to taxpayers in higher brack ets thus the tax benefit flows to higher income taxpayers which leads to less progressive income tax regime the revenue loss generated by taxexempt bonds also expands the deficit or shrinks the surplus persistent budget deficit ultimately leads to generally higher interest rates as the government competes with private entities for scarce investment dollars higher interest rates further increase the cost of all debt financed state and local government projects supporters of taxexempt bonds for private activities counter that the benefit from taxexempt bonds exceeds both the explicit the revenue loss and implicit the inefficient allocation of capital costs of the taxexemption the debate surrounding use of taxexempt bonds will continue well beyond the current congress proponents and opponents of taxexempt bonds generally and private activity bonds specifically both explore methods of modifying the rules for private activity bonds to advance their respective positions because the rules and definitions for private activity bonds are complex uncertainty about the potential effects of the proposed modifications to those rules is common this report will not attempt to either justify or criticize the existence of or use of taxexempt private activity bonds 9 instead the report provides brief review of bond fundamentals and more detailed examination of the rules and definitions surrounding private activity bonds to help clarify the impact of the of those modifications

governmental purposes and for qualified private activities are special because unlike corporate bonds or us treasury bonds the bond buyer does not have to include the interest income from the bond in federal gross taxable income 10 the bond buyer is willing to accept lower interest rate because the interest inco is not subject to federal income taxes the lower interest rate arising from the taxexempt status subsidizes state and local investment in capital projects for example if the taxable bond interest rate is 700 the aftertax return for taxpayer in the 35 income tax bracket who buys taxable bond is 455 thus taxexempt bond that offers 455 interest rate would be just as attractive to the investor as the taxable bond all else equal for more on taxexempt bonds generally see crs

rate was 442 see table 1 11 the actual interest rate spread the difference between the two interest rates is smaller empirically than the earlier example because many taxexempt bond buyers are below the 35 marginal tax bracket individuals in income tax brackets below 35 would require higher taxexempt bond interest rate because lower tax rates mean less tax savings from taxexempt bonds12 the lower tax bracket taxpayers bid up the tax exempt bond interest rate closer to the taxable bond interest rate table 1 reports the interest rate of corporate bonds and taxexempt municipal bonds of like maturity for 1980 through 2007 bonds issued by state and local governments are usually called municipal bonds by the investment community ge nerally the two rates move in tandem with the taxable

bonds 12 for example someone in the 10 income tax bracket would find taxexempt bonds attractive only if the interest rate were 637 or looking at the problem from different perspective the marginal tax rate below which taxexempt bonds are not attractive is 1658 thus taxpayers in margin tax brackets below this rate would not find taxexempt bonds attractive investments because the market interest rate on municipal bonds would be too low taxpayers in the 15 marginal tax bracket would receive higher aftertax return though buying taxable bonds and paying taxes on the interest income at the 15 rate

private activity bonds is included in the alternative minimum tax amt base the amt is tax that is levied in parallel with the income tax and is intended to ensure that taxpayers with many deductions and exemptions pay minimum percentage of their gross income in taxes because private activity bonds are included in the amt the bonds usually carry slightly higher interest rate approximately 50 basis points 13 higher than do taxexempt governmentpurpose bonds all else equal14 however the private activity bond rate is still lower than the taxable bond rate for more on the amt see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax for individuals by steven maguire repealing the amt or exempting some bonds issued for qualified private activities from the amt would increase investor demand for those bonds the increased attractiveness of those bonds would eventually lead to lower interest costs for the issuer of private activity bonds

private entity test satisfying both conditions would mean the bonds are taxable private activity bonds bonds are private activity bonds and not taxexempt if both of the following conditions are met16 use test more than 10 of the proceeds of the issue are to be used for any private business use and security test if the payment on the principal of or the interest on more than 10 of the proceeds of such issue is under the terms of such issue or any underlying arrangement directly or indirectly secured by any interest in 1 property used or to be used for private business use or 2 payments in respect to such property or if the payment is to be derived from payments whether or not to the issuer in respect of property or borrowed money used or to be used for private business use if bond issue passes both tests the bonds are taxable and would carry higher interest rate nevertheless bond issues that pass both tests can still qualify for taxexempt financing if they are identified in the tax code as qualified private activities thus when those in the bond community refer to taxexempt private activity bonds the more technically correct reference is taxexempt qualified private activity

activities are granted special status in the tax code see table 2 these activities are called qualified private activities because they qualify for taxexempt financing even though they would likely

originally defined by the revenue and expenditure control act of 1968 the tax reform act of 1986 kept most of the activities listed in the 1968 act and reorganized the private activity bond section of

legislated that the interest payments on industrial development bonds idbs the original private activity bonds were to be includ ed in taxable income this was shift from the previous internal revenue service irs position which held that the interest on these bonds was not taxable income the motivation behind the change offered in the 1968 act was based on the theory that industrial development bonds described in the proposed irs regulations were not obligations of state or any political subdivision within the meaning of section 103 since the primary obligor was not state or political subdivision 17 the 1968 act also 1 established the basis for the current private use and private security tests 2 created exceptions to the taxability provision for small issuers 3 and specified group

prompted congress to create taxadvantaged economic development zone intended to encourage investment and rebuilding in the gulf region the gulf opportunity zone goz is comprised of the counties where the federal emergency management agency fema declared the inhabitants to be eligible for individual and public assistance based on proportion of state personal income the katrinaaffected portion of the goz represents approximately 73 of uisianas economy 69 of mississippis and 18 of alabamas 21 specifically the gulf opportunity zone ac t of 2005 pl 10935 goza 2005 contains two provisions that would expand the amount of private activity bonds outstanding and language to relax the eligibility rules for mortgage revenue bonds the most significant is the provision to increase the volume cap see table 3 for private activity bonds issued for hurricane katrina recovery in alabama louisiana and mississippi identified as the gulf opportunity zone or go zone goza 2005 would add 2500 per person in the federally declared katrina disaster areas in which the residents qualify for individual and public assistance the increased volume capacity would add approximately 22 billion for alabama 78 billion for louisiana and 48 billion for mississippi in aggregate over the next five years the legislation defines qualified project costs that can be financed with the bond proceeds as 1 the cost of any qualified residential rental project 26 sec 142d and 2 the cost of acquisition construction reconstruction and renovation of i non residential real property including fixed improvements associated with such property and ii public utility property 26 sec 168i10 in the goz the additional capacity would have to be issued before january 1 2011 the provision is estimated to cost 1556 billion over the 20062015 budget window 22 the second provision allows for advance refunding of certain taxexempt bonds under goza 2005 governmental bonds issued by alabama louisiana and mississippi may be advance refunded an additional time and exempt facility private activity bonds for airports docks and wharves once private activity bonds are otherwise not eligible for advance refunding following is brief description of advance refunding and how the goza 2005 provision confers significant tax benefit to the gulf states refunding is the practice of issuing new bonds to buy back outstanding bonds to potentially lower interest costs advance refunding is the practice of allowing the new bonds to be outstanding for longer than 90 days advance refunding thus allows for the existence of two sets of federally taxexempt bond issues to be outstanding at the same time for single project goza 2005 allows the states of alabama louisiana and mississippi to advance refund 1125 billion 45 billion and 225 billion respectively this provision was estimated to cost 741 million 21 see crs report rl33154 the impact of hurricane katrina on the state budgets of alabama louisiana and mississippi by steven

qualified private activities if the bonds that were originally issued as taxexempt are found to longer qualify meaning that they pass both the security and use tests the interest on the bonds becomes taxable technically bond holders are the recipient of the tax benefit and are responsible for remitting forgone taxes to the treasury when taxexempt bond fails to qualify retroactive taxability finding means all previous tax benefits to the bond holder would have to be returned to the treasury prospective taxability finding means all future interest payments would be taxable to the bond holder however in most cases the irs will settle the apparent violation by requiring that the issuer not the bond holders pay monetary penalty and that the issuer change the circumstances that led to the noncompliance finding 24 g25g145g138g157g561g11g156g561g157g145g142g561g18g155g146g159g138g157g142g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g162g561g24g152g149g158g150g142g561g5g138g153g501g344g347g561 the federal government has limited the amount of private activity bonds that states can issue to subset of the 21 activities listed in table 2 and to ez bonds the third column of table 2 identifies the 13 activities of the 21 that are subject to an annual state volume cap the annual cap was increased from the greater of 50 per capita or 150 million in 2000 to the greater of 85 per capita or 262095 million in 2008 and is now adjusted for inflation for small states the 262095 million minimum provides more generous volume cap than the per capita allocation table 3 lists the volume cap amount in 2007 and 2008 for all states and territories and compares the 2008 cap to state personal income in 2007 of the 13 activities subject to an annual volume cap two are treated differently than the others and two others are subject to separate cap first states are required to count only 25 of the bonds issued for highspeed intercity rail facilities 26 usc 142i against the annual cap if the facility is
