deduct state and local real estate taxes personal property taxes and income taxes from federal income when calculating taxable income in addition temporary deduction for sales taxes in lieu of income taxes expired december 31 2007 the federal deduction for state and local taxes results in the federal government paying part of these taxes through lower federal tax collections theory would suggest that taxpayers are willing to accept higher state and local tax rates and greater state and local public spending because of lower federal income taxes arising from the deduction in addition there is some evidence that state and local governments rely more on these deductible taxes than on nondeductible taxes and fees for services repealing the deductibility of state and local taxes would affect state and local government fiscal decisions albeit indirectly generally state and local public spending would decline although the magnitude of the decline is uncertain and repealing the deduction for state and local taxes would shift the federal tax burden away from lowtax states to hightax states maintaining the current deductibility would continue the indirect federal subsidy for statelocal spending expanding deductibility such as extending the sales tax deduction option or allowing non itemizers to deduct taxes paid would likely increase the subsidy for state and local spending the sales tax deduction option would primarily benefit taxpayers in states without an income tax that are already itemizing the effect of allowing nonitemizers to deduct taxes paid would depend on the type of deductible tax for example property taxes are only paid directly by property owners whereas all consumers pay sales taxes in states that levy sales tax on december 20 2006 the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 was enacted extending the sales tax deduction option for the 2006 and 2007 tax years in the 110 th congress legislation has been introduced that would 1 extend the

taxes however were not introduced until 1932 mississippi was the first and deduction for those taxes for individuals was not explicitly stated in the tax code until passage of the revenue act of 1942 pl 77753 the deductibility provision was frequently modified over the years including the introduction of the standard deduction in lieu of itemizing deductions in 1944 but significant revision did not occur until 1964 with enactment of the revenue act of 1964 pl 88272 before the 1964 act deduction was allowed for all state and local taxes paid or incurred within the taxable year except those taxes explicitly excluded after the 1964 act only taxes explicitly mentioned were deductible included in the list of deductible taxes were state and local taxes on real and personal property income general sales and the sale of gasoline diesel fuel and other motor fuels new subsection in the 1964 act spelled out the test for deductibility of general sales taxes first the tax must be sales tax tax on retail sales and second it must be general that is imposed at one rate on the sales of wide range of classes of items items could refer either to commodities or services the deductibility provision remained largely unchanged until the sales tax deduction was repealed by the tax reform act of 1986 tra 1986 pl 99514 one of the primary goals of tra 1986 was to broaden the base of the federal income tax eliminating the deduction for all state and local taxes paid was one of the policy options considered to broaden the tax base the final version of tra 1986 repealed the deduction for general sales taxes but preserved the deduction for ad valorem property taxes and income taxes the joint committee on taxation jct summary of tra 1986 suggested that congress chose to repeal the sales tax deduction and not income or property taxes because only general sales taxes were deductible and not selective sales taxes eg tobacco and alcohol taxes which created economic inefficiencies arising from individuals changing consumption patterns in response to differential taxation the deduction was not allowed for taxes paid at the wholesale level and passed forward to the consumer thus creating additional inequities and inefficiencies the sales tax deduction was administratively burdensome for taxpayers who chose to collect receipts to justify sales tax deduction claims and the alternative sales tax deduction tables generated by the internal revenue service irs did not accurately reflect individual consumption patterns thereby diminishing the equitability of the tax policy 2 the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca 2004 pl 108357 reinstated deductible sales tax in lieu of income taxes3 the in lieu of treatment in ajca 2004 is in contrast to the in addition to treatment in pretra 1986 tax law the concerns noted above would still hold secondary concernpresented during the debate before repeal in 1986that states would alter their tax structures in response to the elimination of sales tax deductibility would not arise the ajca 2004 sales tax deductibility provision expires after the 2005 tax year but was extended through 2007 by the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 2 for more on the 1986 act see us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of the tax reform act of 1986 hr3838 99th congress pl 99514 100th cong 1st sess jcs1087

individual taxpayers however must itemize deductions rather than use the standard deduction on their income tax return to claim the deduction for taxes paid business taxpayers in contrast may deduct state and local taxes as cost of doing business the federal tax savings from the deduction is equal to the taxpayers marginal tax rate multiplied by the size of the deduction because the federal income tax rate regime is progressive 4 deduction for itemizers in contrast to tax credit for all taxpayers favors taxpayers in higher income tax brackets table 1 reports the number and percentage of returns with itemized deductions for the four state and local taxes described and analyzed in this report the 1986 tax year is included in table 1 to exhibit the utilization of the deduction for sales taxes paid which was repealed by tra 1986 in 1986 the sales tax deduction was the most common itemized deduction for taxes paid more taxpayers would claim sales tax deduction because all but five states imposed sales tax and in contrast to property taxes paying the tax is not conditioned on owning property real or personal the current sales tax deduction will not be as common because it is in lieu of income taxes in 2006 112 million taxpayers claimed deduction for sales taxes paid and the number who claimed deduction for income taxes paid declined slightly from 359 million in 2003 to 357 million in 2006 the gradual growth in the percentage of itemizers through 2002 exhibited in table 1 may reflect income growth that has outpaced infla tion income growth that exceeds the inflation adjusted expansion of income tax brackets bracket creep implies higher marginal tax bracket which ultimately increases the tax saving from itemizing the decline in 2003 may reflect the impact of lower marginal tax rates the total number and percentage of itemizers increased from 439 million in 2003 to 463 million in 2004 likely reflecting introduction of the sales tax deduction option t able 1

that if particular state and local tax is favored by deductibility in the federal tax code then state and local governments may rely more upon that tax source5 in effect local governments and taxpayers recognize that residents are paying only part of the tax and that the federal government through federal deductibility is paying the remainder for example economists douglas holtzeakin and harvey rosen 1990 found that if deductibility were eliminated the mean property tax rate in our sample would fall by 000715 715 per 1000 of assessed value or 211 of the mean tax rate 6

levied as percentage of assessed value from taxable income7 for example an itemizing individual owning home with an assessed value of 100000 and who pays 1 property tax can deduct the 1000 tax from his or her adjusted gross income if this taxpayer is in the 28 marginal tax bracket taking 1000 out of taxable income re duces taxes by 280 1000 multiplied by 288 in most cases both the taxpayers tax bracket and home value increase with income thus 5 lawrence b lindsey federal deductibility of state and local taxes test of public choice by representative government in fiscal federalism

property tax deduction was claimed on approximately 31 of all tax returns however not all homeowners itemize and only those who itemize can take the deduction in 2006 there were 723 million owneroccupied households yet only 426 million taxpayers claimed an itemized deduction for real estate property taxes in 2006 9 table 1 above provides data for the years 1986 and 1997 through 2006 on the number of returns that claimed property tax deduction the most common itemized deduction claimed property taxes are major source of local government revenue and thus the federal transfer through deductibility is also quite large state governments in contrast are less dependent upon property tax revenue and instead rely more upon income and sales taxes nationally property taxes comprised 452 3473 billion in fy2006 of all local government general ownsource revenue and 12 118 billion in fy2006 of all state government general ownsource revenue 10 less than half of the combined 3591 billion in property taxes collected by state and local governments in fy2006 was deducted by individual taxpayers who itemized on their federal income tax returns or by businesses as business expense in 2006 1564 billion of real estate property taxes were claimed as itemized deductions on individual federal income tax returns personal property taxes such as annual car taxes based on the value of the car generated 90 billion in deductions in 2006 the amount co llected and the amount deducted are different because only onethird of taxpayers itemize on individual returns and businesses including landlords pay large share of property taxes that would not appear as itemized deductions on individual income tax returns the federal tax expenditure estimated by the joint committee on taxation jct

were eliminated taxpayers would gradually reduce their level of housing consumption and thus their property tax bill this shift would be gradual as housing consumption choices are not as responsive as other expenditures to changes in aftertax price given the relatively illiquid nature of housing assets in addition as noted earlier state and local governments may lower tax rates and shift to other revenue sources if the relative tax price of raising revenue through property taxes increases local governments would have more at stake than state governments because the real property tax is primarily local source of revenue across taxpayers highincome property owners in states with relatively high local property values and taxes would likely see the greatest increase in total tax burden

and local sales taxes in lieu of income taxes likely diminishes the progressivity of the federal income tax system because the deduction from income is available only to taxpayers who itemize itemizers in states that do not impose an income tax benefit the most from the optional sales tax deduction see table 4 footnote for these states the gradual reduction in allowable itemized deductions for wealthy taxpayers and the alternative minimum tax amt do limit the benefit at th highest end of the income distribution it is also true that states without an income tax rely more on sales and property taxes than do states with an income tax as result itemizers in states without an income tax will be able to deduct proportionately more of their state and local taxes than taxpayers in states with both an income and sales tax shown in table 4 in states without an income tax state and local governments rely on sales and property taxes for 693 of total tax revenue in contrast in states that levy an income tax state and local governments rely on income and property taxes for 560 of total tax revenue the differential treatment of states based on the reliance on the income tax was likely unintended nevertheless states without an income tax are considerably better off with the sales tax deduction option relative to income tax states as such extension of the sales tax deduction option would benefit nonincome tax states relatively more than other states 14 see irs publication 600 noted earlier

states under current tax rules taxpayers in high tax states can deduct more from federal income than can those in low tax states15 for example potentially deductible state and local taxes in new york comprise approximately 88 of total personal income whereas deductible taxes in nearby delaware account for approximately 48 of total personal income16 thus taxpayers in new york can deduct significantly more from federal income than can taxpayers in delaware assuming that other federal taxes were maintained after the elimination of the federal deduction for state and local taxes the tax burden would shift toward hightax states from lowtax states if the federal government reduces tax rates to maintain revenue neutralitythe base is larger with the elimination of the deductibility allowing for lower rates to yield the same revenuethen the effect is even more pronounced the higher the state and local tax burden as percentage of total income the lower the new federal tax rate would be under revenue neutrality more generally if state and local tax deductibility were eliminated the federal tax burden would shift from all federal taxpayers toward itemizers as noted earlier itemizers tend to be higher income thus federal income taxes may become more progressive if the state and local taxes paid deduction were eliminated some secondary effects however are anticipated at the state and local level if deductibility were eliminated state and local governments might be less willing to finance projects that generate benefits that extend beyond the taxing jurisdiction the tax price to community of these projects would increase as the federal contribution through deductibility is lost projects and initiatives whose benefits extend beyond the local jurisdiction would likely be the most sensitive to changes in the tax price as the benefits are more widely dispersed 17 reduction in state and local public good provision may adversely affect lowincome i ndividuals relative to highincome individuals quantifying the magnitude of the state and local spending response is difficult because many other factors influence state and local spending decisions such as state and local political considerations and overall economic conditions nevertheless most research has found that state spending declines or would decline but by how much before sales tax deductibility was eliminated in 1987 one researcher estimated that the overall responses are on the order of zero to ten percent much less than estimates used in the political debate 18 in contrast another economist found that the level of state and local spending is significantly affected by deductibility19 15 the tax reform panel reform package would counter or at least offset the distributional effect of the state and local taxes paid deduction through elimination of the amt and the highest tax bracket 16 state personal income data are from the us census bureau bureau of economic analysis available at

during the debate surrounding the federal income tax treatment of state and local taxes one are the tax expenditures for state and local taxes paid truly federal tax expenditures or do these expenditures represent return of taxpayer income that was never the federal governments to begin with two would the absence of federal deduction for state and local taxes paid amount to taxing tax the foundation of these arguments can be traced to the difference between theoretically ideal income tax and the federal income tax as it currently exists the ideal federal income tax would include wage in come plus all accretions to wealth including imputed income over designated time period one calendar year for example 21 this definition of income should theoretically accurately measure an individuals ability to pay income taxes any exclusions or deductions from this definition of income would represent departure from the rule and thus generate tax expenditure or federal subsidy there are two ways to view taxes paid for stat and local government services under an ideal income tax22 if one views state and local taxes paid as payment for government provided services which could be privately provided then the federal deduction for state and local taxes is not appropriate in contrast if one views state and local taxes as lost income resulting in reduced ability to pay federal income taxes loss then deduction for those taxes seems reasonable the more tangible less theoretical taxonatax issue arises from this last observation23 there is not clear consensus on which view is correct for some state and local taxes and taxpayers the feeforspecificservices view is more accurate taxpayers with government provided trash collection who pay property taxes for government spending

almost confiscatory cumulative income tax rates the current federal rate structure with much lower rates minimize this effect

reform panel has recommended elimination of the deduction for all state and local taxes as part of broader effort to simplify the tax code under the reform plan the repeal of the deduction would be accompanied by repeal of the alternative minimum tax amt switch from personal exemptions and standard deduction to family credit and lower top marginal tax rate each of the additional proposals affect the overall impact of state and local deductibility repeal as outlined earlier in this report under current law the deductibility benefits itemizers in hightax jurisdictions more than nonitemizers in lowtax jurisdictions thus elimination of the deduction would shift the burden from lowincome taxpayers to highincome taxpayers all else held constant elimination of the amt and lower top regular income tax rate however will benefit primarily highincome taxpayers note that amt filers cannot take the deduction for state and local taxes paid thus elimination of the deduction is mostly inconsequential the elimination of the 10 bracket amount and the narrower 28 income tax br acket will increase taxes for all taxpayers lowincome taxpayers will likely encounter greater increase in relative tax burden based on taxes as percentage of income under the tax reform plan thus on balance the tax reform panel package of tax code changes taken together may not significantly shift the federal tax burden the proposed tax reform plans will also have an indirect effect on state and local government finances if implemented federal income taxes will not vary based on the residence of the itemizing taxpayer as is currently the case some may argue that the neutral treatment of all taxpayers regardless of state and local tax burden may be inequitable because taxpayers in high tax jurisdictions have reduced ability to pay federal income taxes alternatively others argue that the federal income tax should be neutral with regard to state and local taxes nevertheless the use of uniform credits will increase the relative price of state and local government services hightaxhighgovernmentservice jurisdictions would fare less well than lowtaxlowgovernmentservice jurisdictions
