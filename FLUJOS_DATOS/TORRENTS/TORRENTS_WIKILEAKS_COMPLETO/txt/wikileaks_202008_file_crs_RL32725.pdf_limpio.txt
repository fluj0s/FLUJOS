was referred to the house committee on energy and commerce and to the house committee on the judiciary if enacted the bill would permit industr ial hemp production based on state law without

fr 51530 explaining the basis of its zerotolerance standard it held that when congress wr ote the statutory definition of marijuana in 1937 it exempted certain portions of the cannabis plant from the definition of marijuana based on the assumption now refu ted that such portions of the plant contain none of the psychoactive component now known as thc12 the deas interpretation made hemp with any thc content subject to enforcement as controlled substance hemp industry trade groups retailers nd major canadian exporter filed suit against the dea arguing that congressi onal intent was to exempt plant parts containing naturally occurring thc at nonpsychoactive levels the same way it exempts poppy seeds containing trace amount s of naturally occurring opiates 21 usc802 1920 industry groups mainta in that 1 naturally occurring thc in the leaves and flowers of cannabis varieties grown for fiber and food is already at belowpsychoactive levels c ompared with drug varietie s 2 the parts used

executive order eo 12919 entitled national defens industrial resources pr eparedness which was intended to strengthen the us industria l and technology base for meeting national defense requirements the order incl uded hemp under the category of food resources which it defined to mean in part all starches sugars vegetable and animal or marine fats and oils cotton tobacco wool m ohair hemp flax fiber and other materials but not any such material after it loses its identity as an agricultural commodity or product15 it could be argued that the government has already recognized that industrial hemp is capable of contributing to national defense needs and to the readiness of us defenses during times of peace as well as national emergency opponents of industrial hemp point out that us agricultural history illustrates the great difficulty of bringing promising alternative crops into profitable commercial use usda has supported research on lternative crops and industrial uses of common commodities since the late 1930s currently under the critical agricultural materials act of 1984 pl 98284 the supplementa l and alternative crops provisions of the 1985 and 1990 omnibus farm acts and other authorities the federal government supports about 15 million annually in research and development on alternative crops at usda and state laboratories16 some alternative crops that have become established in certain parts of the united states kenaf for fiber in texas jojoba for oil in arizona and ca lifornia and amaranth for nutritious grain in the great plains states for example have benefits similar to those ascribed to hemp but are not complicated by having drug variety within the same species one of the first economic analyses of i ndustrial hemps poten tial as profitable crop for us farmers was report prepared by usdas economic research service in 2000 ers based its dom estic production assumptions on import data covering hemp fiber yarn and fabric but excluding seed and oil the report concluded that us markets for hemp fiber and seed are and will likely remain small thin markets uncertainty about longrun mand for hemp products and the potential for oversupply disc ounts the prospects for hemp as an economically viable alternative crop for american farmers17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32725crs7 18 small and marcus p 321 19 see footnote 9 20 one example of

fabric among other things information from the research council is available online at httpwwwnrccnrcgccahighlights20040407hemp_ehtmlthe more recent study by small and marcus 2002 reflects the fact that interest in the crop in the united states has deepened since ers calculated its negative forecast it concludes it often takes 10 to 15 years for the industry associated with new agricultural crop to mature while it is true that fo reign imports have been the basis for hemp products in north america for at leas t decade north american production is only 4 years of age in canada viewed from this perspective the hemp industry in north america is still very much in its infancy and is likely to continue experiencing the risks inherent in small niche market for some time however hemp has such diversity of possible uses is being promoted by extremely enthusiastic market developers and attracts so much attention that it is likely to carve out much larger share of the north american marketplace than its detractors are willing to concede18 an update in 2007 of december 2003 re port from agriculture canada draws an even more positive conclusion based on its reading of consumer interest hemps remarkable advantages are hard to beat it thrives w ithout herbicides it reinvigorates the soil it requires less wate r than cotton it matures in three to four months and it can yield four times as much paper per acre as trees hemp can be used to create building materials that are twice as strong as wood and concrete textile fiber that is stronger than cott on better oil and paint than petroleum cleanburning di esel fuel and biodegradable plastics in addition it can produce more digestible protein per acre than any other food source these advantages are in tune with the environm ental and health preferences of todays north american public the growing curios ity of consumers the interest shown by farmers and processors and canadas excellent growing conditions for industrial hemp allow optimis tic views for its future19 according to the canadian hemp trade alliance chta leading trade group the harvesting shelling and proce ssing technologies for conventional oilseed crops in canada are suitable for handling hemp grown for seed which has enabled acreage to expand as soon as markets are found farmers who obtain organic certification for their hemp seed receive premium prices chta reported market price of 50 to 60 cents c per pound fo r conventional hemp seed and an 85 centpound market price for certified organic seed in winter 20032004 the canadian hemp fiber industry is not as developed because the crop became legal to produce again in 1998 government and private funds have only recently begun to support research on br eeding fiber varieties

products and markets proponents of reintroducing hemp as co mmodity crop in the united states are watching the canadian experience with interest however it also is important to keep an eye on the larger picture the wo rld market for hemp products is relatively small and china as the worlds largest hemp fiber and seed producer has had and likely will continue to have major influence on market prices and thus on the yearto year profits of producers and pr ocessors in other countries21 canadas head start in the north american market for hemp seed and oil also would likely affect the

these are that commercial cultivation would increas the likelihood of covert production of highthc marijuana significantly complicate deas surveillance and enforcement activities and send the wrong
