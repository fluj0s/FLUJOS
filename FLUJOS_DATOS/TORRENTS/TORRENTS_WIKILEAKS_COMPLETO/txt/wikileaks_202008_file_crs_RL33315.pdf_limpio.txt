laundering is commonly understood as the process of cleansing the taint from the proceeds of crime1 in federal criminal law however it is more in the principal federal criminal money laundering statutes 18 usc 1956 and 1957 and to varying degrees in several other federal criminal statutes money laundering involves the flow of resources to and from several hundred other federal state and foreign crimes2 it consists of engaging in financial transaction involving the proceeds of certain crimes in order to conceal the nature source or ownership of proceeds they produced3 engaging in financial transaction involving the proceeds of certain crimes in order to promote further offenses4 transporting funds generated by certain criminal activities into out of or through the united states in order to promote further criminal activities or to conceal nature source or ownership of the criminal proceeds or to evade reporting requirements5 engaging in financial transaction involving criminal proceeds in order to evade taxes on the income produced by the illicit activity6 structuring financial transactions in order to evade reporting requirements7 spending more than 10000 of the proceeds of certain criminal activities8 traveling in interstate or foreign commerce in order to distribute the proceeds of certain criminal activities9 transmitting the proceeds of criminal activity in the course of money transmitting business10 1 money laundering is the act of transferring illegally obtained money through legitimate persons or accounts so that its original source cannot be traced b lack s law dictionary 1027 8th ed 2004 2 few years and several amendments ago one commentator estimated the number of section 1956 predicate offenses at 250 or so cassella the forfeiture of property involved in money laundering offenses 7 b uffalo criminal law review 583 612 20032004 the estimate appears exceptionally conservative each of the 50 states outlaws 1 murder 2 kidnapping 3 gambling 4 arson 5 robbery 6 bribery 7 extortion 8 dealing in obscene material and 9 drug dealing felony violation of any one of these is section 1956 predicate offense 18 usc 1956c7a 19611a each of the close to 200 countries of the world outlaw many if not most the same types of misconduct murder kidnapping robbery and the like and when they do these too are section 1956 predicate offenses if they involve financial transaction in the us 18 u sc 1956c7b but however daunting the absolute number of section 1956 predicate offenses may be the reported cases suggest that handful of predicate offenses like mail fraud wire fraud and drug dealing account for the vast majority of section 1956 prosecutions 3 18 usc 1956a1bii 4 18 usc 1956a1ai 5 18 usc 1956a2 6 18 usc 1956a1aii 7 18 usc

definition which allows conviction without the necessity of proving that the defendant know the exact particulars of the underlying offense or even its nature it is enough that he knows that the property flows from some sort of criminal activity and that the property in fact constitutes the proceeds of predicate offense20 the knowledge element cannot be negated by turning blind eye to reality

robbery bribery extortion dealing in obscene matter or dealing in controlled substance or listed chemical as defined in section 102 of the controlled substances act which is chargeable under state law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year27 the list of foreign crimes recognized as section 1956 predicate offenses is very much the same violations of the laws of another country involv ing murder kidnapping bribery drug trafficking and the like but it only applies in cases involving financial transaction occurring in whole or in part in this country28 the list of federal predicate offenses is considerably longer if for other reason than it is both specific and generic29 for instance instead of listing kidnapping in violation of federal law it lists several of the federal statutes that outlaw kidnapping interstate kidnapping kidnapping member of congress kidnapping the president and so forth30 on the other hand it also lists any act or activity constituting an offense involving federal health care offense31 moreover it encompasses not only the rico state predicate offenses but also the rico federal predicate offenses32 the inventory of rico predicates contains

winners he was convicted of running an illegal gambling business40 he was also convicted of engaging in promotional money laundering when he paid winners and his employees from the gambling receipts41

the congress did not explicitly define proceeds as the term is used in the money laundering statute43 in such cases words are thought to have their ordinary meaning in common parlance proceeds can mean either profits or gross receipts44 when the words of criminal statute can be read in either of two ways the rule of lenity requires them to be construed in the manner most favorable to the accused45 recourse to the rule avoids the socalled merger problem since few lotteries if any will not pay their winne rs the statute criminalizing illegal lotteries 18 usc 1955 would merge with the money launderi ng statute congress evidently decided that lottery operators ordinarily deserve up to 5 years of imprisonment 1955a but as result of merger they would face an additional 20 years u nder the money laundering statute 1956a1 the merger problem is not limited to lottery operators generally speaking any specified unlawful activity an episode of which includes transactions which are not elements of the offense and in which the participant passes receipts on to someone else would merge with money laundering there are more than 250 predicate offenses for the moneylaundering statute 46 justice stevens concurred in the result not the rationale of the plurality opinion47 he agreed with the dissent at least to the extent that the legislative history of 1956 makes it clear that congress intended the term proceeds to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involved in such sales48 yet he found the results of inevitable merger too extraordinary to believe congress intended them in other instances the revenue generated by gambling business that is used to pay the essential expenses of operating that business is not proceeds within the meaning of the money laundering statute as the plurality notes there is explanation for why congress would have wanted transaction that is normal part of crime it had duly considered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the criminal code to radically increase the sentence for that crime congress could not have intended the perverse result that would obtain in this case under justice alitos opinion 49 consequently he would presume and the case s hould probably be read to mean that congress intended the word proceeds to mean gross receipts except in those cases like santos

being approached by government agents64 evidence of defendants predisposition may include 1 the character or reputation of the defendant 2 whether the government made the initial suggestion of criminal activity 3 whether the defendant engaged in the activity for profit 4 whether the defendant 58 18 usc 1956a3a the terminology used in the s ection permits an alternative construction of the

consensus over whether the international money laundering proscriptions of section 1956a2b reach international transactions that are part series of related transactions when the deceptive or evasive

found that gilbert was involved in only one transaction and the transaction was totally outside this country because this transaction is separate from the one originating in the united states and

something of cloud over the first knowledge element of the section 1956a2b international transfer offenses knowing that the funds involved in the transfer represent the proceeds of some form of

offenses of section 1956a1 refers to property in financial transaction rather than funds transferred84 the property phrase knowing that the property in financial transaction is specifically defined so that the defendant need not know that unlawful activity which generates the laundered proceeds constitutes money laundering predicate offense ie specified unlawful activity it is enough that he knows that it is state federal or foreign felony85 at least one court has held that the same definition applies to section 1956a2b international offenses notwithstanding the differences in terminology86

1956a3b exchanging small bills for larger ones may evidence an intent to conceal the location of the proceeds of predicate offense since large bill is more easily concealed than the small bills representing an equal amount88 other indicia of an intent to conceal include 1 unusual secrecy surrounding the transaction 2 structuring the transactions to avoid attenti on 3 depositing illegal funds with legitimate enterprise 4 highly irregular features of the transaction 5 using third parties to conceal the real owner of the funds and 6 unusual financial moves89 the sting proscriptions are found on belief rather than knowledge that the proceeds involved have been tainted by their involvement in predicate offense90 nevertheless defendant is still not free to turn blind eye to the fact that the proceeds are represented to have predicate offense taint91 the financial transaction element of the offense demands either transaction that affects interstate or foreign commerce or transaction involving the use of financial institution engaged in or whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce 92 to satisfy the financial institution prong of the financial transaction element of the offense the government need only establish that the transaction involved the use of financial institution with an interstate or foreign commerce nexus not that the institution was itself an integral or essential part of the transaction93 to satisfy the transaction prong the government need only establish minimis effect on interstate commerce 94 the representational element does not require undercover agents to have told the defendant in so many words that the transaction involves the proceeds of predicate offense it is enough that they made the defendant aware of circumstances

years 18 usc 371 in addition section 1956h declares that any person who conspires to commit any offense defined in this section or section 1957 shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy115 although casual reading might indicate that section 1956h simply changes the penalty for section 371 conspiracy to violate section 1956 to match the other penalties for violation section 1956 section 1956h in fact creates separate crime 116 the distinction matters because violation of section 371 is not complete until one of the conspirators commits an overt act in furtherance of the scheme117 section 1956h has such overt act requirement118 conspiracy to violate section 1956 carries with it the

the substantive offenses in section 1956 each of which contain an attempt component raises the interesting possibility of prosecution of conspiracy to attempt violation of one of the substantive offenses although the case law is sparse the courts appear to have acknowledged that conspiracy to attempt may constitute an indictable offense both as general matter and in the case of section 1956120 the cases however do not discuss the offenses precise elements attempt ordinarily requires proof of substantial step towards the completion of the underlying offense conspiracy to attempt whether in the absence of an overt act requirement or not presumably requires something less as general matter anyone who commands counsels or aids and abets the commission of federal crime by another

predicate offenses such mail fraud125 subsequent amendments to the guidelines126 and penalty increases in some of the predicate offenses127 address that concern under the sentencing 120 united states

laundering offense occurred second property involved in section 1956 money laundering offense or property traceable to such involved property may be confiscated138 involved property obviously includes more than the proceeds of the predicate offense since the proceeds are separately forfeitable already in theory it might include both sides of transaction the proceeds from the predicate offense and the cashiers check real estate jewelry or sports car purchased with the proceeds in laundering transaction in practice however involved property has been construed to mean untainted property joined with the proceeds of predicate offense as part of the laundering transaction 139 property acquired in exchange for the proceeds or for the proceeds and other involved property is forfeitable as traceable property but the government may confiscate the property on either side of the transaction but not the property on both sides140 the eighth amendment prohibits excessive fines fines are excessive if they are grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offenders misconduct141 while the excessive fines clause may impose limits upon the permissible extent of the confiscation for failure to comply with anti money laundering reporting statutes142 forfeitures under section 1956 are not ordinarily considered excessive because of the gravity of the offense and its predicate offenses143 137 the following property is subject to forfeiture to the united states c any property real or personal which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to any offense constituting

in the transfer of the laundered property from the place where the predicate offense occurred eg missouri to the place where the laundering occurred eg florida 146 the section 1956 money laundering

the attempt to cleanse dirty money by putting it in clean form and so disguising it this statute applies to the most open aboveboard transaction united states v gabriele 63 f3d 61 651 st cir 1995the crux of the argument is that section 1957 is rather novel statute in that it criminalizes conduct by person once removed from that of the person who generated the criminally derived property thus he argues the proscribed conduct is not likely to appear unlawful to an ordinary citizen section 1957 is but another in substantial line of federal criminal statutes whose only mens rea requirement is knowledge of the prior criminal conduct that tainted the property involved in the proscribed activity httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33315g15g152g151g142g162g561

act is section 1956 and 1957 predicate offense specified unlawful activity 175 section 1956 and 1957 are travel act predicate offenses unlawful activity176 and although the money laundering predicate offense list is more extensive several of the travel act predicate offenses are also money laundering predicates177 the travel act essentially condemns three crimes each with an interstate element the distribution of the proceeds of predicate offense the promotion of predicate offense or the commission of violent crime in aid of predicate offense the first two variants bear some resemblance to the concealment and promotion offenses of section 1956 and somewhat more remotely to the depositspending proscriptions of section 1957 the violent crime component of the travel act is only coincidentally related to money laundering and consequently will be mentioned only in passing the travel acts elements cover anyone who 1 travels in interstate or foreign commerce or b uses any facility in

commerce 2 with the specific intent to distribute the proceeds of an unlawful activity and 3 knowing and willful commission of an act in furtherance of that intent179 facilitation the government must prove 1 interstate travel or use of an interstate facility 2 with the intent to promote an unlawful activity and 3 followed by performance or attempted performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity 180 violence to prove violation of the travel act the government was required to establish that ajaj 1 used facility of interstate or foreign commerce 2 with intent to commit any unlawful activity including arson and 3 thereafter performed an additional act to further the unlawful activity 181 the accused need not have been guilty of the unlawful activities that generated the distributed proceeds182 distribution in section 1952a1 carries connotation of distribution of illegal proceeds to persons in organized crime conspiracies certainly the person receiving them must be entitled to them for reasons other than normal and otherwise lawful purchase and sale of goods at market prices 183 distribution however does include distribution to pay off criminal associates184 as well as the interstate transfer of criminal proceeds to confederate for the purchase of controlling interest in bank in order to facilitate subsequent laundering185 actual distribution is not necessary for conviction the offense simply involves interstate commerce an intent to distribute and subsequent attempt to distribute some action perhaps incomplete or unsuccessful in furtherance of the intent to distribute 186 the dimensions of the facilitation offense are comparable in addition to interstate travel or the use of interstate facilities with the requisite intent it requires the performance or attempted 179 united states v hinojosa 958 f2d 624 629 5th cir 1992 180 united states v nishnianidze 342 f3d 6 15 1st cir 2003 united states v welch 327 f3d 1081 1090 10th cir 2003

the act of bulk cash smuggling itself criminal offense and to authorize the imposition of the full range of civil and criminal sanctions when the offense is discovered because the act of concealing currency for the purpose of smuggling it out of the united states is inherently more seri ous than simply failing to file customs report strong and meaningful sanctions such as confiscation of the smuggled currency are likely to withstand eighth amendment challenges to the new statute see also united states v 293316 349 fsupp2d at 643 cassella bulk cash smuggling and the globalization of crime overcoming constitutional challenges to forfeiture under 31 usc 5332 22 b erkeley journal of international law 98 106 2004in 2001 congress expressed its displeasure with the bajakajian decision and created new bulk cash smuggling offense 31 usc 5332 that is designed to permit forfeiture of one hundred percent of the smuggled currency in most circumstances whether or not the government can establish nexus between the smuggled money and another criminal offense enacted as part of the postseptember 11 effort to address terrorist financing specifically and intentional money laundering generally in title ii of the usa patriot act the new law recognizes the central role that bulk cash smuggling plays in the globalization of crime 240 united states v ely 468 f3d 399 402 n2 6th cir 2006this statute included forfeiture provision that was precursor of the present version of 31 usc 5332 the statutory language was modified as part of the usa patriot act in 2001 by moving the forfeiture provisions from 18 usc 982 the statute authorizing the forfeiture in bajakajian to 31 usc 5332 the statute authorizing elys forfeiture the government advances this modification as basis for us to find bajakajian inapplicable however the forfeiture language of the two provisions is virtually identical and even if congress could circumvent the eighth amendments limitations on excessive fines by modifying statute which would make little sense cutting and pasting provision of the united states code from one chapter to another cannot be viewed as meaningful change but see united states v jose 499 f3d 105 110111 st cir 2007congress in enacting section 5332 responded to bajakajian in way that it believed would in most circumstances constitutionally permit the full forfeiture of currency not reported to authorities as required by section 5316 section 5332 make clear that congress has now prohibited what it calls bulk cash smuggling and that it considers this to be very

money transmitters sometimes referred to as hawalas may have funneled extensive amounts to money to terrorist groups abroad241 the designation as the transmitters as unlicensed is something of misnomer since the statute applies to both licensed and unlicensed money transmitting businesses242 it outlaws the transmission of money known to be derived from or intended to finance criminal activity even if the transmitter is duly licensed 243 it also proscribes money transmission businesses which either fail to comply with any state law requirements for such businesses or b have failed to comply with federal regulatory requirements for such businesses244 in all three instances money transmitting is defined broadly by way of nonexclusive list of examples245 initial judicial construction is has been somewhat divided the courts agree that the government must establish that the defendant operated money transmission business that the business affected interstate commerce and that the business was unlicensed or unregistered unless the charge is the transmission of tainted funds246 the statute itself declares that in prosecution under the statelicense branch of the statute the government need not show that the defendant was aware any state licensing requirement247 it must prove however that he knew the business was unlicensed248 in the prosecution under the federalregulation branch of the statute the government need not show that the defendan t knew of federal regulatory requirements249 but it must show that the defendant knew that he was operating transmitting business250 violations of section 1960 face imprisonment for not more than five years andor fine of not more than 250000 not more than 500000 for organizations251 241 united states

as noted earlier all rico predicate offenses are by definition money laundering predicate offenses under sections 1956 and 1957252 the crimes that suggest the possibility of rico offense also suggest the possibility of money laundering in some money laundering cases there is separate rico violation the rico contributio n is limited to its shared predicate offenses list253 in number of other cases however either money laundering is one of several predicate offenses of larger rico enterprise254 or the rico enterprise is devoted primarily to money laundering255 rico makes it federal crime for any person to 1 conduct or participate directly or indirectly in the conduct of 2 the affairs of an enterprise 3 engaged in or the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce 4 through the collection of an unlawful debt or b through pattern of racketeering activity predicate offenses 256 to establish the elements of substantive rico offense the government must prove 1 that an enterprise existed 2 that the enterprise affected interstate or foreign commerce 3 that the defendant associated with the enterprise 4 that the defendant participated directly or indirectly in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise and 5 that the defendant participated in the enterprise through pattern of racketeering activity by committing at least two racketeering predicate acts to establish the charge of conspi racy to violate the rico statute the government must prove in addition to elements one two and three described immediately above that the defendant objectively manifested an agreement to participate in the affairs of the enterprise 257 this statement of the elements addresses the more common rico prosecution 252 18 usc 1956c7a 1957f3 253 mail fraud and wire fraud 18 usc 1341 1343
