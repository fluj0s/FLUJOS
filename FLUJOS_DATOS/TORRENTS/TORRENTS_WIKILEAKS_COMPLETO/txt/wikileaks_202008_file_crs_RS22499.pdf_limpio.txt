census bureau periodically collects national survey information on child support by interviewing random sample of singleparent families the census bureau is able to generate an array of data that is useful in assessing the performance of noncustodial parents in paying their child support although the census bureau has been collecting child support information in special child support supplement to the april current population survey cps biennially since 1978 the supplement survey has changed significantly over the years according to the census bureau the most recent data from 20051 is comparable only back to 1993 during the early years of the survey information was collected only from custodial mothers beginning with the 1991 data information was also collected from custodial fathers this report presents unsegmented data with respect to custodial mothers and fathers ie custodial parents data the survey population includes all persons who have their own children under age 21 living with them while the other parent lives outside the household the child support enforcement cse program was enacted in 1975 as federalstate program title ivd of the social security act to help strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services the cse program is administered by the office of child support enforcement ocse in the department of health and human services hhs and funded by general revenues all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto ri co and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds the cse program provides seven major services on behalf of children 1 parent location 2 paternity establishment 3 establishment of child support orders 4 review and modification of child support orders 5 collection of child support payments 6 distribution of child support payments and 7 establishment and enforcement of medical child support the cse program is estimated to handle at least 50 of all child support cases the remaining cases are handled by private attorneys collection agencies or through mutual agreements between the parents in fy2005 the cse program collected 230 billion in child support payments from noncustodial parents and served 159 million child support cases the national census bureau data show that the aggregate amount of child support received in 2005 was 248 billion and that 136 million parents had custody of children under age 21 while the other parent lived elsewhere 2 in 2005 84 of custodial parents were mothers of all custodial parents 56 were white 25 were black 22 were married 35 were divorced 30 were never married 15 did not have high school diploma 15 had at least bachelors degree 54 worked fulltime yearround 25 had family income below poverty and 31 received some type of public assistance 1 us census bureau custodial mothers and fathers and their child support 2005 current population reports p60234 by timothy s grall august 2007 httpwwwcensusgovprod2007pubsp60234pdf to view detailed tables see httpwwwcensusgovhheswwwchildsupportchldsu05pdf 2 note that the ocse defines cse case as noncustodial parent mother father or putativealleged father who is now or eventually may be obligated under law for the support of child or children receiving services under the cse program if the noncustodial parent owes support for two children by different women that would be considered two cases if both children have the same mother that would be considered one case thus the cse program caseload may be larger than the national number of custodial parents potentially eligible for child support payments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22499g5g145g146g149g141g561g21g158g153 g153g152g155g157g497g561g3g151g561g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561g152

biennial survey data for selected years from 1993 through 2005 the table shows that the likelihood of having child support award being legally entitled to child support payment and actually receiving at least one child support payment has increased only modestly over the 13year period from 1993 through 2005 in contrast the percentage of noncustodial parents who received the full amount of the child support that they were owed increased by 27 from 37 in 1993 to 47 in 2005 t able 1 child suppor t award and receipt 19932005 199 3 199 5 199 7 199 9 200 1 200 3 200 5 change 1993 200 5 all

2005 only 32 million 23 of the 136 million custodial parents eligible for child support actually received the full amount of child support that was owed to them in 2005 the average child support payment amounted to about 36424 almost 18 higher than the average child support payment in 1993 3095 in 2005 about 65 of the 38 billion in aggregate child support due was actually paid in 1993 65 of the 32 billion adjusted for inflation in 2005 dollars in child support due was paid over the 13year period 1993 to 2005 aggregate child support due increased 20 total child support received increased

g344g342g342g347g561 while sex race marital status and education are significant factors in predicting whether custodial parent will be issued child support order award rates tend to be significantly lower than receipt rates for example although female custodial parents were more than 15 times as likely to be awarded child support in 2005 as their male counterparts among parents who were oweddue child support both had at least 70 chance of actually receiving child support payments see table 2 moreover in 2005 only onehalf of black custodial parents were awarded child support compared with threefifths of white custodial parents even so nearly 70 of black custodial parents who were oweddue child support actually received child support payments and 80 of white custodial parents who were owed child support actually received child support payments in 2005 similarly while only 48 of nevermarried parents were awarded child support in 2005 75 of neverma rried parents who were owed child support actually received child support payments in 2005 also about 47 of custodial parents without high school diploma were awarded child support while 71 of custodial parents without high school diploma who were owed child support actually received child support 3 conversely the reader should note that many custodial parents do not r eceive child support this includes the 43 of custodial parents who were not awarded child support and 11 of custodial parents who did not receive any child support payments even though they had been awarded child support in 2005 this number amounted to almost 74 million custodial parents some of the reasons given as to why there was not legal child support obligation included the following they did not feel the need to make it legal 34 the other parent provided what he or she could 28 the other parent could not afford to pay 24 they did not want the other parent to pay 21 the child stayed with the other parent part of the time 20 they did not want to have contact with the other parent 17 they could not locate the other parent 15 and paternity was not legally established 8 4 this amount reflects total child support payments r eceived divided by the number of parents who were oweddue payments 248000000006809000 table 2 shows an average child support payment of 4717 for custodial parents who actually received at least one child
