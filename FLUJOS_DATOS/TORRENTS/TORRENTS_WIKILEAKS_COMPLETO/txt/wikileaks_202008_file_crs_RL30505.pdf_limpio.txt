the military construction bill incorporates fy2000 supplemental appropriations for military operations in kosovo and elsewhere for counterdrug assistance to colombia and for some other defense programs background congress provides funding for national defense programs in several annual appropriations measures the largest of which is the defense appropriations bill congress also acts every year on national defense authorization bill which authorizes programs funded in all of the regular appropriations measures the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely the same level of detail as the defenserelated appropriations and congressional debate about major defense policy and funding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization because the defense authoriz ation and appropriations bills are so closely related this report tracks congressional action on both measures the annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the department of defense dod including pay and benefits of military personnel operation and mainten ance of weapons and facilities weapons procurement and research and development and for other purposes most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the department of defense though the bill also provides 1 relatively small unclassified amounts for the central intelligence agency retirement fund and intelligence community management 2 classified amounts for national foreign intelligence activities administered by the cia and by other agencies as well as by dod and 3 very small amounts for some other agencies five otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs2 appropriations bills also provide funds for national defense activities of dod and other agencies including the milita ry construction appropriations bill which finances construction of military facilities and construction and operation of military family housing all administered by dod the energy and water development appropriations bill which funds atomic energy defense activit ies administered by the department of energy the vahudindependent agencies appropriation s bill which finances civil

ercejusticestate appropriations bill which funds national securityrelated activities of the fbi the department of justice and some other agencies and the transportation appropriations bill which funds

committee marked up bill hr 3908 that provided 91 billion in supplemental appropriations including 50 billion for dod the additional money for dod included 16 billion for petroleum price increases and 854 million for increased defense health program costs on march 29 the full house approved an amendment to the bill that provided an additional 4 billion for defense programs all of which was made available through september 30 2001 the senate however declined to consider the bill and decided to fold supplemental appropriations for fy2000 into regular fy2001 appropriations bills under the conference agreement on the fy2001 budget resolution the extra 4 billion that the house provided for defense could be incorporated into the regular fy2001 defense appropriations bills on june 29 the

authority for the national defense budget function in fy2001 there are several ways to put the overall request into context one is to compare the request to the amount congress provided for defense in fy2000 second is to calculate the inflation adjusted growth or decline in projected spending from year to year and third is to compare the amount the administration requested for fy2001 with the amount it planned year earlier to request for fy2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs5 1 it is also worth noting that the fy2001 dod budget has more purchasing power than was continuedcompared to fy2000 appropriations for defense in 1999 congress appropriated total of 2897 billion for national defense in fy2000 the total includes amounts provided in the regular appropriations bills both as regular appropriations and as emergency appropriations and 38 billion fy2000 funds for pay raise in the fy1999 kosovo supplemental appropriations measure pl 106 31 offset by an acrosstheboard reduction of 038 imposed by the fy2000 consolidated appropriations bill pl 106113 compared to the fy2000 enacted level the administration request represented an increase of 157 billion for the national defense budget function and of 148 billion for the department of defense the rate of real growth or decline as table 2 shows the administrat ion plan represented real growth of about 13 above inflation compared to the administrations estimate of the fy2000 defens funding level which included among other things 23 billion supplemental appropriations request the administration projected that defense spending would decline modestly adjusted for inflation in fy2002 and would then be essentially level again adjusted for inflation through fy2005 longer term white house projections not shown here assume that national defense budget authority will remain flat adjusted for inflation through fy2009 although this represents an end to the decline in defense spending that had been underway since the mid1980s many argue that the defense budget should increase at least at modest pace over the next few years in order to maintain readiness and permit an increase in weapons modernization see below for further discussion indeed secretary cohen and other senior officials have agreed that weapons procurement budgets in particular should turn up substantially in the future longterm administration defense plans however still assumed that budgets would be flat for the foreseeable future compared to the previous year s administration plan for fy2001 in february 1999 when it presented its fy2000 budget request to congress the administration projected fy2001 funding of 3005 billion for the national defense budget function and of 2864 billion for the department of defense the february 2000 fy2001 request was 49 billion higher for the national defense budget function and 47 billion higher for dod the funding increases included 22 billion to cover increased costs of military contingency operations mainly peacekeeping in kosovo and 14 billion to cover increased fuel costs in the past the defense department has often had to absorb such increased costs within its planned budget and the decisio n to add money to cover such expenses represents significant change in policy1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs6 1 continued planned last year for two other reasons first except for fuel inflation has been lower than was expected last year and dod has in effect been allowed to keep the money saved and apply it to additional purchases second last year it was assumed that the fy2001 defense budget would have to absorb 31 billion of advance appropriations for military construction projects that were actually part of the fy2000 budget request congress rejected the use of advance appropriations however and fully funded fy2000 military construction projects in the fy2000 budget so the extra 31 billion is available for other purposes since the fy2001 budget was not reduced to reflect the additional fy2000 fundstable 2 national defense budget function and department of defense budget administration projections fy19982005 current and constant fy2001

army national guard and reserve force levels secretary of defense cohen decided not to complete reductions in army national guard and reserve troop levels that were planned following the 1997 quadrennial defense review qdr the qdr called for reduction of 45000 army guard and reserve positions of which 20000 were implemented by the end of 1999 as result decision on the remaini ng 25000 positions will be deferred pending the outcome of the next qdr to be carried out in 2001 secretary cohen explained that army guard and reserve forces have taken on much greater responsibility for peace keeping and other missions recently army transformation the army has undertaken major effort to develop and field more flexible and more easily deployed medium weight force structure this entails 1 as an interim step buying an existing mediumweight armored vehicle to equip redesigned brigades 2 accelerating several other weapons programs such as the lineofsight antitank missile the high mobility artillery rocket system the tactical unmanned aerial vehicle and number of command control and communications programs and 3 accelerat ing development of the future combat vehicle fcv it also entails reducing other programs to offset at least part of the increased costs major program reductions which were matter of congressional scrutiny included slowing and redesigning the crusader artillery program and eliminating among other things the grizzly engineer vehicle and the wolverine heavy assault bridge submarines and other shipbuilding programs dod also made some adjustments in navy shipbuilding programs though they were not as extensive as some members of congress had expected in the autumn of 1999 following joint chiefs of staff review of attack submarine ssn force levels dod agreed to maintain 55 ssns in the force rather than shrink to 50 as had been planned the new fy20012005 shipbuilding plan included reserve of 11 billion for either refueling overhauls of existing ssns or to convert trident missile submarines into attack submarines carrying large numbers of cruise missiles regarding surface combatant ships the navy extended development of the new dd21 destroyer by one year through fy2005 and it stretched out procurement of remaining currentgeneration ddg51 destroyers until then in program of continuing interest to congress dod requested money for lhd amphibious ship procurement even though congre ss provided partial funding of 356 million for one ship the lhd8 in the fy2000 budget aircraft programs dod made major changes in fighter aircraft programs but changes in cargo aircraft procurement were significant dod requested 12 c17 aircraft rather than 15 as had been planned officials expected that the decline in us

requested funds for 4 c130 aircraft in order officials said to avoid temporarily shutting down the production line which would cost an estimated 600 million to restart some have argued that this vindicates congresss decision to add funds for c130 s in recent years the navy also restructured its trainer aircraft programs missile defense in its revised longterm budget plan the defense department increased projec ted funding for national missile defense by 23 billion over the fy20012005 period to total of 104 billion saying this will fully support the option of deploying an initial system in alaska beginning in 2005 dod also made some changes in theater missile defense tmd programs the most significant being cut of 859 million over five years in the air force airborne laser abl program as congress directed in the fy2000 defense bills dod included separate funding lines for the theater high altitude area defense thaad system and for the navy theater wide ntw program both are high altitude longrange tmd programs for defense against short to intermediaterange missiles the 60 billion procurement target and the defense train wreck debate in presenting the fy2001 defense plan to congress secretary cohen and other senior officials emphasized one key aspect of the request the request includes 603 billion for weapons procurement the 60 billion weapons budget is particularly important because it has become litmus test of support for strong defense in 1995 the joint chiefs of staff urged an increase in procurement funding then at about 45 billion to 60 billion year beginning in fy1998 this was they argued the minimum level necessary over time to recapitalize an inventory of weapons that would otherwise begin to age very rapidly the administration originally committed to reach that level by fy2000 but fell short as money was reallocated to maintain shortterm readiness achieving the 60 billion target in fy2001 therefore became matter of some political significance as it has turned out the 60 billion procurement level is now seen by many defense proponents in congress as wholly inadequate in the congressional defense committees the issue has been how far short of necessary levels the budget remains with answers ranging from 20 or 30 billion year at the low end to 100 billion short of what is needed at the high end early in the year much of the discussion was shaped by study by the center for strategic and international studies csis entitled averting the defense train wreck in the next millennium 2 which calculated that procurement budgets would have to average 164 billio n per year in fy2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs9 3 see steven kosiak and eliza beth heeter cost of defense plan could exceed available funding by 26 billion year

httpwwwcbogovshowdoccfmindex2398sequence0from7prices over the next decad to replace the weapons in the current inventory with more advanced versions as systems reach the ends of their planned service lives the csis study made number of assumptions that have been questioned not all parts of the weap ons stock will be replaced any time soon strategic nuclear missiles and bombers for example are not projected to be upgraded in the foreseeable future and some will be retired if there is start iii agreement army tanks may be replaced some time after 2010 but possibly not with similar types of weapons costs of tactical aircraft and of navy ships may be unlikely to grow as fast in the future as csis assumes since the services will be required to reduce weapons performance if necessary to stay within budget constraints modern precision munitions ough t to be able to replace older ones on much less than oneforone basis and many of the newer munitions are much cheaper than older ones and many weapons may simply be kept in the inventory much longer than nominal service life estimates call for perhaps with upgrades that are less costly than buying new systems several less extreme estimates of required procurement levels however still show shortfall of some magnitude the center for strategic and budgetary assessments calculated that the administrations procurement program would cost about 80 billion year in fy1999 prices by the later part of the decade3 the congressional budget office testified in 1999 that it would cost about 90 billion year also in fy1999 prices to sustain steady state procurement rate ie rate at which enough major weapons would be bought every year to maintain roughly the current number of weapons in the stock on the assumption that parts of the force will be allowed to grow older than has historically been the goal4 most recently cbo completed broader study of what it called steady state budget ie the amount needed over the long term to maintain force of the current size and composition5 cbo estimates that steady state budget over the next 15 years would have to average about 340 billion year in fy2000 prices of which as cbo calculated year earlier about 90 billion year would be for procurement for its part the defense department has acknowledged that procurement budgets may have to grow further in the future but senior civilian officials have disputed the various projections by outside analysts in congressional testimony in february 2000 secretary of defense cohen stipulated that procurement budgets will have to grow substantially beyond 70 billion year in the period after fy2008 when several planned weapons programs are scheduled to begin full scale production buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs10 6 statement of william j lynn before the house armed services committee subcommittee on military procurement september 21 2000in testimony before the house armed services committee on september 21 dod comptroller william lynn insisted that the cbo overstates requirements because it assumes oneforone replacement of current generation weapons with like systems in the future which is not likely given efforts to transform the force6 corollary issue concerns whether it will be possible to increase funding for weapons procurement over the next severa l years without substantial increase in overall defense spending the clinton administration assumes that spending on operation and maintenance om will level off over the next several years and that savings from improved efficiency will be allocated to weapons procurement historically however projected om savings have seldom materialized and om costs have continued to grow from year to year it remains possible that increased procurement spending could be finance d by reducing the size of the force for the present however each of the military services has complained that it is being overstretched by the demands of the postcold war international environment debate has focused on whether and how much to increase selected elements of the force rather than on where to make cuts military service unfunded priorities lists for the past several years the military services have submitted to the congressional defense committees lists of programs that would be candidates for any additional funds made available these lists have substantially guided congressional additions to the defense budget in 2000 the services submitted unfunded priorities lists amounting to more than 16 billion in fy2001 and well over 80 billion in the fy20012005 period the ballistic missile defense organization submitted its own list as in the past priorities were about evenly divided between readinessrelated accounts and weapons programs the fy2001 congressional budget resolution approved by the house on march 23 2000 provided only 1 billion more for national defense than the administration requested which would not leave much room for additions to service budgets later in the process the house approved 4 billion more for defense as part of the fy2000 supplemental appropriations bill hr 3908 however all of the extra 4 billion was made available through september 30 2001 so it would represent in effect an addition to the fy2001 defense budget later the senate added 4 billion to its version of the fy2001 budget resolution these amounts together with other measures appropriators took subsequently provided more room for congress to add funds for major weapons programs some of the items on service unfunded priorities lists have been particular matters of discussion in congres s the army for example included proposals to restore funds for programs that were trimmed in order to provide money for the mediumweight force including wolverine and grizzly the air force included proposal to restore funds for the airborne laser program that has historically been matter of congressional interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs11 key issues in congress several key issues emerged in congress over the course of the fy2001 defense debate including several matters that carried over from debates in recent years the level of defense spending the administration requested 3054 billion in new budget authority for national defense programs an amount reestim ated by cbo to total 3053 billion of this total 2845 billion was requested in the defense appropriations bill in initial committee action on the congressional budget resolution neither the house nor the senate appeared inclined to add much to the administration request instead the priority in both chambers was to limit total discretionary spending to something less that freeze with growth for inflation the original housepassed budget resolution provided 3063 billion in budget authority for national defense just 1 billion more than the request the senate budget committee recommended level of 3058 billion 500 million above the request pressure from defense advocates to provide more for defense was growing in both chambers however the house responded by adding 4 billion for defense to the pending supplemental appropriations bill in effect an addition to the fy2001 funding level subsequently the senate agreed to an amendment to the budget resolution to increase the fy2001 level by 4 billion to 3098 billion the conference agreement provides 3099 billion 46 billion above the administration request see table a6 in the appendix for detailed figures through fy2005 the 46 billion added to the administration request allowed congress some room at least to provide funds for selected programs of special interest the conference agreement also included provision that establishes point of order in the senate against measures that would exceed specified levels of funding for defense and for nondefense discretionary spending in effect reestablishing socalled firewalls between defense and nondefense appropriations in the end this provision was in effect moot because congress later lifted caps on discretionary spending to accommodate both defense and nondefense increases congressional action in the past two years the appropriations committees used number of devices to increase defense spending substantially while formally adhering to caps on total discretionary spending in final action on fy1999 appropriations bills for example appropriators included in the fy1999 omnibus consolidated appropriations act pl 105277 about 21 billion in emergency supplemental appropri ations of which 83 billion was for the department of defense last year in action on fy2000 bills appropriators took several steps to provide additional funds for defense and nondefense programs including 1 providing 18 billion in funding for fy2000 pay raises as emergency appropriations in an fy1999 supplemental appropriations bill 2 moving the last pay day of the fiscal year for militar personnel into fy2001 and 3 designating 72 billion in the fy2000 defense appropriations bill as emergency funding httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs12 this year appropriators have taken some similar steps as noted above the house added 4 billion in emergency defense funds to the fy2000 supplemental appropriations bill hr 3908 all of which was made available through fy2001 in effect an addition to the fy2001 defense budget the conference agreement on the supplemental which is included in hr 4425 the fy2001 military construc tion appropriations bill includes 18 billion of that amount along with some additional funds see table a8 in the appendix for detailed account of all dod funds in the supplemental the conference agreement on the supplemental also moves the pay date for military personnel back into fy2000 thus freeing up additional outlays within the fy2001 discretionary spending caps senator gramm objected to this step and some other related provisions in the supplemental and insisted that they be reversed this held up final senate action on the fy2001 defense appropriations bill the conference agreement on the fy2001 defense approp riations bill also includes additional measures to squeeze extra mone into the budget without formally violating spending caps in particular the bill provides 1779 million in emergency fy2000 appropriations of this amount 11 billion is for the overse as contingency operations transfer fund that provides money for operations in kosovo bosnia southwest asia and elsewhere and the remaining 679 million is mainly for programs that were in the housepassed version of the fy2000 supplemental but that were removed in confe rence the bill also includes general provision that eliminates 11 billion in fy2001 funds for the overseas contingency operations transfer fund so in effect the bill provides fy2001 money for contingency operations as in the form of fy2000 emergency appropriations if the fy2000 emergency funding is not counted as part of the fy2001 appropriations bill the conference agreement provides 33 billion more for dod than the administration requested if supplemental funding is counted the bill provides an increase of 51 billion table 3 provides an overview of the bill by title later however congress made an acrosstheboard cut of 022 in all fy2001 discretionary appropriations including defense in hr 4577 the laborhhs education appropriation s bill that became vehicle for several other appropriations measures at the end of the session the acrosstheboard cut exempted funding for military personnel in all the defense reduction amounts to 521 million according to cbo estimates hr 4577 also provided some additional fy2001 funds for defense programs the major defense additions are 150 million to repair bomb damage to the uss cole 100 million for classified programs in funded through the overseas contingency operations transfer fund and 435 million for military construction program s the bill also includes measure

defense health care last year the administration requested an extensive set of improvements in military pay and benefits and congress responded by approving somewhat more generous package this year administration officials focused on fixing perceived shortcomings in defense health care and congress again considered some more expansive alternatives two interrelated sets of issues have been particular mattershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs14 7 for an excellent overview by dod officials see hon rudy deleon et the military health system joint overview statement testimony before the house armed services committee subcommittee on military personnel march 15 2000 8 the congressional budget office has recently prepared cost estimates of 810 billion per year by fy2005 for three similar bills hr 2966 hr 3573 and s 2003 of attention 1 adjustments in the tricare program of healt h benefits for military dependents and 2 military retiree health care the administration supported two tricare reform measures one to eliminate copayments for families enrolled in the tricare hmo program called tricare prime and another to extend managed care option called tricare prime remote to family members of military personnel serving more than 50 miles from military base the administration did not formally propose any changes in medical programs for military retirees though the joint chiefs and other senior defense department officials informally supported at least two measures one is to extend nationally test program called tricare senior prime which provides hmotype coverage to retirees with medicare paying part of the cost for those eligible second is to provide mailorder pharmacy benefits and medigap coverage to retirees over age 64 where tricare senior prime is not available number of demonstration projects to test alternative ways of providing retiree health care are ongoing7 in congress several measures to reform defense health care programs were proposed8 the senatepassed version of the annual defense authorization bill included guarantee that the defense department will provide health care for life to military retirees for discussion of current military medical programs and of some alternatives see crs issue brief ib93103 military medical care services questions and answers by richard best crs report 981006 military health care the issue of promise d benefits by david burrelli and us general accounting office statement of stephen p backhus on defense health care observations on proposed benefit expansion and overcoming tricare obstacles before the house armed services committee militar personnel subcommittee gao report t hehsnsiad00129 march 15 2000 congressional action the conference agreement on the congressional budget resolution included section that reserved funds for possible increase in military retiree health benefits the amount available however was limited to 50 million in fy2001 and 400 million over the fy20012005 period this amount was not enough to cover substantial expansion of retiree health care benefits in its version of the defense authorization bill however the senate approved guarantee that dod would provide care benefits to all retirees this was key issue in the authorization conference the house armed servi ces committee hasc version of the defense authorization approved expansion of tricare prime remote made some administrativ changes in tricare and added some other benefits for tricare participants including lower limit on catastrophic costs and payment of some travel expenses on retiree health care the hasc bill extended current demonstration programs established tricare seniorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs15 pharmacy program and recommended an independent panel to propose roadmap for retiree health care that would establish permanen t benefit by fy2004 the senate armed services committee sasc version of the authorization also extended tricare remote and it established an extensive pharmacy benefit for all retirees including those eligible for medicare with enrollment fee or deductible in floor action on june 7 the senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill by senator warner that would eliminate provision in current law that makes military retirees eligible for medicare ie all those over age 64 ineligible for military medical care the provision would take effect on october 1 2001 in effect this is guarantee that the defense department will provide full health coverage for life to retirees because this meas ure would exceed limits on mandatory spending if extended beyond the end of fy2004 senator warner added provision that would terminate the program after then but his intention clearly was that the program if finally approved by congress would continue with an adjustment in caps on mandatory spending being made to extend it permanently the warner amendment also extended the tricare senior prime demonstration program the authorization conference agreement makes permanent the guarantees provided by the warner amendment in the senate bill and it establ ishes separate trust fund from which costs of the program will be paid once the fund is established the defense department will be required to pay into the fund the actuarily determined cost of future benefits for current personnel the conference agreement also provides nationwide pharmacy benefit for all beneficiaries extends tricare remote eliminates copayments for tricare prime for active duty family members and extends the tricare senior prime demonstration program the budget effects of increased health care benefits are complex and have been matter of some confusion in part because some costs for military retiree health care benefits that the defense department now pays out of annual appropriations will be shifted to new mandatory account table 5 provides the most recent though still preliminary congressional budget office estimate of the budgetary impact of the retiree health care provisions in the conference agreement to summarize 1 under current law the defense departmen t is projected to provide 248 billion in benefits to military retirees over the ten years from fy2001 through fy2010 all of which would have to be absorbed within total discretionary appropriations for dod 2 the authorization conference agreement provides an additional 404 billion of benefits for retirees of which 200 million in fy2001 and 17 billion in fy2002 will be paid for through regular discretionary dod appropriations 3 the remaining 385 billion in additional benefits plus 214 billion of the amount that dod is already providing to retirees ie total of 599 billion will be provided for retiree benefits as mandatory spending in small parthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs16 through medicare but mainly beginning in fy2003 through new department of defense medicareeligible retiree health care fund 4 also beginning in fy2003 the defense department will make payments to the new fund to reflect the cost of future benefits for current uniformed personnel through fy2010 these payments will total 290 billion this funding mechanism is known as accrual accounting and it has been used since fy1985 to finance military retirement costs and has long been used to finance federal civilian retirement 5 in all discretionary dod appropriations will pay 19 billion more than under current law in fy20012002 for increased retirement benefits 290 billion more for health care retirement benefits accrual from fy20032010 but 214 billion less from fy20032010 to reflect the shift of spending on health care for retirees beginning in fy2003 to mandatory accounts for net increase of 95 billion in discretionary funding over fy20012010 6 total mandatory spending in the federal budget will increase by 599 billion from fy2001 through fy2010 an amount that has not been offset and that therefore triggered point of order against the measure in the senate under current payasyougo budget rules the senate waived the point of order by vote of 849 for its part the approp riations conference agreement provides 963 million above the request for the defense health progr am enough appropriators explained to implement expanded pharmacy access for retirees as approved in the hous epassed version of the defense authorization bill the 200 million cost in fy2001 of the health care provisions in the authorization conference agreement was not provided in the appropriations bill but it may be financed in number of ways it could simply be absorbed within the defense health care program financed through reprogramming of other dod funds or paid for by later supplemental appropriations by

admin istration announced revised nmd development program know as the threeplusthree plan under the plan development and testing of missile defense system would proceed for three years after which decision would be made on whether to deploy system then if decision was made to go ahead the system could begin operation another three years later as the plan evolved the socal led deployment readiness review drr was scheduled for june 2000 and the potential date for an initial deployment was pushed back to calendar year 2005 this years debate over national missile defense focused mainly on whether the president should go ahead with the formal drr as scheduled or whether in view of series of test failures the president should leave decision to his successor after test failure in january and some delays in other parts of the program the drr was pushed back to late in the summer another test failure on july 7 further intensified the debate finally on september 1 2000 president clinton announced that he would leave decision on the program to his successor early in the year much of the discussion in congress was shaped by two official reports that raised serious questions about the pace of the nmd development program the national missile defense review panel study headed by former air force chief of staff general larry welch warned last november that the nmd program continues to be high risk development effort and that additional delays could further compress the decisionmaking schedule the welch panel did not recomme nded deferring the drr however the annual report of the pentagons director of operational testing released in february was more critical saying that the nmd program was being driven by an artificial decision point more recently bitter debate arose about the adequacy of planned tests of the planned nmd systems ability to discriminate between warheads and decoys mit scientist ted postol and others have argued that the test program has been deliberately dumbed down to avoid challenging tests of discrimination the international reaction to the us nmd deployment plan was also matter of debate the administration has pursued negotiations with russia on changes in the 1972 antiballistic missile abm treaty that would be necessary to permit deployment without abrogating the agreement the new russian leadership has continued to oppose deployment however and some congressional leaders have promised to resist any measure that would extend the abm treaty the administrati on has also had hard time persuading key allies of the wisdom of an nmd deployment for an overview of these and other nmd issues see crs issue brief ib10034 national missile defense issues for congress by steven hildreth and amy f woolf the cost of the system also remains an issue recent review by the congressional budget office projects somewhat higher deployment costs than the administration has estimated cbo estimates that the initial limited system that the administration is planning would cost about 30 billion in fy2000 prices to deploy and operate through fy2015 comparable administration cost estimate according to cbo is about 26 billion cbo also

navy theaterwide ntw program and the status of the two programs was an issue in congress again this year under the current administration plan thaad will be pursued first followed by ntw unless the thaad program experiences unexpected problems congress has traditionally supported an acceleration of the ntw program however and some navy officials claim that the program is ready to proceed more rapidly than the administration is planning ballistic missile defense organization bmdo officials have proposed program to accelerate ntw that would cost an additional 22 billion over the next five

of some discussion in the wake of disastrous accident on april 8 in which 19 marines were killed during the bush administration congress resisted efforts by the office of the secretary of defense against the wishes of the marine corps to terminate the program subsequent ly the clinton administration has continued the development program and congress has remained supportive occasionally adding money to administration requests httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs23 congressional action none of the committees reduced v22 funding except for minor reduction by sac the appropriations conference report makes reduction from the request the authorization conference also approves planned procurement shipbuilding programs key issue early this year was whether congress would continue to provide funds on an incremental basis to purchase lhd8 largedeck amphibious ship last year congress provided 356 million as downpayment for the 18 billion ship but the administration did not request any money in the fy2001 budget and also did not include funds in future navy budget projections later in the year key issue became whether to provide requested funds for two lpd17class amphibious ships submarine production was also an issue with decision pending on whether to convert 4 trident missile submarines into cruise missile carriers and the navy beginning to argue that 68 submarines are needed to fulfil current requirements for general discussion of attack submarine issues see crs report rl30045 navy attack submarine programs background and issues for congress by ronald orourke the navy has also begun to argue more and more explicitly for an increase in the overall size of the force beyond the planned 300 ships and there continues to be some sentiment on the congressional defense committees to the effect that planned shipbuilding rates are too low for discussion of shipbuilding issues see crs report rs20535 navy ship procurement rate and the planned size of the navy background and issues for congress by ronald orourke congressional action sasc and sac added 460 million in increme ntal funding for lhd8 sac also eliminated 15 billion buy two lpd17class amphibious ships complaining that the desig n is not stable and that costs are climbing instead sac provided 179 million in advance procurement for two ships to be purchased in fy2002 and 285 million for cost growth in the first four ships that have already been ordered both hasc and sasc authorized fiveyear block purchase of new attack submarines reflec ting desire to ensure adequate funding for the current program to split work between newport news shipbuilding in virginia and general dynamics electric boat division in connecticut the appropriations conference agreement provides 460 million for lhd8 and in major change to the administration request it largely follows the senate on the lpd17 ie it eliminates 15 billion to procure two ships and instead provides 560 million only for advance procurement the conference report also specifically authorizes continued incremental funding for lhd8 the authorization conference agreement also approves 460 million in incremental funding for lhd8 but in contrast to the appropriators authorizers approved the full 15 billion requested to procure two lpd17s army transformation the army plan to develop new medium weight force has been matter of some scrutiny in congressional hearings some legislators have asked whether lighter more deployable force can also possess the firepower and survivability necessary for higher intensity conflicts the main questions however concern whether plannedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs24 programs have been adequately thought through and reviewed whether the schedule is achievable and whether adequate funds are available army leaders acknowledge shortfall in longterm funding for the program some legislators have urged that funds be restored for programs the army trimmed in its effort to find money for the medium weight force on an indirectly related issue congress has been particularly interested in helicopter procurement plans the comanche scout helicopter continues to be high priority for the army congress has in the past supported the program in the face of efforts by the office of the secretary of defense to slow it down and there remains some concern that the program may again be slowed by funding constraints congress has also in the past supported higher than requested production of blackhawk uh60 utility helicopters congressional action hasc and sasc both restored funds for the army grizzly and wolverine programs ie programs that were cut to fund the medium weight force hac and sac restored funds for the wolverine program in the fy2001 defense appropriations and the house added funds for grizzly to fy2000 supplemental appropriations though it did not revise funding sasc expressed concern about potential delays in the crusader selfpropelled artillery program an effort to lighten the crusader is part of the army transformation progra m sac went much further reducing funding for the crusader program from 355 million to 200 million and instructing that the program be redirected to develop an entirely new lighter vehicle compatible with the army transformation initiative on the whole congress has proved to be very supportive of the army transformation effort hasc sasc and sac added some funds for army transformationrelated programs while hac added much more including 800 million to equip second brigade with medium weight equipment sasc however included provision that the army strongly opposed requiring sidebyside evaluation of alternative armored vehicles for the interim mediumweight brigade the appropriations conference agreement 1 restores funds for the wolverine heavy assaul t bridge and another bill provides funds for grizzly as fy2000 supplemental appropriations 2 provides the full 355 million requested for crusader but prohibits obligation of the funds until 30 days after dod submits an analysis of alternatives to congress 3 following hac provides 800 million above the request for second army mediumweight brigade and includes other funds to accelerate acquisition of lightweight armored vehicle and 4 adds funds for 8 uh60 blackhawk helicopters and fully funds comanche the authorization conference agreement provides 750 million for additional procurement and rd on mediumweight armored vehicles the authorization conference also follows sasc however in requiring the army to carry out test program to compare currently deployed armored vehicles with new wheeled vehicles that the army wants to buy before third medium weight brigade can be outfitted congressional support for an acceleration of the armys transformation program is perhaps the biggest single story in this years defense debate though sascs insistence that the army evaluate current tracked armored vehicles for the mediumweight force may slow the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs25 department of energy security last year in the wake of evidence of security lapses at department of energy doe facilities congress included in the defense authorization bill measure establishing an independent agency called the national nuclear security administration nnsa within doe to oversee counterintelligence and security though it initially objected to the proposal the administration has now selected director for the agency congress has continued to review implementation of the new security regime and doe security may remain an issue

issue brief ib10036 restructuring doe and its laboratories issues in the 106th congress by william c boesman congressional action hasc imposed some new constraints on doe funding under its jurisdiction pending submission of detailed program for implementation of the nnsa the sasc version of the bill included separate title title xxxi that would establish regulations governing the nnsa intended to ensure the agencys independence from the secretary of energy among other things provisions would 1 set specific term for the first head of the agency 2 permit the president to dismiss the agency head only for inefficiency neglect of duty or malfeasance 3 limit the ability of the secretary of energy to reorganize abolish alter consolidate or discontinue any organizational unit or component of the nnsa and 4 prohibit pay of any doe employee assigned duties both within nnsa and within the rest of doe several senators objected to these restrictions but subsequent further security breaches at the alamos lab headed off any challenges on the floor the authorization conference agreement includes the senatepassed provisions with some very slight technical revisions cooperative threat reduction the administration has requested 458 million in the defense department for the cooperativ threat reduction ctr program that provides demilitarization assistance to states of the former soviet union the department of energy budget also includes almost 200 million for related doe programs 150 million for the materials protection control and accounting mpca program 225 million for initiatives for proliferation prevention ipp and 175 million for the nuclear cities initiative nci in the past congress has scrutinized the ctr and related programs closely last year congress reduced funds for ipp and nci and prohibited the use of ctr funds to construct chemical weapons destruction facilities in russia and instead provided that funds should be used only to improve the

2001 unless the president certifies that us allies have met certain burdensharing commitments this appears to be major issue in the authorizatio n conference all of the fy2001 defense bills however have approved requeste d funding for contingency operations in kosovo and elsewhere the appropriations conference agreement provides reque sted funding with minor adjustments to reflect reduced force levels in bosnia though 11 billion of the total provided for contingency operations is designated as fy2000 emergency appropriations the authorization conference agreement does not include the housepassed measure that would require troop withdrawals from koso vo though it does include extensive reporting requirements concerning allied burdensharing conferees also warned that congress may mandate troop withdrawals in the future if allies fail to meet their commitmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30505crs27 navy livefire testing at vieques puerto rico in january the white house announced an

on the future of navy activities on the island 40 million economic development program for the island and depending on the outcome of the referendum either transfer of navy property to the general services administration for cleanup and disposal or an additional 50 million economic development program implemen ting the presidents plan would require congressional approval of land transfer

matters of debate in defense funding bills in recent years two years ago gender integrated training was major issue last year congr ess debated whether to lift ban on abortions in military hospitals overseas this year gays in the military is again focus of attention though there has not been any specific proposal in congress to revise current policy congressional action the hasc military personnel subcommittee failed on tie vote to approve an amendment by representative sanchez to remove the prohibition on abortions in military hospitals abroad and the full committee later rejected the same amendment on may 18 the full house rejected similar sanchez amendment hasc also approved an amendment offered by representative bartle tt to require congress to be notified 120 days before

military base closures now starting in 2003 officials argue that cuts in the defense infrastructure have lagged far behind cuts in the size of the force and that funding for major weapons programs in the future depends on improving efficiency over the next few years for the past three years congress has rejected additional base closure rounds in part opponents have complained that the white house politicized the base closure process in 1995 when it acted to keep aircraft maintenance facilities in texas and california open as privately run operations after the base closure commission had recommended their closure for discussion see crs report rl30440 military base closures where do we stand by davi d lockwood and crs report rl30051 military base closures time for another round by

levin and mccain to authorize additional closure rounds in 2003 and 2005 china policy in recent years mustpass defense bills particularly the defense authorization have been used as vehicle for measures regarding technology transfers to china and other china policy matters and it was widely expec ted that security relations with taiwan in particular could be matter of debate this year earlier this year the house approved hr 1838 the taiwan security enhancement act that would require expanded ustaiwan military exchanges and establishment of direct military communications and that would mandate annual reports on the security situation in the taiwan strait the bill as passed did not mandate sale of particular kinds of weapons to taiwan but china reacted very negatively to the

specific proposals this year senate armed services committee chairman john warner has joined the discussion urging the services to pursue development of unmanned systems both for ground and for aerial combat in statements to the press senator warner has said that he plans to set goal of having onethird of all deep strike aircraft unmanned by 2010 and onethird of all ground combat vehicles unmanned by 201511 this would require dramatic changes in current military rd programs congressional action sasc cited its interest in harnessing new technologies as rationale for several measures including increased funding for unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance and related missions though not for combat increased funding for counterterrorism and protection against cyberwarfare an increased rd funding sasc also included provision requiring the defense department to develop plan aimed at meeting the ambitious goals for use of unmanned combat systems that senator warner laid out ie that unmanned systems will constitute onethird of deepstrike aircraft by 2010 and onethird of ground combat vehicles by 2015 the authorization conference agreement approves funds for number of programs
