routine 3m lecture given on 12 february 1963 all right this is the saint hill special briefing course first lecture and this is the 12th of february ad 13 and youll have only one lecture tonight reason for that being youtheres less data to put out now more persuasion and youre going to have to exercise this and probably you get very tired lot of you get very tired and exhausted being talked to couple of hours on couple of nights so im going to talk to you tonight about 212a and 3mx all right i have bit of news bulletin has nothing to do with the mental health empire that mr kennedy is trying to create in the united states at 16 billion dollars that isnt news the federal government of course always has wanted the right to incarcerate any citizen forwithout trial and of course immediately they get their legislation passed why theyll be able to do that in other words theyll be able to incarcerate any citizen without commissionpermission from his family without medical consultation and without trial and will be able to move him at any time without the consultation with the family or hearing or trial and do anything to him they wish such as electric shocks and prefrontal lobotomies and of course that makes very interesting political empire and mr kennedy is trying to create just that empire right this minute so i think thats very interesting so im not going to talk about that im going to talk about something much more important something much more important i was clear last night its very remarkable experience very remarkable experience i was firstgoal clear you say i was firstgoal clear well actually i was firstgoal clear for all of about three minutesand we went on to the second goal what happenedwhat happened was quite interesting is i got the last package of items the last two on the spiral staircase there were twentyfive items in all and i got the last pair and in listing the last item actually the last two items my ta sat exactly at 30 at about the eighteenth reliable item the goal had already blown i felt like an electron parade i felt like proton sitting in the middle of heavily spitting electron i thought that was quite fascinating the goal was going bzoom bzoom bzoom bzoom actually and on the meter why mary sue was sitting there and she went completely out of session sitting there and she was just bringing the needle down and the thing was blowing down on rocket reads pswwpswwpswwpswwpsww and it blew all the way down from about 40 to about 30 and that was about that that was at about the eighteenth but the goal didnt give up the ghost until we had seven more items and theshe got the twentyfifth item that includes finding the goal by the way thats twentyfour ris and the goal and she found the goal and went straight into it went straight on through i never had any time to cognite because on some of these sessions she found some championship numbers as matter of fact one of these sessions in five hours and fifteen minutes plus some breaks she found nine ris this didnt give us much time actually this auditing sprint goes from about the fourth to the eleventh is about one week something like that the total time elapsed during that period is probablybecause it was prepared the goal had been found beforeit was probably about 30 hours on this something like that but i was firstgoal clear for 3 minutes i got up and went over and sat down andon the couch and i ate four or five peanuts and i drank pepsicola and well that was very nice and i sat there and enjoyed this sensation of being unburdened and all cleaned up and i probably looked very young and very dashing everything was fine and i came back and she saw that i was sitting on free needle and i sat on free needle while you could count one and two and three and then she started opposing the final oppterm and all hell broke loose and i went through straight bang i cautioned her i said wait minute waitwaitwait you know wait wait im not sure this is the right thing to do i said test the goal the goal shed already tested it wasnt firing and so forth so she opposed this last oppterm and what do you think what do you think she found another oppterm and then something that wont happen to you because it has already happened to we didnt make the test she treated it as terminal and listed it of course that was the end of the free needle wed gotten this all straightened out finally we had very hectic time of it but the bridge between the first goal and the second goal is very simple you just oppose the last oppterm and youre in the soup actually as i got the first pair one of them listed backwards i told the auditor what my next goal was and that rocket read and thats fine so were operating on this goal and it was very hard to get these thingsnext item straightened around because of course theyre in reverse to what you would expect so anyway were about two or three items deep now on the next goal actually found one ri and we have list goingand weve got to take this oppterm against the last oppterm i got on the first goal and weve got to do something with that and list it right way to we made some progress but you never saw anybody nosedive quite as fast from the sublime to the soup that was really remarkable which is very good data for you im not telling you just because its im telling you because you undoubtedly you knucklehead i know you im looking straight at you i know you you sooner or later will hear the pc say that goal is gone check the goal find it doesnt fire youll be twenty or thirty ris deep and youll say well i dont know and then you will oppose it and then you will fail to apply the terminaloppterm check to the result and list it backwards and then your pc will be very unhappy indeed so iti know youll do this sooner or later even i i may do this sometime when im in hurry but the funny part of finding the next goal the pc presents you with the next goal but let tell you something you actually cant list without that next goal youve got to know what the goal is everything fouls up unless you really know what the goal is so you cant really in spite of what ive told you go very far on ris without knowing the pcs goal in other words you cant take rocket reading ris just all by themselves and list list list and expect the thing to be very happy as an experience because the pc has nothing to align them against and is running in the dark concerning what his goal is he doesnt know so this leaves tremendous mystery you had better find his goal actually its very easy to find his goal because hes sitting right in the middle of terminal that has that as central goal so you just take short goals listtwo three four goalsand one will rocket read like mad and you check it out thats his goal and you continue its very easy to do make sure that you do it now i didnt mean to be so hard on you with regard to your auditing but when somebody in z unit can actually take the source list of pcs goal take the source list of this pcs goal take it extend it out and find an rs an rsafter having found dozen or two rocket reads ignores the rocket reads and opposes this little tiny rs after the lecture i gave you thursday night haaaa hanging and drawing and quarteringhaaaathats too good for him thats completely knuckleheaded act its asinine goals are rr if you got rrs on the list you want rrs you dont want rses and you neverget now you never take one of these little squirt little tiny halfinch rses on 212 or anything else you carry one of those little tiny rses around aw theyre going to get you place theyre going to pull in mass in on you and everything else when i was being hard on you moment ago and said that you were liable to do it when this kind of an error can exist after my last thursday nights lecture after bulletin on the subject and im ashamed to say passed by an instructors view and actually can be listed when the pcs rocket reading item lies on that source list all ready to be picked up and opposed you understand now why i sometimes speak withwell bitterly shall we say bitterly i sometimes speak bitterly because you couldnt do it you try to figure outtry to figure out what little kids going to do with coaster wagon you know and you never can figure it out it becomes tent or something like that the alteris is fantastic now were talking now about 3mx all right it ceases to be 3mx and become 3m because itll carry right on through right according to hoyle bangitybangitybang but you are dealing here with precise process its built like watch it has exact rules it doesnt have too many rules and it is very very easy to do only you can make it difficult actually its fact only you can make it difficult it is probably the easiest process to do aside from the simple repetitive process of olden days that you have had its even simpler because it reveals its exact result bangbangbang and if you dont get that exact result youre doing something wrong thats all youre just doing something wrong now for very long time ive been looking for process that invariable cleared pcs easily well i know enough about how 212 works and howso on to know that this listing phenomena will continue they all behave the same providing they have an auditor it always helpsalways helps to have an auditor and there have been pcs here and there from time to time who have had an auditor now given an auditor and an invariable process why we could achieve process that invariable cleared pcs easily and weve got that now in routine 3m now we also had to have process that was very precise and it was invariable you didnt have whole bunch of rules in connection with the thing that could be varied on pcs with green hair you run sixteen items except on pcs with purple hair you go seventytwo items and then pcs with splayfeet from puget sound only go fiftynine items see that isnt what we wanted when you come to the crossroads if there are several leaves on the ground you always turn to the right except when you turn to the left but on some pcs you go straight ahead well i didnt want that kind of thing i wanted the kind of process that was perfect process in other words pc process samesame difference all right youve got that now in 3m but because you havent had processes like that lately youre going to have to learn to live with it because it can call you an awful liar you say youve done it right youve done it right and all of sudden it all goes wrong something goes wrong well it isnt 3m that went wrong it was you you took terminal and treated it as an oppterm or you took wrong source of some kind or another any number of plaintosee goofs but the wrong source just wouldnt have fired and the terminaloppterm wouldnt have passed the checkout rules for an item these are the things that would have gone wrong now to settle those things and make sure theyre right we have to have invariable rules and weve got those it was through breaking one of these invariable rules by the way failure to check out an item as to whether it was terminal or oppterm applying the eight tests that caused us to blunder as we dropped into the second gpm and made much massier second gpm for little while than i care to confront for while but it was just dropping one of these rules getting cocky you know everythings going along pocketapocketapocketa bangbangbang everything and everythings falling into place why check them you know so hehheh didnt check one boom it was wrong way to the thing goes wrong way to when you drop from goal one to goal two and probably will do the same thing onbetween dropping from goal two to goal three the next rule is the process has to be teachable by rote in other words you had to be able to teach it by rote in other words you say theres this and theres that and theres the other thing and the other thing and you do this that and that and that doesnt much matter how complicated the road is but you have to be able to teach it by rote and after that why itll fire you leave much to judgment on such thing and it cant be relayed and the final thing iswould not be subject to change now thats totally foreign to you in dianetics and scientology you wouldnt know what to do with that but there it is the actual fact is i have been working toward it i wanted something for the long haul so that when we train somebody to do it we train them to do it and they do that from there on out ive been working and working several times ive thought i had it and each time youve proved wrong and im making very sure this time you dont this onewere holding the fort on this one man this is it now with 212 we had this is it and 212 is just as good right this minute as it was when it was first releasedwith this exception we have found it unnecessary to null and we have found there was invariability of the occurrence of the rs as the last rs on the list if the list was complete and so we got 212a well that simply dropped out some unnecessary points in 212 it threw away tiger drilling and so forth and made it very good but out of the listing phenomena of 212 we now have the listing phenomena of routine 3m and youll find out this is just as invariable and its very good its invariable to this degree in 212 you always go fifty items beyond fifty items never fortynine never fortytwo therere fifty items count them fifty you do that with any source list whether it is 2 12a or routine 3m or 212 just doany source list go fifty beyond and on all lists of 212 212a always go fifty items beyond the point where the tone arm became still and fifty items beyond the last rs ill give you an idea the tone arm goes still you count thirteen items you get an rs now you go fifty more but at the point where the tone arm went still why you didnt get an rs after that its just fifty dont you see thats the way that works thats invariable never go less than fifty never never never never if the needle is tightening up youve probably got wrong way oppose or something like that because it shouldnt in 212 tighten appreciably in that fifty seventyfive eighty hundred aha youre liable to get something going pretty tight but that needle will stay loose for that period now in 3m you go fifty items beyond in source list fifty items beyond in source list never fortynine never fortyeight never twenty seven thats fifty items beyond the still point where the ta became still and the last rs same rule same rule exactly now on 3m lists from ris you only go twentyfive beyond that is adequate because youre dealing with rocket reading items and they are more closely compacted together so you always go twentyfive in other words the source list to routine 3m is fifty beyond and the lists for the reliable items taken from reliable item go twentyfive beyond the still point of the tone arm and the last rocket reading or rock slamming item in other words you get rocket read or rock slam you go fifyou go twentyfive beyond that in routine 3m you understand it doesnt matter whether it rocket reads or rock slams you go twentyfive items beyond that needle agitation why is this its actually because rocket read converts very easily to rock slam and vice versa actually these thingsmany rock slams do not convert to rocket reads but rocket reads as they start blowing up go into rock slams its quite interesting that goal in the last part of its run may suddenly give rock slam rock slam rocket read and then tiger drilled little bit will give rocket read rocket read rocket read and then frayed up by another couple of items and so forth go rock slam rocket read rock slam in other words these are cousins these well theyre worse than cousins actually its uncle and nephew where the rock slam is the nephew the senior of the two is the rocket read so you only need to go twentyfive items beyond that but always make sure you go twentyfive items beyond now an instructor is not to check out anything that hasnt been carried twentyfive items beyond and youre not to muck it up or start calling the pcs attention to anything until youve got twentyfive items beyond i mean thats all there is to itroutine 3m and its fifty is the figure for 212 212a those are invariables see what i mean by an invariable rule now the source list for 212 just the source list can have the rock slam occur on it anyplace the rock slamming item can occur anywhere on that source list its not the last rock slam its any rock slam on the list may be it so long as you dont have two things rock slamming you have one thing rock slamming you apparently have blank list you check over those other rock slams and all of sudden youve got nice great big wide rs that you didnt suspect existed and sometimes this is embarrassing because the source listyoure starting to list the source list and all of sudden it rses and you think the source wordinglike in present time what are you in contact with you think thats rock slamming its the first item that the pcs already thought of you put that down on the list and you carry on and you get some other rses and that sort of thing and pretty soon you really cant find what happened what happened to your rock slam because nothing is now rock slamming you go back it was the first item he put on the list but does that meandoes that mean then that you shouldnt complete the list heh well it doesnt mean you shouldnt complete the list you should complete the list and go fifty beyond the last rsing item because just as likely the rock slain would have pulled out of that first rs into another item the contest in source list is to try to get the most fundamental item you can get for that list you dont want any item on the list and you never want two reads on the same list you dont want two items reading on the same list rock slamming or rocket reading that tells you the list is incomplete there will only be one slamming on 212a list and that will be the item but it can occur anyplace on the list well similarly similarly in 2in 3m in routine 3m your source list of course is your goal oppose you never list anything off the goal except goal oppose and that source list takes you intimately and at once right down one of these rock slamming rocket reading lists if its the right goal of course and it goes right on down the line bangitybangity bang and you go fifty beyond the last rocket read or rock slam now dont go blow your brains out or try just to test that last rs and say well it isnt on the list because the last rs doesnt read or the last rs reads tiny little bit and so forth so i guessblahwe better go on and so on youve got rocket reads all over the list look in 3m you dont fool with rock slams unless you absolutely have to if theres nothing on that source list but rock slams youll have to take the rock slam but if youve got rocket reads you only examine rocket readsor let us say you only use the rocket reads you can examine the rses now this means what this means that the first rocket reading reliable item may occur anywhere on that 3m source list so long as the list is complete the only is not to complete the list i remember we had couple of students down here ive forgotten when it was 61 i guess it was we had one of these studentsshe was always flying in everybodys faceand she used to go down and the auditor would list on her 3d list horrible terrible to behold his 3d list 12 items long and then the pc would say oh well thats it i know what the item is now and it didnt even have to read the auditor would simply use it naturally she wound herself up zangitybang actually when pc tells you that is the item its sure thing youd better list further pcs do cognite on items but not until theyre well on their road to clear now the point im making here is the rule consists simply of completing the list and this completion of the list or the item that comes off the list has nothing to do with the pcs opinion this is not up to the pc its simply mechanical action and when you do that mechanical action you look for the thing mechanically well when do these rules blow up when do these rules blow up well they blow up when youve goofed and start relisting after youve opposed the wrong item or run one wrong way to youll find your lists and rules and things are wobbly so you want to do them right in the first place occasionally youll do one wrong youll get down to the end of the list and you wont find anything and youll say ulp oop what happened you wont find anything on the whole list well you probably listed something wrong way to thats what it is now you go back and try to extend some lists youll find youve got more ta action and youve got more rocket reads and youve got more rses where did they all come from well they came from the fact that youve shaken up the bank and its not lying there neatly now so the rules go out accordingly all kinds of weird things happen you got that now after youve done mistake then other things can start going adrift on you but if you dont make mistakes they wont go adrift the most costly thing in time consumption is to make mistake thats terrible now wherewhere you have listed something wrong way to then youve gotten the item and youve opposed that item that you got wrong way toit wont go anywhere now look in 3m on items taken from source list it is always the last rocket reading item it is never any other item on the list its always the last one now if it isnt the last one then just before that you goofed you pushed one wrong way to or you didnt complete list or you didnt complete it to point where all the tone arm action was out it was real good goof and so on and it deadends you in other words its something like riding donkey and the donkey takes you over to the edge of the corral and he authoritatively dumps you over the corral fence and you find yourself youre longer in the corral youre longer in the gpm youre floundering around outside saying where is it where is it where is it its gone gone gone gone well you just goofed on these rules and youll stay with the gpm and clearing as long as you dont goof but if you do goof you know it because you all of sudden deadend you will do list on which there are rrs or rses or its just gone or if they had rrs and rses you go back and you check each one with great confidence you say i will now read you the last rocket reading item on the list you say tiger heh it didnt read first time ifs happened you see gotten cocky youve done twelve fourteen items perfect you see now always the last on the list you cocky you seeyou say well ill now read you the last rocket reading item on the list tiger hahaha it didnt rocket read imagine your embarrassment at this time you see the pcs face sort of screw up you know and he says whats this whats that tiger oh and you say well it didnt rocket read and he says well i shouldnt think it would it doesnt mean anything to where did you go wrong you didnt usuallyyou could fix it up so you hadnt completed the listbut usually it isnt that you havent completed the list and ifs not that the rr lies someplace else on the list theyou goofed on your source item youve either done it wrong way to or you have taken it from one youve done wrong way to youve made mistake or you failed two lists ago to take all the tone arm action out and go your twentyfive items because the pc said he was feeling too dopey to go on id love to hear some pc say that to i would get in my mid ruds so fast itd make his head swim id get them in between the last sessions and id take all his missed withholds and his mothers missed withholds and his grandfathers missed withholds because the only thing that can knock you flat on one of these lists is to have your mid ruds out you can get this pc whos doping hes gone dopey hes gone dopey cowsow and clug wug uhwuwuwuglggwlgg after hes done this for half an hour even somebody in v unit might notice he might notice and then by some miracle remember ron said that the person had missed withholds and pick them up and get the mid ruds in between the last two sessions or something do the works and straighten it all out and then get your list and your tone arm action picks up because missed withhold is the only bug thats the only thing that canif your rudiments are wildly outyouve got missed withhold which all amounts to the same thingyoure going to get ta action and think list is complete when it is not complete that is particularly patent the symbol you want to look for is the doping pc the pc goes dopey he cant keep his eyes open and he so on and he says well the mass keeps hitting in the face and so on very reasonable its very reasonable but hes just got missed withholds and his betweensession rudiments are out so put them both in now these are about the only variables youre going to run into these things can be taught i can see you teaching them now with knout and ruler but frankly 3mx has its own discipline if you ever wanted to see worried auditor if you ever wanted to see an auditor dripping blood on theon the report sheet its an auditor who has all of sudden had 3mx go up in smoke hes been going along pocketa pocketapocketapocketapocketa everythings fine everythings fine everythings fine you know hes got about fourteen items deep and all of sudden the donkey moves over to the edge of the corral and dumps him outside and hes sitting there and its not the last rocket reading item on the list and youll see the auditor start to go yahhh and theres nothing on the list and he checksreads all the rocket reading items banks beefing up on the pc you see more and more more rocket reading items he reads you see the more the bank beefs up on the pc and the unhappier the pc gets and hell say its aa tizzybum uhuha kennedykiller uha psychiatric swindle hehhehheh where the hell where is it didnt write anything on the back of this thing uhhhh well maybe we ought to complete the list yes well before he says maybe we ought to complete the list actually he ought to look overdid he run all of the ta action out and did he go his twentyfive items beyond the last rocket reading or rock slamming item did he do these things if he did them then theres something just ahead of this list like the item it came from or the item that the item this came from came from see tracing it back where all the tone arm action wasnt out or he didnt go twentyfive items beyond or where the pc doped off throughout the whole thingtheres something wrong there he either did wrong way to oppose he thought terminal was an oppterm didnt do his tests you see and did wrong way oppose he got an item all right and then all of sudden he winds up with this list it doesnt have anything on it well it doesnt occur to him to just step back two two items and check those lists usually he shatters because its so perplexing what you want to do is just step back couple and check up and find out if you did those right run your tests on those items find out if they still fire find out what item you goofed up itll only be one or two back of you do the thing right way to but now dont expectbecause youve goofed you seedont expect the rules to hold good thats my message for you dont expect the rules to hold good now lets say you didnt complete the list well youve already opposed what you did take off the list so youve loosened the bank up so therefore the rocket reading and rock slamming count is going to go out on you you see whats going to happen in other words this thing is not going to behave exactly according to hoyle and ill tell you what you do then you pay the penalty for having goofed and you somehow or another get the car back on the highway or get the saddle back on the donkey somehow or another you do it by repairing the immediately prior items to this straightening them out as best you can and proceeding on down actually there is way to do this but as long as you leave an item wrong way opposed youre going to leave jam in the pcs bank so youre going to have to straighten that out anyhow if you just lost track entirely and you couldnt find out where you went you can still run goal oppose and running goal oppose you will wind up with your next consecutive item but make sure that you find out by test if its terminal or an oppterm make very sure of that if you dont make sure of that youve had it because theres the one its the oddbeat one which is most likely to fool you youre listing for terminal you see youre listing opposition to an oppterm so in your head you say of course i will get terminal so therefore your whole attention at this point is on getting terminal so you get it and then you give it to the pc and the pc is all too willing to buy this thing as terminal so he says its terminal you list who or what would that terminal oppose and its wrong way to and you can get an item believe for the moment your rules will hold good because youre clearing the width of your needle swing and so forth doesnt give you the same indicators of tightening needle that you get in 212 it doesnt get that tight it gets tighter but what do you mean tighter the thing is going this way and its not very tight so you dontdont think that it amounts to anything and you say well thats see your tightening needle you dont make these tightening needle tests by the way in 3m its too hard on the pc you dont list it one way and then the other way the way you do in 212 and 212a you just list it right in the first place and youve got several things that tell you whether or not its right and those are given to you here there are lot of these tests as to what the thing is there are eight tests actually and theyre in slightly prior bulletin to this you go down these eight tests one right after the other and you will get yourself full knowledge of whether or not its terminal or an oppterm its not very hard to establish it you dont have to establish it by listing you dont have to establish it by pain and sen you can establish it by whether it turns on mass when you say oppose it or it oppose orand you want the one that turns on the least mass there are actually eight methods of testing this and thats the way you do this you always test these things now youll tend not to test them because the pc complains it upsets the pc every once in while hes sitting there and he knows tiger is his terminal hes very happy about this see he knows its his terminal hes all set fine and you all of sudden say consider committing overts against tiger and he nyah nyah commit overts against tiger and so forth and you say consider committing overts against tiger consider committing overts against tiger now did that turn on more mass or less mass it turned on more mass all right now consider tiger committing overts consider tiger committing overts consider tiger committing overts now did that turn on more mass or less mass turns on less mass its aits terminal whats the matter with you you idiot and the pc will say things like this to you and youll get to point after while where you wont test these things and then one day youll be sitting there and everything was going along beautifully and all of sudden you havent got an item on the list gone magic disappeared what did you do you didnt test thats as simple as that thats the immediate penalty for it now theres something you should know about goal heres another part of tests on the goal you dont find goal lets saylets get this goal lets get this goal to be hero see lets take this goal to be hero and youre listing it and the first terminal you get on it is not an heroic man oh you say thats obvious you know obvious you got the goal to be hero and therefore the first terminal of course would be an heroic man and what would heroic man oppose and you list that and you get coward and you say thats very interesting because thats the oppterm and then you do your third list and all of sudden youre looking at your papers and you cant find any rr that now reads you say where is it where did it go hehhehhehheh there you are thats because you dont know this about goals the pcs goal at the beginning of the run has always gone into the hands of the enemy the enemy has his goal he doesnt thats always an invariable actually you wont even get the straight things if youyou knowif you oppose wrong way to you dont arrive with the right item you arrive with some other item and so youre going along and you get your first item for this goal and its pusillanimous punk thats to be hero the goal see pusillanimous punk you say obviously its an oppterm oh it isnt its the terminal thats where he wound up with that goal thats where he now is he is pusillanimous punk and what is the oppterm an heroic man ho ho interesting isnt it thats his oppterm thats his enemy hes gotten to point now where he sees anybody acting in an heroic fashion and he says sneer interesting isnt it whatever his goal is hes in the opposite terminal when you first find it in other words hes not in the oppterm now dont misinterpret this and think yourself to death his first terminal designationthe less you have to do with significances the better but this will help you because youre liable to fall into this trap the first item you find may be an heroic man for the goal to be hero and you go right along and you say well of course thats terminal if its the first item and it says an heroic man and the goal is to be hero you know doggone well thats an oppterm invariable lets get an idea now the pc has goal to be nice and your first opposition item coming up is to be nasty snotnosed little brat see nasty snotnosed little brat you say well obviously thats the oppterm it isnt thats where your pc got to on that goal thats the pca nasty snotnosed little brat now the pc very often doesnt like this because hes found out that his goal was to be nice and so hes going to sit there and say now lets see ill be nice so therefore my terminal is obviously nice person it isnt thats the oppterm now when he getsnow listen to this carefully when he gets halfway through these terminals lets say hes going to have thirty terminals on this or some such thing and when he gets to about fifteen its even steven in other words the terminal and the oppterm alike are well its something like this person who is all right i guess opposes person who is probably okay neither one of them to be nice see in other words theres counterbalance here and at the beginning the oppterms are all big heroic goal oppterms you see that represent the goal and then that comes down through kind of like an hourglass on curve and then gets to middle ground and then after that the oppterm starts to lose dont you see and the pcs items start to get more and more like the goal you understand and finally the last oppterm which explains to you why old routine 3 ran when you got the right item the last opptermand when it did runthat you get on the goal to be hero the last one see thats number thirty or something like that will be pusillanimous cowardly shaking piece of jelly and the pcs item will be hero but thats thirty items later that doesnt sound like it at the beginning see and in the middle groundyoull see these things the enemy is less and less the goal and the pc is more and more the goal on fantastically gradual gradient and its quite remarkable so that whenyou can count on this you can use this this isthis is very precise you can use this very well lets say to be hero is the pcs goal and you do who or what would the goal to be hero oppose and you finally come up with rocket reading item on the list which rocket reads beautifully and it says an heroic man actually youve arrived with the oppterm not because it was listed that way but because that would be the first ri invariable and the last one will be comparable to the pc when you first find him and start pushing him through the bank the last oppterm is pusillanimous punk see and the first terminal is cowardly brat you see in other words theyre at opposite ends of the pole see its very interesting and they cross in the middle and become quite similar to each other you see how this goes you can actually know where youre progressing on running out goal by just looking at these items and seeing how they less and less approximate the goal in the oppterm and more and more approximate the goal in the terminal and also you can prevent yourself from making godawful mistake all this is very interesting but how long does it take how long does it take actually to clear somebody on first goal well given his goal and given perfect rote rapid auditing everything going along fine youre only looking at maximum of about fifty hours unless you goof now goofs are what cost time now man you could get five ris see while youre straightening out one goof its fantastic the thing that eats up time is the goof get one ri backwards just because you didnt have time because youre in such hurry or something like that and list it backwards on wrong way to oppose and there you go i mean youre just youre sunk youre going to eat up five ten fifteen hours trying to get back on this donkey you understand i mean thats what costs time in 2 12 212a and so on thats what costs the time and in 3m that can be said with exclamation points because the pcs been perfectly happy and now the pc is miserable as hell he doesnt know whether hes going or coming hes miserable terrible state he says well i dont know and so on hes thrown for loop well i thought it would be thethe item i cognited on that item i gave you supercilious idiot i cognited on that and so on its perfectly all right with and you say it doesnt read well of course somebody who was trained in some farreaching place would say well well just give him the item well just commit suicide because youre never going to have clear heh well well just give him the item hehe liked the item it didnt read but he liked it well he might have liked it but i dont and if itif you just want to not clear somebody at all just give him false item that doesnt read and say theres good reasons why it didnt read and all that sort of thing these things read man in other words your goof is whats going to eat time actually if you were very rapid and very slippy and your pc was not having bad time in his own environment while he was being audited so you didnt have to waste lots of time getting in all kinds of rudiments and all that sort of thing and youre going along youre probably looking atoh i dont know youre probably looking at thirty hours with absolutely not slip anyplace you see but well say that it went little slower than that and so forth and estimated it about fifty all right what do we rack up with some auditor whos driving all over the road and that sort of thing well we rack up all of his auditing time lost plus all of the auditing time that somebody else has to put in to straighten the pc out and it will take you hundred to hundred and fifty hours to straighten out pc thats been thoroughly loused up by some lousy auditor yea and itsyoure going to sit and swear because you cant help but skid on the ice particularly when youre first starting in on this once or twice and youre going to sit there sometime for two continuous days trying to figure out oh my god whatwhat did i do you know what did i do hehheh wherewhere did it go i mean whatwhat was it what was it hehhehhehheh well lets see ron said if you opposed aif you ran goal oppose again you could come up with an item you come up with an item and it doesnt fit anyplace and you get that one wrong way to and thats happened and you didnt know where to go with that and so now youve got another item you dont know where it is and oh god youll wish that you had put in that extra ten minutes testing the item out each time and youll wish that you were little smoother and youll wish you had paid attention to this exact sequence of delivering the item the sequence is read the last rs if there is one if there isnt one you dont see it wont be the rs this is 3m read the last rs tell the pc im now going to read to you the last rock slamming item and he sometimes is doped off and he thinks youre going to say the last rocket reading item or something pcs get educated like this dont worry about raw meat just use the same parlance and he thinks its his item for moment and he says well thats not my item and you said yes i know i said the rocket readingthe last rock slamming item and so on i didnt hear you its reason to get into sense like that so just be positive say this is the last rock slamming item i have to see if it reads it is not your item and you read it bang you see it doesnt read now im going to read the next to the last rocket reading itemit is not your itemto see if it reads and it isbong and you read it and you see that it doesnt read now i am going to read the last rocket reading item on the list which is your item tigerbang immediately tell the pc dont monkey with it see that reads that reads thats fine thats your item so on youll get back so youll groove right in to that exact procedure whats the reason for that procedure thats so you dont read the pc an item and then take his attention off of it to something else because the rule is the last thing you do is read the pcs item to him and you dont ever drag his attention off of that item with anything now let show you the difficulty you can get into you didnt know you had two rocket reading items together on list see you had one rocket read on the first column of your list and you had another rocket read on the last column of your list and you had two together so you say idiotsimple walking simple simon in the pies you say im now going to read you the next to the last rocket reading item which is not your item and then read him the item of thethe upper item of the pair well actually the only way you had to tell when you first put this thing down you see he actually was thinking of the item while he said the other item to you so actually it looked like two rocket read and youve just presented the pc with his rocket reading item see and it goes pow you say im now going to read the next to the last item it is not your item waterbuck pow you say uhoh and the pc says yes waterbuck what what what what what what what youve now got to say well ive got to read the other item now im awfully sorry and youll find the pc will start going real sour on you and now you have to get in and get in some suppresses off and all this kind of thing you just had trouble see so theres an additional rule to this when two lie together you dont lay in any statement that its the pcs and you read the rocket reading item earlier than that pair read the earlier item than the pair dont call the next to the last rocket reading item the onethe upper one of the pair because you could be very wrong this has actually happened in session which is why i know about it itll be the pcyouve given him his item you said this is the nextlastnext to the last item it isnt your item you see you gratuitously invalidated the whole thing and there he goes wow you mustnt distract the pcs attention you mustnt distract his attention after youve given him the item thats your nuance now these arethese are very simple rules these are very simple rules its something like learning number of addresses you can read any gods quantity and memorize any quantity of addresses you can memorize them in complicated ways so long as they always come up in that series well thats what youve got here but theres something for you to memorize on it you better get these rules now i know that this material is not immediately available to you and you havent got it in hand actually you now have three lectures on this subject i invite your attention to them i also invite your attention to some rules and regulations of hco bulletin here on saint hill briefing course hco bulletin i think the 12th i invite your attention to those because it says that ignorance of the technology is excuse for goof and if you goof youve had it it isnt the instructors fault its yours in v unit on your first day at saint hill we hold you responsible for knowing the whole of everything you are doing and the instructor comes along and he says well that rocket slam looks big enough to hehheh its an eighth of an inch wide go on oppose it and the person says oh yes well all right all right and goes ahead and opposes it and the bank beefs up and the pc starts caving in and dark hollows underneath the pcs eyes and somebody happens to see this pc and says whos your auditor and he says oh thatsthats joe blow and so forth well joe blow gets an infraction and if it looks too bad its two weeks with auditing which is just two weeks lost course time and which carries with it the same equivalent of fifteen hundred word infraction sheet and you can only have five thousand words of infraction until you get sent down from the course thats terrible isnt it in other words youve got bunch of new auditing regulations coming out why because i want you to take responsibility for cases and i dont care if some instructor came along and said stand the pc on the head you did stand the pc on the head and it didnt work youre for it not the instructor you got that ill take care of the instructor you see why now weve got to turn clears out here now the material ive been giving you follows onetwothreefour rule and ive already seen that somebody thursday night listening to lecture somebody with bulletin in his hot hand on case on which the goal had already been found could disobey all of it and wind up in 3m opposing rock slamming item quarter of an inch wide and actually go ahead and oppose it haaaa somebodys counting on the instructor man somebodys counting on suzie telling them what to do youre not going to have an instructor when you get out of here youre not going to have suzie and weve just got to make up our minds right now that you have to know how to clear people and youre going to be able to clear people and were going to make sure that youre able to clear people and i start making sure of that on your first day on course now because you saw into the entire complications of 212a if your pc looks bad youre for it yes you say but i havent had time to read the bulletins i havent passed them on my checksheet haha im sorry that has nothing to do with it the tapes are all used up and we cant listen to them anymore im sorry that has nothing to do with it makes you responsible for getting your own data why why can we move up like that well weve been talking for long time that we scientologists ought to be an example in ourselves of the efficacy and working of scientology and thats what weve been saying for long time and im sitting in the drivers seat now i was firstgoal clear last night for three minutes thank you very much and good night editors note this was issued as hco pl 11 feb 63 auditing regulations in oec volume 4
