governors bbg proposed to close or reduce certain radio nguage service broadcasting in order to fund enhanced broadcasts to other countri and utilize new technologies to reach wider audience the senate appropr iations committee while recommending 61 million less funding than requested opposes the further reduction in the language services the committee said in the acco mpanying committee report that it supports the ongoing efforts to improve reaching udience by utilizing new technologies it does not support going silent in areas that the committee regards as critical however the recent fighting between russia and georgia refocused attention on bbgs plans to end or reduce voice of am erica voa radio broadcasting to these countries critics of bbgs plans point to the fighting and the coverage in the russian press as an example of the need fo r such broadcasting while bbg states that surge coverage can be increased using alternative means the committee states thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34552crs4 sufficient funding is provided to maintain the language broadcasts when combining the funding recommended by the committee and the 8 million provided in the supplemental appropriations act of 2008 pl 110252 foreign operations the senate appropriations committee reported out s 3288 with total of 245 billion for foreig n operations in fy2009 this is over 16 billion less than the request of 262 billion for bilateral economic assistance the senate bill provides 177 billion including usaid opera ting and inspector general funds 11 billion below the administrati on request the legislation provides 2109 million more than requested for development assi stance 3832 million more than requested for global health and child survival and 3360 million more than requested for migration and refugee assistance mra but nearly 2 billion less than requested for the millennium challenge corporation mcc for international military assistance s 3288 provides 322 million less than the fy2009 request and for multila teral assistance the senate bill provides 2170 million less than requested among the most notable concerns expressed by the senate committee are those regarding the mcc the committee notes that since fy2004 congress has appropriated for mcc 75 b illion of which 598 billion has been obligated for 17 countries but only 235 million has been dis bursed the committee report states that the committee cannot responsibly appropriate billions in additional funding for new compacts without more evidence that exis ting compacts are meeting their goals therefore the committee recommends allo cating the 11 billion difference between the administration request and the senate committee recommendation to the accounts for which the committee increased funding and belie ves are underfunded in the administration request these include global health and child survival hivaids development assistance intern ational development assistance global food security usaid operating expens mra and emergency refugee and migration assistance erma and nonpr oliferation antiterrorism demining and related programs nadr other congressional action hearings
