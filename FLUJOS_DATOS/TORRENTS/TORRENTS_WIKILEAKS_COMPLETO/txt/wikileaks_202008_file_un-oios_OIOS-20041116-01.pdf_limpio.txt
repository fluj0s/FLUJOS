concentrated on the activities implemented by crt expenditure of us 175000 we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of u s 20000 6 the audit reviewed the administration of th ohr tunis with administrative budgets totalling us 78000 for 2002 and 2003 and assets w ith an acquisition value of us 71000 and current value of us 26000 there were thre local staff currently working in unhcr tunis the office is headed by an honorary represen tative 7 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems 2 interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records given the lack of oversight activities since there was reference to any internal or external audit review of the unhcr operations in tunisia conducted in the last 15 years our review was performed in more detail nd with the objective to provide guidance and support to the staff iv audit findings and recommendations protection and programme issues refugee determination status 8 due to the lack of refugee legislation and eligibility pro cedure unhcr is directly involved in refugee status determination rsd du ring the last decade unhcr has explored various alternatives to have professional staff carry out this function from 1996 to 1998 regional legal advisor covering tunisia mo rocco and libya was assigned to tunis he was replaced by jpo on post until september 20 01 senior liaison officer snr was appointed from the end of 2001 to 31 december 2 002 when this post was abolished since then the decisions on rsd are taken at hq 9 despite the fact that there was protecti on staff in tunis hq did not provide instructions on the procedures to be followed name ly in terms of interviews and records the snr field clerk fc performs the first interviews and submits the request to hq however he is currently on extended mission to tindouf and measure has been taken to avoid backlog in the submission of requests to hq the bureau of casawaname indicated that consultant would be recruited for three months in rder to clear the existing backlog and train the local staff it is envisaged that protection officer p3 would be soon assigned to tripoli who would be asked to perform the intervie ws of asylum seekers in tunisia financial assistance 10 while the number of ics assisted has stead ily decreased during the last five years the average cost per ic is increasing from us 1816 i n 2001 to us 2128 in 2003 there was policy on assistance or established needs criter ia according to ohr tunis several factors were used to determine the amount of assistance ho wever these decisions were not documented home visits were not performed to asses s the adequacy of the assistance provided assessment of living conditions financial resourc available resources generated by any professional activities in order to improve the documentation of need asses sment an evaluation form is currently used and crt would be trained to assist unhcr in performing need assessment project management 11 although the project was managed directly by or closely supervised by hq several errors in the preparation of the implementing instr uments were found in terms of currency of the budget addressee of the loi etc incorrect in structions from hq also caused double recording of project expenditures and prevented the closure of the 2003 project we also observed delays in processing the instalments to cr t at the beginning of the year in the absence of any unspent balance from previous years project crt had to borrow funds from other sources to pay allowances to unhcr beneficiar ies more should be done at hq to 3 enhance the preparation of implementing instruments and to ensure timely release of instalments b review of implementing partner crt 12 reasonable assurance could be taken that u nhcr funds spent by crt were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements 13 crt submitted audit certificates with an unqualified audit opinion although the sub project expenditures did not exceed the equivalent of us 100000 and an audit certificate was therefore not mandatory we agree that in the abse nce of fullfledged unhcr office structure in tunisia an audit of the unhcr subproj ects implemented by crt is useful accounting system and internal control system 14 crt maintained manual accounting system which meets unhcr requirements transactions were recorded in the bank and cashbook journals and reported to the appropriate general ledger account in line with unhcr budget c odes payment requests and payment vouchers provided the necessary proof that the cont rols on authorization of transactions and approval of payments were in place the supporting documents for payments were properly filled out the budgetary control system in place allowed monthly comparison of actual expenditures against budget at the budget line leve l crt maintained separate bank account for unhcr projects and the bank reconciliation was done monthly payments to ics were made by cheques which were signed by two persons 15 oios cannot fully assess the project finan cial management of the subproject implemented by crt since there is potential confl ict of interest in his capacity as leading member of crt the hr is crts authorizing officer and bank signatory for the unhcr sub project implemented by crt at the same time in hi s capacity as head of the unhcr office the hr determines the eligibility and the amount of assistance to be paid to individuals and verifies the spmr submitted by crt to avoid any c onflict of interest the hr should not play an active role in crts management of the unhc r subproject other crt officials should be designated for authorizing and approving functions recommendation head2right the unhcr honorary representative in tunis should n longer be actively involved on the part of crt in the ma nagement of unhcr subproject implemented by crt rec 01 c supply management fleet management 16 until the end of 2003 unhcr purchased l coupons from undp which were handed over to the driver without maintaining appro priate records therefore there was control over fuel consumption of unhcr vehicles i n order to improve the management of fuel we advised the snr ac to record the necessary information on spreadsheet which measure has been since implemented 4 17 our review on the use of vehicles from 200 1 up to june 2004 revealed that logbooks were not always maintained nor were they adequate that the unhcr vehicles were used for private purposes despite the fact that tunis is an duty station and sometimes the vehicles were driven by nonauthorized person the caswaname bureau indicated that special authorisation would be given to the hr for the use of unhcr vehicle for transportation tofrom homeoffice and measures would be taken to authorise the snr fc to drive the unhcr vehicle in the absence of the official driver asset management 18 the recording of assets at unhcr tunis in cluding the assets at the disposal of the implementing partner crt was accurate with the exc eption of vehicle transferred to yemen in 2003 and still shown on the hq asset list as an active item ohr tunis should ensure that the corrections are recorded at hq d security and safety 19 basic security measures are in place and t he staff and consultant in ohr tunis have completed the basic security in the field trainin g in order to reinforce security in the premises and to follow the instructions of the secr etary general undp has initiated some additional measures camera security system is c urrently being installed and other measures such as preventing parking in front of the build ing installation of protective glass film are also currently being studied the costs of these dditional measures are estimated at us 3500 for unhcr ohr tunis informed the desk and requested advice on this issue in june 2003 following oioss recommendation request for fund s has been addressed to the emergency and security service ess the reply is still pending 20 in april 2002 hq exceptionally authorized the snr to use the unhcr vehicle and driver for transport tofrom homeoffice for securi ty reasons this measure was terminated few months later though unhcr tunis did not receiv from undp written instructions to stop it we recommended that unhcr tunis obtain f rom undp statement on the measures taken in order to close this security case administration 21 in the areas of administration and financ the ohr tunis generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review procedures for financial transactions 22 unhcr tunis does not operate bank accou nt bank transactions are made through undp the unhcr certifying and authorizing officer issues letter for each disbursement together with the original supporting documents si nce 1 january 2004 the deputy director of caswaname is the certifying and authorizing officer however undp has not been officially informed of this change the bureau for caswaname indicated that in the futu re whenever there is change in signatory undp tunis would be adequately informed 23 since 2003 payment requests issued by unh cr tunis need to be approved by certifying officer at unhcr hq which has led on s everal occasions to payment delays 5 generally it took up to five working days while i t should be more than one or two working days for urgent transactions 24 in order to reduce the administrative work load at hq it would be suitable that the snr ac should be exceptionally authorized to sign payme nt requests to undp under the abod with an appropriate ceiling with the exception of payments related to temporary assistance travel hospitality overtime and any advances to s taff members to ensure adequate internal controls it is recommended that ohr tunis send on quarterly basis list of estimated expenditures under the abod in order to obtain prio r authorization for disbursements from the bureau of caswaname 25 in proceeding the payment undp verifies u nhcr requests to ensure conformity with financial regulations but does not check t hat the correct account code is charged in view of unhcr specific account codes we found man cases where more attention should have been given at hq to detect incorrect coding for instance expenditures incurred by unhcr were charged to the crt subproject or were c harged to nonexisting subproject budget line or project expenditures were charged t the abod etc 26 the current structure of ohr tunis does n ot allow an adequate segregation of duties therefore alternative control measures should be i mplemented for instance regional mission to ensure that the management of the office is in ccordance with unhcr procedures rules and regulations the caswaname bureau indicated that in the future either the desk or the snr resources manager would perform such missions recommendation head2right the bureau of caswaname should consider exceptional ly authorizing the snr administrative clerk to sign pa yment requests to undp under the abod up to an appropriate ceiling and consider alternative control measures such as regi onal missions to compensate for lack of segregation of duties rec 02 control over the abod 27 unhcr tunis does not operate fmis the abo d is therefore not prepared under fmis and monthly administrative budget control s heet abcs is prepared unhcr tunis does not receive from hq an updated and compl ete breakdown of expenditures under the abod at the end of the year the last informati on received from hq on the issue usually dates 12 december showing the total expenditures ccording to the iovs received as of this date in order to control its abod expenditures th ohr tunis should maintain records of payment request submitted to undp hq should send very year breakdown of abod expenditures to allow unhcr tunis to reconcile its budget records with hq data undp cost recovery for services 28 on 12 june 2003 unhcr signed with undp memorandum of understanding related to undp cost recovery for services at the p rogramme country level though it was for the period starting 1 january 2003 it was copi ed to unhcr tunis only in april 2004 during the audit we came across three different ve rsions of the universal price list referring to the same mou according to the version sent by unhcr hq fee of us 11 6 would be charged per individual transaction while for automated recurring or bulk processes the fees would apply only once both versions recei ved from undp tunis indicated cost of us 15 per transaction but one of them does not ref er to recurring or bulk transaction given that the agreement has been in effect since 1 janua ry 2003 and that several other unhcr country operations are concerned urgent action is required to determine what is the valid basis for determining the changes for undps services recommendation head2right the unhcr division of financial an supply managemen t should clarify which version of the undp universal price list is applicable to services provided by undp for the unh cr office in tunisia and other offices operating through undp an d should inform the unhcr offices concerned accordingly rec 03 29 budget was prepared by unhcr for cost r ecovery services in 2003 estimated at us 2800 undp indicated that according to their records unhcr has not yet paid any charges for 2003 and bill was to be submitted bef ore the end of june 2004 however according to unhcrs records an amount of dt 1250 us 985 was paid in june 2003 for administrative financial services unhcr tunis should deduct any advance payment made and amend its 2004 abod if the 2003 cost recov ery service charges cannot be absorbed by the current budget 30 unhcr tunis often deals with small volume transactions for instance us 3 receipt for reimbursement of private calls according to t he universal price list the fee for such transaction is us 15 or us 11 unhcr tunisia sho uld therefore avoid making use of undp services for small amounts for both payments and recoveries by grouping low value receipts or deducting the amount from payment to the person concerned common services with undp 31 unhcr and some other agencies unfpa f ao wfp etc are located in building that the tunisian government provides free of charge to the with the exception of maintenance costs in addition to the maintenance of the building undp provides to the other agencies various other services such as receptio n security cleaning internal communication etc the control on these charges is not fully adequate since undp does not report on its actual costs the charges for the use rs are based on budget prepared at the beginning of the year we recommended that the ohr tunis request undp to provide them with breakdown of expenditures under common charg agreement in order to ensure that the instalments cover the actual expenditures and that there is significant overpayment made to undp communication costs 32 since january 2003 unhcr tunis has not m ade use of the internet connection three of the computers currently in use in unhcr tunis at n annual cost of us 1600 have unlimited access to internet moreover unhcr tunis has access to the unhcr intranet despite the need for it following oios recommendation request was m ade to undp to reduce to one the computers with access to internet installatio n of unhcr intranet is in preparation 7 33 the costs for long distance calls have sig nificantly increased from us 900 per year in 2001 to us 5300 in 2003 it is due to unnecessar charges for connection to sita in early 2003 and to the fact that that since october 2002 the emails are sent through direct phone number at hq which is costly itts informed us that new version of groupwise wa s to be installed in tunis which will modify the current g roupwise connection and allow significant savings oios believes that review of the groupwise conne ction for other unhcr offices may be warranted to ensure the less costly rate medical insurance plan mip 34 the mip for unhcr tunis is administered b unhcr cairo mip claims of unhcr tunis are sent to ro cairo for settlement ro cairo then issues payment authorization to unhcr tunis oios review of the claims did not reveal any shortcomings the bureau of caswaname should consider similar arr angements for other offices in the region eg morocco human resources management 35 though the current structure of the office was established in 1963 the functions of the hr who is holding consultant contract have neve r been clearly defined due to his contractual status the hr does not have the rights and obligations of staff member there was limitation in particular in terms of delegation of financial authority he is only allowed to confirm price and performance and management of pe rsonnel he is not authorized to supervise unhcr staff members and therefore to sign performance appraisal reports pars or related human resources documents such as employ ment contracts 36 there was also job description for the three local staff members and the pars for 2003 have not been finalized in view of the curre nt structure of the office we recommended that the hr prepare draft pars and send them to hq where the designated officer will complete and sign them draft pars have now been submitted to the hq recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should clarify in writing the terms of reference of the honorary repr esentative in tunisia and ensure that job description is issued for the three gs staff at the unhcr office in tunis rec 04 v acknowledgement 37 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr and implementing par tner in tunisia egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office of
