6608c02 shspec73 suppressives and gaes normally there is penalty for crime of omission in this society it is being there and communicating that are the crimes that are mostly punished but there are also crimes of omission for an auditor not being there and not communicating are the highest crimes in the area of tech we have gone from total change to total nochange the materials are all there the road to clear from raw meat to grade iv is very fast that is something you can have trouble with is an auditor it is over before you notice there is difference between wog and raw meat wog isnt even trying some processes are dangerously quick so they are not even in the lineup because they overrun too easily r212 is one of these the route is so fast that only gaes can prevent someone from going watch out here come quickie grades every thetan wants out at least for himself even the suppressive suppressive is special breed of cat he is someone with case gain the sp knows that he belongs in the soup so he is sure that you want to put him in an sp could be described as someone who is always totally surrounded by martians matter who you are as an auditor he will do nothing but commit gaes he wont just commit few he wont audit at all but he will say see i try to audit these guys and it doesnt work so its worthless fraud he rewards only down statistics he goofs up and vilifies every effort to make people better the trouble with scientology in south africa is that they are afraid that lrh will teach it to africans if registrars kept this nocasegain fact in mind it would save us lots of trouble we wouldnt try to audit them an sp will make case gain and cant resist bragging about it the registrar could route them to the ethics officer anyone has the right to complain about one auditor but not about all auditors as an auditor the suppressive is only happy when the pc gets worse and he is sad when the pc gets better an sp is in state of constant attack on scientology he commits overts 24 hours day you very seldom find out about it another characteristic is that he attacks wrong targets he attacks those who are trying to help him he will not complete cycle of action if by chance he does complete one he will reverse it at time during this lecture have i said that all existing governments on the planet today reward down statistics choose wrong targets fail to complete cycles of action or commit continuous overts i have not said that and your inference on that subject is your own responsibility an sp believes that you are trying to trick him into letting down his protective mechanisms long enough so that you can stab him in the back if as an auditor you observe all these things and the pc is getting case gain you know that tech is out because it isnt working you as an auditor can be an ethics officer if need be you should know some ethics tech you have to know how to locate overts that are so unreal that they dont read on meter the heads of governments are suppressives they do commit continuous overts and they do the other things that sps do they would get case gain if you audited them having them in the drivers seat is dangerous situation ethics must be gotten in not on police state basis but on very narrow precise basis the world is also full of pts people they are the ones who cause most of the trouble hence the name the pc who gets and loses case gain is rollercoastering he has an sp somewhere on his lines either directly or by restimulation auditing is fast but it isnt fast enough to overcome the sp you could take the pts out of his restimulative environment audit him up to grade v let him go back to the environment and he would collapse the reason why the pts individual rollercoasters is that the suppressive person or valence will try to destroy him if he makes case gain therefore dont audit pts you may kill him pts person could make it however if he made it as far as the clearing course grade vi is the makebreak point at grade vi you could barely make it in the presence of an sp below this it is not possible another way to handle the pts individual is to do an s and d to find the suppressive the s and d is an assessment not auditing it is an ethics action therefore you cant have gaes during an assessment because it is not auditing you ought to get the arc break handled by assessment first before doing an s and d what can you do for an sp the only known action that will change an sp is the last power process he is the real psycho the only place that it can be done is in an org that has class viis who could run it and registrar who will throw him out when he comes in complaining of case gain because getting him to answer the question could be very difficult if you did do power on him his next action would be grade 0 or lower but until you have total control of the environment and padded cells send him to ethics if it turns out that he has been well audited with case gain you are taking your life in your hands to put him in the hgc an sp got to be one by switching valences man is basically good but he mocks up evil valences and gets into them an sp is in false mockedup valence to which he has earlier assigned or postulated evil purposes or actions evil is the declaration and postulate that evil can exist thats all in the absence of such postulates man is good scientology would be very dangerous if that were not true the suppressive first mocked up badness in another then took on that valence the suppressive got in the bad valence committed overts then was attacked by other beings he is stuck in that second incident it is far more real than pt he is living nightmare anybody has few of these realerthanreal pictures but when most of us run into them we are running back into them the sp never left you and i may go back to an incident of trauma but an sp has never left it the incident is more real to him than pt to the sp all life is the threat of this incident and the personnel in it all life is this incident and everyone in pt is one of the attackers that is all there is to an sp he continuously commits overts because he thinks he is defending himself you could get in this state only if you had lots of overts before it this makes the sp choose wrong targets he cant complete cycles of action because he is stuck in time that is why the last power process works person commits overts stacks up the bank until he cant move on the track then gets the business institutions contain few sp they mostly contain ptss power processes can blast the sp loose from his stuck point on the track so that he can then be normally audited but how can he be audited on power processing in the first place by someone who is perceived as an enemy how can cop or the roman legion audit him psychiatrists fail to put in ethics on their own profession that is lrhs criticism of them lrhs quarrel with governments and politics is the same any system that permits an evil man to rise to power is bad system as an auditor you are only at liberty to handle ethics if you yourself have clean hands and if you have certainty that it is not your auditing that is the cause of case gain you must be satisfied that you dont commit gaes before you can accurately spot an ethics problem the difference between confident and an unconfident auditor is that the unconfident auditor is one who feels that he may be committing gaes the benefits of doing trs are the benefits of the auditing comm cycle itself apart from the processes used we know that the tech is not inadequate if you omit tech or add to tech it fails to work there was an additive until recently auditors were quitting when ta went low saying that the pc could then only be audited on power the truth is that case that is chronically below 20 is in chronic apathy and wont really get over it until he gets power processing but he can get gains on grades the easy way to know whether it is your error or the pcs condition that is causing auditing problems is to know the five gaes your judgment on an ethics problem depends entirely on your confidence in avoiding gaes they are very obvious you could detect them on tape of your auditing be interested in what is going on with the pc observe how he is doing getting and keeping pc in session is under the heading of observing the pc which depends on willingness to confront the pc real justice can never occur in the absence of an understanding of the human mind never our justice leaves artificial justice behind it justice is only necessary in an aberrated world or area
