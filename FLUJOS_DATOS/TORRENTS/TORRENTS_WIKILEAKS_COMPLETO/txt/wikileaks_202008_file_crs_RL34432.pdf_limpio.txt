medicaid rehabilitation includes full range of treatments that licensed health practitioners may recommend to reduce physical or mental disability or restore eligible beneficiaries to their best possible functional levels over the last seven years of available data 19992005 reported medicaid expenditures for rehabilitation increased from 36 billion to 64 billion an increase of 77 in comparison over the same period total medicaid spending increased from approximately 1474 billion fy1999 to 2756 billion fy2005 an 87 increase both the executive and legislative branches have addressed medicaid rehabilitation services for instance in recent annual budget submissions the bush administration proposed administrative changes to reduce medicaid rehabilitation expenditures congressional and executive branch oversight organizations have documented inconsistent policy guidance and states practices for claiming federal matching funds that failed to comply with medicaid rules the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued proposed rule on august 13 2007 for medicaid rehabilitation services the proposed rule was intended to more clearly define for states the scope of the rehabilitation benefit and identify services that can be claimed as rehabilitation under medicaid cms estimated that the proposed changes would reduce federal medicaid expenditures by approximately 180 million in fy2008 and 22 billion between fy2008 and fy2012 the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 mmsea pl 110173 imposed moratorium until june 30 2008 on implementation of the rehabilitation proposed rule on may 22 2008 the senate passed the supplemental appropriations act of 2008 hr 2642 which contained moratorium until april 1 2009 on implementation of the rehabilitation regulations hr 2642 was amended by the house and passed on june 19 2008 the house amendments included moratoria until april 1 2009 for six medicaid regulations including rehabilitation services on june 26 2008 the senate passed hr 2642 without changes to the house legislation so that implementation of six medicaid regulations including rehabilitation services would be delayed until april 1 2009 the president signed pl 110252 into law on june 30 2008 earlier on june 4 and 5 2008 the senate and house respectively adopted the final version of the budget resolution

populations primarily individuals with disabilities the elderly members of families with dependent children and some pregnant women and children1 rehabilitation is an optional medicaid service meaning that states are not required to include it in their medicaid programs what is included as rehabilitation service can be particularly difficult to describe because it may encompass many medical and social service activities some have said that the term rehabilitation is so broad that it has become almost meaningless and these services might better be described as catchall medicaid service if an all other category did not already exist 2 this broad definition of rehabilitation coupled with limited and contradictory regulations have had the unintended consequence of creating confusion about what can and cannot be included as medicaid rehabilitation states have used the rehabilitation benefit to cover many services therapies and treatments and to even cover services that might be considered benefits of other state andor federal health and human services programs there is at least perception that states are covering an increasing number of services that could be considered habilitative or custodial rather than rehabilitative to address the confusion surrounding the rehabilitation benefit clarify definitions create more transparent process and ensure that the services states claim as rehabilitation actually are rehabilitative in nature cms issued proposed rule 3 on august 13 20074 g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g561 federal law describes medicaid rehabilitation services as any medical or remedial services recommended by physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts within the scope of his or her practice under state law for maximum reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration of recipient to his best possible functional level5 rehabilitation might once only have been considered physical rehabilitation used mostly for beneficiaries who had strokes or disabling accidents however rehabilitation now encompasses broader range of therapies and treatments state medicaid programs followed the development of additional rehabilitation therapies by using medicaids flexibility and the broad definition of rehabilitation to extend services to medicaid eligible beneficiaries beyond physical rehabilitation medicaid rehabilitation as defined by states often includes mental health and substance abuse treatment occupational and speech therapy and 1 for more information on optional and required benefits and

mental illness certain disabilities substance abuse strokes diseases hivaids cancer and other conditions medicaid programs cover rehabilitation treatments provided by physicians nurses social workers

columbia covered rehabilitation services7 nationally estimated medicaid rehabilitation expenditures have increased as shown in table 1 total fy2005 federal and state medicaid expenditures reported to cmss medicaid statistical information system msis as rehabilitation services were approximately 64 billion in fy1999 total state and federal rehabilitation expenditures reported by states to msis were approximately 36 billion between fy1999 and fy2005 federal and state medicaid rehabilitation expenditures increased by 767 in fy1999 12 million beneficiaries received rehabilitation services in fy2005 the number of beneficiaries receiving rehabilitation had increased by 362 to 16 million per beneficiary rehabilitation expenditures among those receiving such services increased by approxi mately 30 between fy1999 3020 and fy2005 3916 in comparison overall medicaid expenditures increased at an even more rapid rate over the same time period rising from approximately 147 billion in fy1999 to approximately 276 billion in fy2005 approximately an 869 increase the number of medicaid beneficiaries also increased during this time period rising by 431 from fy1999 403 million to fy2005 577 million during the same time period spending per medicaid beneficiary increased by 307 from 3657 in fy1999 to 4781 in fy2005 although most states cover rehabilitation services some do not show rehabilitation expenditures in their msis data compiled by cms from statereported information 6 rehabilitation expenditures are not reported separately in states financial reports to cms but are included in other financial expenditure categories data on rehabilitation expenditures in this report are estimates of overall rehabilitation expenditures based on msis data reported by states to cms there is considerable variation between states financial reports and msis data 7 the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid benefits online database october 2006 httpwwwkfforgmedicaidbenefitsservicejspgroffntonso0tg0yr320cat12sv36 accessed march 31 2008 according to kaiser georgia texas and pennsylvania did not cover mental health and substance abuse rehabilitation services in the notes to the online database kaiser explains that it counted only mental health and substance abuse services as optional rehabilitation services rehabilitation services also can be included in other benefit categories such as clinic services and physical rehabilitation if all benefits that could be rehabilitation services are considered then virtually all states and the district of columbia cover medicaid rehabilitation nonetheless for the purpose of this discussion only 48 states were counted as providing medicaid rehabilitation services

statute and regulation what activities states may cover as rehabilitation services these administrative and legislative activities strived to define how rehabilitation service benefits should be used as well as to control or reduce states rehabilitation service expenditures for example in the 1970s and 1980s the secretary of health and human services approved 17 state plans8 to cover habilitative services for mentally retarded statutory term individuals under the rehabilitation option habilitative in contrast to rehabilitative services are intended to help indi viduals acquire retain and improve selfhelp and adaptive skills but are not intended to remove or reduce individuals disabilities the secretary later withdrew approval for habilitative services because the services were determined to not meet conditions to qualify for the rehabilitation benefit in 1989 with passage of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 obra 1989 pl 101239 9 congress intervened and permitted states that had received the secretarys approval to continue to cover these services congress prohibited other states from gaining approval to cover habilitative services for mentally retarded individuals 8 based on conversation with cms staff the 17 states approved to provide habilitative services under the rehabilitation benefit were arkansas california colorado delaware idaho iowa maine maryland massachusetts michigan missouri montana new york ohio oregon rhode island and wyoming 9 see section 6411g of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 obra pl 101239

that provided guidance to states on using the rehabilitation option as vehicle for providing services to mentally ill beneficiaries this letter reiterated regulatory guidance that rehabilitation services were intended to be medical and remedial in nature for the maximum reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration of recipient to his best possible functional level the letter offered examples of services that states could cover under the rehabilitation option including basic living skills social skills counseling and therapy the smdl also described examples of services cms believed to fall outside of the definition of rehabilitation including vocational training direct personal care services and case management case management is covered under separate medicaid benefit option in 2005 the government accountability office gao and health and human services office of inspector general hhsoig issued reports that were critical of states and cmss practices on rehabilitation congressional testimony presented by cms officials also was critical of state practices to maximize federal matching payments for rehabilitation and other medicaid expenses 11 gaos reports were critical of cms for not issuing guidance that would clarify rules for states to follow in claiming federal financial participation ffp for medicaid services such as rehabilitation12 these same gao reports and testimony found that states increased federal matching payments for rehabilitation and other services by increasing medicaid payments to other state government agenciesnonmedicaid human services agencies that serve medicaid beneficiaries in addition hhsoig audits showed that states did not meet federal and state reimbursement requirements for rehabilitation services or comply with state andor federal medicaid rules 13 even though statutory and regulatory guidance for states on claiming medicaid rehabilitation expenditures have been inconsistent states often receive explicit guidance on specific services that can be covered under the rehabilitation benefit when preparing and submitting state plan amendments spas to cmss regional and central offices these cms staff must review and approve all spas before state may add or chan ge services through the spa approval process states can receive considerable direction spa approvals however are dependent on states making changes to their medicaid service offerings and as long as the programs remain static it is not necessary to seek cmss approval further cms contends that new rehabilitation rules are needed to guide states in making changes to their rehabilitation benefit offerings to provide states with clear transparent and consistent guidance and to clarify definitions moreover cms states new rule is necessary to protect beneficiaries and to maintain the fiscal integrity of the medicaid program 10 cms issues periodic policy guidance and clarification through correspondence with states medicaid directorsstate medicaid director letters or smdls these letters generally are available on cms website at httpwwwcmshhsgovsmdl however this letter is unavailable on cmss smdl website 11 dennis smith

specific outcome objectives for each patient treatments to achieve those goals specific timeline for treatment and the health care provider responsible for developing the plan rehabilitation plans would need to provide for process to engage the beneficiary as well as families and other responsible parties in the management of rehabilitation care this personcentered approach is intended to improve transparency help to speed recovery and facilitate coordination with other nonmedicaid human services programs rehabilitation services would need to be delivered under th direction of qualified providers who assume professional responsibility for ensuring all services are provided and are medically necessary

elements of programs other than medicaid however the rule stipulates that beneficiaries of other nonmedicaid programs may still be covered for medicaid rehabilitation services if all medicaid program

receive ffp the rule acknowledges for other rehabilitation services delivered to medicaideligible beneficiaries placed in tfc as long as the services were deemed medically necessary and described in rehabilitation treatment plan supervised by qualified provider in addition the proposed rule describes services that would not be considered rehabilitative services furnished through nonmedical programs as benefits or admi nistrative activities would not be considered rehabilitation under the proposed rule the rule identifies nonmedicaid programs such as foster care child welfare education child care vocational and prevocational training housing parole and probation juvenile justice and public gu ardianship also medicaid rehabilitation would exclude room and board coverage for residents of community home or institutional settings including beneficiaries residing in institutions for mental disease such as community residential treatment facilities g21g142g157g157g146g151g144g156g561 although rehabilitative services may be provided in facility home or other setting the proposed rule specifies that such care does not include room and board in an institution community or home setting and thus is not an inpatient benefit when rehabilitative services are provided in residential setting and delivered by qualified providers only the costs of the specific rehabilitative services would be covered under the rehabilitation benefit

clarify distinctions between rehabilitative and habilitative services where rehabilitation focuses on restoration of functional level and habilitation services help people to acquire new functional abilities habilitation services particularly in states approved prior to obra 1989 are associated with day treatment services for mentally retarded individuals or individuals with related conditions the proposed rule would prohibit habilitative services for states grandfathered under obra 1989 these states that were approved for habilitative services coverage under the clinic or rehabilitation benefits would need to transition those programs to other medicaid authorities such as 1 home and communitybased service hcbs 1915c waiver programs or 2 the hcbs state plan option 1915i established under the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 cms was forbidden from taking adverse action against the 19 states that were approved to cover habilitation services until such time as the agency issued regulations that specify types of day habilitation services states may cover cms stipulates that with the proposed rehabilitation rule the agency has met obra 1989 conditions so that states that were permitted to cover habilitation under rehabilitation benefits would need to phase out those services

perspectives on rehabilitation policy issues 1 the viewpoint of the federal regulatory agency cms responsible for monitoring and enforcing states compliance with federal medicaid statutes 2 the perspective of advocates representing children and adults who could receive medicaid rehabilitation services and 3 the stance of state governments and state medicaid agencies cms believes there is evidence that additional guidance is needed to clarify what can and can not be claimed as rehabilitation services cms cites criticism from gao and hhsoig the agency also notes that through the spa process it has discerned confusion among states about what is rehabilitation and habilitation and other issues related to rehabilitation further cms claims and as gao also has recommended without clarifying guidance states could inappropriately claim excess ffp by paying for services and administrative components of other nonmedicaid state agencies that service medicaid beneficiaries organizations representing individuals living with mental illness and their families as well as child welfare and disability groups have expressed concerns that personcentered care approaches while wellintentioned may be problematic with rehabilitation beneficiaries 19 these groups argue that rehabilitation therapy is often provided to individuals with serious mental health issues and these populations may be unable to be actively involved in their therapy decisions these groups state that requirements for personcentered rehabilitation plans need to be more flexible when dealing with noncompliant beneficiaries as opposed to onesizefitsall requirement for personcentered rehabilitation plans similarly child welfare groups contend that requirements to engage parents in decisions about therapy for children in foster care may compound delay or undo therapy by returning an abused or neglected child to influences that are detrimental to the childs treatment organizations representing children particularly specialneeds children are concerned that the rehabilitation proposed rule would make it more diff icult for children to receive rehabilitation and related services

argue that the distinction between rehabilitation and habilitation is not relevant factor in addressing childrens needs for health services advocates say that because of early and periodic screening diagnostic and treatment epsdt provisions in medicaid children should receive rehabilitation treatment whether it can be considered habilitation or rehabilitation medicaids childrens health benefits known as the epsdt benefits21 ensure that children receive comprehensive coverage for at least categorically needy beneficiaries according to specialneeds children advocates epsdt coverage ensures that children receive treatment to ameliorate physical or mental conditions whether children were born with the conditions or developed them later22 similarly other child welfare advocates indicate that it can be much more complex judgment with children to determine when beneficiary has lost functioning or when the child may not yet have developed certain skills or abilities in the first place children acquire and master skills at different times and may not be at age appropriate levels because of physical emotional social or many other problems these judgments are further compounded among specialneeds children which would include most children in foster care 23 advocates for mentally retarded and developmentally disabled mrdd individuals are concerned that the proposed rehabilitation regulations could reduce key funding stream for communitybased mental health services resulting in reductions in services for needy individuals and incentives to treat mrdd individuals in institutional settings 24 if mrdd individuals and their families were unable to find suitable communitybased care the result might be increased medicaid expenditures where the costs for institutional care might exceed communitybased services they argue that if the goal is to save money the proposed rule could be counter productive further mental health advocates are concerned that the proposed medicaid rehabilitation regulations requiring treatment plans to document skill recovery and lost functionality will diminish medicaidreimburse d services for individuals who are developing skills to cope with mental and emotional disabilities but are not considered to have lost previously acquired skills states are concerned that cmss proposed rehabilitation service regulations would entail substantial new administrative and procedural burdens on states in bringing their medicaid state plans into compliance in addition states claim that reductions in rehabilitation expenditures might be more costly in the long run as individuals particularly children would benefit from earlier interventions that might avert future more costly care further states note that medicaid expenditures run counter to business cycles so that when states economic conditions deteriorate medicaid expenditures rise thus state governors argue as the economy contracts federal 20 specialneeds children are
