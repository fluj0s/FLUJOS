indian trust reform act of 2005 and an identical measure hr 4322 were introduced in the 109th congress to address settlement of the cobell v norton1 litigation they cover claims by individual indian beneficiaries that funds held in individual indian moneys iim accounts in their names by the department of the interior doi have not been properly handled2 funds in the iim accounts represent receipts from the leasing of trust land held in the name of individual indians or leasing of mineral rights timber management contracts grants of rights of way or other incomeproducing activities relative to such land there are also iim accounts that represent per capita shares of tribal distributions in introducing the legislation senator mccain stated that s 1439 would resolve the cobell litigation by creating settlement fund and directing the secretary of the treasury to develop formula for distributing the fund to the beneficial owners of iim accounts in full settlement for losses errors and unpaid interest in their iim accounts as well as reform the indian trust management system restructure the bureau of indi an affairs under an under secretary for indian affairs and phase out the office of special trustee 3 the legislation was premised on findings that although congress has appropriated tens of millions of dollars to provide an historical accounting of funds held by the federal government in iim accounts some data indicates that complete historical accounting of the receipts and disbursements may be impossible cost hundreds of millions of dollars and be incomplete at the death of many of the elderly account beneficiaries4 there are also findings respecting the need for complete historical accounting to determine losses in the iim accounts resulting from errors or mismanagement and the possibility that the cost of an accounting may exceed the current balance of total sums passing through or the enforceable liability of the united states for losses from the iim accounts 5 there is also finding that because many of the beneficiaries would prefer monetary settlement rather than protracted litigation congress should provide benefits that are reasonably calculated to be fair and appropriate in order to transmute claims by the beneficiaries of iim accounts for undetermined or unquantified accounting losses and interest to fixed amount taking into consideration the risks of delay and litigation to the claimants6 title i resolution of historical accounting claims in cobell v norton would provide lump sum the amount of which is to be determined during the course of legislative consideration for an individual indian accounting claim settlement fund to be administered by the secretary of the treasury who is to appoint special master of the fund 80 is to be used to make payments to claimants with one portion distributed to all claimants on per capita basis and 1 cobell v norton et case 196cv01285 ddc documents are available on the

accounting and individual indian trust accounts it calls for lump sum settlement amount of 27487 billion which is seen as justified among other things in terms of the level of mismanagement of the iim accounts and the potential cost of an accounting it requires that the sum be agreed to by class representatives and distributed by the district court also included in this section is requirement for

rights within selfdetermination contracts the indian land consolidation principles advocate further legislation to promote consolidation of franctionated interests in land and specify various practices including those designed to assure that adequate notice is provided to land owners assistance is given to promote practices that will lead to land consolidation and tribal government purchase of fractionated lands is fostered principles under the heading individual indian resource management claims propose that congress provide fair offer to individual indians for decades of federal mismanagement of their trust resources13 g20g142g138g140g157g146g152g151g561 in introducing s 1439 senator mccain presented it as preliminary step rather than an unalterable legislative package he thanked plaintiffs representatives and various indian organizations but cautioned them and other stakeholders that they may have issues with certain aspects of the bill as it is now written

begun doi took the position that any legislative solution should 1 eliminate any requirement for historical accounting 2 address all claims related to funds mismanagement 3 include methods of ameliorating fractionated interests and 4 address the issue of resource mismanagement claims 15 elouise c cobell voiced mixed response to the legislation comparing it unfavorably with the principles but resolv ing to continue working with the committee and expressing hope for the ultimate resolution of the issue she endorsed the bills provisions requiring the use of the judgment fund instead of doi program funds and indicating that the settlement amount could be expected to be in the billions of dollars on th other hand she criticized the bill for 1 placing the administration of the settlement fund within the executive branch and eliminating judicial oversight over the distribution process 2 not setting an actual amount for the settlement fund and 3 failing to provide thoroughgoing refo rm for the trusts held for individual indians through clear definition of trust duties enforcement by the courts remedies for breach and independent oversight
