land border this report examines the strengths and limitations of deploying uavs along the borders and related issues for congress this report will be updated as events warrant background within the department of homeland security dhs customs and border protection cbp is the lead agency charge d with securing our nations borders while cbp is charged with overall border enforcement within the bureau distinction is made concerning border enforcement at and between ports of entry poe at poe cbp officers are responsible for conducting immigrations customs and agricultural inspections on individuals presenting themselves for entry into the united states between poe the united states border patrol usbp is charged with detecting and preventing the entry of terrorists weapons of mass destruction nd unauthorized aliens into the country and interdicting dr ug smugglers and other criminals the usbp utilizes advanced technology to augment its agents ability to patrol the border the technologies used include but are not limited to sensors light towers mobile night vision scopes remote video surveillance systems directional listening devices various database sy stems and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs these so called force multipliers allow the usbp to deploy fewer agents in specific area while maintaining the ability to detect and counter intrusions and are increasingly becoming part of the usbps daytoday operations increasingly dhs has explored the use of uavs to augment usbp agents ability to patrol the border there are two different types of uavs drones and remotely piloted vehicl rpvs both drones and rpvs are pilotless but drones are programmed for aut onomous flight rpvs are actively flown remotely by ground control operator uavs are defined as powered aerial vehicle that does not carry human operator uses aerodynamic forces to provide lift can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely can be expendable or recoverable and can

been used in vari ous military settings outsi of us borders uavs have provided rec onnaissance surveillance target acquisition search and rescue and battle damage asse ssments in the recent wars in afghanistan and iraq uavs have been used for surveillance purposes and to attack enemies the predator uav for example was armed with antitank weapons to attack taliban and qaeda members uavs have also been used in dom estic settings the nasasponsored environmental research aircraft and sens or technology erast program has produced civilian uavs to monitor pollution and m easure ozone levels the massachusetts institute of technology mit is involved in developing global positioning systems gps and video camera guidance for us ing uavs to locate and identify toxic substances3 lastly the department of energy recently announced that it will test uavs outfitted with radiation nsors to detect potential nuclear reactor accidents4 congressional mandates for the use of uavs congress has directed dhs to study the feasibility of using uavs and to implement the technology to surveil the borde r on numerous occasions in the 108th congress the intelligence reform and terrorism prev ention act pl 108458 included provisions calling for pilot program to study the use of these technologies including uavs along the northern border the law also required dhs to present plan within six months of enactment to comprehensively monitor the southwest border with uavs and to implement the plan as pilot program as s oon as funds are appropriated for that purpose5 the 2003 dod authorization act pl 108136 re quired the president to issue report on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for support of homeland security missions in the 109th congress the conference report to the fy2007 dhs

surveil the u smexican border since june 2004 the uav demonstrations conducte d by various commercial compan ies at fort huachuca and gila bend arizona on behalf of cb p have prompted various questions regarding their potential use within the united states that will be addressed subsequently one uav model the predator b was used as part of the arizona border control initiative multidisciplinary initiative that seeks to coordinate federal state and local authorities to control the arizona border7 until it was destroyed in crash on april 25 20068 congress required dhs to report on its findi ngs related to this crash and other uav mishaps by january 23 2007 in the conference report to pl 109295 the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110 161 directed dhs to explore the use of uavs in the marine environment in additi on to the border nd appropriated 15 million for dhss uav program additionally th dhs conference report to the fy2008 act directed dhs to work with other federal agencies including the faa to evaluate the appropriateness of an faa exemp tion for small scale uav technology benefits and limitations of uavs benefits one potential benefit of uavs is th at they could fill gap in current border surveillance by improving coverage along remote sections of the us borders electrooptical eo sensors cameras can identify an object the size of milk carton from an altitude of 60000 feet9 uavs also can provide pr ecise and realtime imagery to ground control operator who would th disseminate that information so that informed decisions regarding the deployment of border patrol agents can be made quickly additionally the predator b used along th southern border can fly for more than 30 hours without having to refuel compared with helicopters average flight time of just over 2 hours the ability of uavs to loiter for prolonged periods of time has important operational advantages over manned aircraft the longer flight times of uavs means that sustained coverage over previously ex posed area may improve border security the range of uavs is significant asset when compared to border agents on patrol or stationery surveillance equipment if an illegal border entrant attempts to transit through dense woods or mountainous terra in uavs would have greater chance of tracking the violator with thermal detection sensors than the stationary video equipment which is often used on the borders it is impor tant to note however that rough terrain and dense foliage can degrade the images produced by uavs sensory equipment and thus limit their effectiveness at the borders th extended range and endurance of uavs may lessen the burdens on human resources at the borders also uav accidents do not risk the lives of pilots as do the helicopter s that currently patrol us bordershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21698crs4 10 ibid 11 amy butler acc officials to suggest serv ice establish five pr edator squadrons inside the air force june 7

aerial vehi cles background and issues for congress 15 paul jackson janes all the worlds aircraft 20032004 pp 721722limitations despite potential benefits of using uavs for homeland security various problems encountered in the past may hinder uav impleme ntation on the border there are concerns regarding the high accident rate of uavs which is currently 100 times higher than that of manned aircraft10 because uav technology is still evolving there is less redundancy built into the ope rating system of uavs than of manned aircraft and until redundant systems are perfected mishap rates are expected to remain high additionally if control systems fail in manned aircraft welltrained pilot is better positioned to find the source of the problem because of his her physical proximity if uav encountered similar system failure or if uav landi ng was attempted during difficult weather conditions the ground control pilot would be at disadvantage because he or she is removed from the event unlike manned pilot the remote pilot would not be able to assess important sensory info rmation such as wind speed11 inclement weather conditions can also impinge on uavs surveillance capability especially uavs equipped with only an eo camera and forward looking infrared radar flir because cloudy conditions and high humidity climates can distort the imagery produced by eo and flir equipment alt hough the predator b is operating in the low humidity environment of the southwest the effects of extreme climatic or atmospheric conditions on its sensors reportedly can be mitigated if dhs decides to outfit the predator b with synthetic aperture radar sar system12 and moving target indicator mti radar adding sar and mti to the predator bs platform could significantly enhance its operational capability for border missions however adding sar and mti to the uav platform would increase the costs asso ciated with using uavs on the border according to the cbp inspector general the costs of operating uav are more than double the costs of operating manned aircraft this is b ecause uavs require significant amount of logistical support and specialized opera tor and maintenance training operating one uav requires crew of up to 20 support personnel additionally the use of uavs has resulted in fewer alien apprehensions pe r flight hour than the use of manned aircraft13 the high comparative costs of operating uav may be offset somewhat by their comparatively lower unit co sts the unit cost of uavs varies widely from 350000 for the shadow uav to 45 million for the predator14 in contrast the unit cost for manned aircrafts used along the border vary from 86 million for the cbp blackhawk helicopters to 36 million for immig ration and custom enforcements p3 manned aircraft however the benefit of the blackhawks relative low unit cost is offset by its lack of endurance given its max imum flight time of 2 hours and 18 minutes15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21698crs5 16 from crs site visit to the air nd marine operations center august 2005 17 testimony of major general michael kostelnik house committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on aviation march 29 2006 18 in november 2003 the faa dod nasa and six companies launched fiveyear program to address the safety and technical concerns associated with using uavs in national airspaceother concerns lastly how uavs could be integrated into civilian airspace within the united states is fundamental ques tion that would need to be addressed by the federal aviation administration faa nd dhs integrating uavs into civilian airspace so that they could operate safely w ould require not only the creation of regulatory guidelines by the faa but also technical developments the faa requires that all aircraft operating in us airs pace have the ability to detect and avoid other aircraft for uavs this has meant that an operator at am oc must be dedicated to each uav that is flying16 additionally the faa has required that uav operators be licensed pilots the faa currently is working on guidelines for integrating uavs into the national air space nas and has deployed representative to amoc to liaise with dhs on variety of issues including the use of uavs17 although there are guidelines or regulations for incorporating uavs into the nas the faa s worked closely with government users of uav technology in developing certificate of authority coa so nas can be blocked off for exploratory development or operationa l testing primary concern of the faa is whether uavs can operate in already crowded airspace before uavs can be introduced into national airspace the faa dhs and other relevant users will need to address collisionavoidance communica tion and weather avoidance issues18 issues for congress while congress has demonstr ated consistent support for the concept of using uavs in border security many stions remain regarding th eir practical employment costs vs benefits as noted the cost comparison between uavs and manned aircraft is complicated uavs are less expensive to procure than manned aircraft but may cost more to operate thus the life cycle cost of uavs could actually be greater than the life cycle cost of manned aircraft the disparity in operating may be offset by the fact that uavs can remain in the air more than 10 times longer than the helicopters currently being used by cbp to support the usbp further uav command and control systems are being developed that can c ontrol multiple uavs simultaneously when fielded these new capabilities may change the cost compar ison to favor uavs over manned aircraft uav effectiveness the dhs inspector general noted that uavs were less effective in their limited tests than manne d aircraft in supporting the apprehension of unauthorized aliens in addition the uavs were used to assist in the apprehensions of aliens who had already been detected by other means however ability of uavs to maintain position for over 20 hours represen ts significant advantage over manned aircraft in the future they may be used to actually detect unauthorized entries as opposed to merely supporting apprehensi ons of aliens already detect ed an issue for congress could entail whether uavs are an eff ective tool for securing the borderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21698crs6 19 robots jets could share airspace by 2008 angeles times may 21 2004 rich tuttle meeting on uavs in nas gets good industry faa reviews aerospace daily november 24 2003 20 statement of christopher bolkcom senate governmental affairs committee subcommittee on international security proliferation and federal services june 11 2002 21 tom kongton italy could fly uav s in civil air by year end isr journal june 14 2004lack of information testing uavs along the border has been limited robust program to test multiple uavs on the borders might ascertain where how and whether uavs should be deployed larger scale tes ting would provide an opportunity to evaluate whether limitations of uavs would hinder their utility on the border in the past multiple uavs piloted in close proximity have expe rienced interference and loss of control between the uav and the remote pilot in ma ny cases interference led to accidents possible issue for congress coul d include whether testing s hould be expanded before any decisions are made regarding the wi descale use of uavs along the border coordination with usbp agents while uavs may in the future be used to detect unauthorized entries the fact remains that usbp agents must be deployed to apprehend any aliens thus id entified possible issue for congress could entail whether there are enough border patrol resources to investigate all uav identified targets safety concerns the technical capabilities of th uavs have been tested in military context but serious safety and technical issues need to be addressed if the program is to be expanded dom estically chief among these issues is the faas concerns about the nas and whether uavs can be safely incorporated into the nations crowded skies it is noted that uavs suffer accident rates up to 100s of time higher than manned aircraft however in an effort to support the wars in afghanistan and iraq dod fielded uavs such as predator and global hawk before their development programs were complete thus the uav accident rate might be lower if these systems had been allowed to mature under the fu ll development program implementation schedule currently the regular use of uavs in us airspace appears to be slated for the year 2008 in pa rt due to the faa concerns outlined above19 however other countries such as japan nd south korea have for many years used uavs in variety of civil roles20 italy could fly civil uavs by the end of 200221 possible issue for congress could involve wh ether us aviation authorities should pursue more aggressive implementa tion plan for the use of uavs possible alternatives possible issue for congress could include whether there are potential alternatives to using uavs to surv eil the border tethered aerostat systems tars heliumfilled blimps tethered to th ground with cable that provides power may offer one alternative ta rs are unmanned and can loiter for much longer periods of time than uavs if uavs are deemed attrac tive because of low cost elevated sensor capabilities and long loiter times tars may be studied as platform that might offer advantages in all three of these areas however tars do not have capability to move and thus could not be used for pursuit purposes
