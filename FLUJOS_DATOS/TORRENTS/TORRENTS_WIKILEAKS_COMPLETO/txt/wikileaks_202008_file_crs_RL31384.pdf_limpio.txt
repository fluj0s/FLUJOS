provide them an unprecedented capability to quickly and decisively project power from well over the horizon the air forces cv22 version will be used for special operations army officials have testified that the service has requirement for the v22 but the navy has expressed interest in purchasing mv22s for variety of missions the v22 program has been under development for over 25 years safety and maintenance concerns have arisen during this period due in large part to three fatal accidents the commander of the v22 maintenance squadron admitted to falsifying maintenance records to make the aircraft appear more maintainable than it was and three marines were found guilty of misconduct the program has maintained support from many in congress despite these deficiencies the program has undergone restructuring to accommodate congressional direction budget constraints and recommendations from outside experts and dod managers after 17month hiatus the osprey embarked on its second set of flight tests in may of 2002 tests were completed in june 2005 to the satisfaction of navy testers who believed that the v22 program had resolved all technical and engineering problems identified in internal and external reviews on september 28 2005 the v22 program passed major milestone when the defense acquisition board approved it for military use and full rate production supporters tout the v22s potential operational capabilities relative to the helicopters it will replace it will fly faster farther and with more payload than the ch46 sea knight the marine corps currently operates they argue that this co mbination of attributes coupled with the ability to take off and land vertically will provide the marine corps with new and potentially transformational capabilities detractors tend to emphasize the v22s long development schedule its three fatal accidents and its high cost relative to the helicopters it will replace v22 opponents argue that modern helicopters also offer capabilities superior to the ch46s and more cost effectively than the osprey through fy2008 more than 27 billion had been provided for the v22 program the defense departments

the marine corps top aviation priority1 marine corps leaders believe that the osprey will provide them an unprecedented capability to quickly and decisively project power from well over the horizon in the words of one former leader its combination of increased payload with vastly improved speed and range make the osprey the aircraft that defines the commanders area of influence as it relates to placing marines on the ground2 the aircrafts promise however has been dimmed by series of challenges to its affordability safety and program management the v22 tiltrotor design combines the helicopters operational flexibility of vertical take off and landing with the greater speed range and fuel efficiency of turboprop aircraft the v22 osprey takes off and lands vertically like helicopter but flies like fixedwing aircraft by tilting its wingmounted rotors 90 degrees forward to function as propellers the v22 is intended to perform variety of marine corps and air force missions including troop and equipment transport amphibious assault search and rescue and special operations the marines mv22 version is to transport 24 fullyequipped troops some 200 nautical miles nm at speed of 250 knots 288 mph exceeding the pe rformance of the ch46 mediumlift assault helicopters the mv22 will replace the air forces cv22 version with range of 500 nm will be used for special operations army officials have testified that the service has requirement for the v22 the navy has expressed interest in purchasing mv22s for variety of missions eg personnel recovery fleet logistic support aerial refueling special warfare but has funds budgeted in the current future years defense plan fydp developed and produced by bell helicopter textron of fort worth tx and boeing helicopters of philadelphia pa the aircraft is powered by two t406 turboshaft engines produced by allison engine company of indianapolis in subsid iary of rollsroyce north america fuselage assembly will be performed in philadelphia pa drive system rotors and composite assembly will be completed in fort worth tx and final assembly and delivery will be completed in amarillo tx through fy2008 more than 27 billion had been appropriated for the v22 program the defense departments selected acquisition report of december 31 2007 estimated the total acquisition of 458aircraft program would be 542 billion which translates into program acquisition unit cost pauc of 1184 million per osprey the pauc includes funding for both development and production of the aircraft and related activities the average procurement unit cost apuc which for the osprey is estimated at 966 million does not include these sunk costs the v22 is in fullrate production 3 1 office of budget department of the navy highlights

vertic or short take off and landing with forward flight like conventional fixedwing aircraft about 65 of the airframe is made of graphite epoxy composite materials the marine corpss mv22 version will have the following characteristics propulsion 2 t40 6 t urbos haft ngines crew 3 passengers 24 com bat troops max vertical take off weight 475 00 lb max short tak off weight 550 00 lb speed at max weight 250 knotsho ur combat radius 200 n m the airframes of the marine corps mv22 and the air force cv22 variant for special operations command will have some 90 commonality the primary differences being in avionics the cv22 is to carry 18 troops with auxiliary fuel tanks increasing combat radius to about 500 miles this variant may carry 50cal gau19 nosegun for self defense instead of the mv22s 30cal rampmounted gun dod plans to field v22s in four blocks blocks b and c for the marine corps and blocks 10 and 20 for the air force block b aircraft were produced first in fy2004 and are the aircraft with which the marine corps achieved initial operational capability ioc block b aircraft will improve upon those used in emd testing block aircraft with upgrades to avionics communications navigation it will also feature retractable fuel probe ramp gun for self defense joist and an improved position for the fastrope method for personnel to quickly exit the aircraft while in hover the air force will achieve ioc with the block 10 variant which will be based on the block b but feature advanced avionics such as terrainfollowing radar and directed infrared countermeasures that will allo w special operations forces to penetrate hostile areas in all weather and terrain the marine corps and air force plan to begin producing the most capable v22 variantsthe block c nd block 20

defense began the v22 program in 1981 first under army leadership but with the navymarine corps later taking the lead in developing what was then known as the jvx jointservice vertical takeofflanding experimental aircraft fullscale development of the v22 tiltrotor aircraft began in 1986 like some other tactical aviation programs suc h as the fa18ef supe r hornet fa22 raptor and joint strike fighter the total number of v22 aircraft planned for procurement has decreased over time in 1989 the defense department projec ted 663aircraft program with six prototypes and 657 production aircraft 552 mv22s 55 cv22s and 50 hv22s as projected in 1994 however the program comprised 523 production aircraft 425 mv22s 50 cv22s and 48 hv22s procurement of these 523 aircraft was to continue into the 2020s since the defense acquisition board limited annual expenditures for marine mv22s to 1 billion fy1994 dollars when it approved entry into engineering and manufacturing development emd in

marines 50 air force cv22s and 48 navy hv22s such 458aircraft program is now projected on march 19 1989 the first of six mv22 prototypes was flown in the helicopter mode and on september 14 1989 as fixedwing plane two of these aircraft were destroyed in crashes prototype aircraft numbers three and four successfully completed the ospreys first sea trials on the uss wasp lhd1 in december 1990 the fifth prototype crashed on its first flight june 11 1991 because of incorrect wiring in flightcontrol system the fourth prototype crashed on july 20 1992 while landing at quantico marine corps air station va killing seven people and destroying the aircraft this accident was caused by fire resulting from hydraulic component failures and design problems in the engine nacelles 4 flight tests were resumed in august 1993 after changes were incorporated in the prototypes flight testing of four fullscale development v22s began in early 1997 when the first pre production v22 was delivered to the naval air warfare test center in patuxent river md the first emd flight took place on february 5 1997 the first of four lowrate initial production aircraft ordered on april 28 1997 was delivered on may 27 1999 osprey number 10 completed the programs second sea trials this time from the uss saipan lha2 in january 1999 operational evaluation opev testing of the mv22 began in october 1999 and concluded in august 2000 on october 13 2000 the department of the navy announced that the mv22 had been judged operationally effective and suitable for landbased operations on november 15 2000 the marine corps announced that the osprey had successfully completed sea trials and had been deemed operationally effective and suitable for both land and seabased operations successfully completing opev should have cleared the way for full rate production this decision was to have been made in december 2000 but was postponed indefinitely because of mixed report from dods director of operational test and evaluation and two fatal accidents g3g140g140g146g141g142g151g157g156g561g138g151g141g561g8g138g157g138g149g146g157g146g142g156g561g25g152g155g156g142g151g561 on april 8 2000 another osprey crashed near tucson arizona during an exercise simulating noncombatant evacuation operation all four crew members and 15 passengers died in the crash an investigation of the accident found that the pilot was descending in excess of the recommended flight envelope which may have caused the aircraft to experience an environmental condition known as power settling or vortex ri ng state according to lt gen fred mccorkle the pilot was descending more than thousand feet per minute the recommended descent rate is 800 feet per minute following twomonth suspension of flight testing the osprey recommenced opev in june 2000 with pilots flying slightly tighter flight envelope july 27 2000 report by the marine corps judge advocate general jag which had access to all nonprivileged information from the safety investigation confirmed that combination of human factors caused the crash 4 former secretary of defense cheney tried to terminate the program in 198992 but congress continued to provide funds for development of the v22 the george h bush administrations fy1990 budget requested funds for the program in submitting that budget to congress on april 25 1989 defense secretary cheney told the house armed services committee that he could not justify spending the amount of money proposed when we were just getting ready to move into procurement on the v22 to perform very narrow mission that i think can be performed by using helicopters instead of the v22

maintenance factor specific to tilt rotors its primary cause that of an mv22 entering vortex ring state power settling andor blade stall condition is not peculiar to tilt rotors the contributing factors to the mishap steep approach with high rate of descent and slow airspeed poor aircrew coordination and diminished situational awareness are also not particular to tilt rotors 5 dod inspector general study concluded that the v22 would not successfully demonstrate 23 major operational effectiveness and suitability requirements prior to the december 2000 opev milestone iii decision to enter full rate production in june 20016 the marine corps agreed with dods assessment of the deficiencies but said that they had been aware of these deficiencies before the beginning of opev furthermore the marine corps said that they had an approved plan designed to resolve the deficiencies prior to the milestone iii decision on november 17 2000 dods director of operat ional test and evaluation issued mixed report on the osprey saying although operationally effective the v22 was not operationally suitable primarily because of reliability maintainability availability human factors and interoperability issues the report recommended that more research should be conducted into the v22s susceptibility to the vortex ring state blamed for the april 8 2000 crash on december 11 2000 an mv22 osprey crashed near jacksonville nc killing all four marines on board this was the fourth osprey crash since 1991 and the third lethal accident the aircrafts pilot lt col keith m sweeney was the programs most experienced pilot and was in line to command the first squadron of ospreys the aircrafts copilot maj michael murphy was second only to sweeney in flying time on the osprey7 the marine corps grounded the osprey fleet pending mishap board investigation on april 5 2001 the marine corps reported that the crash was caused by burst hydraulic line in one of the ospreys two engine casings and software malfunction that caused the aircraft to accelerate and decelerate unpredictably and violently when the pilots tried to compensate for the hydraulic failure8 the marine corps report called for redesign of both the hydraulics and software systems involved9

media by someone claiming to be mechanic in the osprey program the letter claimed that v22 maintenance records had been falsified for two years at the explicit direction of the squadron commander enclosed in the letter was an audio tape that the letters author claimed was surreptitious recording of the squadron commander directing maintenance personnel to lie about the aircraft until the v22

him of command and reassigned him to different position at may 1 2001 hearing members of the senate armed services committee expressed their concern that false data might impede dods ability to accurately evaluate the v22 program and identify problem areas and potential improvements the department of defenses inspector general ig conducted an investigation on september 15 2001 it was reported that three marines were found guilty of misconduct and two were reprimanded for their actions in june 2005 us grand jury indicted company that had supplied titanium tubing for the v22 program the indictment charged the company with falsely certifying the quality of the tubes the v22 test program was halted for 11 days in 2003 because of faulty tubes replacing deficient tubes cost the v22 program 4 million navy officials do not believe that these deficient tubes caused fatal mishaps 10

aspects of the v22 program reported its findings and recommendations11 these findings and recommendations were also discussed during congressional testimony on may 1 2001 the panel recommended that the program continue albeit in restructured format the panel concluded that there were numerous problems with the v22 programincluding safety training and reliability problemsbut nothing inhe rently flawed in basi c tiltrotor technology because of numerous safety training and reliability problems the v22 was not maintainable or ready for operational use the panel recommended cutting production to the bare minimum while an array of tests were carried out to fix long list of problems they identified with hardware software and performance cutting nearterm production was hoped to free up funds to

there were known aeromechanical phenomena that would stop the tiltrotor aircrafts development and deployment the study focused on several aeromechanics issues including v ortex ring state power problems autorotation and hover performance15 in december 21 2001 memo to the secretaries of the air force and the navy and the commander special operations command undersecretary of defense aldridge gave his authorization for the v22 to resume flight testing in the april 2002 time frame secretary aldridge expressed support for range speed and survivability goals of the v22 he noted however that the program still had numerous technical challenges to overcome and emphasized that the v22 must demonstrate that 1 it can meet the needs of the warfighter better than any other alternative 2 it can be made to be reliable safe and operationally suitable and 3 it is worth its costs in contributing to the combat capability of us forces secretary aldridge approved the flight test program under the condition that the production rate be slowed to the minimum sustaining level that it be comprehensive and rigorous and that the restructured program is fully funded in accordance with current estimates 16 undersecretary aldridge estimated that the v22 would require at least two years of flight testing before dod could conclude that the aircraft is safe effective and worth the cost17

operational concerns explored included whether the osprey is too prone to v ortex ring state to make it safe or effective aircraft whether this potential problem is further exacerbated by multiple ospreys flying in formation and how well the v22 handles at sea18 the principal differences between the aircraft that were grounded in 2000 and the aircraft that began testing 17 months later called block aircraft are rerouted hydraulic lines and an improved caution and warning system 19 technical glitches were experienced during tests hydraulic failures for example continued during the reinstated flight test program once on august 4 2003 due to misinstalled clamp and again on september 5 2003 in june 2004 v 22 was forced twice to make an emergency landing during one landing the aircraft suffered class b mishap one causing between 200000 and 1 million in damage20 an investigation revealed that the v22 suffered from widespread problems with an engine component that required replacement every 100 flight hours21 in conjunction with resuming flight testin g the navy department modified certain v22 requirements for instance the v22 is longer required to land in helicopter mode without power also known as autorotation protecti on from nuclear chemical and biological weapons has been eliminated the v22 is longer required to have an air combat maneuvering capability instead it must demonstrate defensive maneuvering also the requirement that troops be able to use rope or rope ladder to exit the cabin at low altitudes has been eliminated 22 also concurrent with the resumption of v22 flight testing dod began an indepth study of alternatives to pursue in case the aircraft does not pass muster options reportedly include purchasing the s92 or upgrading ch53 or eh101 helicopters23 after one calendar year and 466 hours of flight testing dod reviewed the ospreys progress on may 15 2003 thomas christie dods director of operational test and evaluation dote graded bellboeings improvements to the ospreys hydraulics as reasonable and appropriate and effective24 christie also at that time approved of the testing that had been completed and was satisfied with what had been learned about the v22s susceptibility to v ortex ring state on may 20 2003 the defense acquisition board also reviewed the program and approved of the flight test programs progress marine corps officials recommended increasing the production rate in fy2006 from the minimum sustainable rate of 11 to 20 aircraft however in an august 8 2003 memorandum undersecretary of defense for

based in part on observations that the mv22 had complied with the objectives of pl 107107 sec123 hydraulic components and flight control software performed satisfactorily the aircraft was reliable and maintainable the mv22 operated effectively when employed with other aircraft and the aircrafts downwash did not inhibit ground operations 25 on september 28 2005 the v22 program passed major milestone when the defense acquisition board approved it for military use and full rate production26 the mv22 continues testing to assess survivability and to develop tactics the cv22 is in developmental test and evaluation the program continues to experience technical and operational challenges and mishaps for example an inadvertent takeoff in march 2006 caused wing and engine damage in excess of 1 million an engine component has been replaced because its failure in flight has caused seven unexpected flight terminations in october 2005 v22 experienced engine damage during flight due to icing an engine compressor failure during the v22s first overseas deployment july 2006 forced the aircraft to make precautionary landing before reaching its destination an engine fire on december 7 2006 caused more than 1 million to repair and the marine corps grounded all of its v22s in february 2007 after it was found that faulty computer chip could cause the aircraft to lose control during flight

flight hours and maintaining an average missioncapable rate27 of 6828 reportedly the marine corps has lauded the extended range speed and payload that the osprey possesses in comparison to helicopters

first the marine corps is concerned that v22 engines manufactured by rollsroyce are not lasting as long as expected for example when the marine corps began to purchase the v22 it was anticipated that each engine would last approximately 600 flight hours however fleetwide engines are lasting about 420 flight hours while aircraft deployed to iraq are requiring engine change outs about every 380 flight hours31 while this problem does not detract from the aircrafts inflight performance it does call into question the longterm viability of the enginesustainment deal that dod currently has with rollsroyce which was based on business case model where the engines were expected to last so many thousand hours32 in addition to the engine not lasting as long as expected some have also questioned whether the existing engine is powerful enough to support aircraft modifications expected to increase the ospreys weight for example the marine corps expects to add defensive systems designed to defeat shoulderlaunched surfacetoairmissiles and guns to the osprey but wants to maintain capability to carry 24 marines how dod plans to deal with these two problems is unclear options being considered include renegotiating longterm sustainment contract with an industry partner transitioning to an organic model where the ospreys engines would be sustained by dod personnel or selecting an entirely new engine for the v22 33 27 an aircrafts mission capable rate is the percentage of time an aircraft is available for to fly scheduled sorties 28 gareth jennings usmc details osprey

cabin may not be large enough to carry 24 combatequipped marines and that the severe rotor down wash might impede the ability of troops to exit the aircraft and move into combat positions also to avoid entering v ortex ring state ospreys will have to descend slowly which will make them vulnerable to ground fire in combat situations critics also challenge comparisons that are made between the

that tiltrotor aircraft are more susceptible to airflow instabilities that can cause v ortex ring state than are traditional helicopters 39 and our understanding of the kinds of airflow anomalies that have caused numerous deaths in v22 flight testing are still very immature whatever commercial value tiltrotor aircraft might some day have for civil aviation the v22s value as military system is
