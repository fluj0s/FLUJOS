determination of ayp for the 2005 2006 school year only displaced student subgr oup may be established for ayp purposes and students counted in that subgr oup need not be counted in any other subgroups into which they might otherwise qualify including the all students group8 in april and may of 2006 the secretary approved requests for flexibility agreements under the second option for five statesalabama arkansas georgia tennessee and texas9 the secretary conditioned approval of the flexibility agreements on the following requirements states must include the displaced students subgroup in the 20052006 ayp calculations for participation at the school lea and state levels states must report achievement information for the displaced student subgroup at the lea and state levels the same as for other subgroups on lea and state report cards and states must provide remedial education assistance for displaced students who score below the proficient level on 20052006 assessments 10 as part of the flexibility agreement with texas the secretary also agreed to allow it to waive ayp determinations for schools or leas that were closed for more than seven days as result of hurricanes katrina or rita and that are located in county designated by fema as disaster area as condition for this flexibility texas is required to provide ed the opportunity to review ayp data for displaced students from schools and leas that fail to make ayp solely due to the displaced student group prior to the public release of these data two significant effects appear possible as result of allowing states to create separate subgroup for displaced students and to exclude displaced students from all other subgroups including the all students subgroup first given the minimum group size n for the reporting of academic achievement data as shown in table 1 it appears that information on the academic achievement of displaced students will be made available at the school and lea levels in areas that experienced even modest influx of displaced students if separate subgroup were not created for displaced students it could be very difficult to determine if their level of academic performance was any different than that of the subgroups with which they share membership by excluding displaced students from the all students subgroup one also may be able to make inferences of relative performance by comparing the achievement levels of displaced students with the all students subgroup which would represent only nondisplaced students t able 1 minimum gr oup siz f or repor ting and f

under the ap proved state accounta bility plans of these stat student is sidered to be enrolled for full academic year and th us cou nted for accounta bility pur poses if he or she is contin uously rolled from october varying dates throug h t he day of testing second it appears that the academic achievement of displaced students will only have any impact on the ayp determinations of schools or leas if there are sufficient numbers of displaced students to qualify the displaced student subgroup as counted categorygenerally 40 or more displaced students in school or lea as shown in table 1 by excluding displaced students from all other categories including the all students category the enrollment of displaced students in school or lea would not push any subgroup above the minimum group size threshold for being counted nor would it have any effect in raising or lowering the ayp level for any single group other than the new displaced student subgroup thus it appears that under these state flexibility agreements the performance of displaced students will be reported in most cases but their performance will have an impact on ayp determinations only in schools and leas that have

the senate bill would have required charter schools as defined in esea 5210 to be eligible for reimbursement under the stafford act for damages incurred to public schools as result of hurricane katrina or hurricane rita the bill specifies that reimbursement shall be accorded to charter schools regardless of whether the facility in which they are housed is privately or publicly owned 50 under the stafford act reimbursement for damages to facilities resulting from the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes is available to public facilities until recently this included regular public schools as they were housed in public facilities but not necessarily charter schools located in facilities privately owned charter schools that were located in privately owned facilities were required to apply to the small business admini stration sba for loan to support renovation and reconstruction efforts if the school was denied assistance through the sba they might then be eligible for assistance under the stafford act as of may 11 2006 fema issued new recovery policy with respect to charter schools that are located in privately owned facilities 51 such schools as defined in esea 5210 were recognized as local government applicants for purposes of applying for public assistance under the stafford act thereby eliminating the need for them to firs t apply to the sba for assistance in letter to senator vitter dated may 12 2006 the department of homeland security described the new continued and other international activities additional hurricane katrina relief by paul m irwin et 49 by authorizing the

of public facilities public agency must administer all program funds and retain ownership of any materials equipment or property repaired 50 if the charter school v acates the facility and is not

limited if third party such as an insurance agency or building landlord other than local government unit including charter school is responsible for funding repairs to the faci lity it stated that existing statutory authority granted by the stafford act was sufficient to address the recovery efforts of charter schools and that based on consultations with ed the administ ration had determined that the aforementioned language included in hr 4939 was not necessary to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of charter schools damaged by hurricanes katrina and rita 53

have provided 200 million to create new education relief loan program that would provide longterm lowinterest direct loans to postsecondary institutions for direct or indirect loses suffered as result of having to suspend their operations and being unable to reopen in existing facilities due to the effects of hurricanes katrina or rita 54 the senate bill would also have modified provisions of the historically black college and university capital financing program for historically black colleges and universities hbcus55 located in an area affected by gulf coast hurricane disaster while the proposed statutory language did not specify appropriations to support these modifications table in the senate report srept 109230 p 139 indicates that 15 million would have been provided for this purpose the bill would also have provided an additional 30 million under fipse specifically to provide grants to ihes adversely affected by the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes finally the bill would have allowed funds provided to the mississippi institutes of higher learning under the fy2006 defense appropriations to be used for activities authorized by fipse this would have provided additional flexibility in the use of funds and provided the mississippi institutes of higher learning with the same flexibility accorded to louisiana in the fy2006 defense appropriations the conference agreement provided 50 million under fipse to assist ihes adversely affected by the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes it did not however include funding to create new loan program for ihes the conference agreement modified provisions of the hbcus capital financing program as proposed by the senate 56 the statutory language authorizing these modifications does not specify level of appropriations to support the modifications the conference agreement however scored this provision at 15 million the same as the senate bill finally the conference agreement provided the mississippi institutes of higher learning with the additional flexibility proposed in the senate bill 52 letter to senator vitter obtained directly from fema available from report author rebecca r skinner upon request 53 the letter asserts that the language included in hr 4939 may establish an unfortunate precedent and may unintentionally cause significant implementation issues 54 the bill also would have provided 300 million for the principal amount of the direct loans 55 eligible institutions must meet the definition of part b institution included in hea title iii 322 56 for example pl 109234 provided the secretary the authority to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provisions to ensure that the calculation of financing for an hbcu reflects changes in the financial condition of the institution as result of the 2005
