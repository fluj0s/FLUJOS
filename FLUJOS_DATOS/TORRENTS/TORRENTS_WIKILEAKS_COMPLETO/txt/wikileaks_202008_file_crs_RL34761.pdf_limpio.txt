usvietnam relations summary since the end of the vietnam war in 1975 there has been gradual warming of bilateral relations between the united states and vietnam culminating in the appointment of the first us ambassador to vietnam in 1996 and granting vietnam permanent normal trade relations pntr in 2007 over the last three decades many but not all of the major issues causi ng tension between the two nations have been resolved one major legacy of the vietnam war that remains unresolved is the damage that agent orange and its accompanying dioxin have done to the people and the environment of vietnam for the last 30 ears this issue has generally been pushed to the background of bilateral discussions by other issues considered more important by the united states andor vietnam with most of those issues presently resolved the issue of agent orangedioxin has emerged as regular topic in bilateral discussions according to various estimates the us military sprayed approximately 1112 million gallons of agent orange over nearly 10 of vietnamese territory between 1961 and 1971 one scientific study timated that between 21 million and 48 million vietnamese were dir ectly exposed to agent orange vietnamese advocacy groups claims that there are over one million vietnamese suffering from serious health problems caused by exposure to the dioxin in agent orange in the last few years the people of vietnam have become increasingly concerned about the issue of agent orange this is placing more pressure on the vietnamese government to remove the dioxin from the environment and provide better care to the people exposed to agent orange the vietnamese government has long sought us assistance although th united states has pr ovided scientific and technical support it has repeatedly denied any legal liability to provide assistance and has questioned vietnam s assertions about the extent of the environmental and health problems attributed to agent orange and dioxin as result there is growing possibility of friction between the two governments over the issue of agent orange recently the united states has shown greater willingness to cooperate on some aspects of the issue including the appropriation of 3 million for dioxin removal and health care facilities in da nang however there is sense that the vietnamese government and people would like to see the united states do more to remove dioxin from their country and provi help for victims of agent orange this report examines various estimates of the effects of agent orange on vietnams people and environment the hi story of us policy on the issue the current clean up efforts in vietnam the va rious forms of assistance including us assistance provided to people with medi cal conditions associated with dioxin exposure and the implications for bilateral relations it concludes with brief discussion of possible congre ssional responses to the issue this report will be updated as conditions

significant changes in its trade policies and has increased its efforts to help assist the united states recover the remains of us soldiers and civilians who died during the vietnam war the two nations also ve expanded their na scent cooperation on strategic and military issues although the united states remains cerned about human rights in vietnam tensions between the two nations are comparatively low however inside vietnam there is longstanding issue that could cause friction in the future the condition of vietnamese people affected by agent orange and its unintended byproduct the dioxin 2378tetrachlorodibe nzopdioxin or tcdd1 agent orange was one of several herbicides that the us miliary used widely in southern vietnam during the vietnam war over the last decade th ere has been groundswell of concern among the vietnamese people about the continuing problems of envir onmental damage and illnesses associated with agent orange some nongovernme ntal organizations ngos in vietnam are seeking comp ensation or assistance from the us government and the manufacturers of agent orange partially in response to this rising tide of popular concern the vietname government has ra ised the profile of this issue in various bilateral fora with the us officials including the june 2008 summit between president bush and prime minister nguyen tan dung according to one estimate there are up to five million vietnamese spanning three generations who have medical conditions that are purported to be related to exposure to the agent orange and its accompanying dioxin that the us military sprayed across much of south vietna m as part of operation ranch hand2 the vietnamese government and various vietnamese interest groups have long sought us assistance with the clean up of the residual dioxin in vietnam as well as financial support to pr ovide medical treatment to pe ople exposed to agent orangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34761crs2 3 observation based on various interviews conduc ted by author with vietnamese officials and citizens 4 joint statement between the socialist re public of vietnam and the united states of america office of the press secret ary the white house november 17 2006the official us response to date has been to deny any legal liability and to contest that the medical conditions are related to exposure to agent orange and dioxin the vietnamese government and people have objected to thes denials given the level of support provided to us ve terans who were presumably exposed to agent orange and the extensive clean up efforts made at love canal times beach and other us locations found to have elevated levels of dioxin in the soil3 in the waning months of the george w bush administration there were some indications that the united states was becoming more flexible on this issue in the future just as the issue has risen in importance in vietnam the bush administration showed some willingness to provide greater support in cleaning up the dioxin in vietnam for example following president bushs november 2006 meeting with then prime minister phan van khai the two governments issued joint statement that included the sentence the united states and vietnam also agreed that further joint efforts to address the environmental contamination near former dioxin storage facilities would make valuable contribution to the continued development of their bilateral relations4 in addition the 110th congress demonstrated willingness to provide assistance for both the dioxin cleanup and humanitari an support for vietna mese believed to be affected by exposure to dioxin in ma 2007 congress appropria ted 3 million to the state department for the clean up of diox in in and around an exmilitary base in da nang used as distribution center for agent orange during the vietnam war some of the funds were to be used to provide medical care for reside nts near the exmilitary base according to state department the specific plans for using the 3 million are still being developed newly established us agency for international development usaid mission in vietnam is to coordinate nd implement the use of the funds it is not clear when the usaid expects to expend the 3 million or if additional us support for agent oranged ioxin remediation and medical care will be provided in the future as discussed below some members of congress have also stated that the united states has moral obligation to the people of vietnam many of whom were either llies at th time or were i nnocent civilians to help address the perceived environmental and health problems created by the use of agent orange during the vietnam war although both sides appear to be willing to discuss the issue the legacy of agent orange has the potential to adversely affect usvietnamese relations in the future with other key issues apparently resolved agent orange has emerged as one of vietnams top concerns however viet nams interest in forming closer

president ford extended the embargo to all of vietnam on april 30 1975 generalized system of preferences gsp program5 and the possible negotiation of bilateral investment treaty bit may counteract vietnams interest in us assistance with the legacy of agent orange into the background for the united states the recent growth in bilateral trade and us investment in vietnam is providing strong incentive to improve relations with its exenemy according to many us manufacturers vietnam is one of the more attractive alternative sources to china for variet of imported products also some analysts think that friendly relations with vietna m offer strategic counterbalance to the growth of chinese influence in asia in addition greater assist ance with the cleanup of dioxin in vietnam andor aid in providing medical care for dioxin victims may enhance the image of the united states in southeast asia if the united states continues to deny the legitimacy of vietnams environmental and health claims and the responsibility to help ameliorate the damage caused by agent orangedioxin it risks causing harm to its relations with vietnam and possibly weakening us soft power in asia6 brief history of postwar usvietnam relations and the agent orange issue from 1975 to about 2000 although the agent orange issue was on vietnams agenda it was generally pushed into the background7 there are many reasons for this including vietnams desire for gr eater trade opportunities with the united states the us desire for more complete accounting for us soldiers still listed as missing in action mia in vietnam vietnams invasion of cambodia in 1978 and the rising tide of viet namese boat people in 1975 following north vietnams victory over south vietnam president ford severed diplomatic relations and imposed trade embargo on vietnam8 although vietnam sought to normalize relations it was predicated on the united states honoring president nixons secret pro mise of 325 billion in reconstructionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34761crs4 9 during the peace negotiations for the viet nam war then president nixon wrote secret letter on february 1 1973 to then prime mini ster pham van dong promising the united states would contribute in th range of 325 billion in postwar reconstruction assistance over fiveyear period 10 in 1976 congress passed legislation the in ternational security assistance and arms export control act s 2662 that would have partially ended the embargo on trade with vietnam but president ford vetoed the bill 11 following vietnams invasion of cam bodia chinese troops entered vietnam precipitating border conflict given the cold war politics of the time the united states was more concerned about maintaining its deve loping relations with china than fostering relations with vietnam 12 the vietnameseussr mutual defense treaty was primarily targeted at the peoples republic of china china not the united stat both vietnamese and ussr relations with the china had soured during the 1970s and both nations perceived military threat from neighboring china for vietnam the threat wa s quite real as china attacked vietnam in 1979 in part in response to vietnams invasion of cambodia 13 for more information on the powmia issue see crs report rl33452 pows and mias status and accounting issues by charles henningassistance9 which the united states was unwilling

politically impossible usvietnamese relations became even more frosty following the signing of mutual defense treaty between vietnam and the union of soviet socialist republics ussr on november 3 197812 these circumstances pushed the issue of agent orange effectively off the bilateral agenda despite vietnamese efforts to raise the subject president reagan was generally opposed to any move towards normalizing relations with vietnam so long as vietna mese forces remained in cambodia and the vietnamese government d not provided full accounting of us powmias13 in addition the reagan administration wh ich repeatedly expressed skepticism about us veterans claimin g medical problems related to agent orange exposure was generally unwilling to discuss the issue of vietnamese nationals with similar medical conditions supposedly caused by agent orange exposure following vietnams withdrawal from cambodia in 1989 president bush reopened communication with vietnam in april 1991 president bush announced us roadmap for normalization of rela tions that included greater cooperation in locating and returning the re mains of approxima tely 2200 us soldiers and civilians who were

the current assistance programs for vietnamese nationals exposed to agent orange to determine the preferre d allocation of the 3 million appropriation the effects of agent orange on vietnam virtually every aspect of the effects of agent orange on vietnam is infused with uncertainty andor controversy there is some question about the amount of agent orange and other herbicides sprayed in vietnam as well as the amount of dioxin contained in the agent orange used it is also unclear exactly where the herbicides were sprayed and the amount sprayed at each location nor is it known who was exposed to agent orange and its dioxin and for what duration they were exposed finally there is limited information about th longterm effects of agent orange on the environment and people of vietnam the uncertainty and controversies are in part attributable to the general fog of war at the time the herbicides were used there was little consideration within the us military about potential longterm nvironmental and hea lth effects of the widespread use of agent orange in vietnam similarly both the south vietnamese and north vietnamese governments were not keeping deta iled troop deployment information in anticipation of future claims of health problems associated with exposure to agent orange and dioxin in addition after the war ended many vietnamese combatants returned to their home towns far away from the jungles where they once were sprayed with herbicides from us military aircraft given that direct informa tion about agent orange exposure is not available the alternative generally used has been to seek indirect evidence of dioxin exposure soil samples taken from supposedly sprayed and unsprayed locations can be analyzed to determine the amount and extent to whic h vietnam has been contaminated with dioxin due to operation ranch hand at the same time blood and tissue samples can be taken from vietnamese nationals across the count ry to determine how much dioxin is present in their systems to da relatively few of these studies have been done in part because of the cost associated with the research and in part because of the political implications of the findings of such studies although the research on the use of agent orange and other herbicides in vietnam and the resulting exposure of the people of vietnam to dioxin is limited in scale it is possible to draw few tentative conclusions from existinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34761crs11 30 dioxin is not water soluble but an unknown amount of dioxin has washed into the rivers streams and coastal waters of vietnam and presumably settled into its river and ocean beds 31 the us military also sprayed herbicides in cambodia and laos but information on those programs is not included in this

levels of dioxin in the systems of people presumed to be have been exposed to agent orange but met hodological problems ma ke interpretation of the data difficult and open to debate fourth research in

vietnamese exposure to agent orange and dioxin has followed two different appr oaches one approach has attempted to determine how much agent orange was sprayed in vietnam where and when it was sprayed and who was in the area when the herbicide was sprayed from this data researchers can then determine the level of exposure to agent orange and dioxin the second approach examines the amount of dioxin in blood and tissue samples taken from people in vietnam and then infers each persons level of exposure because of data and other methodological problems neith er approach has been able to provide conclusive information on the general pattern of agent orange and tcdd exposure in vietnam amount used precise information on how much agent orange was sprayed in vietnam during the war is difficult to find though several studies estimate the amount in the range of 1112 million ga llons 1978 gao report states that 1885 million gallons of herbicide were applied during the vi etnam war of which 1122 million gallons were agent orange35 according to william buckinghams calculations operation ranc h hand sprayed about 19 milli on gallons of herbicide of which 11 million gallons were agent

on exposure to agent oran ge for vietnamese nationals is even more difficult to determine for several reasons first while official records for operation ranch hand are ava ilable it is difficult to be certain about how much herbicide was sprayed on what locations due to mitigating combat conditions40 second in addition to the areas intentionally exposed to agent orange an unknown amount of herbicide was leak ed or spilled on military bases41 third it is difficult to correlate the presence of vietnamese nationals in exposed areas during or soon after the distribution of agent orange in location fourth the sc ientific tests on soil and tissue samples are expensive the typical cost of determining the dioxin level in one person is 1000 the vietnamese govern ment states it lacks the financial resources to conduct comprehensive exposure studies exposure studies generally fall into two types 1 estimates of the concentration of agent orange applied or found at studied locations and 2 sts to determine the concentration of dioxin in the tissue samp of persons who may have been exposed to agent orange during the vietnam wa r in part because of difficulties in determining where when and how much ag ent orange was distributed in different locations in vietnam there are also varying estimates on the number of vietnamese nationals who were exposed concentrations 2005 study of the concentration of agent orange distribution in vietnam determined that an estimated 17 million hectares 42 million acres were sprayed with herbicides cont aining 245t and by extension containing tcdd42

some scientists maintain that the apparent contradictions in the study results may reflect differences in the circumstances surrounding vietnam veterans exposure to agent orange there seems to be gene

elevated tcdd levels others do not so scientists speculate that studies comparing vietnam veterans to other cont rol groups fail to find differences in the tcdd levels because the vietnam veterans

in vietnamese immig rants from nonsprayed areas children born after the war as well as elevated tcdd levels in food and soil samples from the study area60 number of vietnamese exposed determining how many vietnamese nationals were exposed to agent orange during and after the vietnam war is both complicated and controversial one study estimated the number of vietnamese nationals exposed to agent orange ndor dioxin ranged from 21 to 48 million61 vietnam victims of agent orange asso ciation vava estimates that three million vietnamese were exposed to agent orange during the war and at least one million suffer serious health problems due to that exposure62 vietnams health claims the vietnamese government maintains that tcdd is harming the health of its people in several ways first vietnamese civilians and soldiers who were directly exposed to agent orange during the war are experiencing certain diseases and health problems at rate higher than the nations unexposed population second people living in areas with residual tcdd in the soil and water are also suffering from health complications related to the afte reffects of operation ranch hand third the children of people exposed to

prosta cancer and type 2 diabetes otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34761crs18 diseases on the vrcs list are not recognized by the us government as being related to dioxin exposure the ministry of health also considers congenital deformities and mental disorders in the children of those exposed to tcdd as being dioxin related the us government only considers spinal bifida as being potentially caused by agent orange exposure by parent in the last few years much of the vietnamese governments concern about the effects of agent orange has focused on the affected children and their families because the deformities and disorders are frequently quite severe the children often require continual care given the current status of vietnams health care system it is not possible to place many of the children in managedcare facilities as result most of the children are tended by their families this not only creates financial burden for the fa milies it typically means significant loss of household income as at least one person must remain at home with the affected child or children cleanup efforts the prospects for cleaning up the dioxin in vietnam distributed by the spraying of agent orange and other herbicides are complicated by the area sprayed the passage of time and general lack of resources there is supposition that vietnams episodic heavy rains and the passage of time have probably removed most of the dioxin from sprayed areas but ther are definitive studies to verify this notion in addition political and other considera tions have tended to shift the focus on agent orange cleanup efforts towards the confinement and cleanup of dioxin from the identified hot spots with elevated levels of dioxin in the soil such as the airbases used by operation ranch hand bo th the

or so economic and security trade issues have gained priority over war legacy issues in usv ietnam relations although war legacy issues in the united states complicated and held up efforts to normalize relations between the two countries the perceived mutual benefits of bilateral trade currently exert more influence on overall usvietnam relations however there still remains the risk that the mismanagement of war legacy issues such as the status of vietnams victims of agent orange could derail or delay further progress in bilateral relationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34761crs28 109 see crs report rl34702 potential trade effects of dding vietnam to the generalized system of preferences program by michael f martin and vivian c jones 110 based on confidential interviews with vietnamese officials and citizens for more information about the us assistance programs for us veterans with medical problems associated with exposure to ag ent orange see crs report rl34370 veterans affairs health care and benefits for veterans exposed to agent orange by sidath viranga panangala and douglas reid weimerfor the vietnamese government it ppears that economic and strategic considerations will continue to take priority over us assistance in cleaning up dioxin and providing assistance to people with illnesses thought to be related to dioxin exposure vietnam is actively seeking acceptance into the us generalized system of preference gsp program109 which would remove tariffs on us imports of selected goods from vietnam and has i ndicated longterm interest in negotiating free trade agreement fta with the united states additionally since the middle of the decade vietnam has been seeking to expand its security relations with the united states perhaps due to chinas growing influence in southeast asia within vietnam however there is widespread concern about the living conditions of its estimate d 21 million48 million people who were exposed to agent orange and the already identified one million people with medical conditions attributed to that exposure much of that concern is focused on the physical problems of vietnams children who have medical conditions associated with direct or indirect exposure to dioxin some observers think the vietnamese peoples generally positive attitude about the united states could chan ge for the worse if the us government is perceived to be insensitiv or intransigent about agent orange and its associated problems for the us government the past polic seems to have been to deny legal responsibility for any health effects of agen t orange while providing some assistance with the assessment containment and cleaning up of any agent orangerelated dioxin found in vietnam as result th united states has been unwilling to provide medical or financial assistance to programs specifically targeted at purported victims of agent orange for the present the governments of bot h nations apparently are comfortable with us involvement bein g limited to the identification containment and clean up of dioxin hot spots at its current pace it could take several more years before all of the major dioxin hot s pots have been remediated it is likely public attention will shift to caring for people exposed to agent orange once the clean up is done raising the risk of the emergence of bilateral tensions the vietnamese government nd people see some in consistencies between the us governments reluctance to provi aid to vietnamese victims of agent orange and its generous support programs for us veterans who claim their medical problems are agent orange related110 whereas us vietnam veterans are presumed to have been exposed to agent orange and thereby automatically qualify for various benefits for range of medical conditions the us government continues to claim that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the medicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34761crs29 conditions of vietnamese w ho were exposed to agent orange are consequence of their exposure to the herbicide and its dioxin in the same vein the willingness of the united states to provide aid to vietnamese who lost limbs to land mines while refusing to provide help di rectly to people exposed to agent orange can be difficult to explain to vietnamese officials and civilians these apparent inconsistencies in us policy could pose future pr oblems for bilateral relations conversely there is concern in the ited states that if the us government were to seemingly accept some legal or moral responsibility for the vietnamese victims of agent orange it could have undesirable implications for future military conflicts in this view for the us government it remains important that any and all assistance being provided to address the aftereffects of the use of agent orange in vietnam be seen as humanitarian act and not an admission of culpability issues and options for congress for over three decades the effects of agent orange and its accompanying dioxin tcdd on the people and the environm ent of vietnam have remained in the background of usvietnamese relations curre ntly through fora such as the joint advisory committee jac and the dialogue group us and vietnamese officials are meeting and discussing ways to jointly address the war legacy issues of agent orange including scientific research environmental re mediation public awareness and health care assuming that recent pattern s of economic and security issues taking precedence over war legacy issues continue as well as the comparatively positive dynamics in the jac and the dialogue group it could be argued that there is need for congressional involve ment at this time if congress wishes to address the issues related to agent orange there are several aspects of us policy it could examine and consider the most immediate issue may be to obtain concrete answers on how and when the 3 million in assistance congress appropriate d for dioxin clean up efforts in vietnam in may 2007 will be used over 18 months have passed since congress appropriated 3 million for dioxin remediation in da nang and the provision of medical care facilities in the area to date the state department and usaid have not provided specific information on how these funds are to be us ed one option for congress is to exercise oversight to determine the reasons for th delay in utilizing the appropriated funds and to ascertain the status of usaids progress in addition congress may choose to cons ider the appropria tion of additional funds for exposure assessment research dioxin remediation andor humanitarian assistance to vietnamese nationals llegedly suffering from medical conditions related to exposure to agent orange lthough past cooperative efforts in exposure assessment research encountered problems it is generally agreed that more research needs to be done and the timated cost of the research ex ceeds vietnams current budgetary capacity similarly the projected cost of containing and removing the residual dioxin in and around vietnams ag ent orange hot spots is beyond the vietnamese governments resources the precedent for us financial and technicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34761crs30 111 for more on the issue of us soft power see crs report rl34620 comparing global influence chinas and u s diplomacy foreign aid tr ade and investment in the developing world coordinated by thomas lumassistance with dioxin remediation is already established perhaps making the appropriation of dditional funding less problematic appropriations for medical assistance to purported agent orange victims in vietnam may be more problem atic although there exists precedent critics remain concerned about the possible implications fo r future conflicts in addition cambodia and laos may demand similar treatment given that parts of their nations were also sprayed with agent orange during the vietnam war however past and existing humanitarian aid programs in vietnam addressing victims of land mines and hivaids demonstrate the provision of aid need not imply legal or moral responsibility another alternative for congress would be the development of multiyear policy on the general issue of agent orange and dioxin in vietnam this policy could take the form of legislation that ddresses all aspects of the issue research on the level of dioxin in vietnam genera l population studies to determine the level of dioxin exposure in vietnam dioxin containment and remediation and medical care for people with medical conditions rela ted to dioxin exposure the development of such program would likely necessitate consultation with the incoming obama administration as well as the vietnamese government in order to ensure its effective implementation one potential benefit of the developmen t of comprehensive policy on agent orange in vietnam could be the enhancem ent of us soft power in southeast asia111 to some analysts us global influence is being challenged by china and other nations by the use of nonmilitary engagement soft power to encourage other countries to adopt policies or stances consistent with the goals and objectives of the nation employing these policies it has been postulated that the us military interventions in afghanistan and ir aq have undermined its global image and that to restore its image the united stat should more actively engage in soft power exercises such as humanitarian assistance to vietnam to address its war legacy problems in addition relations between china and vietnam since 1975 have ranged from hostile to cool but more r ecently china has sought to foster more friendly ties with its neighbors increas ed us assistance for vietnams agent orange victims could strengthen usvietnam relations and encourage vietnam to be stronger partner to the united stat in other diplomatic and security areas
