history of psychotherapy lecture given on 20 june 1963 meat bodies cook whats the date audience 20th of june okay twenty june ad 13 saint hill special briefing course i was thinking what i could tell you that might make auditing easier im not in the position at the present moment to give you history of auditing on the whole track that would be complete history but i know quite bit about it and its pretty stinking it all goes along the traditional psychiatric lines of evaluate invalidateyou know the psychiatric code evaluate invalidate and so forth now it might strike you as peculiar that if this universe has been sitting here this long that nobody ever got very practical about digging anybody out of it and thats becausethats becausetheres very good reason for thisis the guys who consistently remain in charge are usually in sufficiently good shape that they are not terribly worried about their own condition you see that audience mmhm mmm so it makes continuous authoritative level of not interested thats quite interesting because new blood comes into this universe i suppose even today and these boys havent gone the route and so on by the time they have theyve usually lost out and so theyre longer in position of authority but there have been spells of auditing of sorts but you wouldnt call it auditing but as much as ive been around in this universe i have never encountered an effective therapy thats quite interesting because it goes contrary to the fondest hopes of the religionists it rather plows in the legend of the kahoona kapuna kapunas who all they had to do was go kahoona kapuna and somethingthaauh see this is an unworkable level see there havent been workable therapies thereve been bythebootstraps recoveries which are rather spectacular and as you look back over the whole track youll find that youve been going on rollycoaster youve spent some time in meat body and then the next thing you know why there you were operating thetan see and then for while why youre pushing doll body around or something like that and then boomwhy youre operating thetan and then you push meat body around for while and then spend few million or trillion years in trap or something like that and then you come out the other end of it and suddenly and mysteriously why there you are chucking planets around or something like this you see this is allthis is all very difficult for person to reconcile and its what am i doing what am i doing being up being down being up being down there isnt one of you who hasnt been in meat bodies on the whole track many many times many times and places you see and who succeeded this actwho didnt succeed this action by being an ot you see quite interesting and vitally necessary to your understanding of the situation because it gives you false hope you say well whatwhat must have turned what must have turned the dials on my life like this what mysterious thing happened that would suddenly make nine empire state buildings tall and whatwhat turn of the road did i hit that brought into state where i could well cut earth in half and serve it up as watermelon see what did i suddenly do that brought this about and then also what did i do that made suddenly feel so weak and how come few trillennia later why here i am professor of medicine in the college of fine arts or something in hoosegow university or something howwhat dizzy very dizzying up one minute down the next and you go along the track looking for miracle because it must have been miracle you didnt know anything about it very peculiar things went on youre on stake trap of some kind or another and some bird out of the goodness of his heart grabs you by the scruff of the neck and threw you up into the sky or somebody else fortuitously put charge in the planet and blew it to flinders that you happened to be trapped on and you fortuitously went flying out into space and next thing you know there you are tromping around in your bare feet lightyear tall see and you say well it must have been that i just felt that way when i was on the stake and when i was off the stake why then i felt okay and cant happen to again and then the next thing you know why there you are pushing broom at hoosegow university feeling very apathetic well id like to point out something to you the cycle is getting shorter see thats the trick you stay up less long you go down quicker and what is this mysterious thing that suddenly brings you into prominence where youre flexing the biceps in all directions and so on what is this mysterious thing well i cant even now give you full answer that i would guarantee to stay solid for the next some trillenniayears but its the opportunity more than anything else and necessity level and then you find out you can and there you are and so you can go along for while because you see you arent naturally matchbox tall you see thats probably 90 percent of the answer you arent naturally only two inches high see you look at it as the ordinary condition of life now to be in meat body and be quite small you see actually thats not the ordinary condition of life thats an extraordinary condition of life very extraordinary takes quite bit to get person into that state every once in while youll run into somebody and theyre allergic to boot polish or something like this you see you ask them to recall time when they swiped or ate their mothers boot polish or something you see and bang they do and bang theyre longer allergic to boot polish and you say well isnt this wonderful isnt this remarkable here i have achieved near miracle oh yes you have theres doubt about that but what you havent looked at is the unnaturalness to have an allergy to boot polish thats terribly unnatural now it takes great deal of publicity takes great deal of working at to keep everybody down the enthusiasm that this has to be worked at is rather phenomenal it does take sixteenbilliondollarperannum appropriations on the part of the us socalled governmentwith psychiatric treatments for one and all and siberia slated for anybody who doesnt agree with them politically it takes that much money it takes that much effort it takes that many tv screens see it takes that manyit takes that many misguided mothers who said johnny you must not get your feet wet see it takes this whole operation has to be worked at youve never looked at it as workedat operation youve looked at it as rather natural operation well not to introduce memoirs into the thing particularly but you occasionally have not wanted to be pushed around youve just wanted to go and sit on cloud for nine thousand years and recover i almost tore up valley one time on just this one basic fact they wanted to give some treatment well their treatment was damn good it was perfectly friendly treatment friendly you know youyou got knocked out in crash see well lets fix him up you know whole attitude is why the hell dont you go off someplace and get lost i just want to sit here on this rock till my head stops spinning see total ambition they had to hand out treatment oh hoho yeah ho weve got to fix him up see ah well its very interesting because the funny part of it is if i just sat on rock for another thousand years or something like that and admired the sunsets and sunrises why i would have probably come out of almost anything i would have gotten into dont you see because i wasnt being trapped there nothing bad was happening to but you never have these opportunities the struggle person has right now trying to get vacation and the glee with which some other people say theyve just been on one now this is athis is an interesting thing how come everybody wants vacation well actually life is very interesting activity and if you were going at it hammer and tongs and were not being degraded in the process why you really wouldnt feel like you wanted vacation but that vacation is token payment on the possible opportunity of having hundred thousand years to sit on mount everest and admire the snowfall because you know youd be better the universe itself if you delete incident from it is therapeutic although you can look on this universe as big basic trap its mostly trap cause it lets people get at people it itself is not very operative in that direction now you could probably turn out well lets go way down scale and lets take the spinbins look how busy they are in spinbin have you ever been in hospital ever been in hospital youre lying there six oclock in the morning crash on goes the lights bang the door opens somebodys standing therethermometer konk here we go man gotta do gotta do gotta do gotta do gotta do you know i think theres hospital someplace they were understaffed and they produced some remarkable cures at the same time it isnt true that if you just went on sitting still for any gods quantity of years that you would necessarily get well that isnt necessarily true either it would all depend on what condition you were sitting still in if you were sitting still in the head of an idol someplace in an abandoned temple for few trillennia you might not deteriorate but you certainly wouldnt improve either power of choice has got to be there to sit still and thats what gets overset entirely the entire economic system that we have now is completely rigged to overthrow the power of choice to sit still you cant do it you see games are lots of fun but here are enforced games and well theres the game of overdraft overdraft at the bank thats quite game theresits accident that money keeps inflating and people keep fooling with money because the impulse is there to make the economic noose tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter where could you go right now and simply sit down in meat body on this planet and be free of the economic clutches well not too many years ago you could go up to the backwoods of alaska or something like that or i even know places in montana little kootenay country something like that youd probably disappear in there and years decades would go by and nobody would even know you were around you know throw sod hut or log cabin together ah these places are disappearing and there are desert islands now where you can go sit under the pago pago tree and make love to the local wahines and have nothing to do see theyve all been atombombed or taken over by the food and drug administration its quite remarkableits quite remarkable if you come right down to it how all the progress level is directed toward at this particular time tightening the economic noose and which of course shortens up the amount of available time you have which of course gives you more problems and which once more overthrows your power of choice and so theres chance to rest well now of course if youre in good shape you dont want to rest but bad shape has to be maintained people have to work at it to keep people in bad condition thats something that you should take into your considerations as an auditor youve got the pcnow let show you how far this goesyouve got pc and you audit them up all week inch by inch and over the weekend they fall foot by foot well thats an interesting thing hardly any of us havent run into this here we go somebody is working all weekend to make sure that enough problems are mounted up here and enough time is denied and enough this and that and the other thing is denied and enough arguments and trouble are thrown in the air to continue this type of status quo you say well this person must be crazy to be trying to hold this other person down to this degree theyre just dramatizing theyre justnot even dramatizing anything on the back track theyre just dramatizing current trend well now john you go off all week getting audited like that you see and what do you think is happening to here and the kiddies and so forthand do you realize that the rent is overdue and the meatballs are overdue and everything is overdue and then of course theres installments on the furniture andand theres theand whoand who do you think has to put out the cat every night and so forthand you cant go on like this you realize that and so forthits all just your introversion after all and what are you doing putting out all that money for getting audited you know youve probably had this happen to your pc see well you say whats going on this persons keeping this other person down well actually not trying to keep the person down theyre just dramatizing the extant confusion then there has to be some feeling that if you leave some guy alone why hell resurge but it isnt true that if you leave him alone in trap hell resurge because his power of choice is missing now how long can person stay in trap and not get any better even though hes not being hurt well i can tell you on very good authority1394 trilliontrillion years didnt get any better why well sitting in mass didnt want to be there see the beingness factor is all knocked out power of choice knocked out that sort of thing youre sooner or later going to find the pc youre going to have incidents on that run up into trillions of trillionsmaybe the thousands of trillions of trillions you see maybe theyve been sittingtheyve been sitting inside this volcano or something volcanoes dont last that long something more permanent theyve been stuck on this sun for trillions of trillions of trillions of years you see big time periods but all that time they are being harassed by the fact that they are not there by choice theyre harassed also by the engram of their original arrival how they got into that state theyre protesting in other words their situation and as long as thetan protests he is not free and he wont get any better thats why you cant enforce auditing on somebody well you see some guy walking down the street and you say hey you youre going to be audited he says whats that you say youll find out funny part of it is you get away with it with some they say hey whats this stuff hey this is all right you know on some of them but the bulk of them just the fact that you had forced them to get audited on something they didnt even know what it was eliminates power of choice from the auditing so completely that auditing is just kind of trap you see power of choice factor is what has been overthrown there they dont get better of course its testimony to auditing that evenauditing will even take care of that factor you got guy sitting there whos protesting the process all the way along the linehes protesting the process all the way along the line well unfortunately he isnt going to get any betterhes going to stick himself in that protest that protest against the process thats all hes going to stick himself itd be better to run him on something that was too upgraded for him that he wasnt protesting that was just killing himtry it seethan to run him up against this continuous protest you take pc whos trying to go earlier on the track while youre running lateronthetrack incident the pc gradually mounts up to higher and higher protest against not going earlier he finally locks himself later on the track see its as simple as that this mechanic you should take into effect in auditing now what you know and what you have in your possession as an auditor is actually data which has not been extant in this universe and the longer i go why the surer i am of that fact now theres been data about engrams in this universe theres been data about mental image pictures theres been data about all kinds of things but theres not been data about auditing now auditing perforce does not evaluate or invalidate and when you audit person against persons wisheswell momentarily in session you sometimes push guy through cch command and so forth and youthat is protesting so forththats not what i mean i mean he didnt want to be audited he is being audited you see nothings going to happen or if it does happen youve got to be pretty heroic in the way youre making gain youve got to completely alter his idea that he wants to be there old failed help was one of the most effective mechanisms by which you did that he knew he couldnt be helped because all help failed now if you have this weapon this tool called auditing and so forth what is the limit of its use well ive just given you the reason why its use is limited you can to some degree overthrow persons protest by reorienting him on his power of choice he finally through habit and otherwise familiarity recognizes that you are not trying to do him in and therefore comes to want to be audited not because hes overwhelmed because youve changed his ideas on the subject this is also very possible so that really cant be considered terrific limiter on the subject of auditing auditing is limited only by communication its the only thing auditing really limits you could imagine yourself going on horrendous sales talk that everybody on planet zug is worshipping the god baal see and their idea of really doing their family good favor is make them feed their babies oftener to this idol see and why you say it would take long time to bring them around to any particular way of thinking oh i dont know that it would you wouldnt do it by suddenly overwhelming the lot of them and say now look thats the god baal but i happen to be the god mug and youre going to get mugged any minute if you just dont sit down and go into coaudit here and straighten yourselves out well oddly enough that might even work too but you mustnt get overwhelm completely cancelled out of your catalog of tricks remember that dont cancel that out completely but look on it as an administrative or political tool not as an auditing tool dont mix up these tools you see well one of the ways to do it would just be to say well if you guys dont stop worshipping baal and get on the ball and kick its head off and get busy and set up proper temple here to mug why im going to scareify and scorchify the lot of you in fact there goes an acre of wheat right now and theyd all say gaw coo yessir and after youve pulled them along while why you might get them into communication and then you could alter this overwhelm dont you see force does have its role force does have role the only trouble is force has never been total answer see force is not total answer people try to make it total answer right now most of the governments of earth are conducting themselves on the basis of force if you dont believe it look at the appropriation that is given to weapons see thats their great belief in force and yet none of them can fall back on force and force has become absolutely useless in the field of government it doesnt settle anything one thing ive learned on the whole track has been that force is never the whole answer but ive also learned reverse way to that total absence of force is not the whole answer you just try and build mountain sometime ignoring force hehheh im afraid youre not going to get much mountain built but that is constructive force so the way force is used has an awful lot to do with the value of force and destructive uses of force has been the basic downfall of one and all but youve got this whole planet thats feeding its babies to this fire god and that sort of thing and you cant get them into communicationwell you cant totally rule out destructive force at least tip couple of lightning bolts over there to the temple of baal and blow his silly head off and you say oh you see what happens to the worshipers of baal you see you might get them in communication but driving people toward auditing thats very difficult thing but they are driven toward auditing people are driven toward auditing by their somatics by their illnesses by their unhappiness by their unwillingness to be what they are where they areand those things drive them toward auditing so they are driven toward auditing so you almost never get pc on his own power of choice just to be audited see very very seldom hes driven there at the best by his goals dont you see now all of these things then sort out well what is power of choice well power of choice could be many things but if youre auditing person in the direction of consenting to be audited and then follow this by pushing himauditing him in the direction where he isnt driven to be audited by his own condition and then audit him in the direction finally of putting himself in the condition so he can help you smooth things outthis of course is very usable pattern and i dont care whether your pattern of auditing is preordained to be only on the pcs power of choice or not remember theres always something driving the pc to restore him to any condition where hes anyfeels any freedom or anything else or is any value to himself or anybody elseto put him back into such condition you do have to however consult his power of choice you can always make person well oddly enough with auditing without consulting his power of choice isnt that interesting and it is just to that height only that previous mental therapy has reached and thats physical therapy too thats the height that it reached it got further than that it was all done more or less by force and this thing called power of choice was never consulted interesting isnt it but in your hands why you have weapons which improve persons power of choice and he finally elects to be audited youve seen that happen time after time well thats very safe route so you never then find pure power of choice to be audited see its always monitored by little tiny factors and these factors are more and more otherdetermined the worse off person is see so there is absolute power of choice with regard to whether person gets audited or doesnt get audited and he has this horrible feeling that if he just would go sit someplace and be quiet or something like that he might get well anyway well thats an interesting feeling i appreciate that feeling i feel great empathy with that feeling its fineits nice feeling even though its totally completely impossible such programsuch program in this universe will always be interfered with just as today youre not going to find many wilds in which you could go and sit down comfortably in log cabin of your own construction and get away from it all and remain away from it all from here on out just as you could not do that nowi imagine there are few places you could do that there are few bits and pieces left of the world rapidly being overwhelmedso this universe big broad as it is actually offers opportunities which are almost as few sounds incredible say well theres deserted planet up there and all youve got to do is go up and sit on one of its mountain tops and it hasnt any population for long time because it had an atomic war long time ago or theres an asteroid spinning around and if i could just go and sit on this asteroid for while why id be cheerful about the whole thing and take rest and so forth well i can tell you from personal experience here youre really betting on one man thats very close to the impossible im not going into any detailed private historyold soldiers are always talking about the war that the younger generation has hardly even heard of and im afraid old thetans are always talking about the universes planets and organizations which have long since gone to dust but ill be forgiven by talking about an extant organization and in the last eighty trillion years with change of identity ive played hooky number of times eighty trillion years see im playing hooky right now as matter of fact and all during that period of timeof course thats notthats not any any great quantity of time but remember it is the last eighty trillion years ending up with right now see ive taken off hundred thousand here and two hundred and fifty thousand there and five or six million someplace else and one time even billion i always got caught up withalways did it wasnt that anybody was sending for but it just wasnt that quiet i remember the last time i almost gave up on this one i almost gave up on this one found valley where there wasnt blessed living thing anyplace in any direction anywhere period and the sun was quite distant from that planet who the devil would ever want anything to do with that planet see it wasnt even very hospitable there wasnt any living things on it i sat down and decided to grow some plants and i thought that would be nice peaceful occupation just sit in this valley you know nothing to worry about with anybody or anything of the sort and i finally managed to coax into existence few vines and that sort of thing and flowers and it was getting quite nice around there i fixed up lake and it was getting better and better you see rather hard to do because there wasnt much sunshine you see and i was just getting on my way pretty well and all of sudden zoomboom and there was spaceship and i got pretty mad about the whole thing as matter of fact it wasnt so much that their blast knocked down plants i remember bringing thunderstorm moved it over the ship moved it over range of mountains and then moved it back over the ship just to show them it was under control and then let them have it well they were back couple of years later we had conversation and i reported back to base i mean you give up on these things you know apathetic apathetic about having vacation but therestheres typical sequence id figured id had rough beef about it for the whole billion years before that and i figured i ought to go someplace and sit still and just be quiet for while and that was all the good it did its noble ambition i commend you for it but ive never been able to make it work out it works out to the degree that you flex your muscles little bit better but youre running up against shortening cycle in this universe the cumulative fact of the time track is the defeating fact there is other defeating fact than thatthe cumulative effect of the time track the more you live the more pictures youve got and the more misadventures you have the more engrams youve got and the more engrams youve got the more engrams can be keyed in and the more engrams can be keyed in the less events you can associate yourself with with free mind and that is the dwindling spiral ive just given it to you right there that is it there is nothing complicated about it its just more complicated than that thetan is his own trap and time itself carrying forward adds cumulative effect i remember we had press agent here for while i had to think up all of his press for him and i got tired of having him tell you couldnt get any publicity so i finally had to let him go but i remember one time his attitude toward our ideas in scientology was but he said that just says that iti hadnt told him anything to amount to anything i just told him that when you had an accident or something like that you collected an engramand he said rather disgustedly well thats the theory that the more things that happen to you why the more cumulative disaster you have and he said that couldnt be true and that made total departure between him and scientology you see he couldnt confront that fact but thats the truth thats the truth so one period you might be able to stay forty fifty trillion years sailing around doing beautiful ballet on the planets you know and then all of sudden this whizzlebum goes by and it causes you to feel strange you go back youre not feeling so good and you decide youre not dancing so well and the next thing you know there would be whole chain of disastrous event and bang there you are pushing broom at hoosegow university only the next time it only lasts thirty trillion years see and the next time it only lasts ten trillion years there it goes you see thatsthat is the basic difficulty that you are up against that any being is up against now there is another difficulty that you might become very interested in and that is the difficulty called organization and the way things should be run because scientology is at first glance as any selfidiotic government agency would be the first to scent death on organizationif organization contains seniorities lets look this over lets see why scientology is not looked down on but oooouwehhuhthe fear in the chest when somebody looks at this he recognizes that if scientology as little as he could understand of it was let loose unlimitedly in this universe it would end all castetype organizations of whatever kind i was eating breakfast this morning i was wondering how would i go about selling my compatriots in thein the galactic confederation on the idea of kicking out the meatbody psychiatrists and putting nothing but scientologists in in that particular line of activity it was an interesting mental exercise interesting mental exercise i could imagine the problems which would be thrown in my lap as result theres the hewers of wood and the drawers of water dont you seeand theres the people who direct the hewers of wood and the drawers of water and then theres the peopleand the beings who direct the people who direct the hewers of wood and the drawers of water it never quite occurs to anybody to ask what you doing hewing wood and drawing water but thats beside the point well the galactic confederation is one of the most successful organizations that this universe has ever had basically because it is based on an intermixture its composed of meat bodies doll bodies and free thetans and its one of the very few that ever attempted this odd mixture of course you get back on the whole track you get backwell i can tell you from personal experienceas short time ago as thirtythree trilliontrillion years practically present time only it doesnt seem like present time to memy mind starts creaking little bit on time when i start adding all that upbut from personal experience at even that recent date they were quite accustomed to having free thetans wandering around in towns this was not an unaccustomed action what kind of town well oddly enough about thirtythree trilliontrillion years ago there was society that was not too different from id say about 1920sort of 1920 with the rococo of the 19th century see the potted palm sort of motif you know the fedora hat same clothes the razzledazzle gent wore striped shirt see wide striped shirt see the variousvarious signs and so forth it looked quite odd the buildings like modern gamages or something like that you know these things matter how much they seem to change ages after that by the way in the same locale there was an arabian civilization that didnt even know anything about automobiles or machinery or anything like that but had lots of minarets and big turbans and baggy pants you know and horses the universe goes backwards and forwards and upside down but im beginning to wonder because im looking almost in vain for different type of society you say well of course you couldnt find different type of society because the type of society youve been living in at the present time has keyed in the types of society which are similar to it on the whole track so therefore you arent going to find any different types of soci dont know i didnt ask for any of these engrams to get keyed in particularly ive been getting them keyed in all over this universe i only find half dozen different society types theyre quite the same and i find bogies to amount to anything in some stuff doing last night i was looking at bentleyabout 1916 bentley funny hood mixed up with western stagecoach this was road traffic and greyhound bus sevenhundred billion years ago very modern you know all mixed up all mixed up guy looking at this will think hes running dub if he doesnt watch it very carefully because he gets the repetitive type of society you see so on couple of implantsand in one of them there was nothing but west point cadets and in the other one there was nothing but annapolis cadets it isnt that anybody was doing any dub its just thatthe fact that that is what cadet for the army is supposed to dress like simple where do you suppose manhow does man get this terrific agreement without having experienced it and thats how he has experienced it well anyway thetans used to wander around townslike gamages you know and they had traps and implants and so forth sitting in the town for the unwary thetan to get blundered into like you look into this box and youll see all your life again you know implant shoplifting i think was prevented by wire nets spread across goods on counters if you could imagine london up here beingwith nice rigs so that free thetans wouldnt carry off all the hardware and so forth and youpretty mad but thetan at that time had been so antagonized that he had to consider himself three times as high as the empire state building hed just as soon be small peanuts along with anybody else funny funny admixtures of societies and youll find society where there is such thing as spiritall is scientific you see there is soul man came from mud the only cure and treatment is biochemical shot in the gluteus maximus you find such society you even find them that depraved such as earth 1963 weird beliefs they shift all over the place in other words but an admixture of social strataand i do mean social strata because it falls immediately into the ability and power stratasthat who canthat one who can throw the biggest lightning bolt of course is normally considered to be chief mostly because hed argue if he werent and you get down scale and you get the more active character such as dolls and then you go down scale and you get the meat body and then you go down scale and you get the politician and the situationthe situation which develops is that scientology injected in any mixedup society where you have free thetans doll bodies meat bodies or any other downgradedtheres also other downgrades that have thetans in them some robots have thetans in them and horses dogs cats game animals birds insects these are social strata i dont care if theyre not sentient social strata totally because guys pretty far out by the time hes running an ant but the situation is that youre looking at scale of social castes these are castes and the caste system shatters the moment that you can take human being and process him up to level of doll body well what about the selfrespecting doll the selfrespecting doll at that moment would be the first one to protest processing meat body up to the level of dolls interesting all right so you take the dolls and you process the dolls and you move them up toward category of free thetan whos going to protest there well the free thetans going to protest thats for sure hes going to say well whos going to hew the wood and push the spaceship see you know whos going to stand there and rivet this stuff and how are we going to establish seniority man and one of the first things the galactic confederation would ask well what are you going to do i mean whats your seniority rating so on well actually you could work it out youd say well youve got everybodys records and they have so all right so this characterthis characters been doll body hes been sergeant at arms on planet zed for quite some time as doll and by the time we get him processed were not going to penalize him or something or other so weve made free thetan out of him well im afraid that he would have seniority over somebody who had only been his corporal in other words youd have to leave the status quo and carefully record the status quo unfortunately this leaves free thetan pushing broom someplace or another but who said that free thetan shouldnt or couldnt push broom now the whole argument explodes in the face of this well who says that people have got to be at that level to do those things see thats the lie that is introduced in the situation for instance in the last few hundred billion why the quality of motor or engine being turned out in space vessels in the galactic confederation have been very poor why they blow up every now and then one of the first questions you ask after youve had an arc break with couple of blowups of this particular character is what the hell are we doing using spaceships well spaceships are necessary to carry the troops well you say well what are you carrying troops for because free thetan in the first place could go in and swamp up the lotand usually does to open up the gates or something like that and let the troops into the citadel so it looks like nowimsupposedto chain which is going on here see kind of weird isnt it and after crash why you always have to pick the dolls out of their heads because dolls cant get out of their heads human beings can but dolls cant kind of grim thought isnt it and free thetan to pick one up and salvage him out of wreckand here we get back to auditing againoh theres lots of patterned auditings doll has head inside head oh about the size of your fist you know these puppetthese puppet things they turn out you know that you put on your hand like glove you know wiggle the fingers and well doll without the little hands on the thing and without the head is what the thetan looks like see its just that little skirt so you take him take ball sort of like trap with couple of holes in it so he can see out of it and shove him up into this metal trap thing see then you pick up the head of the doll body and you put him in there into cradle inside the head and he extends into helical arrangement down into the body by which he can then manipulate and so forth the body they get pretty good at it but doll body is actually trap to end all traps because the bodys light and because he isnt always being beaten aroundthey last for long time and so forth but doll is in trap now free thetan to take doll out of wreck pulls hispulls the doll bodys head offyou know like lifting off divers helmetpicks this ball out of the dome pulls the thetan out of the ball you see and goes in other words throws out beam that asises or erases eats up actually burns up his facsimiles of shock and says go on home tells him where the wreck is and the doll says ayeaye and hes away as free thetan tiny one interesting interesting but look at that thats very interesting because thats therapy see thats an outside exterior therapy where somebody else is doing it but it gives you an open sesame to what do you do about ants what do you do about ducks and what do you do about eats funny part of it is that free thetan could pick up duck and go fsssssss thered be residue left the thetan that was occupying that duck would at that moment be free and be clear albeit cleared by somebody else what about the facsimile well hed go on for short time and start mocking them up again of course because its not on his own power of choice but it leaves him momentarily free do you see that interesting from standpoint there is wave then that can be projected at an individual that would erase his engrams quite interesting isnt it but would they stay erased for very long well not until the guy kind of himself got restimulated and keyed them in and so forth it would just be what was in restimulation at that moment would get wiped out now this was psychotherapy and youll see some residues of this called picturology and it consisted of putting guy to sleep with ray or beamwhich is simply energy moving at certain vibrationnothing very mysterious about that which induces hypnosis or sleep you take one of these clapsticks like they have in the front of the hollywood cameras they put this guy to sleep and you know what hes been looking at seehes been in an accident or something like that so you know the scenery he must have in the incident see you talk aboutthis is why some auditors write script theyre probably familiar with the method they take picture see of what hes been looking at and hold it up in front of his face take one of these clapsticks and go snap like that take another copy of it with different view hold it up let him see it take this big stick and go snap see hes sitting there comatose hold up another picture of it another slightly different view take this clapstick snap after while the thetan all of sudden groggily starts to get the idea so he takes the pictures that he himself has been looking at and he goes snap and smashes them by mimicry we want you to smash up this picture and so the thetan in groggy state goes ahead and smashes up the picture auditing the most modern and advanced auditing that the universe ever developed is right there never developed anything any better than that you have to select the picture you select it one hundred percent down to the scene and viewpoint well what if the guy isnt sitting in the picture what if that isnt the picture hes sitting in well forget about that what ifwhat if you bypass some charge in it ahkahhh well we dont know why hes cross and what happens after this has been done well scientologist could run the whole incident unthe whole incident from beginning to end untouched and have the additional bonus of having to run out the erasure of picture sequence too all it actually did was operate as keyin i think this is quite interesting im very interestednow theres other data and of that character but look at the evaluation you choose the picture for the pc one hundred percent its all right to say all right we want you to go to certain part of the track and lets see if we can find anything oh this is total evaluation weve got to have picture of pine tree over on the right and theres got to be rock over on the left now you find the picture with the pine tree and the rock there it is idiotic because it might not even be engramic you talk about hitormiss proposition man well how did they know if they were working this on free thetanhow did they know that he was even sitting in the chair if this was meat body psychiatrist doing this thats an interesting point but they used to have meters some of you are allergic to meters because you realize that meters are normally used by meatbodies societies to detect the presence of thetan and in such therapy room therell be great big dial not unlike an emeter dialthis part of the dial black dial and as long as the thetan is in the chair it of course is registering because the chair is hooked up to the meter theres an aura registeringbut somebodys in connection with this thing and therefore he is detectable now in the helatrobus implants and so forth if youre ever unlucky enough to get derailed and so forth in the helatrobus implants you would have seen workman come up walking forward with box pointed toward the pole you know kind of ducked and scared stiff butbecause you might be big thetan you see you might not have been that little thetan they thought and walking up toward the pole see to find out if youreif theres somebody on the pole or not bad visio thats whats the mattertheir eyes are shot it isnt that thetans are invisible at all as matter of fact they arent invisible they are very visible andhowever if youve cut that whole top stratum off of your perception why you probably couldnt see pink or green traffic lights either see i mean theres people colorblind well people in meat bodies through fear and otherwise go waveblind at the wave actually thetans are very visible particularly if you condense one or freeze one then he looks like an old black glove without any fingers in it now talking about therapy at large then you are actually being asked to grapple then with something for which you have historic background you havent any track background for this ive probably given you sample of possibly the only track background you might have connected with in this particular line you see the ideas of being big and little and how did you go over this cycle the idea of somebody standing up and perfectly beneficially without being angry at you at all trying to get you to get rid of picture by slapping clapstick in front of your face or something like that the idea that if you could just sit still long enough and breathe under your own power of choice why you would somehow or another go free these are the background music and as far as person being pc is concerneddoes he want to be audited doesnt he want to be audited how much is he driven to be audited what is causing him to be auditedall of these various other factors add up into the thing his power of choice has to be consulted to this degree and that is in nutshell practically all the background anybodys got predianetics and scientology on this whole subject sometimes people have freudian background or psychological background but not to be sarcastic at all because id never slap at 01 papa freudbut yourthe basis is wow this is long way from home man yeah thatsi dont know you start counting witch doctor stuff if you count that in dont you see thats about the same level of operation so theres very little preconception here now you get somebody whos been psychoanalytic patient and you try to audit them it shows up at once hell start telling you that he has traumas caused by fixations and he keeps trying to run engrams of having made pass at his little sister or something like this you see and it shows up almost at once what he is looking for and the thing to do with that rather cruelly is just take him to his first psychoanalytic session and scan him rapidly through to his last one do that two or three times and you wont have any more trouble you sometimes also pick up data that the analyst picked up that you can use in running engrams weve also done that it of course makes him recover the ulcers and things like that that hes been cured of thats the cruelest thing i ever did i wasthis poor devil had been five years or something like that maybe seven he was the assistant editor of colliers magazine the poor devil and hed been going to that analyst you know and been eating humble pie and being careful and digging up these times when he thought lascivious thoughts about the wrong thing and hed just been having an awful time and hed beenvast amount of moneyi think he must have spent ten fifteen twenty thousand dollars doing all this and so forth and i got so tired of him trying to pick up his eudipitus lipupsis or something of the sort that i finally said in disgust to himthis is many many years agoi said all right lets pick up your first freudian treatment and we did had little trouble but we finally got it scan rapidly through to the last treatment thats fine all right lets do that again do that again then i found out the poor guy had been treated for ulcers his stomach was justhis stomach looked like swiss cheese you know full of holes and by the time i finished this he just doubled up in the auditing chair and then doubled up on the floor and i thought he was going into prenatal he wasnt his ulcers had just come on full bloom in other words the onlythe only thing that had happened is theyd put him on some kind of suppress ridge so great that they had managed to suppress the pain of the ulcers and of course the second you scanned him through all these years of travail why there he was with complete fullblown set of ulcers id like to finish the story and go on and tell you that i audited him on up then so that he didnt have to worry about ulcers but as matter of fact he wouldnt publish favorable article and i never did anyway but the essence of the thing is is you have as student of dianetics and scientology my sympathy to this degree is youre going in against nobackground action ive given you just about the totality of the background of this particular subject now the people who are and beings who are in the universe that are still communicating and still alive have however arrived at point where they can reverse very easily and start up again and youll get more vectors starting them up than you will pressing them down governments are forgetting more and more how to govern and that sort of thing they will be less and less argument posed against processing and so forth but in actual fact what do you have you have brandnew trend and brandnew trendits not necessary they catch on slowly they dont necessarily catch on slowly at all brandnew trends sometimes go faster than old trends but certainly to this degree it gives you benefit from your own past track except as pc you get reality on this and that and so forthbut you havent got large quantity of data now if you were sergeant in the army trying to teach private how to shoot on rifle range you would be bounteously assisted andor disastrously held up by the persons past skill either guy can shoot or he cant shoot and thats just about what sergeants do they pick out few guys that can shoot and these guys are well well keep them in the lines and these guys over here theyre hopeless dont let them near rifle and so forth well what are they doing theyre just cashing in directly on the training they had before the battle of bunker hill and before that the training they had so on and so on and backtrack and when they were doll and guy cant shoot lefthanded because dolls carry their weapons on the lefthand side and hes committed too many overts on that but he shoots all right as long as you give him righthand holster these things change but youre cashing in all the time on the persons background and youre practically training an automaticity you take some guy send him to university and say hes going to be an atomic scientist but why do you want to be an atomic scientist well he doesnt know he just has feeling wears his hair in the exact design of an atom bomb you know and there he is there he is youre training an atomic scientist whose aggregate training on the subject of atomic science put together would make an ibm computer awful sick in its gears the figure would be so tremendous you take some pilot you teach this guy to be pilot what have you got youve got somebody there my god hes been flying airplanes and flying airplanes andhe either can fly or cant fly and youll find most instructors have just come on down to that what are you doing youre picking up the whole guys background and teaching is then simply method of restimulation thats all weve got brandnew subject here theres nonothing the more you restimulate the less the guys going to learn i mean its quite reverse because theres nothing there to restimulate there is past training on dianetics or scientology as far as your pc is concerned the contrary is true though as i was telling you about the editorassistant editor of colliers you do get conflict because youll get somebody into picturology practically anybody whos been on the whole track has some time or another had somebody smashing clapstick in front of his face see maybe not often maybe some of you will find pc whose helatrobus implant series and so forth has been very nicely erased by this particular method its all there you see and its totally aberrative on the pc but after youve finished up running the whole helatrobus implant then youve got to take care of the treatment and its twice as bad as the implant anyhowthis pc however can mistake the auditor for past schools and past actions he can make bad mistake that way pcs sitting across the auditing table holdinghe sees the auditor as somebody maybe whos sitting there holding up picture dont you see or an implanter or hypnotist or something like this he can get himself screwed up on this particular subject thats why an auditor has to act more like an auditor than an auditor because you can key in awfully easily past therapy on somebody that was therapy that wasnt therapy dont you see now you tell guy to go into an incident and hes liable to get the idea that youre implanting him and you know all kinds of weird things because pc isnt too bright hes down there amongst theamongst the energy waves and the anaten and he isnt thinking too easily so he gets confusions much more easily you just remember that all past therapies overthrew his power of choice exclusively as an operation and an action they were dedicated to this the one factor you can alter is not overthrow his power of choice but rehabilitate his power of choice if hes very very difficult as pc youve always got that one in your locker now its one thing to say never take pcs orders but remember that never means when pc is confused upset in the middle of an arc break hell tell you silly things well that means dont take those silly things but sometimes pc even though hes pretty arc breaky can tell you exactly what is wrong well if you dont take those things knowing yourself that that is what is wrong why youre overthrowing his and your power of choice at the same time so there is nothing wrong at all with taking pcstaking pcs hints and hiswell his orders as far as thats concerned but taking his orders only occurs after youve arc broken him very hard he wont give you orders up to that time hell just give you data you arc break him hard he starts giving orders and then the next thing you know these orders start coming out of the middle of implants they come out of engramic phrases they do this and that and you can just ruin him thats why you say never take pcs orders but that means when hes arc broken upset hell just give you confusing bunch of junk i know i myself giving an auditor orders have wound myself around the meter about three wraps you know what you ought to do is go back to you know the auditor didnt realize that i must be pretty confused at that particular point and go back to it oh it was the reason you shouldnt of course is whats wrong is totally unknown to the pc or it wouldnt be wrong now you get different arc break assessments for different levelsthere are different assessmentstheres different assessment for each level on that state of case scale and the engram running one only has couple thats just bypassed an engram earlier engram an earlier beginning or have i got the date or duration wrong thats two questionsgot the duration wrong or the date wrong and youll find most arc breaks in engram running stem from getting the wrong duration for the engram nothing more elementary than that it isnt the earlier incident its the wrong duration thats the bypassed charge but that wasnt what i set out to tell you i just say well these are the various problems and this is the history of psychotherapy in this particular universe given to you on very limited scale there could be much fancier bunch of data connected with it there could be lot of ramifications we could take in the witch doctors we could take in all kinds of people we could take in psychiatrists in general we could give you probably billions of words of description of the various practices of the ugbug tribe along the moscow rivermethods of psychotherapy see we could get very very catalogicbut that is not psychotherapy thats just dramatization they werent trying to do anything for anybody the point im making is is you yourselfyou yourself have few points that you can put together and remember in handling pcs and in learning auditing and they depend to some degree on history and i think maybe some of the data ive given you might be of some assistance thank you
