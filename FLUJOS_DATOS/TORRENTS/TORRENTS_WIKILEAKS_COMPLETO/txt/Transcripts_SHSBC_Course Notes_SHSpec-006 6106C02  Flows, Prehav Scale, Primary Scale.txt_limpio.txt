6106c02 shspec6 flows prehav scale primary scale person that has flowed in one direction too long eg writer who has written too much shipping clerk who keeps shipping etc one day he will want to stop it is an electrical phenomenon people who are affected by gravity are affected to degree by newtons laws of motion action and reaction when thetan pushes particle out theres recoil effect the law really only applies to masses of comparable magnitude the stuck flow occurs when one neglects the return flows one is in fact receiving one fails to asis it and creates ridge from the resistance if theres been too much inflow ridge may be formed from notised outpushes newtons second law is thus the reason for solidification of flows the facsimiles of back pushes are neglected therefore they stick the stuck flow is reacted to with unconsciousness which is dopeoff if you have someone run flow in one direction in mockup he can either get field in front of his face going black or an avalanche will be triggered where all the things come at him at once or reverse flow avalanche an avalanche of resistance an inversion flow too long in one direction produces reverse flow not just stuck flow this reverse flow is 1 not asised because not noticed 2 resisted then you get flow in the original direction but on an inversion on running ow we can only do this when the pc is below the ability to tolerate change ow is reach and withdraw but only from one terminal and it doesnt account for all the possible motions as long as the individual is below change ow only runs well on f2 see ow limited theory hcob 5jan61 ow is 100 effective below change but not effective above it cf the later order of the grades below the level of tolerating change the individuals inflow and outflow get locked up and change produces ridges on various flow lines therefore the person is individuated cant change his viewpoint resisting change he gets left on some individuated point of the bracket eg he has stuck outflow so he cant relate to people if he was so bad off as to be psycho hed maybe get upset with flow three and maybe get up to obsessive cause if one is fluid on change and doesnt resist it he wont resist the flows and therefore he wont create the ridge when he sets up newtons second law of motion he knows therell be consequence of every thing he does so he knows better than to cause or experience much the consequences of change is change when he cant stand change hell go into ow thats why running brackets is safety factor when ridge is set up it has to be taken apart on both sides alternately if person goes unconscious on running bracket it may be that one flow is overloaded or maybe he isnt really doing one leg of the bracket so you have to check and see about that by asking once on each leg did you answer that to your satisfaction the flow three on brackets is to handle his dispersal in connection with stuck flows the concept of god is interesting what kind of shape would you think god would be in if hed just been creating things and causing everything you could never reach him or say anything to him what kind of duress must he be under to propitiate to us all that much he must be quite spun in anyone whos on such an obsessive cause must be practically nuts we should have society for the resurrection of god he ploughed himself in for us so we should help him out the prehav scale is reactive bank scale when person is eventually able to have he doesnt have to have bank so the bank disappears at the point of have the bank wouldnt be there to measure on an analytical scale the best description of the analytical have scale would be axioms one and two all other truths are the result of postulates agreements and considerations so the scale would depend on what bunch of thetans agreed on it could change the prehav scale is fixed nowimsupposedto this is it why were here scale its the order of the value of postulates that are fixed and not changeable in the absence of scientology at some time early on the time track this scale must have been dreamed up recovering it is quite trick all levels may not be there also some levels repeat in changed wording and there are harmonics
