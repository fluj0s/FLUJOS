1092 amending title 28 of the us code the act extends the reach of federal diversity jurisdiction ove r state law class actions congress wanted to correct provision in federal jurisdiction law that prevented many class actions that were national in scope from being litigated in federal courts by making it more difficult for plaintiffs counsel to def eat diversity jurisdiction second cafa imposes new requirements on the settlement of class actions cafa applies to class actions commenced on or after the date of enactment much of the early cafa case law has held that actions are commenced when filed rather than when removed the courts agree that the simple addition of new members to the class or change in class representative is insufficient the courts are divided over whether the inclusion of additional defendants will satisfy the requirements for cafa coverage the seventh circuit in schorsch v hewlett packard co 417 f3d 748 751 7th cir 2005 and the tenth circuit in pritchett v office

field code32 in order to successfully pl ead and prosecute class actions in accordance with the field code it required that numerous parties demonstrate common interest in law and fact33 before cafa was enacted title 28 s ection 1332 of the us code provided that in cases when at least one plaintiff and one defendant both had citizenship ties in the same state the case would remain in state court this was referred to as the complete diversity requireme nt whereby counselors for the plaintiffs would join nondiverse defendants in order to defeat removal to federal court the class action fairness act amends t itle 28 of the us code and makes substantial changes in two areas where c ongress perceived abuses to be occurring first the act extends the reach of federal diversity jurisdiction over state law class actions34 congress wanted to correct provi sion in federal jurisdiction law that prevented many class actions that were national in scope from being litigated in federal courts by making it more difficult for plainti ffs counsel to game the systemin an effort to feat diversity jurisdiction35 second the act imposes new requirements on the settlement of class actions to prevent some perceived abuses it was observed that plainti ffs counsel at times recovere d large fees in settlements however the class members received awards of little or value such as coupons for the purchase of additiona l products from the defendant36 the act requires that judicial scrutiny be increased for settleme nts involving coupons which constitute allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33507crs5 37

notified of proposed class ac tion settlements and be given an opportunity to object to them38 what is class action the basic definition for the term class action for purposes of original and removal jurisdiction is any civil action file d in district court of the united states under rule 23 of the federal rules of ci vil procedure or any civil action that is removed to district court of the united st ates that was originally filed under state statute or rule of judicial procedure authorizing an action to be brought by 1 or more representatives as class action39 cafa provides that mass action shall also be deemed to be class action40 and the term mass action is c onsidered any civil action other than class action in which mone tary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law and fact except that jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements 5000000 under subsection a41 the senate report states that subsection 1332d11bi includes st atement indicating that jurisdiction exists only over those plaintiffs whos claims in mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements unde r section 1332a the committee notes that the intent of this proviso is as fo llows if mass action satisfies the criteria set forth in the section that is it involves the monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons that are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the claims involve common questions of law or fact and it meets the tests for federal diversity jurisdiction otherwise established by the legislation it may be removed to federal court which is authorized to exercise jurisdiction over the action under the proviso however it is the committ ees intent that any claims that are included in the mass action that sta nding alone do not do not satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements of section 1332a currently 75000 would be remanded to state court subs equent remands of individual claims not meeting the section 1332 jurisdictional amount requirement may take the action below the 100plaintiff jurisdictional threshold or the 5 million aggregated jurisdictional amount requirement howeve r so long as the mass action met the various jurisdictional requirements at the time of removal it is the committees view that those subsequent remands should not extinguish federal diversity jurisdiction over the action httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33507crs6 42 s rept10914 at 4647 2005 43

disguise they involve lot of people who want th eir claims adjudicated together and they often result in the same abuses as class actions42 other significant limitations or restrictions regarding federal jurisdiction over mass actions are 1 the statute would not permit jurisdiction over mass actions involving an event or occurrence that took pl ace within the state and is considered truly local single event with substantial interstate effects43 2 there would be jurisdiction over mass actions if the claims for joinder are the results of defendants motion thus fendant would not be able to get individual claims filed against it in state court and then moved into federal court by having the state court consolidate them and subsequently removing the case as mass action44 3 mass action would not include privat attorney general actions or claims asserted on behalf of the general public and not on beha lf of individual claimants or members of purported class pursuant to state statute specifically authorizing such action45 and 4 mass actions would not include claims that are consolidated or coordinated solely for pretrial purposes46 cafas provisions effective date cafa does not apply retroactively47 section 9 of cafa provides that the amendments made by this act shall apply to any civil action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this act48 the date of enactment of cafa is february 18 2005 and thus according to judicial interpre tations cafa applies to any civil action commenced on or after that date and does not apply to actions already pending in state courts on that date unless there is postcafa development that constitutes recommencement circuit courts of appeal s have uniformly held that state court action is commenced on the date that the plaintiff originated the action in state court and not the date when the defe ndant removes it for example in pritchett v office depot inc 49 the issue one of first impression was whether the removal provisions of cafa apply to pending state court cases that were removed after the effective date of the act in pritchett class action was filed on april 2 2003 in colorado state court on behalf of cla ss

removed the case to federal court the plaintiff m oved to remand arguing that cafa did not apply to pending actions the district court agreed and remanded the case on appeal the defendant argued that the case was commenced within the meaning of cafa 9 on the date it was removed not the date it was first filed in state court the us court of appeals for the tent h circuit disagreed after noting that removal of an action is not traditionally viewed as recommencement of the case it relied on the principle that statutes confe rring jurisdiction on th federal courts are to be construed narrowly and any ambiguity is to be resolved against the exercise of jurisdiction50 the tenth circuit also reviewed ca fas legislative history it noted that an earlier version of cafa woul d have applied cafa not only to cases commenced after its effective date but also to cases in which the classcertification order was issued after the effective date this provision was deleted from the final bill this change the court said s ignaled an intent to narrow the removal provisions of cafa to exclude currently pending suits51 the court also looked to public policy it said the defendant s interpretation of cafa would allow cases to be plucked from st ate court on the eve of trial such practices are disruptive to federalstate co mity and the settled expectations of the litigants permitting removal of this case would effectively apply new rules to game in the final minutes of the last quarter and we find it ironic that defendant seeks countenance for its position from statute that was designed in the first place to curtail jurisdictional gaming and forumshopping52 similar interpretation may be gleaned from other cases involving class actions where the courts have held an action is commenced for purposes of the act when it is first filed in state court not when it is removed to federal court53 although an action does not commence w ith the occurrence of certain events such as filing notice of removal some c ourts have recognized that while routine amendment of complaint may not render state court action subject to cafa the addition of new claim or new defendant may leading case on point is

of cafa federal courts are faced with new issues one such issue is that of determining w ho has the burden of pr oof in demonstrating whether an interstate class action qualifies for removal from state court to federal court and thereafter who bears the burden with respect to state court cafas legislative history suggests that the burden is placed on the remanding party and the party seeking remand conseque ntly will be required to di sprove either the amount in controversy or minimal divers ity or affirmatively demonstrate that an exception to cafa applies the courts appear to be split on this issue although the trend seems to favor imposing the burden upon the moving party that is the party seeking to remove class action case fro m state court to federal court under cafa ordinarily the defendant bears the initial burden81 and thereafter the burden falls to the party seeking remand back to state court under the cafa exception ordinarily the plaintiff82 amount in controversy nd

complete diversity rule and the amount incontroversy requirement in preparation for class action th complete diversity requirement as enacted and refined in judicial decisions was that all named class representatives and all defendants had to be citizens of different states if any named plaintiff and any named defendant were fro m the same state the acti on could not be filed in or removed to federal court83 regarding the amountincontroversy requirement in most cases the claims of class members could not be aggregated to satisfy the 75000 jurisdictional amount in diversity cases84 therefore at least one class member was required to ve claim for more than 75000 however according to the supreme court decision in zahn v international paper co 85 all class members had to have claims exceeding 7500086 with the enactment of cafa changes were made in these requirements cafa amended the diversity statute 28 usc 1332 and the removal provisions 28 usc 1441 et seq to provide for federal jurisd iction at the election of either the plaintiff or the defendant over class actions that do not satisfy the traditional complete diversity and amount incontroversy requireme nts the
