ambassador john f tefft for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary in damning indictment of prime minster yuliya tymoshenko and her lack of leadership respected xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that tymoshenko would continue to work against reform to limit her destructiveness xxxxxxxxxxxx argued for early parliamentary elections which would help strengthen new leaders such as tihipko and yatsenyuk he also expressed hope that the international monetary fund imf would strictly hold ukraine to its commitments to implement reform xxxxxxxxxxxx appeared to deliver his message not in anger but in sincere sorrow for the country and frustration at his inability to convince tymoshenko to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the economic crisis for reform instead xxxxxxxxxxxx said tymoshenko wasted the opportunity in favor of populism and simple desire for allembracing power end summary tymoshenko powerhungry populist 2 c during meeting with the ambassador on xxxxxxxxxxxx accused prime minister tymoshenko of wasting the opportunity for reform that came with the economic crisis he believed that tymoshenko would continue to work against reform and that her argument would be that she and her government were able to make all domestic and international payments during the crisis without implementing what would amount to painful reforms for the public in this sense xxxxxxxxxxxx said the imf program had actually harmed ukraine neither the ukrainian government nor the public suffered terribly from the crisis thanks to imf money as result support for change that would pull the economy out of crisis evaporated 3 c xxxxxxxxxxxx said that it was an easy decision for tymoshenko to do nothing to reform the economy he was critical of her leadership skills and said that she made policy decisions without listening to considered advice he found it difficult to understand tymoshenkos logic most of the time except in the sense that her decisions were normally guided by adventurous populism8 she also was overly confident in her own decisions and believed everyone else is wrong xxxxxxxxxxxx concluded that tymoshenko simply wanted to consolidate power in her own hands in her eyes populism helped her do this reform would notxxxxxxxxxxxx own frustration with his inability to influence policy xxxxxxxxxxxx preterm parliamentary elections best for country 4 c xxxxxxxxxxxx was certain that tymoshenko would continue to act as destructive force in hardcore8 opposition to yanukovych as result he argued that preterm parliamentary elections would be best for the country he assumed byut and our ukraine would lose seats in parliament with preterm election it would also allow new voices such as serhiy tihipko and arseniy yatsenyuk to gain stronger position xxxxxxxxxxxx thought that the voters in the presidential election had shown that they wanted new leaders to come to power 5 c although elections would delay reform for few more months xxxxxxxxxxxx thought new parliament would be more likely to implement reform he understood that this could delay the return of the imf to ukraine but xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that the country could get through the next six months on its reserves particularly if new budget were adopted the lack of budget limited the governments ability to spend he said in fact xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that pushing the country into deeper crisis could actually be benefit because voters and the leaders would feel the need for change more acutely kyiv 00000278 002 of 003 xxxxxxxxxxxx prescription for reform 6 c xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that in the 1990s and in 2000 when the economy was truly in crisis ukraine had made some positive changes that led to growth ukraine again had unique opportunity to reform the structure of the government itself to tackle corruption and to implement economic reform that would put the country back on the path to growth he agreed with the conditions contained in the imf package for ukraine including gas price increases and pension reform but said that the imf should be stricter in forcing adherence xxxxxxxxxxxx passed the ambassador two documents xxxxxxxxxxxx outlining his reform priorities the papers are copied below paras 8 and 9 comment 7 c xxxxxxxxxxxx appeared to deliver his message not in anger but in sorrow for the country and in frustration at his inability to convince tymoshenko to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the economic crisis for reform his indictment of tymoshenko was particularly damning xxxxxxxxxxxx one of the few we have found in highlevels of government in ukraine it is unfortunate that tymoshenkos unwillingness to make the hard decisions has cost the country dearly not only in terms of larger deficits greater public debt and declining gdp but also in that she has driven out intelligent xxxxxxxxxxxx preventative measures 8 u unofficial translation of xxxxxxxxxxxx ten preventative measures for ukraine government reform functional
