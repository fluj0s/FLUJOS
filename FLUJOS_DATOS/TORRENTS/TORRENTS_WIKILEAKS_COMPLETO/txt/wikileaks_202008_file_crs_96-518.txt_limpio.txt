findings of seminar june 6 1996 robert g sutter senior specialist in international politics with the assistance of peter mitchener foreign affairs and national defense division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report summarizes the findings of may 1996 crs seminar that examined challenges posed for us policy by the rising wealth and power of china and alternative us strategies to deal with chinas rising power clinton administration representative and four non government experts discussed these subjects together with other seminar participants they reached general consensus on recommendations favoring balanced us policy of positive and negative incentives geared toward prolonged interaction with rising chinese power in the context of careful us leadership attention to nurturing the relative power and influence of the united states in asian and world affairs this report will not be updated chinas rising power alternative us national security strategies findings of seminar summary although recent development of chinas wealth and power poses opportunities as well as challenges for us policy participants at crs seminar on dealing with chinas rise focused on the challenges china was seen as very large strategically located country undergoing rapid economic growth and social change and ruled by authoritarian political leaders since the maoist era china has made great strides in conforming to many international norms but combination of rising chinese power and nationalistic assertiveness has posed serious problems for us security interests in asia us efforts to curb trafficking in technology for weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons us support for smooth running market based international economic systems and us backing of other international norms regarding human rights environmental protection and other issues seminar participants judged that historical experience suggests that the united states will be unable to reach any grand bargain or lasting solution to the china challenges rather us leaders will need to devote continuous highlevel policy attention issue by issue case by case in order both to deter chinese assertiveness and to encourage chinese accommodation to prevailing international practice in so doing the us would be ill served to rely solely on policies designed to moderate chinese assertiveness through accommodation and greater integration in world affairs although many are hopeful about the positive changes that could come from chinas economic modernization and social change positive changes could be long in coming as result seminar participants urged us policymakers to establish us national goals visavis china and clearly defined negative and positive incentives that would prompt prc behavior more compatible with us interests at the same time us policy of containment against china was seen as both premature and unworkable an effective us strategy toward china needed to be seen in the context of broader us strategy in asia one seen to include strong us military economic and political presence and requiring some degree of cooperation from important us allies and friends in the region recommendations for us policy focused on establishing clear set of priorities that take account of us interests along with chinese concerns and those of us allies associates and other interested third parties especially in asia to formulate these policy priorities and to help to insure that they are met requires careful and consistent highlevel us policy attention including regular usprc summit meetings the fact that such meetings give considerable prestige to prc leaders seen as illegitimate by many americans posed perhaps an immediate dilemma for sustained us

first presidential election on march 23 1996 headed the list of beijings deviations from usbacked international norms in early 1996 other contentious issues included the estimated 2 billion in annual losses us firms suffer as result of chinas continued and growing violations of us intellectual property rights despite past chinese government agreement to halt such violations chinas reported continued close cooperation in pakistans widely noted effort to build nuclear weapons capability reports of chinas sale of advanced surfacetosurface missiles and related technology to such troubled areas as iran and pakistan and beijings hardline stance toward any signs of political dissent or advocacy of greater human rights in china1 against the backdrop of deluge of media and congressional criticism of chinas actions and the clinton administrations avowed policy of comprehensive engagement with the peoples republic of china prc the administration toughened the us posture toward china specific steps included deploying two us carrier battle groups to the taiwan area during the prc military exercises in the region in march 1996 postponement of the planned visit of chinas defense minister to the united states temporary suspension on approval of us exportimport bank financing for new us projects in china pending thorough review of us options to deal with reported chinese exports of nuclear weapons technology and other measures the administration endeavored to underline its dissatisfaction with recent chinese behavior while trying to find common ground to sustain longer term engagement with china through series of recent or anticipated discussions with senior prc leaders notably president clinton reportedly sent letter to chinas leaders with newly appointed us ambassador james sasser requesting such dialogue the chinese responded in part by sending in march 1996 the prc state councils senior foreign policy official to the united states for extensive discussion with executive branch and congressional leaders2 congressional opinion was not assuaged by the administrations actions and congress sought additional measures to reinforce the us posture against chinas infractions of international norms the house and senate passed separate non binding resolutions expressing support for taiwan in the face of prc intimidation 1 for background see kerry dumbaugh chinaus relations crs issue brief 94002 2 interviews with prc embassy and us government officials march 1996 crs2 many members strongly concerned with chinese infractions on nuclear and missile proliferation and on important trade issues like intellectual property rights were adamant in hearings public statements and private communications with the administration that more needed to be done in order to end beijings egregious violations of accepted world norms for example the house committee on national security along with the senate foreign relations committee held extensive hearings on chinas military and national security challenges to us interests the house and the senate also passed the 19961997 state department authorization bill hr 1561 that contained over one dozen provisions targeted directly or indirectly on strengthening us opposition to prc government practices on issues ranging from taiwan to tibet and from human rights to world trade organization wto membership president clinton vetoed hr 1561 and the veto was sustained by the house on april 30 1996 after reaching an understanding with chinese officials on reported chinese exports of nuclear weapons related technology to pakistan the president in may 1996 lifted the suspension of us export import bank financing but he also began formal procedures threatening over 2 billion in trade sanctions unless china took further measures to curb intellectual property rights violations deadline of june 17 was set on may 20 1996 the president announced that he would grant on june 3 the annual waiver that allows chinese imports mostfavorednation mfn tariff treatment by the united states setting the stage for the annual congressional debate on the pros and cons of the move and on the broader direction of us relations with china senate majority leader and republican presidential candidate bob dole added to the debate with speech on may 9 that was sharply critical of the clinton administrations vacillation on china policy though also supportive of continued mfn for beijing in this context the congressional research service at the request of the house national security committee and with the support of the national committee on uschina relations conducted seminar on may 13 1996 the topic was dealing with china alternative us national security strategies clinton administration representative and four nongovernment experts offered diverse perspectives as to the challenges posed for the united states by chinas rising power and influence in world affairs and made recommendations for us policy the speakers and others who addressed the seminar gave their personal views under ground rules that their remarks would not be for personal attribution the views expressed were those of the individual participants not the sponsors the speakers at the seminar were kurt campbell dept of defense douglas paal asia pacific policy center jonathan pollack rand corp ezra vogel harvard university arthur waldron naval war college the challenge of china in the period immediately following the june 1989 tiananmen incident and subsequent collapse of communist regimes in europe and elsewhere many journalists analysts and other observers outside china judged that the communist crs3 regime in china was destined for collapse3 observers also sometimes warned of major retrogression in chinese economic reforms speculating that beijing would feel compelled in the face of domestic and foreign pressure to revert to autarchic development policies of the maoist past these would reduce chinese interdependence with other countries and substantially reduce chinas incentive to avoid disruptive behavior in interaction with its neighbors and other world powers on balance chinas record in recent years has undercut the predictions of collapse or retrogression the regime in beijing has presided over period of unprecedented growth in the chinese economy this growth has not only benefitted many in china but has come at time of lackluster growth in most other parts of the world the result has been period of unprecedented international investment in and interaction with the chinese economy when combined with beijings selectively accommodating posture in world affairs in recent years the result has been to erode foreign sanctions and to enhance the international legitimacy of the chinese leaders nevertheless analysis of key determinants of chinas future shows wide range of possible outcomes for china over the next few years in particular good deal of the success of beijings efforts in recent years is attributed to the leadership of senior leader deng xiaoping dengs anticipated early demise means that vacuum at the center of political power in china could lead to political struggles with possibly adverse outcomes for the country the leadership transition is likely to complicate an already difficult set of problems of governance caused by dynamic economic growth rapid social change realignment of central and local power arrangements and other factors also seen as complicating chinas future is the rise of the chinese militarys influence on sensitive policy issues including foreign policy and the increasingly nationalistic tendency among chinese leaders and people alike which seems to reduce chinese flexibility in dealing with the united states and much of the outside world positive scenario for chinas future posits an effective administration and some political reform along with powerful economic modernization alternative outcomes are of two kinds one sees series of developments including political changes leading to degeneration of government effectiveness and authority with range of negative effects on chinas economic and social development another sees china developing formidable economic power while retaining strong authoritarian political control this raises the possibility of an emerging chinese economic and military superpower less interested in accommodation with the outside world and unfettered by the political checks and balances that accompany less authoritarian political structures it is the latter scenario that has received considerable attention in hearings and is the cause of particular concern on capitol hill recent developments in china pose economic cultural and other opportunities and the prospect of cooperation on global and regional issues as well as challenges for the united states the seminar participants like much recent us government media and popular opinion focused on the challenges to us policy china is seen as very large strategically located country undergoing rapid economic growth and 3 see china and congress in 1992 kerry dumbaugh crs report 93894f october 12 1993 crs4 social change and ruled by an authoritarian political leadership strongly supported by conservative political military and other constituencies in china chinese leaders are seen as determined to maintain their political power while pursuing strongly nationalistic ideology emphasizing chinas desire for greater international respect and recognition of chinas territorial claims and aspirations for leadership in asia and world affairs chinese leaders strive to make china great power with broad international influence chinese capabilities to achieve great power remain limited in certain areas because of such factors as continued widespread poverty population pressure and limited capability for military power projection chinas uncertain leadership transition is also seen as source of potential weakness as are the difficulties the authoritarian political leaders in beijing are seen to face in trying to manage chinas rapid uneven economic and social changes on balance the participants at the seminar saw problems for us policy focused heavily on china itself and nearby parts of asia although china is also seen to pose difficulties in other areas of us policy concern the difficulties posed by chinas search for wealth and power prompted one participant at the seminar to recall the many positive features for us interests in chinas approach to world affairs since the death of mao zedong 20 years ago chinese international policy changed markedly during the maoist period 1949 1976 it moved from reliance on the ussr and strident opposition to the united states to posture of strong opposition to both the us and the ussr finally their approach relied strategically on reconciliation with the united states to deal with the danger posed by the soviet threat these shifts were often accompanied by hostile and militant actions fundamentally threatening peace and stability in asia and the broader international order after mao died chinese leaders emphasized domestic policies of development that required markedly increased economic contacts abroad these policies comported with beijings desire to sustain good relations with the west and avoid disruptions around the periphery of china that would complicate the chinese drive toward modernization4 on specific issues in foreign affairs chinese leaders generally adhered to the logic underlying the pragmatic trend in chinese foreign policy seen in the postmao period postmao chinese communist leaders need to foster better economic life for the people of china in order to legitimize and justify their continued monopoly of political power these leaders cannot rely as mao did on enormous personal prestige as successful revolutionary or on the appeal of communist ideology they have little of maos prestige and the appeal of communist ideology is fading china depends critically on foreign trade and related foreign investment and assistance for its economic development 4 see among others china in world affairs by robert sutter crs report 95265s january 31 1995 19 p crs5 china depends particularly heavily on its neighbors for aid investment and trade benefits and on the united states to absorb its exports therefore to buttress their political survival postmao leaders emphasize their concern with maintaining peaceful international environment which assures continued trade investment and assistance flows so important to chinese economic well being chinese leaders put aside past ideas of autarchy and selfreliance and allowed the chinese economy to become increasingly integrated into the world economy they sought to avoid dependence on any one power by encouraging broad competition beijing made efforts to meet the requirements of the united states and others regarding market access intellectual property rights and other economic issues and strove to become member of the gatt and founding member of the world trade organization wto chinese leaders duly accepted commitments and responsibilities stemming from their participation with such international economic organizations as the world bank the asian development bank and the asian pacific economic cooperation apec forum chinese leaders remained sensitive on issues of national sovereignty and were less accommodating on international security issues they did adjust to world pressure when resistance appeared detrimental to broader chinese concerns examples included chinese cooperation with the international peace settlement in cambodia in 1991 beijings willingness to join the nonproliferation treaty and to consider halting nuclear tests by the end of 1996 under an international agreement banning nuclear tests chinas reported willingness to abide by terms of the missile technology control regime mtcr and the chinese leaders reportedly helpful efforts to assist the united states in reaching an agreement with north korea in october 1994 over the latters nuclear weapons program beijing also selectively sought to meet international expectations on other transnational issues like policing drug traffic curbing international terrorism and working to avoid further degradation of the worlds environment as was noted in the seminar it is easy to exaggerate the degree of chinese accommodation to international concerns beijings continued hard line against outside criticism of chinese political authoritarianism and poor human rights record graphically illustrates the limits of chinese accommodation continued chinese transfer of sensitive military technology or dual use equipment to pakistan iran and other potential flash points is widely criticized in the united states and elsewhere and the chinese political and military leaders are not reluctant to use rhetorical threats or demonstrations of military force in order to intimidate and deter those in sensitive areas like taiwan the south china sea and hong kong who are seen by beijing as confronting its traditional territorial or nationalistic claims these and other assertive chinese actions may reflect changing chinese international calculus increasingly chinese leaders are seen as more confident in their international position of greater wealth and military power the power vacuum in asia caused by the collapse of the ussr combines with strong chinese nationalistic ambitions to fuel perceived prc tendency to assert its interests in the face of opposition from the united states and others crs6 in short beijing has been widely seen as accommodating pragmatically to many international norms not because such accommodation is seen as inherently in chinas interest rather beijing is said to view each issue on casebycase basis calculating the costs and benefits of adherence to international norms in each case5 underlying the casebycase approach is rising sense of nationalism among chinese leaders viewing the world as highly competitive state centered system chinese leaders remain deeply suspicious of multilateralism and interdependence rather they tend to see the world in more traditional balanceofpower terms and therefore argue that the current world trend is more multipolar ie number of competing nation states than multilateral system where nation states sacrifice some of their independence and freedom of maneuver for the expected benefits of an interdependent international order governed by law chinese suspicions of many multilateral efforts focus on the central role of the united states and the other developed countries these nations are setting the agenda of most such multilateral regimes they are accused of doing so to serve their own particular national interests and to give short shrift to the interests and concerns of newly emerging powers like china as result many leaders in china see us and other efforts to encourage or press china to conform to multilateral standards on international security human rights and economic policies and practices as motivated by the established powers fear of chinas rise their unwillingness to share power fairly with china and their desire to hold down china to keep it weak and fragmented for as long as possible in short chinese leaders are often predisposed to oppose the international status quo supported by the united states this mix of accommodation and assertiveness has combined with chinas obviously growing power and importance to lead to number of specific conflicts with united states foreign policy and security interests6 chinas military power there appears to be general agreement among specialists that china at present does not pose major direct military threat to the united states its military economic and other capabilities are seen as too limited to pose such danger in the near future 510 years us and foreign analysts see potential for china to challenge and threaten the united states over the longer term 5 for example beijing saw by 1991 that maintaining its past support for the khmer rouge in cambodia would be counterproductive regarding chinas broader interests in achieving favorable peace settlement in cambodia and solidifying closer relations with the association of southeast asian nations asean countries japan and the west all of whom saw continued chinese aid as serious obstacle to peace by the same token the usled international moratorium on nuclear testing had reached point in 1994 that beijing had to announce its decision to consider halting nuclear testing by the end of 1996 and join comprehensive nuclear test ban or risk major friction in its relations with the us japan western europe and russia 6 see among others chinas rising military power and influence by robert sutter crs report 9666f january 16 1996 see also council on foreign relations publications redressing the balance american engagement in asia 1996 and weaving the net conditional engagement with china 1996 crs7 20plus years of the nations of the world in their view china is among the very few that have the mix of economic political human resource and military factors that could produce the emergence of superpower capable of directly challenging the united states in the first half of the 21st century chinas rapid economic growth in recent years has been accompanied by steady increase in military spending reflecting in part the influence of the chinese military on budget and policy issues the overall impact of chinas military buildup on justified us policy concerns remains subject of debate among us specialists in the interim the main danger to us positions coming from china bears on us interests in preserving and strengthening the peace and stability of the asian pacific region there is considerable debate among specialists as to whether or not china is likely to embark on an expansionist or more assertive course disruptive to stability in the area b china as proliferator of weapons of mass destruction manufacturing technology for such weapons and related delivery systems chinese military strategy against both the united states and the soviet union focused during much of the maoist period 19491976 on developing reliable hardtolocate weapon systems of mass destruction ie nuclear missiles and bombs these weapons gave chinese leaders the option of second strike against stronger adversary and thus were seen to deter feared preemptive nuclear attack especially from the ussr for many years china shared such technology with select group of countries notably pakistan whose defense had direct bearing on chinas own national security at the same time china has long record of selling materials technology and related expertise in these sensitive areas for profit in the past us and other westernaligned international observers tended to play down the consequences of these chinese actions they appeared more interested in sustaining broadly cooperative relationship with beijing in the cold war competition with the soviet union us views changed markedly in the post cold war environment this occurred especially after the 19911992 usled allied confrontation with iraq which was developing mass destruction weapons in order to dominate regional adversaries and world oil supplies fearful of having to confront authoritarian expansionist leaders armed with nuclear or other mass destruction weapons and related delivery systems us officials now saw chinas proliferation practices as major threat to us interests american officials have had some success in recent years in leading international efforts to press china to adhere to international control regimes regarding nuclear weapons and related missile delivery systems in this effort they have used leverage provided by chinas dependence on trade and other relations with the us and other developed countries concerned with proliferation c chinas economic rise the strength size and vibrancy of the chinese economy has attracted positive international attention but also has caused considerable uneasiness among chinas major trading partners although chinas economy was large though qualitatively weak and grew rapidly in the maoist period the regimes self reliant development strategy meant that chinese interaction with the world economy was limited and the consequences of developments in china for other nations were generally limited crs8 the postmao economic reforms have changed that situation the chinese economy is larger than ever and is growing at rate surpassing that of the maoist period and mirroring the rapid rise that some other asian countries experienced during periods of economic take off in the latter 20th century at the same time the chinese open door policies have put aside maoist autarchy in favor of integrating the chinese economy with the growing economies of asia and the world in the past 10 years chinese foreign trade and foreign investment in china have grown at rates far surpassing chinas overall economic growth rate the chinese economy today statistically depends more on foreign trade than do the economies of other large countries like russia india and brazil and that dependency even surpasses that of japan china is now among the top 15 world traders and rising fast much of this trade stems from investment from inside china and from abroad in manufacturing industries designed to produce goods for export to considerable degree china has become manufacturing platform for exports to many countries of the world with investment from hong kong and taiwan being the major impetus behind this development7 analysts in asia and the west sometimes see chinas economic power and potential as current or prospective threat to asian stability or the stability of international commerce in certain commodities on the one hand chinese leaders may choose to use this rapid economic growth to support military modernization and more assertive policy toward chinas neighbors on the other hand chinese enterprises may choose to direct their sometimes statesupported manufacturing capabilities to world markets sensitive to the rest of asia and the west in this view the size scope and capabilities of the chinese economy when combined with the fact that the economic system in china remains subject to state control and direction in several important respects means that china is seen as having great ability to surge this involves targeting production in certain areas dominating markets and causing major disruption and dislocation for trading partners and competitors of course the larger and more resilient world economies eg the united states japan doubtless are better able to adjust to chinese growth but others eg taiwan may find themselves more vulnerable to directed or predatory chinese economic initiative another challenge relates to the ability of chinese authorities to divert foreign supplied technology from civilian to military use reports of such alleged diversions have led to investigations in congress over the past year d chinas challenge to other postcold war values beijings determined effort to sustain its authoritarian political regime is seen to defy us backed efforts accentuated in the postcold war period supporting greater pluralism human rights and democracy chinas economic development could also come at the expense of its environment which given the size of china is sure to have major impact on international efforts to curb suspected global warning among other environmental concerns as noted above it is unclear whether the rise of chinas wealth and power 7 see central intelligence agency chinas economy in 1994 and 1995 december 1995 crs9 will prompt beijing leaders to be more or less accommodating to these widely shared values backed by the united states the problem of weakened china although the potential problems and dangers noted above stem from the growth of chinas wealth and power analysts at the seminar and elsewhere have been careful to point to the dangers to asian and international stability that could result from markedly weakened china the concern focuses on possible breakdown in government authority in china such as was seen in number of communist countries in recent years the size and scope of problems in china suggest that such breakdown could be accompanied by large scale economic dislocation armed conflict and massive outflows of migrants for the crowded and often strongly homogeneous countries along chinas eastern rim and for the sparsely populated and poorly controlled countries to chinas north and west such outflows of migrants would pose national security threat of the first order findings and recommendations the presentations and discussions at the seminar offered somber picture for the united states as it faces the wide range of existing and potential challenges posed by chinas rising power in the years ahead there was general agreement that the united states needed to clarify us goals visavis china and find practical ways both to engage china more fully in the current world system while deterring chinese behavior adverse to us interests policies of accommodation of china on the one hand or strict constraints of china on the other were deemed to be inappropriate or unworkable the panelists were in general agreement that the us strategy toward china should be seen in the context of broader us strategy in asia one requiring strong us military economic and political presence and also requiring significant cooperation from important us allies and friends in the region recommendations for us policy focused on establishing clearer set of us priorities that take account of us interests along with chinese concerns and those of interested third parties especially in asia to formulate these policy priorities and to help to insure that they are implemented requires careful and consistent high level us policy attention including regular usprc summit meetings it was acknowledged that such meetings and the prestige they give to prc leaders seen as illegitimate by many americans posed difficult problem for us policy as it endeavors to deal effectively with the rise of china crs10 lessons of history china shows strong signs of emerging as the most important new world power in the early 21st century in modern history most instances of such rising powers have been accompanied by severe strains on the prevailing international system often resulting in conflict the size and importance of china and its large influence on the strategically and economically important rimlands of the pacific basin prompted seminar participants repeatedly to emphasize the need for consistent and close us policy attention to china for years to come given the wide differences in us and chinese leaders values and world views along with the relatively immature security political and economic frameworks for the postcold war situation in asia specialists warned the us not to expect any grand bargain regarding the future of the region and of chinas role in it to be reached in the foreseeable future more likely in their view was future characterized by the need for persistent us efforts dealing casebycase with issues as they arise and striving both to encourage china to engage more fully with and conform to the norms of the international system and to deter china from taking action detrimental to accepted world norms limits of engagement and containment some seminar participants were hopeful that greater us and other international engagement with china along with continued rapid economic and social change in china would lead to changes prompting chinese leaders to conform more fully to international norms growing economic interdependence presumably would reduce chinas incentive to challenge the interests of its important economic partners while internal pressures stemming from modernization would presumably reduce the ability of the authoritarian regime to exert power in ways contrary to the interests of the chinese people nevertheless it was duly acknowledged that the positive fruits of such development process are not certain and could be long in coming this is seen as especially relevant given the evident determination of chinas current leaders to sustain political authoritarianism and the slow and mixed record of such peaceful evolution in other parts of asia as result us policymakers were urged by some participants to establish some clearly defined positive and negative incentives that would both prompt chinese leaders to conform more to international norms backed by the united states and deter them from taking actions disruptive of such norms specific recommendations are discussed below on the other hand policy of us containment of china was deemed unneeded and currently unworkable for one thing because of its economic strength china is in far different position than the ussr or maoist china when they were targets of us containment strategies during the cold war in one sense it was argued it is already too late for the us to consider containing china as the prc in the past two decades has so broadened its economic and related political connections abroad as to make policy of trying to isolate china unworkable at the same time it was argued the challenges currently posed by china cannot be compared to the fundamental antagonism to the us of the ussr or of maoist china crs11 during much of the cold war as noted above some participants thought that chinas record in world affairs shows increasing willingness to conform to us backed norms while some chinese doubtless harbor antagonistic intentions toward the united states their freedom of action is constrained for now by realities of power and by the practical considerations of beijings search for greater wealth and power at the same time rising wealth and power prevailing nationalistic sentiment leadership uncertainty giving greater influence to military and other conservative leaders and other trends could prompt more assertive and disruptive chinese foreign policy behavior at this time it remains unclear whether beijing will in the future follow path of confrontation or greater accommodation with world norms seminar participants judged that the united states should wait to see which path is chosen and try positively to influence the choice before the us itself chooses path of containment and confrontation us effort to pursue containment policy under current circumstances would likely get little support from allies and associates in asia who are wary of china and uncertain about beijings future policy directions but who see little justification for such hard us response and in any event have to live in close proximity to the prc seeing china in asia seminar participants were in agreement that an effective us policy toward china needs to be placed in the context of broader us policy toward east asia whatever strategy the united states adopts to deal with china needs to be compatible with broader us efforts to protect and foster american interests in the postcold war situation in east asia from the point of view of us national security policy the latter effort involves several major components in addition to dealing with china us efforts to revitalize security alliances with regional allies the administration has already capped recent effort to strengthen alliance relations with japan during president clintons visit to tokyo in april 1996 us efforts to build support at home and abroad for the us forward deployed forces in east asia despite us government spending cutbacks the pentagon has been able to sustain support for around 100000 us forward deployed forces us domestic backing for this effort is enhanced by the willingness of allies and associates to publicly support the us presence and to bear some of the financial and other burdens associated with it although japan and to much smaller degree korea bear financial costs associated with the us presence many asian governments are reluctant to stand up and be counted in support of the us military presence even though they privately support it in strong terms such public ambivalence makes it difficult for us defense leaders to make strong case that the american military presence is an asset rather than liability in us efforts to benefit us interests in east asia us efforts to strengthen still weak multilateral efforts to promote more secure environment in asia some seminar participants stated that existing crs12 multilateral security efforts in the region like the asean regional forum arf were weak but they expressed desire to use at least some multilateral efforts to sustain us security interests in the region as the united states seeks both to deter and engage china seminar participants emphasized the need for the united states to build coalitions centered among asian allies and associates such coalitions were seen as difficult to form and use but important in making sure that chinas leaders did not outflank or isolate us efforts to press china for change key difficulty was the perceived preference of these asian allies and associates for an ambivalent position on china and on forthright us efforts to deal with china thus seminar participants judged on the one hand that it was desirable for the united states to set out in clear terms its security and other concerns visavis china and to press us asian allies and associates to back the us position yet on the other hand seminar participants judged that us allies and associates under most likely circumstances would be very reluctant to take such forthright positions regarding china for fear of antagonizing the prc or important domestic political constituencies highlevel dialogue versus prestige for prc leaders seminar participants appeared to agree on the need for highlevel and continuous dialogue between us and prc leaders they readily acknowledged that summit meetings with chinese leaders would be used by the prc to legitimize beijings current authoritarian rulers both at home and abroad this poses big problem for the large segment of us opinion that sees china as rising power bent on rolling back us influence in asia and those that remain strongly offended by beijings crackdown at the time of the tiananmen incident and its subsequent violations of human rights and other norms specialists at the seminar offered arguments to persuade us skeptics of the utility of highlevel dialogue despite the problem of legitimizing beijings authoritarian rulers they stressed the need for senior us leaders to lay out us interests to their chinese counterparts in order for the latter to understand clearly areas of great sensitivity to the united states the alternative is miscalculation that can lead to military confrontation for example several seminar participants judged that beijing had misunderstood us resolve in pursuing its military intimidation efforts against taiwan in 19951996 they also emphasized the us needs to take account of chinese leaders interests without clear sense of chinese priorities it was argued us leaders will have difficulty in coming up with options for china that have realistic chance of being successful highlevel us dialogue with china was said to assist international efforts to get china to conform to norms favored by the us it was claimed that chinas shift from confrontation to more conformity in the last 20 years was facilitated by us leaders efforts in discussion with senior chinese leaders the us leaders were said to make clear to beijing the negative consequences of confrontational or obstructionist actions in sensitive areas and the positive consequences of more cooperative behavior as such american leaders were seen to have helped to channel chinese behavior in more constructive ways crs13 highlevel dialogue with china was especially needed during time of leadership transition in the prc without it chinese leaders are seen as prone to adopting politically safe nationalistic stances that greatly reduce chinese flexibility and increase prc paranoia in dealing with the united states with highlevel us assurances prc leaders could justify taking few more risks in moving away from narrow nationalistic positions to more cooperative internationalist stances broadly beneficial for both china and the world community to deal with the issue of adding to beijings international prestige us officials were urged to pick and choose from among chinese leaders thus some at the seminar said there is need for us leaders to have summit meeting with premier li peng who is widely identified with the tiananmen crackdown but the us could move ahead with president jiang zemin who handled the 1989 demonstrations in his area of responsibility shanghai in largely bloodless way the idea here suggested by some is in part to empower the more pragmatic chinese leaders some seminar participants went on to stress that past practice and practical interests seem to argue in favor of dialogue even with leaders thought to be key to distasteful or dangerous prc policies for one thing us practice in dealing with the ussr during the cold war showed the utility of dialogue with soviet leaders even when us policy saw the ussr as an evil empire meanwhile seminar participant supportive of clinton administration policy pointedly emphasized the benefits of active dialogue with chinas peoples liberation army pla viewed by many as key force in chinese domestic authoritarianism and international assertiveness the perceived benefits were make known us military priorities and concerns to key prc leaders at time of leadership transition and policy formulation in china exposing the nationalistic pla leaders to the possible negative consequences including possible us military actions if they forcefully pursue their nationalistic goals exposing the pla leaders to broad discussion of us perceptions of interests and priorities encouraging them to pursue paths of constructive activity and avoid disruption and confrontation exposing us leaders to clear understanding of pla plans intentions and capabilities establishing rules of the road so that us and prc forces in proximity in east asia do not accidentally come into conflict8 8 while not addressed explicitly at the seminar skepticism of such usprc military exchanges has been voiced repeatedly on capitol hill notably during hearings held by the house committee on national security and the senate committee on foreign relations crs14 specific recommendations set priority among us policy interests panelists were in agreement that us policymakers should establish more clear priorities in order to set clearer guidelines for dealing with china in the years ahead specifically seminar participants urged higher priority be given to us security and economic interests regarding peace and development in asian and world affairs and suggested that us concerns over issues of values like human rights be given less priority part of the reasoning had to do with sense that regional peace and development were not only in us interests but were of fundamental importance to human rights conditions in china and neighboring areas and part of the reasoning had to do with the general judgment that chinese priorities made it unrealistic for us policymakers to hinge relations with china on human rights seminar participants agreed that us policymakers where possible should reduce linkage between major issue areas as they set their priorities for dealing with china they generally endorsed the recent us administrations practice of dealing with economic and trade disputes with positive and negative incentives focused in the area of economic relations the clinton administrations may 1996 decision to threaten over 2 billion in trade sanctions if china did not do more to protect us and international intellectual property rights was case in point they urged similar approaches in dealing with security issues and human rights questions though it appeared that us leverage on the human rights issue per was relatively weak in part this is why some in congress wish to link human rights and us trade policy toward china chinese leaders were thought to be relatively open to meaningful negotiations with suitable giveandtake on trade and economic issues with the united states beijing had shown less flexibility on security issues involving such questions as nuclear technology and missile exports some seminar participants judged that progress could be made here as well provided in part that us negotiators were aware of chinese motives for reported nuclear and missile sales to pakistan and the middle east9 those motives included chinas search for economic profit and better overall relations with key strategic and oil producing countries china is now net importer of oil seminar participants also linked chinese arms transfers to this sensitive area to prc desire to show the united states that if us policy continues to upgrade arms sales to taiwan then beijing is prepared to respond with an upgrading of military related sales to areas sensitive for the united states given beijings strident nationalistic emphasis in recent months specialists judged that the us could expect little flexibility on chinese issues of sovereignty eg taiwan or internal political control eg human rights on the former the 9 in particular some noted that us explanation of its difficult experience with proliferation in sensitive world areas might have positive impact on chinas appreciation of how such proliferation could affect its interests crs15 faceoff of us and prc forces in the taiwan area at the time of the march 1996 taiwan presidential election had the benefit of giving beijing clearer notion of the limits of us tolerance to mainland chinese pressure tactics seminar participants warned that beijing remains determined to restore its sovereignty over taiwan over the long term and that one of the lessons learned by the pla from the faceoff with the us forces was that china needed to do more to prepare militarily for possible contingencies over taiwan it was assumed that this line of thinking would add to incentives prompting faster chinese military modernization nevertheless participants also judged that the us show of force had provided useful deterrent to further prc aggressive actions at least for the time being over the longer term at least one seminar participant judged that the usprc framework setup in the 1970s and 1980s for dealing with the socalled taiwan issue longer conformed to reality and would have to be adjusted through what were expected to be very difficult discussions with the prc several suggestions on how to advance us human rights interests despite prc inflexibility included use an improved atmosphere coming from us leaders willingness to meet with chinese leaders to petition strongly and privately for the release of prominent chinese dissidents use improved us interchange with china to actively promote us interests and values through business contacts exchange and education programs study missions etc some seminar participants urged greater us funding for these efforts build consensus behind us policy at home and in asia as noted above seminar participants judged that this consensus had to focus on broader us policy toward asia as well as policy toward china us officials were urged to explain fully to american opinion leaders and citizens the utility of continued strong and active us military economic and political involvement in asia as the foundation of an effective policy toward china strong exposition on the many current and future challenges posed by china was thought to be helpful in obtaining greater american support for an effective and balanced asian presence in east asia clear and realistic priorities and consistent direction were deemed important in building of asian support for us leadership as noted earlier most us friends and allies are reluctant to follow the united states in confrontation with china even when the prc strongly violates world norms part of the reason has to do with regional perception that us policy could change with the united states withdrawing from asia leaving its allies and associates exposed before the rising power of china seminar experts acknowledged the difficulty for us policy in crafting china policy sufficiently balanced to win support among asian allies and friends while having enough force behind the policy to warrant serious and constructive prc response some participants noted that this argues for more active us diplomacy and military cooperation with allies and friends crs16 clarity and consistency once us leaders establish clear and workable policy priorities and build consensus at home and abroad behind them it is incumbent on us leaders to remain consistent in pursuing these objectives one participant judged that the clinton administration had been less than optimally effective in dealing with china because it had changed policy in key areas regarding mfn and taiwan in particular the administrations ability to establish lasting understandings with chinese leaders and to build consensus in the us depends on clarity credibility and consistency the alternative is seen as vacillation and drift whereby the us may be forced to resort to extraordinary means including the use of force in order to clarify its intentions in the face of growing pressure from china for other versions of this
