this legal question is beyond the scope of this report readers inte rested in this issue should refer to crs report rl31994 samesex marriages legal issues by alison m smith 7 see crs report rs21029 survivor benefits for families of civilian federal employees and retirees by patrick purcellthe social security act generally defers the determination of whether marriage is valid for the purpose of qualifying for spousal or survivor benefits to the state of residence of the worker2 one might interpret this deferral to the statelevel definition of marriage as permitting samesex spouse to be eligible for social secu rity spousal benefits if such marriages are legal in that state however the definitions of wife and husband in the social security act rely on genderspecific pronouns the soci security act defines person as the wife of an individual if she either 1 is the mother of his or daughter 2 is married to him for at least year before filing for benefits or 3 in the month prior to her marriage to him was entitled to or if she had pplied and been old enough would have been entitled to social security benef its as spouse widow parent or disabled child3 similarly the act defines person as the husband of an individual if he either 1 is the father of her or daughter 2 is married to her for at least year before filing for benefits or 3 in the month prior to his marriage to her was entitled to social security benefits as spouse widow parent or disabled child4 the social security administration ssa interprets this use of genderspecific pronouns as an indication that congress did not intend samesex spouses or rvivors to be eligible for social security benefits5 regardless of the ssa position the defense of marriage act of 1996 doma pl 104199 established the legal definition of marriag as only legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife and define d spouse as only person of the opposite sex who is husband or wife when determining the meaning of any act of congress ruling regulation or interpretation by federal agencies the ssa must use this federal definition of marriage when interpreting the social security act therefore the legalization of samesex marriage at the state level has effect in determining the validity of marriage for social security purposes6 federal employee pensions federal employees with permanent appoin tments are eligible for retirement and disability benefits under either the civil serv ice retirement system csrs or the federal employees retirement system fers all federal employees initially hired into permanent federal employment on or af ter january 1 1984 are covered by fers employees hired before january 1 1984 are covered by csrs unless they chose to switch to fers during open seasons held in 1987 and 1998 both fers and csrs provide survivor benefits for the spouse nd dependent children of deceased federal employee or retiree7 title 5 of the us code whic h governs benefits under csrs and

contributions to qualified plan ar taxdeductible expense for the employer and are not included in the income of the employeenot define the word marriage however the code of federal regulations defines marriage for purposes of determining elig ibility for federal retir ement benefits under title 5 as marriage recognized in law or equity under the whole law of the jurisdiction with the most significant interest in the mar ital status of the employee member or retiree unless the law of that jurisdiction is contrary to the public policy of the united states8 because federal employee retirement be nefits under both csrs and fers are subject to the statutory interpretation re quired by the defense of marriage act in determining eligibility for survivor or pendant benefits under csrs or fers the word spouse refers only to person of the opposite sex who is husband or wife9 although federal employee cannot name dom estic partner as his or her surviving beneficiary under either fers or csrs an employee who is applying for nondisability retirement can elect an insurable interest nnuity iia only one person may be named as the beneficiary of the iia and the election must be made at the time of retirement the person named as the beneficiary must be so meone who is financia lly dependent on the employee and the employee must establish th rough one or more affidavits from other people the reasons why the beneficiary might reasonably expect to suffer loss of financial support as result of the employees death the cost of an iia can range from 10 reduction in the employees retirement annuity if the beneficiary is 10 years younger than the employee to 40 reduction if the be neficiary is 30 or more years younger under both fers and csrs an employee ma designate domestic partner as his or her beneficiary for lumpsum refund of retirement contributions to the retirement system however if anyone qua lifies to receive survivor annu ity benefits by law such as spouse or dependent child retirement cont ributions cannot be refunded federal employee also can name domestic partner as the beneficiary under the thrift savings plan tsp and he or she can designate domestic partner as th beneficiary under the federal employee group life insurance fegli program privatesector pensions employers in the private sector are not re quired to offer pension benefits but those that do must comply with the employee re tirement income security act erisa pl 93406 section 514a of eris provides that the law preem pts all state laws relating to employee benefits that are

restrict w ho is considered to be survivor plan could require samesex partners consent to name anyone else as the recipient of death benefit or contingent nnuity even though the plan could not require retiring participant with sames ex partner to take qualifying joint and survivor annuity instead of singlelife annuity see neal s schelberg and carrie l mitnick samesex marriage implications for employee benefit plans employee benefits journal vol 29 2 june 2004 15 for example because doma prohibits recogniti on of samesex marriage an employer could not be required to comply with qualified domes tic relations order qdro from state court in which spouse in samesex marriage was named as an alternate payee of pension benefitjoint and survivor annuity qjsa at retirement12 married participant must obtain his or her spouses written pproval either to waive qjsa or qpsa or to use pension benefit as security for loan13 definedcontribution plans such as 401k plans pay the account balance to the designated beneficiar if the participant dies the employees spouse is the automatic beneficiary of the employees account upon his or her death unless the employee has designated nother beneficiary the spous consent is not required in order for participant in definedcontribution plan to designate another beneficiary or beneficiaries in the event of the participants death in administering federal income taxes the internal revenue service irs has historically maintained that an individual is considered to be spouse if the applicable state law recognizes the relationship as marri age if for example state law recognizes commonlaw marriages as legal an employer in that state will be required to recognize an employees commonlaw spouse as his or her legal spouse and irs will recognize the marriage as valid the irs has never recognized samesex marriages for income tax purposes and the defense of marriage act pr ohibits it from doing so regardless of any state law moreover while an employer may voluntarily extend benefits to the samesex domestic partners of its employees the doma s upersedes state or local laws that would require an employer to recognize samesex partner as an empl oyees spouse for purposes of administering employersponsored retirement plans as noted above taxqualified pension plans are required to provide qualified joint andsurvivor annuity to ma rried participant and spouse unless both spouses decline the qjsa in writing because doma prohib its employers from recognizing samesex marriage for purposes of administering pension plans plan cannot require participant with samesex partner to take qjsa as the normal form of benefit even if state law recognizes the samesex partner as s pouse because federal law doma prohibits federally regulated plans from recognizing samesex partner as spouse14 doma provides that in interpreting any fe deral statute ruling or regulation including for example erisa and the inte rnal revenue code spouse can only be person of the opposite sex who is husband or wife consequently pension plan cannot be required to recognize samesex spouse even if samesex marriages are permitted under state law15 some benefits specialists have suggested that because section 514a of erisa preempt s state laws that relate to employee benefits covered by erisa erisa would therefore preempt any state law requiring the plan to recognize samesex marriage for purposes of administeri ng pension benefits however whetherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21897crs5 erisa alone would preempt state laws recognizing samesex marriage is irrelevant because doma prohibits recognition of same sex spouses in the interpretation and application of federal law bills in the 110th congress several bills ve been introduced in the 110th congress to address the issu of samesex marriage hjres 22 is proposed constitutional amendment that would amend the united states constitution to state that marriage in the united states shall cons

the same sex that is treated as marriage or as ving the legal incidents of marriage under the laws of such other state hr 107 would define marriage for all lega l purposes in the district of columbia to consist of the union of one man and one woman hr 724 would amend title 28 of the united state code to limit federal c ourt jurisdiction over questions under doma s 2521 the domestic partner benefits nd obligations act would extend benefits to domestic partners of fede ral employees under the act sa mesex domestic partners of federal employees would be eligible for benefits under the
