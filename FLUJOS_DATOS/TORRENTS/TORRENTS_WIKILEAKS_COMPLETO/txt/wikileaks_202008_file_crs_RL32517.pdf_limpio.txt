rate on capital income in several different ways taxes on capital arise from individual taxes on dividends interest capital gains and income from noncorporate businesses proprietorships and partne rships reductions in marginal tax rates as well as some tax benefits for business reduce these taxes taxes on capital income also arise from corporate profits taxes which are affected not only by rate reductions but also by changes to provisions affecting depreciation interest deductions other deductions and credits finally taxes can be imposed on capital income through the estate and gift tax tax cuts on capital income through marginal rate reductions estate and gift tax reductions dividend relief and bonus depreciation are estimated to cost about 110 billion per year with about half that amount attributable to the estate and gift tax these tax cuts are temporary and proposals to make some or all of them permanent are expected while there are many factors used to evaluate the effects of these tax revisions one of them is the distributional effect this report addresses those distributional issues in the context of behavioral responses data suggest that taxes on capital income tend to fall more heavily on highincome individuals all types of capital income are concentrated in high er income classes for example the top 2 of tax returns with adjusted gross income over 200000 in 2004 have 26 of income 16 of wages 38 of interest 57 of dividends and 79 of capital gains taking into account very broad range of capital assets treasury study found that the top 1 of the population has about 15 of total income and about 11 of labor income but receives almost third of capital income estate and gift taxes are especially concentrated in the higher incomes prior to recent tax cuts only 2 of estates paid the estate tax at all if there is significant reduction in savings in response to capital income taxes in the long run the tax could be shifted to labor and thus become regressive tax some growth models are consistent with such view but generally theory suggests that increases in taxes on capital income could either decrease or increase savings depending on variety of model assumptions and particularly depending on the disposition of the revenues there are also many reasons to be skeptical of these models which presume great deal of skill and sophistication on the part of individuals new models of bounded rationality suggest that taxes on capital income are likely to have effect or decrease saving as individuals rely on common rules of thumb such as saving fixed fraction of income and saving for target empirical evidence in general does not suggest significant savings responses as savings rates and pretax returns to capital have been relatively constant over long periods of time despite significant changes in tax rate if capital income taxes do not reduce saving these taxes fall on capital income and add to the progressivity of the income tax system

reductions enacted in 2001 through 2004 as well as some under consideration reduce the effective tax rate on capital income in several different ways taxes on capital arise from individual taxes on dividends interest capital gains and income from noncorporate businesses proprietorships and partnerships reductions in marginal tax rates as well as some tax benefits for business reduce these taxes taxes on capital income also arise from corporate profits taxes which are affected not only by rate reductions but also by changes to provisions affecting depreciation interest deductions other deductions and credits finally taxes can be imposed on capital income through the estate and gift tax the largest of the recent reductions measured by estimated revenue cost is the estate and gift tax repeal 54 billion in fy2011 the last full year it is effective under current law the reduction in tax rates on dividends and capital gains costs 27 billion in fy2008 the marginal individual rate reductions cost 63 billion in fy2010 of which perhaps quarter or around 15 billion are taxes on capital income bonus depreciation began at cost of more than 30 billion but that figure represented timing effects the equivalent annual cost was probably less than 20 billion overall the tax cuts on capital income cost around 110 billion per year significant sum all of these provisions are temporary although in the case of the estate and gift tax and the individual rate reductions the temporary nature was necessary to address parliamentary rule in the senate bonus depreciation was deliberately set to be temporary and expired in 2004 the dividend and capital gains relief was originally to expire in 2008 but was extended through 2010 thus some or all of these provisions will likely be considered for extension although many issues surround these tax changes one of them is the extent to which they benefit higher or lower income individuals the eventual consequences of these tax provisions depend on the behavioral responses to tax cuts which also drive issues of incentive effects and economic growth this report addresses these distributional issues in the context of behavioral responses the first section of this paper provides general data on the distribution of capital income of various types as background to discussing the incidence issues the next section discusses how behavioral responses could alter the distributional effects examining both shifts in the types of assets held and changes in savings rates

g5g149g138g156g156g561 capital income may be earned directly by individuals in operating their own businesses or as passive income from lending or investing in corporate stocks income from unincorporated businesses is not separated into labor and capital income but we can compare the distribution of income of different types by examining passive capital income sources there are three major types of passive capital income interest on debt dividends on corporate stock and capital gains which arise from the sale of stock and from the sale of other assets table 1 provides data on the distribution of this income

funds whic h were relatively small by compa rison in that year table 1 demonstrates several aspects of the distribution of capital income first as in the case of all income the distribution is very uneven with larger shares accruing to very small portions of the population for example the under 30000 adjusted gross income class has 50 of the returns but only 12 of income 15 of wages 29 of taxable interest income 8 of taxable dividends and 4 of taxable capital gains those over 200000 had 2 of returns 26 of income 16 of wages 38 of taxable interest 57 of taxable dividends and 79 of taxable capital gains secondly on the whole capital income is more concentrated among higher income individuals than is wage income and the concentration varies by type capital gains are more heavily concentrated among higher income individuals than is income from dividends and dividends are more concentrated than interest higher income individuals are more likely to be risk takers and invest in stocks and bonds so that both dividends and capital gains are more concentrated in higher income classes than is interest income the greater concentration of capital gains as compared to dividends may be partly due to the preference of higher income individuals for growth stocks partly due to the fact that lot of interest is effectively reported as dividends because it is funneled through mutual funds and partly due to the fact that sales of capital assets also reflects sales of real property also concentrated in highincome classes highincome individuals would also tend to prefer investme nts that would have otherwise been subject to higher individual tax rates and so may be more concentrated in capital gains and stocks for that reason although corporate source income is taxed more heavily than noncorporate income this rate is essentially flat rate and there is tax benefit to higher income individuals at the personal tax level however highincome individuals benefit from the lower capital gains rates more than lower and middle income individuals because of the higher spread between the ordinary and capital gains tax rate note that there are also significant amounts of capital income that are not subject to tax one such source of income tax exempt municipal bonds is reported in table 1 there are much larger amounts of interest held in pensions and iras in fact about half of interest and dividends are not

durables most importantly owner occupied housing is not subject to tax if individuals did not change their behavior in response to tax change then we could measure the effect of tax cuts or increases for these types of income by applying the change in the tax rates to income cuts in capital gains tax would most favor higher income individuals but in general all tax cuts on capital income are likely to benefit higher income individuals table 1 does not contain any information about the estate and gift tax however the estate tax is highly concentrated among top asset classes with only 21 of decedents paying estate taxes in 2000 before the recent round of tax cuts the table also does not contain direct information about corporate source income but since that income is ultimately received as dividends and capital gains the data also suggest that corporate taxes were there to be behavioral response would fall on higher income individuals based on this distributional data capital income taxes fall on higher income individuals and contribute to the progressivity of the tax system

portfolio shifts are considered first holding aggregate assets as fixed there is behavioral response unless returns on different types of assets are taxed differently in general more assets will be allocated to those activities or forms of investment whose returns are favored by the tax system in classic economics article that focused on the response to differential taxin this case the corporate income taxthe analysis showed that th likely outcome of such behavioral response is that the burden of the tax falls on all owners of capital1 this behavioral response arose from the migration of capital out of the more heavily taxed sector as the posttax return falls and into the more lightly taxed sector as capital migrates the sector with the reduced capital stock will experience higher pretax return because capital is relatively scarce compared to the other sectors while the sectors with the increased capital stock will experience lower pretax return this process occurs until aftertax returns adjusted for risk are once again equated capital owners in the tax favored sector bear part of the burden through lower pretax returns and capital owners in the taxed sector have some of the original burden reduced through higher pretax returns this shifting effect can however only occu r for the normal return to capital the return earned by competitive firms excess returns due for example to market power should be 1 see arnold c harberger the incidence of the corporate income tax journal of political economy vol 79 june 1962 pp 215240 this outcome has persisted through many different ways of modeling the coexistence of corporate and noncorporate sector although these different approaches have found different efficiency effects they all tend to point to the burden falling largely on capital and either sligh tly harming or slightly benefitting labor income for brief overview see jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital income cambridge mit press 1994 pp 79

one time fall in value that falls on the current owners labor could benefit slightly or share some small part of the burden but in general to examine the burden of say the corporate tax one would want to attribute the tax to owners of capital in general thus to determine the distribution across income classes it is necessary to determine the distribution of capital and labor income treasury study estimates the distribution of capi tal labor and all income by population quintile with some finer divisions at the top as reported in table 2 this analysis confirms the earlier findings that suggest capital income is especially concentrated at high levels the top 1 have more than 30 of capital income but only 10 of labor income t able 2 distribution of income capital labor and t otal population

19 99 thus while portfolio shifts should be taken into account in determining the burden of capital income taxes since overall capital is concentrated towards higher income individuals tax on capital income is likely to fall on higher income individuals even considering shifts in the allocation of capital hence capital income taxes contribute to the progressivity of the tax system even if they are applied at flat rate as is essentially the case of the corporate tax there is one potential reservation to this argument even in the context of fixed savings rate namely the effect of capital income taxation in an open economy when capital is migrating across sectors labor is also free to migrate as well as wages and prices change when capital migrates abroad however labor does not have the same freedom thus it is possible that the burden of capital income tax shifts to labor for this reason indeed in very specific set of circumstances one can find that all of the burden of tax imposed in one country is shifted to labor and since the share of labor income received by higher income individuals is less than the share of total income then capital income taxes would be regressive rather than progressive the circumstances for this outcome however are very narrow the tax must be applied on territorial basis that is only applied to capital used in the country not capital owned by the

and there are returns from market power moreover there must be resp onse to change in tax rates from the trading partners these conditions do not apply to the united states which is large country where personal level taxes are applied on residence basis and even corporate taxes are not entirely territorial moreover imperfect substitutability of assets or of products can cause less and even none of the tax to fall on labor even in the absence of market power and the empirical evidence suggests that such is the case 2 finally with inflation debt financed capital can actually experience subsidy at the firm level because nominal interest payments are deductible and if debt is more substitutable than equity which is likely an increase in the corporate tax could actually cause capital inflow rather than capital outflow thus introducing an open economy is not likely to change the conclusion that the ultimate burden of capital income taxes falls on capital in general and therefore falls more heavily on higher income individuals even in the limited case of the corporate tax

part to labor if individuals respond to the reduction in return by reducing savings3 however such an effect is not at all certain on theoretical basis in model of optimizing individuals an increase in the rate of return can lead to more savings or less savings depending on income and substitution effects that is lower incomes cause one to consume less in every time period while substitution effects cause consumption to shift over time the outcome depends on number of important issues and model assumptions secondly the presumption that individuals can make the complex optimizing decisions about saving that are depicted in these models is questionable indeed there is considerable reason to believe that individuals may employ ruleofthumb guidelines to saving behavior that suggest that taxes on capital either have effect or increase savings this view is bolstered by empirical evidence that suggests savings rates tend to be relatively steady over time rather than engaging in the dramatic swings that are predicted by certain optimizing models to interpret the empirical evidence it must be rela ted to particular theory so the first subsection lays out alternative models and approaches

burden of the corporate tax in an open economy national bureau of economic research working paper 8280 may 2001 3 the february 2004 economic report of the president hereafter er chapter 4 takes the position that capital income taxes fall eventually on labor because capital income taxes reduce saving reduce the capital stock and cause wage income to fall while there is mention of open economy issues it is clear that the argument rests primarily on savings effects their argument appeals to both theory c iting the ramsey model in particular and to some empirical evidence both of which are discussed in this section the february 2007 economic report of the president chapter 7 simply asserts this view without reference to theory or evidence

cycles were needed to explain depressions and recessions and models of growth needed to reflect the stylized facts of steady growth of output and productivity in the us postwar period the solow model with its fixed savings rate was consistent with both steady state growth in output per capita in the us economy as well as savings rate that seemed to show trend economists were dissatisfied with those models which were not built up from individual optimizing decisions as are other models in economics and many new macroeconomic model variations developed as result students in modern macroeconomics study many types of models in the area of economic growth these new models were intertemporal models which allowed individuals to choose consumption over timethat is to make savings decisions that responded to the prices and quantities in the economy many of these models continued to treat technological advance as exogenous and characterized by steady state growth 4 of these models there are essentially two forms the infinite horizon or ramsey model and the overlapping generations life cycle model or olg model the infinite horizon model is actually special case of the olg model these intertemporal models are commonly used in academic journals indeed in macroeconomics there is increasingly disconnect between the models used by forecasters both private and in the government and those used in the academic literature most forecasters use the basic model of sticky prices or wages where fiscal and monetary policy can affect output to address business cycles with their models gradua lly developing into solow models in the longer term certainly government or private sector forecaster uses ramsey or olg model to predict economic variables there has also been reaction among academic economists to these intertemporal models which assume an enormous amount of sophistication and planning on the part of consumers and models of bounded rationality have also developed where individuals are often assumed to follow rules of thumb these rules of thumb often lead back to the solow model or even to model where savings falls when the rate of return rises

elastic in this model which leads to lot of response to change in tax rate on capital income the after tax rate of return must always return to its original value and the ramsey model when used to model the actual equilibrium in the economy rather than the social planner problem for which it was originally devised5 effectively depicts the economy as composed of series of identical infinitely 4 there are also growth models where growth rates are pendent on the size of the economy or certain institutional features and some allow technological advance to be determined by choices within the economy such as investment in research and development investment in human capital and investment in public infrastructure 5 ramseys 1928 article clearly begins by addressing the issue of the optimal amount of saving for social planner of an economy or an economy truly composed of single infinitely lived individual rather than describing an actual equilibrium in fact the article contains considerable discu ssion of some of the problems in the model including finite lives and heterogeneous preferences see f p ramsey mathematical theory of savings the economic journal vol 38 december 1928 pp 542559 the model is also referred to as the ramseycasskoopmans model b ecause of later developments in modeling but both of these authors also referred cass quite explicit ly to the model as

intertemporal substitution elasticity or ies which measures the percentage change in the ratio of consumption in two time periods divided by the percentage change in their relative prices6 these effects can occur very quickly although with more modest ones that are consistent with empirical evidence they take place more slowly7 g14g146g143g142g556g5g162g140g149g142g561g15g152g141g142g149g561 the ramsey model is not the only way to model the effects of the capital income tax through formal model of individual rational choice although it is typically taught in most macroeconomics classes and is popular because of its mathematical simplicity more general form of intertemporal model is the lifecycle model where rather than depicting individuals as having single infinite life individuals have finite life and new generations are born while others die the lifecycle model has the same outcome as the ramsey model if bequests are motivated by interdependent utility functions but if they occur by accident are part of trading situation between children and parents or because of direct utility from the gift itself joy of giving motivation the outcome will be quite different 8 in the life cycle model savings may rise or fall due to standard income and substitution effects the life cycle model may indicate capital income taxes reduce savings or increase savings the magnitude and direction of outcomes depend on ma ny factors how substitutable consumption is over time whether individuals take into account the effects of behavioral response on future returns why bequests occur and how they change or dont change with change in the interest rate the amount of savings that is for precautionary purposes rather than for retirement the expected period of retirement relative to the working period and the pattern of wage growth over the career and the use of the revenues if tax on capital is imposed to finance spending and that spending does not directly affect consumption behavior then it is likely to be projected to reduce saving but in models with fixed bequest target that is significant low substitution elasticity lot of precautionary saving and long retirement period it is perfectly possible for savings to fall and capital income tax cut even were it to increase savings would not do so to the degree arising in the ramsey model so that the burden would still fall partially on capital 9 if the tax increase is used to reduce other taxes the effects depend on the type however in the current us 6 the relative price of consumption t years into the future is 11rt where r is the rate of return after tax 7 the er also provides some simulations of the time path of adjustment indicating that after five years quarter of the burden will fall on workers while over ten years 40 will fall on workers this speed of adjustment depends among other things on the intertemporal elasticity of substitution ies which is set at one the smaller the ies the more slowly adjustment takes place most empirical estimates of the ies are well below one if more typical value of 025 is chosen rather than one the adjustment would be about half as large in the first five years ie about 12 or 13 falling on wages and about twothirds as much after 10 years ie about quarter rather than 40 see crs report rl31949 issues in dynamic revenue estimating by jane g gravelle which has

substitution would easily increase the capital stock even if the model did not have bequests an increase used to reduce consumption taxes would however tend to product reduction in savings10 raising capital income taxes and using them to reduce the deficit would almost certainly expand the capital stock although the deficit could not grow without limit and the model cannot be solved for the steady state unless the deficit were eventually offset if an increase in capital income taxes leads to decreased consumption then rather than workers bearing part of the burden they actually benefit and capital income bears more than 100 of the burden one of the important implications of the life cycle model is that the outcome is not only sensitive to the model results but it is also sensitive to the disposition of revenues resulting in dramatically different outcomes depending on how revenues are used appendix contains detailed discussion of why this is the case

to the infinite horizon model in some important respects for tax analysis and public finance economists using intertemporal models tend to gravitate to life cycle models 11 for example the ramsey model does not permit heterogeneity in preferences unless some individuals are driven to subsistence level or if borrowing against future labor income is not permitted spend only labor income the ramsey model also does not work when there are differential tax rates unless one group country state or an income class accumulates all of the capital thus it is incompatible with differ ential taxes across countries differences in state level taxes and graduated tax rates these problems do not exist with the life cycle model the requirement that individuals exhibit heterogeneity is powerful restriction on the model the theory also implies that with mixed bequest motives families with bequest motives governed by interdependent utility functions will ultimately own all of the capital stock although the steady state in the model will take much longer to reach v ery long if the fraction of individuals with this type of bequest motive is small but to reach the ramsey solution also requires that these families have continual unbroken dynastic link across descendants that preserves preferences and always reproduce either asexually or by intermarrying only with other dynastic families

important of these is the assumption that consumers are able to engage in process of choosing savings and consumption and labor supply in some models based on optimizing consumption and leisure over period of 55 years or so or even an infinite period responding all the while to changes in current and projected wage rates taxes and rates of return since solving current models requires facility w ith calculus at least the knowledge of economic modeling possessed by graduate students and in some cases the ability to program large scale numerical model on computer as well as an extensive knowledge of economic conditions such an assumption seems difficult to defend bernheim 12 discusses different type of model of behavior based on bounded rationality which acknowledges that individuals have trouble dealing with complex problems even those much less complex than those presented by life cycle or ramsey models if so those models cannot be used to assess behavior the response to this criticism is that individuals need only behave as if they are optimizing much in the way that experienced poker players may behave as if they are basing their bets on the knowledge of odds even if they cant state those odds bernheim describes three conditions that might permit such behavior if individuals have chance to repeat the behavior frequently and observe the outcome if they can observe others choices and outcomes easily or if they can obtain and evaluate expert advice the first two options do not exist for life cycle savings which occurs only one time and without chance to examine outcomes and behaviors of ones own contemporaries financial advice is not always easy to evaluatebut more importantly it is generally not consistent with the prescriptions of intertemporal models financial planners do not provide advice along the lines of the lifecycle or ramsey models they may recommend rule of thumb such as saving percentage of income consistent with interest elasticity or accumulating an appropriate annuity which is form of target savings which results in rise in savings when taxes go up fixed saving rate is consistent with another common textbook growth model the solow model it is easy to find evidence of this type of advice for example the national retirement planning coalition posts calculators on the internet to determine how much money you need to save to accumulate certain recommended amount this is target savings approach if the rate of return goes up you will need to save less to accumulate the target amount or consider these statements reported in newspaper many economists say average workers should be investing 10 to 15 percent of their pay other economists say less than 25 percent 13 and they are nowhere near the 1 million in savings one is supposed to have for retirement14 this advice proposes fixed saving rate in the first case and target savings approach in the second 12 b douglas bernheim taxation and saving op cit 13 betty nooker

intertemporal models studied have focused on taxes on the return to capital such as individual income taxes and state and local taxes estate and gift taxes have unique issues the motive can strongly determine the effect the tax affects not only the donor but the recipient and the estate tax is very concentrated among highincome donors suppose that individuals leave bequests because they have saved money as means of insuring against living too long or having bad health in that case the estate tax is irrelevant to their behavior because they will never have to face the tax however the estate tax may affect the savings behavior of their heirsby reducing the value of the net bequest there is an income effect which induces more savings or possibly more labor supply15 if donors receive some pleasure from giving bequest so that we think of beque st as form of individual consumption the donor faces competing income and substitution effects that have uncertain outcome but the recipient has an income effect so that the tax encourages private saving there are also exchange and altruistic models which have uncertain results16

the post war period and attempts to formally estimate the savings response while problematic have found small effects of varying sign17 statistical estimates of the substitution of consumption and leisure over time have suggested small effects as well18 these latter estimates do not directly determine the savings effects since the effects depend on the interaction of these estimates with other model features however low intertemporal substitution elasticities make it hard for realistic life cycle models to produce large or even negative savings effects from capital income taxes there is little direct evidence of the effect of estate taxes on wealth accumulation 19 although the savings evidence in general should be informative about the estate tax as well as other capital income taxes as noted earlier the economic report of the president er has argued for the shifting of the tax to labor based largely on economic theory and specifically referencing the ramsey model there is one paragraph however which addresses empirical evidence empirical work provides some evidence that capital income taxes are shifted to some extent studies find that the before tax return to capital is higher when the tax rate on capital income is higher however the picture is not entirely clear because other factors may cause tax rates and before tax rates of return to move 15 the notion that leaving descendants large bequests will cause them to be less productive citizens is referred to as the carnegie conjecture and it was the reason that andrew carnegie left most of his wealth to charity 16 see william g gale and maria g perozek do estate taxes reduce saving in william g gale james r hines jr and joel slemrod eds rethinking estate and gift taxation washington dc brookings

the major support for the shifting of capital income tax burdens to labor income and therefore shifting from higher to lower income individuals rests in theoretical models that while popular with many economists for their mathematical elegance have not been empirically tested and are not consistent with most empirical evidence on saving if formal intertemporal model that is more realistic is used the analysis of incidence cannot be made until the accompanying policies involving disposition of the revenues are made for those who doubt that most individuals possess the sophistication and ability to plan whether over finite lifetime or an infinite family dynasty the rule of thumb approaches that involve targeting or fixed savings rates seem consistent with bounded rationality models and suggest that capital income taxes are more likely to have little effect or increase savings the view that there is little effect on savings seems supported by some empirical evidence

basic issues including the uncertainty surrounding the effect of cutting taxes on capital income using an intertemporal model consider simple model where individuals live for two periods although more realistic multiperiod models are normally used to study tax issues this model can provide important insights into what drives the results in two period model the individual lifetime budget constraint is 1 c 1 c 2 1 r1 t wl 1 wl 2 1 r1 r1 t where c 1 and c 2 are consumption in periods one and periods two r is the rate of return t is the tax rate w is the wage rate and l 1 and l 2 are labor hours in each period typical utility function will result in relationship between c 2 and c 1 as the following 2 c 2 c 1 b1 r1 ts where b is the relative valuation placed on the second period consumption b normally less than 1 indicating that future consumption is discounted in value relative to present consumption r is the rate of return and s is the substitution elasticity between consumption in the two periods with respect to the relative price the price of consumption in period one is one and the price in period two is 11r1t also assume that l 2 and l 1 are fixed with l 2l1 equal to some constant if is one you work the same amount in both periods and if equals zero you are fully retired in the second period by substituting 2 into 1 and using you obtain the relationship between consumption and income 3 c 1 1 bs 1 r1 ts1 wl 1 1 1 r1 t the first thing to notice about this relationship is that if equals zero so there are earnings in the second period and s equals one consumption and therefore savings is not affected by the rate of return the effect of r on the left hand is th normal income and substitution effect of price change in this case the price is 11r1t if the rate of return goes up you may wish to consume more in the second period but the higher return means that it is also possible to consume more in both the first and second period the substitution effect s causes savings to rise and the income effect causes savings to fall on the right hand side there is direct income effect on w which is called the human wealth effect an increase in r causes the present value of earnings to fall and that effect in isolation causes consumption to fall and savings to rise when the rate of return falls it is the relative size of these different effects that determines whether savings rises or falls with rise in the interest rate if you derive the savings rate which is wl 1c 1wl 1 and differentiate with respect to t and evaluate at t 0 to get the change in the savings rate that change is positive for tax cut as long as 4 121a c c 1 a1 rs

earnings relative to consumption if equals zero s must be greater than 1 with income in the second period s less than one can still cause decline in savings depending on the value of and the other parameters since most empirical evidence suggests that intertemporal elasticities quite small there is empirical ambiguity for models where significant retirement is assumed in the second period the same forces that act in this two period m odel also act in multiperiod model that more realistically reflects actual life cycles although the effects are much more complicated in these models as well the effect on savings depends on the magnitude of the intertemporal substitution elasticity and the time horizon of earnings as compared to the time horizon of consumption this latter effect means that the period of retirement relative to the period of consumption will affect the results that the path of wages over lifetime will matter and also that bequests can alter the effects because they can alter the horizons of income and consumption we will return to these issues after discussing third extremely important consideration which is how the revenues from capital income tax increa are used or how the loss is made up for decrease consider the following scenarios 1 tax cuts on capital income reduce government spending presumed to be spent on consumption goods which does not affect the individuals private choices 3 tax cuts on capital income reduce transfers which may occur in the first period as well as the second period 4 tax cuts on capital income are offset by tax increases on wage income 5 tax cuts on capital income are made up by imposing consumption tax 6 tax cuts on capital income add to the deficit in each of these different scenarios different outcome appears offsetting tax changes with government expenditures invokes the income and substitution effects shown above and thus tax cut can either raise or lower savings rates the effect of transfers depends on whose transfers are changed they can be changed for the old the young or both to consider the two extremes suppose tax cut reduces transfers by the same amount for the old in the simple two period model the individual loses in transfers exactly what he gained in the tax cut so that the income effects are removed tax cut would unambiguously increase savings for any positive intertemporal substitution elasticity suppose instead that the transfer occurred in the first period in this case it is even less likely that tax cut would increase savings than in the government spending case the normal income and substitution effects that arise from increases in the rate of return would remain but income of the young would fall because of the negative transfer and that decline in income would reduce both consumption and savings in proportions that reflect preferences and income essentially this assumption produces negative effect on the right hand side of the budget constraint much the same as human wealth effect

occur but the general nature of the transfers is associated with certain types of tax substitutions for example if cut in capital income taxes is financed by higher tax on wages that additional tax burden is concentrated more on the young consumption tax places more of the burden on the old if the tax cut is financed by deficit then it is much more likely that the capital stock will fall because the effect of private savings is ambiguous but public savings will fall as result of government borrowing note that tax cut financed with deficit can only be considered as shorter or intermediate term effect in model with myopic behavior individuals believe that current wages and pretax returns will be fixed for long run steady state some resolution of that deficit must be determined there are many aspects of life cycle model that will affect the direction and magnitude of the effect on savings the following is partial list of model features and assumptions that will contribute to the likelihood that the model would predict savings decrease with cut in capital income taxes 1 lower intertemporal substitution elasticities 2 tax cut offset by higher wage taxes or by deficit eventually resolved by restoring higher tax rates 3 including bequests which tend to lengthen the time horizon between consumption and earnings as long as bequests do not arise from interdependent utility functions which leads to the ramsey model discussed in the text the effect of bequests is particularly likely to push the results towards less savings when they tend to be fixed targets as might be the case when money is accumulated because of uninsurable uncertainties such as longevity and health in old age 4 incorporating risk which cannot be eliminated by market mechanisms this could be risk in wage earnings risk in expectancy health rate of return or any number of uncertainties risk not only leads to the accumulation of precautionary savings that is not very sensitive to the rate of return and indeed may be more affected by income effects from the interest rate but also leads to accumulation of bequests as form of selfinsurance which also tend to be insensitive as noted above 5 longer retirement period relative to working period which expands the time horizon of consumption relative to earnings 6 slower productivity growth w hich slows the growth of expected wages and in general wage profile with declining wages in later years 7 assumption of minimum subsistence amount of consumption in each period which limits substitutability in consumption referred to as the stonegeary utility function there are many other uncertainties associated with life cycle models some of these quite technical in nature it is difficult for example to calibrate life cycle model to match all of the features of the economy without bequests unless intertemporal elasticities are set relatively high even if empirical evidence suggests they are low 20 growth rates are set artificially low the

realistic all of those compromises affect outcomes in important ways and it might be argued that any life cycle model that does not include bequests is deeply flawed as model of savings behavior even if other concerns were not present in model that did include bequests it was quite common to find that shift to wage tax decreased the capital stock21 continued revenue estimating by jane g gravelle

is the main subject of mulligans paper addresses different shifting issue altogether namely whether firms try to mark up prices in the short run to immediately shift the burden to consumer prices this type of shortrun shifting is generally questioned by economists because it requires firms to make irrational short run decisions if firms are maximizing their profits before tax then any change in prices leads to smaller profit and adds loss in pretax profit to the tax burden itself also if firms are in competitive environment it is difficult to be successful in raising prices because sales would decline significantly despite these reservations study in the 1960s argued that there was evidence for short run shifting of the corporate tax 23 although most economists studying the issue concluded that the effects were due to not controlling for other factors particularly cyclical factors the mulligan paper actually carried out two diff erent empirical estimates the following is summary and commentary on these findings

calculations of the pretax return to capital and the overall average tax rate on capital taken from the national income and product accounts noting that the after tax return is r1t where r is the pretax return and t is th tax rate he regresses the log of r against the log of 1t coefficient of minus one would indicate that the entire tax is shifted ie the after tax return remains constant and coefficient of zero would indicate shifting he presents scatter diagram of the average of these values for five year intervals and his regression initially yields coefficient of 027 which would suggest about 27 is shifted however visual examination of the scatter diagram contained in mulligans paper makes it clear that the regression coefficient is caused by two outlying periods reflecting world war ii 19411945 and the great depression 19311935 and mulligan ggests those periods be excluded once those periods are excluded the regression line would appear to have an approximate zero coefficient that is although the tax rate changes substantially there is little variation in the pretax returns in particular the rate of return early in the century is different than later returns even though tax rates were zero at that point rather than running the regression on this set of data which would almost certainly produce an insignificant coefficient around zero the author decides to exclude all preworld war ii data his reason for doing so is that the data are not as reliable however this exclusion also eliminates much of the variability of the tax rate data the new regression line has coefficient of 051 22 casey b mulligan capital tax incidence first impressions from the time series nber working paper 9374 december 2002 23 marian krzyzaniak and richard musgrave the

again from looking at the scatter diagram that cyclical effects are still at wo rkfor example the 198185 period which covers serious recession is characterized by low pretax returns and low tax rates just as the case of the great depression when mulligan controls for forecasted unemployment the relationship disappears with the coefficient not statistically different from zero and actually positive these data therefore tend to indicate that there is short run shiftingie that pretax returns are not high when tax rates are high the simple da ta also would not appear to present much of case for long run shifting either since the pretax return did not change over long periods of time that is tax rates went from zero and very low rates to fairly high rates over period covering many years but there seemed to be little change in pretax returns mulligan does not use this data to address the long run issue and there are many other factors that could have an effect so how is it that mulligan concludes that there is evid ence of long run shifting his abstract states the empirical findings are consistent with significant capital tax shifting in the long run little shifting in the short run and clearly rule out overshifting g7g158g149g142g155g561g7g154g158g138g157g146g152g151g561g20g142g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g156g561 this conclusion apparently arises from the second part of the paper and actually from references to other work which turns to different estimating strategy instead of using pretax returns and tax rates the analysis looks at consumption growth using the consumption euler equation from the first order conditions of an intertemporal model using expectations this first order condition is 1 ln ectct1 s r1t p which says that the expected growth rate in cons umption c is determined by the expected after tax rate of return and s is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution ies it is not possible using this approach to differen tiate between the effect of the ies on growth and the short run shifting of the tax that is the growth rate of consumption might be unaffected by the tax rate because the ies is close to zero or because change in r offsets change in t short run shifting mulligan uses estimates from another paper to set the ies to 1 by regressing consumption growth against aftertax incomean estimate that itself comes from paper using similar data and that might be questioned 24 in this case because he regresses consumption growth against the log of 1t coefficient of zero implies there is short run shifting and coefficient of 008 equal to the after tax return suggests that there is shifting 24 this paper essentially uses the same data to estimate the ie s but actually regresses it ag ainst the aftertax return see casey b mulligan capital interest and aggregate intertemporal substitution national bureau of economic research working paper 9373 december 2002 the main innovation of this paper is that the author uses constructed tax rates for the entire capital stock rather than financial returns since he argues that more complete portfolio provides better measure of aftertax returns of course such portfolio could also be measured as mix of after tax financial assets with the exception of owneroccupied housing and noncorporate equity thereby avoiding at least some potential measurement error the scatter diagram presented in that paper covering 19301997 also shows the depression and war years to be outliers and thus results in much higher ies when those years are included the elasticities around one come from

for estimating both the ies and short run shifting it is not clear what the findings ar and although claims ar made about long run shifting it seems difficult to reconcile these results with the data from the first part of his study which seems to show that pretax returns dont change very much over long periods of time mulligan concludes that the empirical findings are consistent with significant capital tax shifting in the long run little shifting in the short run and clearly rule out overshifting it appears that his conclusions about the long term arise from the fact that tax rates have varied but consumption growth has not if one assumes significant ies and other disturbances arising for example from demographic or technological changes then one could interpret the stability of consumption growth over periods far apart as evidence that the tax was shifted over the long run however the data in his scatter diagram that directly relate pretax return to net of tax share seem to contradict that view indicating that when leaving out the depression and war years and controlling for unemployment there is effect of taxes on the pr etax return view consistent with effect on saving direct evidence of long run effects of tax changes on savings is difficult to find given the limitations of data number of studies have tried to relate the savings rate to the after tax rate of return those studies have mostly found small effects that vary in signthat is small increases or small decreases but none very significant 25 these results are not consistent with significant long term shifting but there are problems with these approaches in particular they came under criticism because of arguments that policy changes and expectations might not be constant over time the lucas critique some of these same criticisms could be applied to comparing pretax rates of return over time the other approach consumption euler approach as discussed in the mulligan paper is also vulnerable to many criticisms26 certainly one of them is the possibility that tax rate changes are unanticipated shocks and an uncertainty about the purpose of the tax change suppose we presume that the infinite horizon model holds and that there is short run shifting an unanticipated fall in the marginal tax rate on capita l income that is expected to be permanent let us in this example hold total taxes constant causes current consumption to fall in way that is divorced from the euler equation and is set to move the economy to new growth path consumption would fall all at once then consum ption growth would be higher because the rate of return is higher but this higher growth would gr adually slow as the rate of return adjusted until new steady state was reached thus the theoretical model that lies behind the estimates using the euler equations suggests that if the ies is actually large ie one then consumption growth must be function of profits as well as tax if the rate of return is to be fixed or virtually fixed the implication is that the ies is virtually zerowhich means that either the ramsey model adjusts so slowly that it takes centuries to reach new equilibrium or that the ramsey model is not the right model moreover the presumption of an ies of one in this section is not consistent with the findings in the section comparing pretax returns with tax rates that data seemed to show relatively constant pretax return an outcome consistent with very low ies or model where taxes do not affect savings rates such as the model of bounded rationality where individuals save target fraction of income or target an annuity 25 see engen gravelle and smetters dynamic tax models why they do the things they do opcit 26 see b douglas bernheim taxation and saving op cit for discussion of the problems of estimating elasticities particularly with aggregated consumption

other issues that might be raised about the mulligan paper including the fact that aggregate consumption growth is affected by technology and population growth as well as many other institutional factors moreover the author does not actually measure the marginal tax rates that should drive the savings response he uses average rates taxes also include the property tax rate which is problematic on number of grounds including the possibility that these tax rates are capitalized or that individuals choose to live in places where property tax rates are set so as to provide desirable bundle of local government services overall however the most straightforward conclusion from this empirical paper is that the pre tax return has been remarkably stable over long period of time and in the postwar period when controlled for cycles this evidence seems to suggest not only that taxes are not shifted in the short run but also that they do not induce the savings behavior that results in shift in the long run if so the tax burden would fall on owners of capital not on labor g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 jane g
