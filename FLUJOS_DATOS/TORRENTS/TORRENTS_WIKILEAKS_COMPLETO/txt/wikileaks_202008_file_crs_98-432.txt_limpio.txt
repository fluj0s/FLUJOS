and us interests raymond j ahearn specialist in trade relations foreign affairs and national defense division summary mercosur consisting of argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay is the third largest preferential trading group in the world since its inception in 1991 mercosur has made considerable progress in integrating the economies of its members the integration an almost complete free trade area and partial customs union has been accompanied by significant increase in us exports and investment to the region in general the united states has viewed the evolution of mercosur as being supportive of its political interests as well although mercosur is seen as favoring slower approach to hemispheric economic integration in the future mercosur faces challenges affecting the size of its membership the depth of its integration and the strength of its institutions formation mercosur the spanish acronym for the common market of the south was created in 1991 by the treaty of asuncion consisting of argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay mercosur has combined gdp of 12 billion and population of 208 million in 1997 it is the third largest preferential trade grouping in the world after the european union and nafta1 brazil and argentina are the dominant members of mercosur together these two countries account for 97 of mercosurs gross domestic product cooperation between these two historic rivals remains crucial to the continued viability of the trade grouping the 1991 treaty of asuncion and its amendments embodied in the 1994 protocal of ouro preto commits the members of mercosur eventually to form common market in common market goods services capital and labor are provided free movement among its members sequential process to establish common market was envisioned with 1 chile and bolivia became associate members in 1996 adding another 21 million inhabitants and 84 billion world bank parity prices to mercosurs total congressional research service the library of congress crs2 free trade area and customs union to be achieved first2 to lay the foundation for the creation of common market the treaty called for the coordination of labor monetary tax research and development and industrial policies while mercosur was created primarily for economic reasons it clearly has wider geopolitical rationale as well in drawing up their proposals for economic integration mercosurs charter members underlined the importance of political stability and commitment to democratic principles subsequently they all proceeded to sign democracy clause which ensures that only those governments that are democratically elected will be welcomed as members3 mercosur was also envisioned as mechanism to provide its members with more influence in the global trading system in terms of trade relations mercosur negotiates in united way as one single trading bloc status for the most part mercosur is fully functioning free trade area the vast majority of goods traded among its four members receive dutyfree treatment mercosur is also close to becoming fullfledged customs union but the establishment of common market remains fairly distant aspiration mercosur has made steady progress toward becoming free trade area by january 1 1995 tariffs among the four countries were eliminated on 85 or approximately 9000 dutiable items the remaining 15 included exceptions for sensitive products such as textiles steel and paper products special arrangements are also scheduled to remain in effect until the year 2000 for two protected sectors automobiles and sugar in moving towards fullfledged customs union mercosur members began implementing common external tariff cet on january 1 1995 the cet which is imposed on imports from nonmember countries applies to 85 of all tariff items the maximum tariff imposed is 20 ad valorem with various rates between 2 and 18 also in effect depending on the product the average tariff rate is about 14 ad valorem computers automobiles and capital goods which comprise 15 of the tariff items but higher percentage of trade will continue to be subject to national tariffs until the turn of the century capital goods will have maximum cet of 14 effective from the year 2001 for brazil and argentina and computer equipment and telecommunications goods will have maximum cet of 16 from 2006 in addition to these general exceptions each country has at least 300 products on which the cet will not apply until the year 2001 or 20064 2 free trade area such as nafta eliminates tariffs on intragroup trade customs union entails free trade among its members and common trade and tariff policy towards the rest of the world but it does not involve the free movement of labor among member countries 3 mercosur was widely credited with keeping paraguay on democratic path in 1996 when rebellious general moved against president juan carlos wasmosy mercosur foreign ministers traveled to asuncion and made clear he would face diplomatic and economic isolation 4 the temporary exemption of products and sectors from the cet implies that major continued crs3 in late 1997 in response to generalized concerns over growing balance of payments deficits brazil and argentina agreed to raise the cet by 3 paraguay and uruguay both more dependent on imports than brazil and argentina agreed to the increase under the condition that they be allowed to exempt up to 600 items the 3 increase to be in effect for 3 years moves the average external tariff to 17 and the upper limit to 235 although the 1991 treaty of asuncion established 1995 as the date for completing the common market the goal has not been reached and it remains longterm objective lacking concrete deadline or strategy key issues such as free movement of labor have not been addressed and only minimal efforts have been made to coordinate policies among mercosur members with respect to macroeconomic and exchange rate policies more intrusive economic ties entailed in common market would require closer political relations between brazil and argentina on the one hand historic rivalries and disparities in per capita incomes population and educational levels could impede movement in this direction on the other hand mercosur is broadly credited with bringing number of political developments that would not have been imagined possible decade ago these include the movement by brazil and argentina to renounce their incipient nuclear programs and the decision to conduct joint military exercises trade effects the economic integration achieved to date an almost complete free trade area and partial customs union has boosted trade among the four members of mercosur since its inception us economic interaction with these four countries has also accelerated following the establishment of mercosur trade among its members intraregional trade has grown from about 4 billion to over 20 billion in 1997 the rate of increase since 1995 have been over 20 per year more than double the rate of trade growth with the rest of the world6 despite the rapid growth in trade mercosur countries remain relatively closed by international standards total tradegdp ratios imports plus exports as percentage of gdp for mercosur averaged only 15 in 1995 compared to the ratio of around 24 for the united states the economies of the mercosur countries appear to have the potential for much higher levels of trade7 while many other factors are involved mercosur integration has not had an unfavorable impact on us trade and investment flows us exports to the region have increased by over 300 rising from 56 billion in 1990 to 231 billion in 1997 lower 4 continued adjustments in the industrial structure of member countries will have to be made in the future 5 the office of the us trade representative expressed concern about this tariff increase in bilateral meetings and at the world trade organization 6 data compiled by the interamerican development bank

the mercosur economies in the aggregate an average growth of 44 in 1993 68 in 1994 20 in 1995 34 in 1996 and 45 in 1997 have been the primary forces driving the rapid expansion of us exports8 during this same period us imports from mercosur countries have increased by only 23 rising from 96 billion in 1990 to 121 billion in 1997 as result of very rapid increase in exports and stagnating imports the us trade balance with mercosur has improved from deficit of 39 billion in 1990 to surplus of 111 billion in 1997 with 63 billion accounted for by brazil and 36 billion by argentina the european union eu remains mercosurs largest trading partner eumercosur trade totaled 427 billion in 1996 compared to 31 billion for usmercosur trade the eu supplied 29 of mercosurs imports and purchased 23 of mercosurs exports the comparable percentages for the us were 23 and 15 respectively since 1990 the eu and the united states both have improved their share of mercosurs import trade up 56 percentage points for the eu and up 37 percentage points for the us but have lost importance as destination of mercosur exports down 85 percentage points for the eu and down 81 percentage points for the us9 regarding foreign direct investment the united states is by far the largest investor in mercosur with stock of foreign investment totaling about 34 billion in 1996 us foreign direct investment flows were almost three times greater than eu flows between 19901995 during this period us foreign direct investment flows totaled 21 billion compared to 8 billion for the eu over time the substantially larger presence of us multinational companies operating in mercosur mostly in argentina and brazil could help the united states gain larger share of mercosurs import market as those companies increasingly source inputs and machinery from affiliates located in the united states10 policy challenges while the four mercosur countries have made considerable progress in integrating their economies more closely there are number of challenges they must address to ensure continued future progress among these challenges are the issues of expansion deepening and organization11 since the december 1994 summit of the americas most countries in the western hemisphere with the exception of the united states have been actively involved in expanding subregional trade groupings mercosur has been the most active during 1996 mercosur reached free trade agreements with bolivia and chile that are designed to serve as stepping stones for full membership into mercosur preliminary talks with the andean community gave rise to much speculation that mercosur would be able to expand its membership to all of south america thereby creating brazilled south american free 8 us trade data compiled

but sure the continuing growth of mercosur harvard international review spring 1997 pp 5253 73 crs5 trade area safta this view of mercosurs rapid expansion was also buttressed by free trade talks mercosur was undertaking with the eu mexico and canada in recent months momentum for mercosurs expansion has appeared to falter bolivias full entry into mercosur is not scheduled to take place for 10 years more rapid entry by chile has been halted by mercosurs tariff hike of 3 mercosurs negotiations with the andean countries mexico and canada have made little progress and these countries all have much stronger trading relationships with the united states than with mercosur and decision to commence any kind of formal negotiations with the eu is not expected to be made until 199912 the political allure of expansion however is unlikely to fade away the creation of safta could position mercosur to play much more important role in regional and world affairs and the prospect of negotiating with the united states and the eu simultaneously over the terms of potentially rival free trade agreements would provide an enlarged mercosur with considerable negotiating leverage mercosur currently appears to be paying increased attention to internal challenges associated with the deepening of the integration scheme in september 1997 argentina and brazil attempted to address the problem of bringing automobiles and sugar within the rules of the mercosur free trade area at presidential summit in december 1997 other efforts at deepening trade integration were made these included decision to begin talks at freeing trade in services over 10year period as well as to begin study on government procurement rules the presidents of the member countries also announced efforts to improve border crossings13 final challenge relates to the organization of mercosur since its inception mercosur has been characterized by topdown organizational strategy heavily dependent on presidential initiatives although the respective national parliaments approved the treaty of asuncion overwhelmingly they have played relatively small role in the development of mercosur to date currently each individual problem and dispute must be resolved directly by members heads of state or foreign ministry officials this is not only time consuming but makes mercosur vulnerable to domestic political agendas that may change from administration to administration decision made by the presidents last december to inaugurate formal mercosur headquarters in montevideo could be seen as modest step towards addressing this problem us interests in general the united states has viewed the establishment of mercosur as being supportive of us economic and political interests mercosurinspired trade and economic reforms have contributed to the strong economic performance of member countries and helped facilitate largescale increases in us exports and direct investments in the region mercosurs existence by most accounts has also contributed to political stability and commitment to democratic principles in the member countries 12 hall kevin g economic woes drive mercosur to clean up its own house journal of commerce march 12 1998 p 1a 13 the economist mercosur back and forth december 20 1997 p 32 crs6 usmercosur relations however have been somewhat strained by differences over the tone and pace of discussions aimed at creating free trade area of the americas ftaa by 2005 most generally mercosur led by brazil has backed slow and staggered talks in support of the hemispheric free trade goal while the united states has supported more comprehensive and swift negotiating approach goslow approach would provide brazil with the opportunity to expand mercosur into larger south american free trade bloc buttressed by the diplomatic support provided by larger mercosur brazil could be better positioned to negotiate with the united states from position of strength this is important because brazil and argentina both wish to extract from the united states concessions limiting washingtons use of unfair trade practice remedies eg antidumping and countervailing duties and to improve access to the us market for agricultural products14 in addition because mercosur currently protects number of sectors such as financial services telecommunications and government procurement longer period of time would provide these sectors with more leeway and capacity to adjust to increased import competition lacking fasttrack trade negotiating authority the clinton administrations leverage to dominate the setting of the structure and scope of the ftaa negotiations has been arguably constrained most recently at march 1998 meeting of the trade ministers from 34 countries of the americas held in san jose costa rica the united states accommodated number of mercosur interests and demands argentina for example was named as the chair of negotiating committee on agriculture the creation of which was top brazilian priority significantly brazil was also named cochair with the united states for the final 3 years of the ftaa negotiations this position could provide brazil with the power to veto any unfavorable positions or to prolong the negotiations beyond 2005 these decisions were ratified by the 34 leaders of the hemisphere at second summit of the americas held april 1819 1998 in santiago chile15 the united states also gained number of its objectives at the costa rican meeting among these were the establishment of study groups on labor and the environment and the designation of miami as the official site of the negotiations until 2001 but the trade offs and compromises accepted left little doubt that mercosur has become strong regional grouping that is able to assert its economic interests forcefully as well as to play skilled diplomatic game mercosurs relationship to the proposed ftaa will remain an outstanding concern at the san jose ministerial last march agreement was reached that subregional agreements such as mercosur and nafta can coexist with the ftaa only to the extent that the rights and obligations under those agreements are not covered beyond those of the ftaa this agreement appears to fly in the face of the notion particularly popular in brazil that mercosur is an end in itself not stage toward ftaa 14 us agricultural exports to mercosur are likely to remain small compared to exports to asia or canada as mercosur continues to be net agricultural exporter 15 for fuller discussion see ahearn raymond j trade and the americas congressional research
