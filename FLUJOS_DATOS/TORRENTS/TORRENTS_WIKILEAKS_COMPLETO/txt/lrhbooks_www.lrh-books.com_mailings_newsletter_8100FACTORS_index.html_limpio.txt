the factors newsletter how do you attract prosurvival attention selfdeterminism and correction of an individual the correction of childnow get that as definition of what dives psychotic back into the pastits correction he misfigures for the future he knows hes been wrong because loss has occurred now he wants to remember it so that in future futures he will not again make the same mistake and lose so hes predicting the future from the present by addressing the past and this is very silly thats experience i know and the whole world runs on it i know but if you take the level of determinism of individuals who have been corrected great deal and the level of determinism of individuals who havent been corrected great deal and youll find out you have two entirely different levelsthe one who hasnt been corrected will have much higher level the mest universe does the most uncompromising correction its much worse than mama when you step out into space in the mest universe in body you fall

said well the problem about money yeah there isnt any problem about money truth be told any good printer can make more money than the government can anyway when you get yourself niceyou confront this thing called security very often it kind of digs you in behind the ramparts you know and you say ive kind of got to hold the fort here somehow or other because lets see i need to make two pounds because two pounds is two pounds and if i dont make two pounds so on i tell you something very funny money is an attention unit crown dollar mark franc is simply an attention unit and do you know that money can be regarded as attention and it follows exactly the laws of attention isnt that peculiar there is the lucky fluke of the guy who all of sudden opens up safe or something and finds he has eight billion dollars or something and he says now im going to take this out one dollar after another and im going to keep myself the rest of my life every once in while the police tear up some old
