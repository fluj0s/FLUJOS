fiscal year fy 2008 budget to congress the presidents budget predicted deficit of 239 billion for fy2008 and steady improvement of the federal governments fiscal position including surplus of 61 billion in fy2012 the last year projected major proposals included large defense supplementals for fy2007 and fy2008 extensions of the expiring tax cuts limited increases in domestic discretionary spending and limited increases in defense spending after fy2008 the administration also proposed temporary halt to the expanding reach of th alternative minimum tax amt in fy2007 and fy2008 medicare and medicaid were expected to grow more slowly the administrations july 2007 midsession review showed little change in the budget outlook for fy2008 through fy2012 although higher health outlays and war costs increased the expected fy2008 deficit slightly the fy2008 budget also discussed longterm fisc problems according to the longerterm projections from the administration the c ongressional budget office cbo and the government accountability office gao the impending retirement of the baby boom generation and rising health care costs will substantially expand spending over the coming decades on federal programs serving the elderly such as medicare social security and medicaid the longterm growth of outlays if left unchan ged or if not offset by new revenues could overwhelm the governments ability to finance its obligations in january 2007 the cbo released baseline projections of future budget outcomes under current law cbo projected fy2008 deficit of 98 billion 170 billion surplus in fy2012 and 249 billion surplus in fy2017 the baseline assumes the large tax cuts enacted in the first half of the decade expire as scheduled real discretionary spending is fixed and the alternative minimum tax is unchanged the house and senate adopted separate versions of the fy2008 budget resolution in march 2007 which would allow more domestic spending than the administration request and extend some expiring tax cuts with conditions the house and senate adopted conference agreement hrept 110153 on may 17 with projected fy2008 deficit of 252 billion by midjuly the house and senate committees on appropriations had approved most of the 12 regular appropriations bills at the end of fy2007 the house had passed all 12 appropriations bills and the senate had passed four the senate passed three more appropriations bills in october the president had said he would veto other appropri ations bills at the end of fy2007 congress passed the first hjres 52 of four continuing resolutions hr 3222 hjres 69 hjres 72 which in sequence funded government operations until the end of the calendar year on november 8 congress approved the laborhhseducation bill hr 3043 s 1710 which the president vetoed and defense bill hr 3222 pl 110116 which he signed on december 19 congress passed an omnibus bill hr 2764 that incorporated the 11 remaining regular appropriations bills on

report for fy2008 contained budget baseline and economic projections for fy2007 through fy2017 the report estimated an fy2008 baseline deficit of 98 billion down from the estimated fy2007 baseline deficit of 172 billion the cbo baseline showed fy2012 surplus of 170 billion and projected 249 billion surplus in fy2017 cbo baseline projections are computed using certain assumptions set by law these assumptions typically yield higher revenue estimates and projections of slower growth of discretionary spending relative to scenarios that independent forecasters consider likely three key assumptions incorporated in cbo baseline projections are that discretionary spending remains constant in inflationadjusted terms the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts fully expire after 2010 as current law specifies and the patch to the alternative minimum tax amt which expired at the end of calendar year 2006 will lapse after 2010 when most of the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 expire according to baseline projections receipts grow substantially the assumption that these tax cuts expire and that growth in discretionary spending is zero in real terms explains most of the declining deficit and the surpluses that emerge over the 10year baseline forecast window unless major policy changes are made federal deficits are expected to grow rapidly beyond the 10year forecast window in large part those future deficits would result from the retirement of the baby boom generation and growing health care costs cbos report includes the estimated budgetary effects on revenues and outlays of selected policies omitted from baseline estimates these include among few others estimates of the budgetary effects of making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent indexing the amt for inflation to limit its expanding coverage increasi ng discretionary appropriations at the rate of growth of gross domestic product gdp and freezing total discretionary appropriations at the level provided in fy2007 the first two reduce expe cted receipts the third increases expected outlays and the last reduces outlays in march 2007 cbo released its analysis of the presidents budget proposals based on its economic and budget models cbo forecast slightly higher revenues and smaller outlays implying fy2008 deficit of 226 billion somewhat smaller than 239 billion deficit in the presidents budget 5 by fy2012 cbo projected that the presidents proposals would produce deficit of 31 billion rather than the 61 billion surplus the administrations expected this difference in forecasts is largely due to the uncertainty of mediumterm projections for the five 5 the overall small change in revenues obscures much larger increases and decreases in the components of the changes that cbo shows in its report

presidents proposals was 790 billion while the presidents budget had cumulative net deficit estimate for the same period of 514 billion economic forecast and assumptions used in the presidents budget yielded larger revenues and somewhat larger outlays than cbos reestimates of the presidents proposals

for extending and making permanent most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts as well as extending other expiring tax provisions the presidents proposals would reduce estimated receipts by almost 600 billion between fy2008 and fy2012 relative to the baseline and by an estimated 19 trillion between fy2008 and fy2017 apart from higher debtservice costs resulting from the change 6 administration proposals according its own estimates would reduce mandatory spending by 96 billion over five years and by 309 billion over 10 years proposed policy changes include both spending reductions and some increasestermed augmentations by the administration the budget includes cost estimate of 637 billion over 10 years for proposed personal accounts for social security the administration estimates its proposals affecting mandatory spending including indirect effects and the outlay effects of tax proposals would yield fiveyear savings of 59 billion and 10year increases of 359 billion much of that projected increase is due to the proposed introduction of personal social security accounts the administrations budget provided limited information for years beyond fy2012 the budget includes estimates of the cumulative proposed revenue changes and proposed mandatory spending changes for the periods fy2008 through fy2012 and fy2008 through fy2017 but these projections omit data for the individual years after fy2012 estimates for other components of the budget or for budget totals beyond fy2012 were also omitted the president proposed eliminating reducing or reforming about 141 programs many of these proposals which would affect both discretionary and mandatory spending programs were also proposed last year 7 according to administration estimates those policy changes would cut 22 billion of budget authority in fy2008 compared to fy2007 the administrations midsession review msr released in july featured the same proposals as the presidents fy2008 budget issued in february8 administration estimates showed some deterioration in the fy2008 budget outlook since february in particular the msr fy2008 deficit estimate was 19 billion higher than the february estimate mix of technical reestimates economic changes and minor policy differences account for the changes slightly over onehalf of the increase in the cumulative fiveyear deficit estimate which jumped from 514 billion in the february outlook to 651 billion in the msr was due to unexpectedly fast growth in medicare and medicaid spending rising health care prices and hospital patient volumes were largely responsible for the faster medicare and medicaid spending rates 6 the administrations current services baseline estimates incorporate some of the administrations policy proposals such as the extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts the effect of the administrations proposals in this report are taken from omb tables measuring the full effect of the policy changes 7 these were issued february 12 2007 week after other budget documents were released 8 office of management and budget midsession review july 11 2007 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovomb budgetfy2008pdf08msrpdf

budget resolution sconres 21 this resolution specified expend itures and revenues that would yield fy2008 deficit estimated at 249 billion 10 billion more than the estimated deficit for the presidents proposal14 the budget resolution was projected to yield 132 billion surplus in fy2012 revenue and outlay levels proposed in the senate budget resolution differed substantially in some areas from those proposed by the president in particular the senate proposed higher levels of discretionary spending than the president yet the resolution would extend tax cuts slated to expire so long as the revenues lost by their continuation were offset the fy2008 totals in both the sbcreported resolution and versions passed by the senate on march 23 were almost identical although the amendments adopted by the senate during its deliberations on the budget resolution reduced the expected fy2012 surplus to 1 billion the house budget resolution hconres 99 reported by the house budget committee and passed by the house was expected to yield fy2008 deficit of 213 billion and fy2012 surplus of 153 billion like the senate resolution the house resolution required offsets to extend the expiring tax cuts

presidents the house and the senate foresee balanced budget in fy2012 although those forecasts are based on some assumptions that inspire skepticism among independent analysts15 the administration the house and the senate all assume for budgetary scoring purposes that funding for military operations after fy2008 will be minimal or nonexistent outlays would be much higher were these war costs included in projections these proposals also all assume sharply larger portion of middleincome taxpayers will become subject to the alternative minimum tax amt after fy2008 even though in recent years congress and the president have agreed to annual fixes to limit the amts reach assuming that amt fixes will longer continue boosts estimated tax revenues the presidents budget assumes little or growth in discretionary spending over the five years while historically discretionary outlays have been more likely to grow at the same rate as the overall economy the house and senate budget resolutions assume that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will expire unless 13 for additional details regarding the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 see crs report rl34298 consolidated appropriations act for

the quality of economic forecasts are statistical unbiasedness meaning that average forecast errors over time are close to zero and accuracy meaning that forecast errors should be small16 budget forecasts unlike most other types of economic forecasts are constructed in order to estimate the incremental costs of policy changes ie scoring in consistent manner if policy changes do occur actual budget outcomes will then differ from baseline estimates technical factors and changes in economic conditions also affect budget forecasts in recent years omb and cbo have provided some measures of the accuracy and statistical unbiasedness of their forecasts budget projections depend on models that reflect assumptions about the structure of the economy expected tax and program changes and how these interact along with other factors that affect the budget changed economic conditions such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower inflation or changes in spending and tax policies affect budget estimates and projections in addition technical components of the budget models may change as the structure of the economy evolves and as econometric techniques advance budget estimates depend in part on some stable trends such as population demographics for instance many baby boomers will retire in the next decade leading to higher spending for medicare and social security estimating the grow th in these beneficiary populations eligible for these programs is relatively straightforward budget estimates also depend on factors that are difficult to predict such as future productivity growth and business cycles some factors that affect the federal revenues such as financial market trends can be extremely volatile small changes in economic conditions such as gdp growth can produce large changes in the budget estimates according to cbo estimates pe rsistent 01 decrease in the real gdp growth rate would increase the deficit including interest costs by 61 billion cumulatively over five year period and by 273 billion over 10 years faster gdp growth would decrease the deficit or increase surplus in addition new government policies also affect budget estimates for example extending military operations in iraq or afghanistan or allowing tax cuts to lapse would also change the budget outlook

presidents fy2008 budget includes some measures of the accuracy and statistical bias of previous forecasts17 this analysis examines why administration february 2005 budget estimates differed from actual results for fy2006 16 there may be tradeoff between statistical unbiasedness and accuracy because some statistically biased met hods may generate forecasts with greater accuracy also other properties of forecasts may be important such as predicting turning points in economic trends for nontechnical discussion of economic forecasting see peter kennedy guide to econometrics 3rd ed boston

the forecast window extends to later years because more policy and economic changes can occur in the interim18 omb analyzed quarter century of february budget estimates of the deficit and estimated the standard deviation for the current fiscal year was 71 billion the standard deviation for the corresponding fiveyearsahead forecast was estimated at 289 billion about four times larger omb then computed upper and lower bounds for deficit projections using those standard deviations19 the gap between these upper and lower bounds at the end of fiveyear period was over 11 trillion suggesting that the administrations 61 billion point estimate for the fy2012 surplus like all fiveyearsahead forecasts of fiscal balance is very imprecise cbo has analyzed the track record of its budget estimates extensively and now routinely includes information about the forecast accuracy of its baseline projections in its budget publications 20 cbo also provides detailed explanations of why its projections differ from omb projections21 g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 the senate budget committee sbc reported its version of the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 on march

billion 5524 for fy2008 almost all of the increase comes from the administrations proposed additional funding for the administrationlabeled security activities which comprise spending for defense homeland security and foreign affairs most of the proposed additional security funding is for the wars in iraq and afghanistan the budget also proposes an 8 billion increase 18 for nonsecurity discretionary spending and 10 billion 07 reduction in mandatory spending compared to baseline levels the administrations budget shows 7 billion 28 increase in net interest payments from baseline levels in fy2008 due to increased federal borrowing 24 ombs current services baseline estimates like cbos baseline estimates are designed to provide neutral benchmark against which policy proposals can be measured for outlays the modified baseline used this year by omb assumes that federal pay adjustment assumptions reflect the usual first full pay period in january start of paycompatibilityadjusted raises rather than october 1 that emer gency spending is not extended and that the debt service interest payment changes are included in the baseline these modifications reduced the reported current services baseline outlay estimate by approximately 41 billion in fy2008 and by 84 billion in fy2012

fy2008 is due to many factors including automatic costofliving adjustments in many federal programs growth in populations eligible for program benefits policy changes and higher costs due to inflation of goods and services bought by the federal government the administrations proposals would reduce ou tlays from 202 of gdp in fy2007 to 200 of gdp in fy2008 between fy1966 and fy2006 ou tlays averaged 206 of gdp by fy2012 the administrations projections showed outlays falling to 183 of gdp lower than in any year since fy1960 the administration projected fall of 07 of gdp in nondefense discretionary spending over the five years defense spending was projected to fall by 11 of gdp over the same period mandatory programs increase their share of gdp by 03 while net interest falls by 02 of gdp both medicare and medicaid are expected by the administration to grow slightly as percentages of gdp despite proposals to trim their growth the presidents budget would increase defense spending by 60 from fy2007 569 billion to fy2008 603 billion incorporating the twoye ar 140 billion requested supplemental for military actions overseas which congress passed and became law on may 25 2007 pl 110 28 by fy2012 according to administration projections defense spending will drop to 546 billion for fy2008 the administrations proposed level of nondefense discretionary spending exceeds the current services baseline estimate by 19 billion over the five years the current services estimates for nondefense discretionary outlays grows by an average 07 annually while the administrations proposed levels fall by an average 07 annually the administrations budget showed nondefense discretionary spending fal ling from 511 billion in fy2007 and fy2008 to 493 billion in fy2012 as shares of gdp the fall is substantial dropping from 37 of gdp in fy2007 to 35 of gdp in fy2008 to 28 of gdp in fy2012 if these levels are achieved nondefense discretionary spending would be smaller as percentage of gdp in fy2012 than in any year since fy1962 how the administration planned to achieve these reductions was largely unspecified mandatory spending in the presidents budget grows by 42 62 billion from fy2007 to fy2008 the budget included proposals to reduce from baseline levels mandatory outlays by 10 billion in fy2008 the reductions would be ac hieved by slowing the growth of selected mandatory spending

showed outlays rising from 199 of gdp in fy2007 to 208 of gdp in fy2008 before easing back to 200 of gdp in fy2012 the baseline projections put fy2017 outlays at 203 of gdp because cbo current law baseline estimates assume that discretionary spending does not change in real terms as the economy grows many analysts believe it understates likely future growth in discretionary spending according

defense discretionary spending as percentage of gdp according to cbo baseline projections will fall from 36 of gdp in fy2007 to 32 of gdp in fy2012 and to 29 of gdp in fy2017 because currentlaw baseline projections are based on the assumption that discretionary spending does not grow in real terms while the economy is projected to continue growing both the cbo and administration projections

gdp in fy2000 outlays in the midsession review msr are all slightly above those in the february budget difference mostly due to reestimation rather than policy changes the alternative estimate based on cboestimated policy alternatives to the currentlaw baseline incorporates two important assumptions that directly affect outlays first discretionary appropriations grow at the same rate as the overall economy in contrast to the baseline assumption that discretionary spending is constant in real terms second the number of troops deployed in iraq and afghanistan as well as other antiterror activities is assumed to fall to 75000 by fy2013 both of these assumptions increase outlays above the baseline projections increasing the deficit or reducing possible future surplus increasing federal debt and subsequent net interest payments the alternative estimate includes these higher net interest payments in addition the alternative estimate for outlays includes the outlay effects of the changes that occur in the alternative estimate for receipts which is described in more detail in the next section these outlay effects for the most part reflect higher net interest payments according

congress and the president enact policies that cause federal spending to exceed federal receipts deficits increase government debt held by the public generally increasing net interest payments surpluses occur when federal receipts exceed outlays which reduces federal debt held by the public 33 this can in turn reduce net interest payments many economists believe that running surpluses when

to cbos january 2007 baseline estimates th federal deficit is projected to fall both in dollar terms and as percentage of gdp through fy2011 surpluses are projected to appear from fy2012 through fy2017 cbo by law must use assumptions for baseline projections that some analysts consider optimistic on the revenue side the baseline assumes the lack of fix to the expanding coverage of the amt and as required by current law the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts at the end of calendar year 2010 these would boost revenues considerably compared to restricting amt expansion and extending the tax cuts on the spending side discretionary spending is assumed to grow at the rate of inflation which is at slower rate than it has grown recently and mandatory spending grows with eligible populations and costofliving adjustments some projections using alternative assumptions show less optimistic fiscal outlook than the path of shrinking deficits and future surpluses depicted by cbo baseline projections substituting selection of alternative scenarios for policy assumptions used in the january cbo baseline produces growing deficit from fy2007 through fy2017 these selected alternative policies limit the growing coverage of the amt extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and increase discretionary spending at the rate of gdp grow th see the cbobased alternative estimate in

federal fiscal policies is unsustainable the nations aging population combined with health care costs that seem likely to continue rising faster than per capita gdp raises spending in federal programs for the elderly to such an extent that the government faces constantly rising deficits and federal debt burden that ultimately spirals out of control although the timing of deficits nd resulting debt build up varies depending on the assumptions used we are on an unsustainable fiscal path 36 keeping future federal outlays at 20 of gdp approximately its current share and leaving fiscal policies unchanged according to cbo projections would require drastic reductions in all spending other than that for medicare social security and medicaid former cbo acting director stated that by 2030 spending for those programs medicare social security and medicaid is projected to reach roughly 15 percent of gdp if that increase happened the rest of the budget would have to be cut by more than half to keep overall spending close to 20 of gdp 37 cbo report on the longterm fiscal outlook concluded that over the next halfcentury the united states will confront the challenge of conducting its fiscal policy in the face of the retirement of the babyboom generation under current policies the aging of the population is likely to combine with rapidly rising health care costs to create an evergrowing demand for resources to finance federal spending for mandatory programs such as medicare medicaid and social security attaining fiscal stability in the coming decades will probably require substantial reductions in the projected growth of spending and perhaps also sizable increase in taxes as share of the economy 38 the administration indicated similar concerns about the outlook for the budget over the long term in the presidents fy2008 budget the current structure of the federal governments major entitlement programs will place growing and unsustainable burden on the budget in the longterm by 2050 spending on these three entitlement programs social security medicare and medicaid is projected to be more than 15 percent of gdp or more than twice as large as spending on all other programs combined excluding interest on the public debt 39 the social security medicare and medicaid programs present different challenges to the long term fiscal position of the federal government estimates of the longterm fiscal gap between social security oasdi outlays and revenues as proportion of longterm gdp are generally much smaller than estimates of longterm fiscal gap between medicare

growth and interest rates some analysts willing to make more felicitous assumptions about productivity growth present more optimistic longterm outlook for social security41 spending projections for medicare and medicaid are sensitive to changes in medical inflation in past years many projections that medical inflation would slow have turned out to be overly optimistic42 unexpected events such as the hurricanes in 2005 or an economic downturn can change the shortterm budget outlook the interplay of policy demographics and medical care costs however will in large part determine the longterm budget outlook the retirement of the baby boom generation which will rapidly expand the population eligible for federal programs serving the elderly along with continuing increase in health care costs will put enormous pressure on the federal budget without policy changes these programs could overwhelm the rest of the budget not only will the programs themselves be stressed but their growth could easily limit the governments flexibility in meeting its obligations or new needs as well as overwhelm the economys ability to provide the resources needed for the expanded programs
