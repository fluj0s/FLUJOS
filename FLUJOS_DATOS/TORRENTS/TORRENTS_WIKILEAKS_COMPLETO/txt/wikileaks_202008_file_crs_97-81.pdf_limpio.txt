divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9781social security recommendations of the 19941996 advisory council on social security summary in 1994 the secretary of health and human services hhs appointed the last quadrennial advisory council on social security at that time the social security act stipulated that every 4 years the secretary of hhs appoint an advisory council on social security for the purpose of reviewing the status of the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi usually regarded as social security trust funds as well as the hospital insurance and supplementary medical insurance medicare trust funds when announcing the appointment of the advisory council the secretary asked the council to focus only on the social security program and specifically requested that it examine the programs longrange financial status as well as the adequacy and equity of its benefits and the relative roles of the public and private sectors in providing retiremen t income although not stated as such this charge reflected general concern about social securitys longrange solvency and the growing loss of public confidence in the system these problems are reflected in the longrange projections of social securitys income and outgo although currently social securitys income exceeds its outgo its board of trustees projects that over the next 75 years its expenditures will exceed its income on average by 16 the primary reasons are demographic an aging post world war ii baby boom generation declining birth rates and incre asing life expectancies are creating an older society it is projected that by 2029 the programs trust funds would be fully depleted and the system would be technically insolvent on january 6 1997 the 19941996 advisory council on social security issued its report on ways to solve the programs longrange financing problems as the council could not reach consen on particular approach the report contains three different proposals that are intended to attain the goal of restoring longrange solvency to the social security system the first proposal labeled the maintain benefits plan keeps the programs benefit structure essentially the same by addressing most of the longrange deficit through revenue increases including an eventual rise in the payroll tax and minor benefit cuts to close the remaining gap it recommends that investing part of the socia l security trust funds in the stock market be considered the second labeled the individual account plan restores financial solvency most ly with reductions in benefits and in addition imposes mandatory employee contributions to individual savings accounts the third labeled the personal security account plan achieves longrange financial balance through major redesign of the system that gradually replaces major portion of the social security retirement benefit with individual private savings accountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9781contents the financial picture 1 the advisory councils report 2 the maintain

advisory councils since the beginning of the program but this is the last as part of pl 103296 which made the social security administration an independent agency in 1995 congress created permanent advisory board and abolished future advisory councilssocial security recommendations of the 19941996 advisory council on social security the 19941996 advisory council was appointed in 1994 under the requirements of thencurrent law1 which stipulated that every 4 years the secretary of health and human services hhs appoint an advisor council on social security for the purpose of reviewing the status of the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi usually regarded as social security trust funds as well as the hospital insurance hi and supplementary insurance medicare trust funds the law also required that the council consist of chairman and 12 other persons appointed by the secretary representing organizations of employers and employees the self employed and the public the secretary donna shalala appointed as chairman edward gramlich dean of the school of public policy at the university of michigan he and the other members of the council are listed on page 6 of this report when announcing the appointment of the advisory council the secretary of hhs asked the council to focus only on the social security program and specifically requested that it examine the programs longrange financial status as well as the adequacy and equity of its benefits and the relative roles of the public and private sectors in providing retirement income although not stated as such this charge reflected gener concern about social securitys longrange solvency and the growing loss of public confidence in the system the financial picture although currently social securitys income exceeds its outgo its board of trustees projects that over the next 75 years its expenditures will exceed its income on average by 16 the primary reasons are demographic an aging postworld war ii baby boom generation declining birth rates and increasing life expectancies are creating an older society the number of people 65 and older is predicted to nearly double by 2025 whereas the number of workers whose taxes will finance their social security benefits is projected to grow by only 17 as result the ratio ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9781crs2 2see the 1997 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal oldage and survivors insurance and disability insurance trust funds intermediate projectionsthe projected slide towards insolvency spending exceeds tax revenues in 2012 oasdi trust funds peak in 2018 oasdi funds insolvent in 2029workers to social security recipients is projected to fall from 32 to 1 today to 20 to 1 in 20302 excess social security revenues are invested in us government securities recorded to the oasdi trust funds maintained by the treasury department in april 1997 the trustees projected that the balance of these trust funds would peak at 29 trillion in 2018 however oasdi spending would begin lagging tax receipts in 2012 at that point general revenues would be needed first to pay interest on the securities held by the trust funds and then beginning in 2019 to redeem them by 2029 the trust funds would be fully depleted and the system would be technically insolvent the problem is not unprecedented in 1977 and 1983 congress enacted variety of measures to address financial probl ems similar to those currently being forecast among them were increases in payroll taxes partial taxation of the benefits received by higherincome recipients and gradual increase from 65 to 67 in social securitys full retirement age which is the age required to receive full benefits however those changes were not sufficient to maintain balance in the system in the latter part of the next century and this combined with more pessimistic projections of factors such as economic growth birth rates and the incidence of disability has led to the return of longterm deficit forecasts several bills were introduced in the 103rd and 104th congresses to deal with the issue bills in the 103rd included raising the full retirement age to 70 modifying cost oflivingadjustm ents colas and increasing taxes several bills in the 104th included privatizing portion of the program the advisory councils report the advisory council began to meet in 1994 during its deliberations general agreement was reached on the need to eliminate the longrange deficit and on some specific measures that would help to reduce program costs however consensus developed on single approach that would restore longrange solvency instead three different philosophies emerged each supported by different faction of the council one was based on the premise that as much of the programs benefits should be preserved as possible and thus part of the solution should include increases in the payroll tax rate another was based on the belief that the systems cost basically must be held within the current revenue structure but with mandatory individual savings added on to help provide adequate future retirement income the third was based on the idea that the system basically is unsustainable without fundamental restructuringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9781crs3 and that restructuring should shift more of the role of providing retirement income from social security to individual savings eventually three proposals emerged the first labeled the maintain benefits mb plan supported by six membe rs of the council addressed most of the long range deficit through revenue increases including rise in the social security payroll tax in 2045 and small cut in benefits to close the remaining gap it recommended that investing part of the social security trust funds in the stock market be considered the second labeled the individual account ia plan supported by two members of the council restored financial solvency without increasing the payroll tax but with more significant reductions in benefits and in addition imposed mandatory employee contributions to individual savings accounts based on the notion that the loss in social security benefits should be offset by increased individual savings the third labeled the personal security account psa plan supported by five members of the council likewise achieves longrange financial balance through fundamental redesign of the system by gradually replacing major portion of the retirement program with individual private savings accounts the three proposals share some features all would mandate social security coverage of newly hired state and local government employees increase the taxation of social security benefits reduce initial social security benefits by various changes in the benefit formula and assume that pending revisions in the consumer price index cpi will result in colas in the future that will be lower by 021 percentage points both the ia and psa plans raise the retirement age and modify surviving spouse benefits following is description of the specific features of each proposal sideby side comparison of the three proposals and current law is in the appendix the maintain benefits plan supported by council members ball johnson jones kourpias shea fierst 1 all state and local government employees hired after 1997 would be required to participate in social security 2 the number of years of highest earnings used in compu ting workers basic retirement benefit the primary insurance amount pia would increase from 35 to 36 in 1997 37 in 1998 and 38 in 1999 and thereafter it was suggested as an alternative that the payroll tax be increased in 1998 by 015 percentage points on employers and employees each 3 beginning in 1998 social security benefits would be taxable like other contributory pensions ie fully taxable except for the part of the pension attributable to the workers own contributions on which income tax has already been paid current law subjects maximum of 85 of benefits to the income tax and only if recipients income exceeds certain thresholds threequarters of current recipients pay income tax on their benefits because their income is under these thresholds these thresholds would be phased out between 1998httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9781crs4 3social security is designed to replace higher proportion of earnings for lowpaid workers than for highpaid workers this is done through formula that calculates the pia by applying three progressively lower replacement factors 90 32 and 15 to workers average career earnings for example for workers attaining age 62 in 1997 the formula is 90 of first 455 of average indexed monthly earnings aime plus 32 of next 2248 plus 15 of aime over 2741and 2007 also all of the revenue generated from the taxation of benefits would go to social security currently part goes to medicare 4 the payroll tax would go up by 08 percentage points on employers and employees each in 2045 5 as final possible measure it is urged that an option to invest part of the social security trust funds in stocks in funds indexed to reflect the overall performance of the market be further studied and evaluated the individual account plan supported by council members gramlich twinney 1 all state and local government employees hired after 1997 would be required to participate in social security 2 social security benefits would be taxable as in the mb plan but there is provision for the redirection of tax revenue from medicare to social security 3 the increase in the social security full retirement age to age 67 would be moved forward to apply to those born in 1949 and later and further increases in the full retirement age would be tied to further increases in longevity current law phases in the increase from age 65 in two steps by increas ing the age by 2 months for each year that person is born after 1937 until it reaches age 66 for those born in 1943 after 12year pause the age is increased again by raising the age by 2 months for each year that person is born after 1954 until it reaches age 67 for those born in 1960 and later the proposal eliminates this hiatus in increasing the full retirement age and indexes the full retirement age thereafter early retirement would still be available but would be reduced on an actuarial basis as the full retirement age rises 4 benefits especially for higherpaid workers gradually would be reduced ie compared to current law to do so the formula for determining the pia would be modified by gradually lowering the 32 and 15 replacement of earnings factors to 224 and 105 respectively by 20303 5 the computation of retired workers pia would by 1999 be based on the highest 38 years of earnings as described in the mb plan 6 beginning in 2000 benefits payable to dependent spouses would be gradually lowered from 50 to 33 of the workers pia by 2016httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9781crs5 4ie annuities would be indexed to rise with inflation and there would be guarantee that if the worker died before or slightly after retirement some portion of the value of the accrued savings would be payable in all cases if the worker is married joint and survivor annuity must be paid unless the spouse declines it7 surviving spouses benefits for twoearner couples would be augmented by assuring that aged widows and widowers would receive at least 75 of the social security benefits payable to the couple while both were still alive phased in over 1998 to 2037 8 beginning in 1998 workers would mandatorily contribute an additional 16 of their social security taxable earnings to individual accounts ias that would be held by the us government the accumulated funds would not be available to the worke r until he or she becomes eligible for retirement and would be converted to single or joint minimum guarantee indexed annuity4 when the worker elects retirement the personal security account plan supported by council members bok combs schieber vargas weaver 1 for workers under age 55 in 1998 5 percentage points of the employee share of the social security tax would be diverted to personal security accounts psas which would be invested at the discretion of the worker subject to regulatory restrictions to make sure they were invested in financial instruments widely available in financial markets and that they were held solely for retirement purposes the accounts would not be available until the worker is age 62 at which point they could be used by the worker for any purpose 2 for workers participating in the psas social security benefits would gradually be reduced ultimately retirement benefits would evolve into two tiers where the social security benefit tier 1 would be based solely on length of service eg workers with minimum of 35 years of coverage would receive the same amount about 410 month in 1996 dollars the social security retirement benefit of workers who are ages 25 to 54 in 1998 would be their accrued benefit under the current system plus prorated share of the tier 1 benefit 3 to finance the transition to the new system the us treasury would issue approximately 2 trillion in 1996 dollars in bonds to the public over the next 40 years the treasury bonds would be repaid by the excess of tax revenue that is projected to occur in the latter part of the transition period from about 2035 to 2069 4 workers and their employers would pay an additional payroll tax of 076 each 152 combined over the period 19982069 5 the earnings test would be eliminated gradually over 19982002 for individuals who have attained the full retirement age httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9781crs6 6 the full retirement age would increase as in the ia plan but in addition the age for earliest retirement would increase by the same amount until it reaches age 65 thereafter the early retirement age would remain at age 65 but further increases in the full retirement age because it would be indexed to rise with increases in longevity would increase the actuarial reduction applied to early retirement benefits 7 for persons disabled after 1997 the initial monthly benefit would be reduced by the same factor as that of worker retiring at age 65 in that year which means that disabled worke rs would receive less than the full pia if the relevant full retirement age is more than age 65 but in event would they receive less than 70 of the pia disabled workers would continue to convert to the retirement rolls at age 65 when their benefits would be recomputed unde r the new retirement rules 8 all state and local government employees hired after 1997 would be required to participate in social security 9 beginning in 1998 the maximum portion of social security benefits subject to taxation would be 50 and revenue from the taxation of benefits would go to medicare the income thresholds would be phased out over 19982007 when tier 1 social security benefits become available they would be 100 taxable but withdrawals from the psa would be taxfree 10 social security surviving spouse benefits would be modified as in the ia plan commission membership edward gramlich dean school of public policy university of michigan chairman of
