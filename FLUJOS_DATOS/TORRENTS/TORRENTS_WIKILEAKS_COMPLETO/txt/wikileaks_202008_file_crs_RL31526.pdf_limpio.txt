september 1939 congress at the presidents request modified the neutrality law by repealing the arms embargo and authorizing cash and carry exports of arms and munitions to belligerent powers8 in april 1934 the senate established the special committee on investigation of the munitions industry to conduct an i nquiry into the manufacture of and traffic in arms in the united states chaired by senator gerald p nye rnd who had introduced the resolution for the pane ls creation the committee conducted public hearings stressing the heavy profits rea lized by financiers and armament makers during world war i continuing until 1936 the committee is credited with strengthening isolationist sentiment in congress and the nation and setting the background for the neutrality acts of 1 935 1936 and 19379 thus through its investigations the climate of opinion it helped generate and the neutrality legislation that it nurtured the nye committee constituted something of brake on the efforts of the roosevelt administration to strengthen and expand the national defense program or to pursue more internationalist foreign policy the nye committee was longer c oncern to fdr as america became engaged in world war ii but two other congressional panels likely occupied white house thinking as the president contemplated his wartime relationship with congress the first was house creati on the special committee to investigate american activities initially establishe d in 1938 the panel had broad mandate to probe unamerican propaganda activities in the united states the diffusion of subversive and unamerican propaganda that is instigated from foreign countries or of domestic origin nd all other questions in rela tion thereto that would aid congress in any necessary remedial legislation10 while the committees primary target was the communist party and its affiliates its mandate to pursue the perpetrators of subversive and unameri can propaganda of either domestic or foreign origin could be regarded as author ity to investigate any private organization promoting social political or economic change to probe any federal entity including the armed forces regarding public affairs and public education activities or even to venture into the realm of foreign policy however the chairman of the committee representative martin dies dtx was conservative who was on record as an opponent of

house leaders from the presidents party sought to keep dies and his committee narrowly focused so as to avoid his wandering into any aspect of the war effort and making demands for sensitive information such strategy of containment could not be contemplated in the case of the other committee of concern the senate special committ ee to investigate the national defense program established in march 1941 war mobilization and defense production were the primary elemen ts of its mandate the panel had been created on the initiative of senator harry s truman dmo who had just been elected to his second term and was concerne d that defense contracts were not being fairly allocated within the country virtually unknown outside his home state truman gradually gained visibility by supporting the new deal although the white house did not want rogue committ ee producing unwelcomed publicity about defense contracting and the progress of mobilization effo rts trumans proposal and the prospect of his leading such panel proved to be an acceptable alternative to similar efforts by antine w dealers and republicans12 war entry the attack on pearl harbor and the us declaration of war the following day launched the president and congress on their wartime relationship ironically the circumstances of the att ack and the immediate response of american armed forces to it became one of the first information issues for the two branches due to its insular location some 2400 miles southwest of califor nia and its totally military status pearl harbor in the aftermath of the japanese attack was impervious to the news media and the surrounding rritory of hawaii was cloaked in martial law the president seemingly had close control over information about the damage that had been inflicted yet by the evening of december 8 new york times washington bureau chief arthur krock had learned that 90 of the fleet had been disabled at pearl harbor13 still for many weeks the public did not learn of the extent of the loss those in possession of the information being afraid that its disclosure would invite japanese amphibious assault on the islands nonetheless by february 1942 blame was being fixed senator david i walsh the chairman of the naval affairs committee advanced the theory that the executive branch wa s wholly responsible for pearl harbor thus exculpating congress and

happened at pearl harbor he said the operations at pearl harbor were an executive function and responsibility for them was lodged in the departments14 thus waiting game ensued president roosevelt sought to satisfy congress and the public with fact finding report prepared by an investigating commission under the chairmanship of supreme c ourt associate justice owen roberts15 congress continued to hold the president and his subordinates both civilian and military responsible for american defenses at pearl harbor continued to pursue its own avenues of information about the ttack and gave indication that the roosevelt administration was absolved of an responsibility to inform the legislature about the prosecution of the war decl ared in response to the attack as the course of the war became more certain and the prospect of the japanese navy making any return to the hawa iian islands receded congress in 1944 extension of all statutes resolutions ws articles and regulations affecting the possible prosecution of any person or persons military or civil connected with the pearl harbor catastrophe of december 7 1941 or involved in any other possible or apparent dereliction of duty or crime or offense against the united states also directed the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy to create boards of inquiry to examine the pearl harbor attack16 finally about month after the surrender of japan congress mandated the joint committee on the investigation of the pearl harbor attack to make full and complete investigation of the facts relating to the events and circumstances leading up to and following the attack made by japanese armed forces upon pearl harbor chaired by senator alben w barkley dky the panel held extensive hear ings between november 11 1945 and may 31 1946 and reviewed as well the work of the roberts commission and the army and navy boards investigating the pearl rbor attack reporting in july 1946 bipartisan majority of the joint committee blamed the inadequacies of the national defense system for the poor response at p earl harbor while minority regarded the tragedy as primarily failure of men but at this late date such conclusions garnered little public interest17 immediately after the pearl harbor att ack senator arthur h vandenberg r had advanced the idea of creating single committee to serve as congressional liaison to the executive branch on the c onduct of the war the model vandenberg had in mind was the joint committee on the conduct of the war from the civil war era18 lacking in details regarding such

committee congress dispersed control over wide number of st anding committees and newly created investigation committees during the war also the state war and navy departments revealed information to relevant legislative committees which was not revealed to the whole congress or to the public in addition the president held weekly free and open discussions with the political leaders of the house and senate and speaker sam rayburn once told the house that these are not blowpulling conferences19 among the initial investigating committees were the aforementioned truman panel established in 1941 the house select committee investigating national defense migration 1940 which expande d its activities to parallel the truman committee th senate special committee to investigate gasoline and fueloil

proliferation of investigation committees was one of the singular characteristics of the war congress the emphasis on investigation on the control of policy after the passage of an act was spontaneous congressional reaction as it were to the increasing number of activities with which the administrative branch was concerned20 nonetheless because method was worked out by which congress as whole was informed on the developments of the war in the aggregate members of congress had more in timate knowledge of how the war was going than the average reader of metropolitan newspaper21 when secret

army nd the navy developed cooperative and sympathetic relationship with the congressional armed services committees senior officers confided in these committees and relied on them for political support congress played very small role either as critic or as participant in the several military and militarypolitical conferences in which the united states participated during the war although it was given some general information on the decisions made at these conferences the president discussed the results of the casablanca conference 1943 where the policy of unconditional surrender was developed in an offtherecord conv ersation with some eleven leaders from congress and with representatives of the state war and navy departments on the quebec conference 1943 the presiden t sent report to congress in which he defended the policy of keeping some matters secret it was difficult to remain silent he said when unjustified attack and criticism come from those who are not in position to have all the facts and he asked for faith that decisions were being made on better evidence than critics had implied secretary of state hull spoke before joint session of cong ress following the moscow conference 1943 president roosevelt also addr essed congressas it happened for the last timeon the results of the yalta conference 194523 during the prosecution of the war congress appears to have been willing to allow the president to prescribe military strategy and foreign policy and was seemingly satisfied at the time with the arrangements for being informed by the president about such matters c ongress conducted more than hundred investigations during the second world war exploring many aspects of war policy but falling short of investigatin g the actual conduct of the war24 prior to becoming vice president in 1944 senator truman as chairman of the senate special committee to investigate the national defe nse program repeatedly renounced any desire to intrude into military strategy or tactics when his investigators uncovered enormous and unexplained expenditures fo r something called the manhattan project he telephoned secretary of war henry l stimson told thats matter which i know all about personally and i am only one of the group of two or three men in the whole world who know about it very important secret velopment truman assured stimson that you wont have to say another word to me25 ironically with fdrs death in april 1945 it would be s timsons duty to inform president truman about the production of the atomic bomb by the manhattan project the truman committee performed splendidl in its principal role as production watchdog perhaps the greatest of the committees accomplishments was the high level of public confidence

and economic stabilitythat would continue to charge the political atmosphere the years immediately following the conclusion of world war ii were also time of change for congress as had been the case after previous wars the return to peace activated congressional desire to dismantle the executives war machinery much of congress antagonism to the war agencies stemmed from recognition that the gigantic executive establishment was making it increasingly difficult for the legislature to maintain its function as coequal branch of government as the war progressed the problem became so disturbing to the responsible leaders of both parties that there was general agreement that something would have to be done about it when the war was over27 one of the first steps taken by congress wa

created by an executive order as quickly as it could congress reduced the massive wartime apparatus by repealing aut horizations and grants of power terminating agencies abolishing administrative positions and pr oviding for the transfer of government undertakings to private business30 to assist with this effort congress in 1947 mandated the commission on the organization of the executive branch of the government which became known as the hoover commission in popular reference to the panels chairman form er president herbert hoover31 another accomplishment the legisla tive reorganization act of 1946 reduced the number of house and senate standing committees adjusted their legislative jurisdictions accordingly encouraged c ontinuous watchfulness of the execution by the administrative agencies concerned of any laws the subject matter of which is within the jurisdiction of the standing committees and expanded the capacity of the legislative reference service as

consolidation of the committees tended to strengthen the position of conservative chairmen particularly southern democr ats who had opposed the new deal and now were resistant to many of the

major foreign policy goal of the united states was to contain communism concerns that the loss of one country to communists would lead to co mmunist takeover in another country and so on fueled the

constitutional authority necessary to act ilaterally there was any reason for either or both chambers to pass resolution authorizing him to act he replied i think the members of congre ss would

hearings to consider the possibility of modifying or replacing the resolution in that same year the senate com mittee on foreign relations held hearings on national commitments resolution122 the committee report included this assessment of the resolution and the role of congress in its passage the gulf of tonkin resolution represen ts the extreme point in the process of constitutional erosion that began in the first year of this century couched in broad terms the resolution constitutes an acknowledgment of virtually unlimited presidential control of the armed forces it is of more than historical importance that the congress now ask itself why it was prepared to acquiesce in the transfer to the executive of power which beyond any doubt was intended by the constitution to be exercised by congress123 the report on national commitments from the committee on foreign relations also suggested why congress acted as it did in 1964124 there was sense of urgency congress believed it was demonstrating its unity with and support for the president by passing the resolution the nations leaders and the public focused on national security yet paid little attention to the war power the committee also stated that in the case of the gulf of tonkin resolution there was discrepancy between the language of the resolution and the in tent of congress although the language of the resolution lends itself to the in terpretation that congress was consenting in advance to fullscale war in asia should the president think it necessary that was not the expectation of congress at the time in adopting the resolution congress was closer to believing that it was helping to prevent largescale war by taking firm stand than it was laying the legal basis for the conduct of such war the committee concluded that in adopting resolution with such sweeping language congress committed the error of making personal judgment as to how president johnson would implem ent the resolution when it had responsibility to make an institutional judgment first as to what any president would do with so great an acknowledgment of power and second as to whether under the constitution congress had the right to grant or concede the authority in question125httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31526crs31 126 federation of american scie ntists operation powerpack fas military analysis network available at

criticized though for the slow pace of bringing troops home the president responded to such criticisms by describing the benefits of gradual withdrawal first he tied the rate of withdrawal to south vietnams prog ress in developing its military capabilities and the lessening of enemy military activities aiding south vietnam in these efforts besides expecta tions of it ensuring success was necessary in nixons view to avoid his being portray ed as the president who lost vietnam and to avoid the accompanying political fallout140 another consideration was bringing the war to an end in an appropriate manner141 for nixon and his administration this meant achieving peace with honor142 time was needed for the paris peace talks to progress satisfactorily so that the united states and other signatories could claim that peace with honor had been achieved time alone would not be sufficient however in bringing the war to an appropriate conclu sion as discussed below the south vietnamese were unable to fend off the viet cong by themselves yet the white house consistent with its policy of vietnamization had pledged to bring amer ican troops home striving to meet its commitments on both fronts the nixon administration resorted to secretive practices in employing the military it could escalate only covertly since almost all americans demanded that th war wind down on nixons watch143 for example very early in his first term nixon had us military aircraft launch thousands of legal bombing raids against the north in the name of protective reaction protective reaction strikes into north vietnam were allowed but only against antiaircraft sites in north vietnam whenever their radar locked on to american reconnaissance flights144 in early 1969 the administration also increased the number of raids into laos and began bombi ng portions of cambodia in an effort to disrupt the north vietnamese supply system the north vietnamese used trails such as the ho chi minh trail that ran

in these shortcuts giving away that which is not its to give notably the war power which the framers of the constitution vested not in the executive but deliberately and most exclusively in the

assessment of congresss actions on the fo rmosa middle east cuba and gulf of tonkin resolutions the committee report noted that each situation appeared to require urgent action there were firm hist orical guidelines on what to do the resolutions were necessary as expressi ons of national unity and executive actions ballooned beyond original c ongressional expectations151 the report also noted that following world war ii the government focused on national security but paid little attention to constitutional matters the committee recommended that for any joint resolutions in the future involving the use or possible use of the armed forces cong ress ought to debate thoroughly each one so that its intent becomes known use authorize empower or similar words to show that congress has the authority to authorize the initiation of war and that it is giving the presid ent power he would not otherwise have be as explicit as possible in the resolution about the circumstan ces place and purpose for using military intervention and include sunset provision which would assure that congress would have an opportunity to review its decision and terminate or extend the grant of authority given to the president152 speaking at news conference held prior to the resolutions passage nixon argued that president should not have to consult with the senate during crisis to bolster his argument nixon noted that the president had to respond immediately in 1958 when eisenhower sent troops into lebanon and in 1964 when johnson orchestrated the evacuation of missionaries from the congo153

that this debt should be forgiven in as much as iraq had served as shie ld against iran moreover kuwait was contributing to low interna tional oil prices by exceeding its oil production quota set by

ensus of public and congressional opinion continued to support opposition to iraqs aggression and the protection of saudi arabia however views were shifting on capitol hill several congressiona l committees subjected administration representatives to unexpectedly tough questioning over proposed accelerated arms sales to saudi arabia many in congress also began to insist that any move to war must include close consultati on with congress as well as formal congressional declaration or other author ization such sentiments came not only from democratic leaders but from ch prominent republicans as senate minority leader robert dole rks and senator richard lugar rin212 when resolutions supporting the actions taken by president bush in response to the invasion of kuwait came under

more widespread public uncertainty about usled offensive ag ainst iraq according to new york times cbs news public opinion poll of october 810 the pres idents gulf policie s were supported by 57 of

indicated that some 200000 personnel would be deployed and th rotation of troops in and out of the region was being disc ontinued some critics thought the troop increase was premature and reflected lack of confidence in the effects of economic sanctions to induce iraq to leave kuwait congressional leaders were taken by surprise because mention of the anticip ated personnel increase had been made

congress had occurred on october 28 and assured congressional leaders that he was not seeking to go to war217 on november 20 45 democratic house memb ers filed suit in us district court to obtain an injunction to bar bush from using force to push iraq from kuwait without first seeking congressional authorization the suit ronald v dellums et v george bush was turned aside in ruling handed down on december 12 by judge harold h green sic in hi s opinion green said that the issue was not yet ripe meaning that it would have been premature for the court to rule since congress as whole had not yet taken any stand on the issue at the same time however green added that congress alone possessed the power to declare war218 shortly thereafter on november 29 the bush administration obtained security council agreement on resolution 678 authorizin g the use of force to expel iraq from kuwait after january 15 1991 when the 102nd congress convened on january 3 1991 the presidents party was in minority status in both the house 267167 and the senate 5644 with the january 15 deadline of resolution 678 looming on th horizon many members wanted to give the sanctions more time to take effect and objected to going to war shortly after the time allowed for diplomatic resolve had expired congress and the bush administration also were in dispute over the presidents constitutional authority to order offensive actions against iraq wh us forces had not been attacked219 the president had been reminded of this disagreement at white house breakfast conference with the leadership on the morning of the day that the new congress convened220 with some sense that he had enough supporting votes president bush sent january 8 letter to the congressional leadership requesting the adoption of resolution stating that congress supports the use of all necessary means to implement security council resolution 678 saying this action would send the clearest possible message to saddam husse in that he must withdraw without condition or delay from kuwait221 attempts to fashion such resolution were briefly delayed by an attempt at negotiations between the united states and iraq in geneva on january 9 the meeting contri buted nothing to realizing an iraqi withdrawal but the conduct of the iraqi fo reign minister had the unintended effect of solidifying support among some member s of congress for the presidents threat to use force222httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31526crs49 223 congressional record vol 137 jan 12 1991 pp 9371019 224 ibid pp 10341140 225 ibid pp 1030 1141 105 stat 3 226

commitment of american armed forces to condition of overseas military conflict not the least of these are the majo rity or minority status of the presidents political party in the house and the senate the extent of public congressional and international support for the president s action the number of personnel committed and the conditions of harm they face the anticipated duration of the comm itment and the diplomatic conditions surroundi ng the commitment other important considerations are the nature of the informing activitya presidential speech to the nation or joint session of congress informal remarks by the president at the white house briefing by an administration representative testimony before congressional committee by administration officials proffered documents or conversation about course of action also who in congress is being informedthe leadership of both houses lected committee chairs of one or both chambers certain members who are supportive of the presiden ts action or the membership of the house and the senate in joint session wh ether personally or through aides the president usually offers congress information about events that have already transpired it is seemingly unusual for president to include members of congress directly in his decisionmaking although advice may be solicite d or offered without invitation without any indication of its acceptability indeed although president may honor the perceived obligation to inform congress about the commitment of american armed forces to condition of overseas military conflict members may well be dissatisfied with the manner in which the information is provided the contents offered the continued unilateral direction of the commitment by the president and in some cases the br oad expansion of commitment made by congress in response to specific incident
