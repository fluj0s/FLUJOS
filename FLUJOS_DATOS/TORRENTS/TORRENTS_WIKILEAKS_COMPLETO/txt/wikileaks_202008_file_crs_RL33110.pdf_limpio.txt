military operations to provide in country support at bases to provide special pay for deployed pers onnel and to repair replace and upgrade warworn equipment dods baseline or re gular budget covers

military capabilities fy2009 bridge fund finances war costs through june 2009 when the administration submitted its original request in january 2008 the defense department stated that its intent was for the br idge fund to last until after new administration was inplace1 with the 66 billion provided for fy2009 in the bridge fund included with the latest supp lemental congress ensured that war funding would last through june or july 2009 ch eck or until after new administration was in place2 based on fy2008 spending rates for army operations the service with the largest war funding demands and by mporarily tapping both the fy2009 bridge and tapping baseline funds the army could finance war costs until july 2009 assuming that troop levels rema in at the postsurge level of 15 brigade combat teams in iraq this is conservative estimate since troop levels in fy2009 could be lower than in fy2008 when 20 brigades were in pl ace for the first part of the year for the surge and were then gradually withdrawn in the latter part of the fiscal year3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33110crs3 war cost issues in the 110th congress this report is designed to answer fre quently asked questions as well as to address some of the major war cost issues that arose in the 110th congress and are likely to confront the next congress as well some of the most commonly asked ques tions center on total warrelated costs how much has congress appropriated in total and for each of the three missions since the 911 attacks operation iraqi freedom iraq operation enduring freedom afghanistan and other global war on terror operations and op eration noble eagle enhanced security for defense bases for defense foreign operations and related va medical care how and why have average monthly dod obligations changed over time for each mission how long the army can last with currently available funding how could war cost requests be made more transparent and what are the problems with current war cost reporting current war cost issues that have been addressed in the past and are likely to confront the new congress include the following what are the bounds of future war costs under various scenarios assuming more or less gradual draw downs in the number of troops over the next several years how large and how urgent are reconstitution and reset costs for repair and replacement of warworn equipment and what is appropriately consider ed to be emergency warrelated procurement as opposed to dods ongoing modernization efforts how to judge and respond to readin ess problems that stem from war operations what are the pros and cons of continued reliance on emergency supplementals to fund dod war costs what mechanisms can congress use to increase iraqi burdensharing of warrelated costs to rebuild their security forces what types of congre ssional funding restric tions are available to affect policy options for iraq this report begins by providing crs timates of the amount appropriated

two scenarios bound the most likely alternatives in the next ten years while others might argue that maintaining current levels or withdrawing entirel could also be options these cbo projections assume that troops withdrawn return to the united states yet another option would be for some number of troops to remain deployed in neig hboring countries like kuwait these options do not reflect specific assumptions about whether withdrawals occur in iraq or in afghanistan cbo considers these to be rough projections rather than formal estimates in part because future costs are difficult to estimate given the problems with current information from dod on costs incurred to date the lack of outlays or actual expenditures for war because war and base line funds are mixed in the same accounts nor is information available on many of the key factors that determine costs such as personnel levels each year or the pace of operations15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33110crs14 15 continued

secretary of defense gates33 there has been limited discussion thus far of the cost implications of additional troop withdrawals how war funding could fall if additional tr oops are withdrawn will depend on the pace of withdrawals nd how many bases dod maintains well as whether and how many additi onal troops are sent to afgh anistan moreover the cost of the troops added in 2007is not necessarily guide to the effect on costs of further withdrawals because little if any additiona l infrastructure was required for their support34 at the same time the increase in troops wa s only in

levels at the end of the year were 10 higher when the surge was fully implemented compared to the beginning of the year35 an important factor in estimating the eff ects of further troop withdrawals

on war costs and the iraqi budget surplus included many calls fo r more burdensharing by iraq in the rebuilding of its security forces the h earing was held in response to recent gao report report that estimated that the iraqis could accumulate surplus of from 67 billion to 79 billion by 2008 depending on oil prices and production though those amounts could be reduced with the augu st passage of an iraqi supplemental39 iraqs ability to pay for the expansion and improvement of its security forces depends on several factors ranging from the effects of attacks on the pipelines and corruption on production to reaching consensu s within the country on managing and distributing oil revenues40 during the hearing members raised concerns about the iraqi governments recent spending rate of below 30 for investment projects41 about 70 of all us funds to train and equip iraqi forces have been obligated or contracted for though the am ount spent has not been reported42 this push to require iraq to share the burden of rebuilding its security forces is also evident in new restrictions recently enacted that prohibit or place restrictions on us funding of infrastructure projects in iraq

another major unsettled war cost issue that may arise during consideration of the fy2008 supplemental this spring and the fy2009 bridge fund once it is presented to congress is the amount of f unds needed to reset or restore the services equipment to prewar levels in its fy2008 dod requested 46 billion for reconstitution primarily pr ocurement funds in the fy2008 congress funded only small portion of that request45 the largest single reason for the increase is war costs between fy2004 and fy2007 is the amount requested and received by dod for reset although repair and replacemen t costs might be expected to grow over time as operations wear down equipment it appears that much of the growth reflects broadening of the defin ition of what is required46 dod changes definition of war costs for the past ten years dod financial regulations have defined the cost of contingencies to include only incremental costs directly related to operations until october 2006 that guidance was largely used by the services to prepare their estimates for iraq and gwot the guidance required that the service show assumptions about tr oop levels operational tempo and reconstitution and limits requests to incrementa l costs that would not have been incurred had the contingency operation not been s upported investment requests are also to be incremental and included only if the expenditures were necessary to support contingency operation47 little of this information was provided to congress in dods requests in the july 19 2006 guidance to the services for developing the fy2007 supplemental and fy2008 war cost requests these strictures were reiterated that guidance also prohibited including ar my modularity because it is already programmed in fy2007 and the outyears and

defense gordon england issued new guidance for requesting war funds to the services requiring them to submit new requests within two weeks that reflect the longer war on terror rather than strictly the requirements for war operations in ir aq afghanistan and other counterterror operations49 such substantial change would be expected to reflect guidance from the secretary of defense the office of management and budget and the president this new definition appeared to open the way for including far broader range of requirements particularly since the needs of the longer war are relatively undefined in its review of the fy2007 supplementa l the appropriators rejected certain procurement and depot mainte nance requests as either unexecutable or not clearly an emergency see crs report

additional force protection and replacement of stressed equipment much may be in response to mr englands new guidance to fund requirements for the longer war rather than dods traditional definition of war costs as strictly related to immediate war needs for example the navy initially request ed 450 million for six ea18g aircraft new electronic warfare version of th f18 and the air force 389 million for two joint strike fighters an aircraft just tering production such new aircraft would not be delivered for about three years and so could not be used meet immediate war needs other new aircraft in

requirements reflect th stress on equipment from operations the accuracy of services estimates has not b een determined recen tly gao testified that until fy2007 the army with the largest rese t

estimated that 40 of the armys war requests were not directly for reset needs63 dods definition of reset now include s not only replacing battle losses typically about 10 of the total quipment repair about half but also recapitalization that typically upgrades current equipment and repair and replacement of prepositioned quipment stored overseas that has been tapped to meet war needs the army has been planning to recapitalize equipment and modernize prepositioned equipment stocks to match the new modular designs as part of its ongoing modernization for this reason it s not clear whether these expenses are actually incremental wartime requirements modularity as an emergency expense the distinction between war related and regular funding has also ben made murky by dod requests to treat conversion of army and mari ne corps units to new st andard configurations known as modularity and restructuring as war requirement in report last year for example the army acknowledged that since modularity requirements mirror the equipment requirements the army already procures for its units the ability to precisely track modularity funds is lost64 at dods request congress agreed to provide 5 billion in the fy2005 and in fy2006 supplementals for converting units with the understanding that dod would move these funds back to its regular budg et in later years the fy2007 supplemental again included 36 billion to convert tw army brigade teams and create an additional marine corps regimental combat team highlighting the issue of whether funds that are part of dods regular requi rements

argued that these costs should be considered warrelated because having more modular units makes it eas ier to rotate units to th war zone and hence would extend the time between deployments giving soldiers more time at home or dwell time and hence improving readiness this conclusion has been questioned in studies by cbo and the rand both studies found that modularity would only marginally improve rotation schedules cbo estimated that the armys modularity initiative would only make available an additional 6000 to 7000 troops66 dod does not estimate the effect of either its previous or new funding for modularity on the amount of time soldiers have at home between deployments congress included the funds in the fy2005 and fy2006 with some reluctance effectively giving the army more room in its regular budget for two years based on an understanding with dod that this funding would return to the regular budget after fy2006 and that 25 billion was set aside for th army in future years to cover these costs67 congress appears to have approved these costs in fy2007 as well growing the force as war cost previously congress has provided funding to cover overstrength or the co st of recruiting and retaining additional personnel above the armys prewar end strength of 482000 and the marine corps end strength of 175000 dod has argued that these increases were required to reduce the stress on forces and that the in creases would be temporary in january 2007 the president announced plans to perm anently increase the size of the army and marine corps by 92000 over the next six years including the almost 30000 additional personnel already on board the fy2007 supplemental included tota l of 49 billion to cover the military personnel cost of additional troops plus 17 billion

fy2017 major investment68 questions about warrelated procurement issues to evaluate dods warrelated reconstituti on and procurement request s congress may want to consider whether reset requirements are fficiently firm to justify front loading and what assumptions about force levels and the pace of operations underlie those requests whether upgrading equipment and replacing prepositioned equipment is actually war expens rather than part of ongoing modernization initiatives how war funding of repair and replacement of equipment could affect maintenance and procurem ent needs funded in dods regular budget whether upgrades requested reflect requirements to equip deployed or deploying forces warrelate d or the entire force and whether dod estimates of war requi rements for force protection reflect warrelated requirement s for deploying forces or modernization of the entire force to some extent these warrelated requi rements for recapita lization m odularity force protection and upgrades overlap each other and the baseline budget since all involve the purchase of new equipment to improve capab ility since dod is constantly modernizing some of the f unding for these requirements may have been assumed in estimates for the later year s of dods baseline budget dod appears to have shifted some of its baseline requireme nts to war requests shifting funding from the regular budget to emergency funding is attractive because dods emergency spending has not been subject to budget caps allowing the services to substitute other less urgent requirements in their baseline budgets on the other hand dod consistently faces budget pressure from unanticipated increases in the cost of its new weapon systems the fy2007 supplemental also includes more than doubling of the amounts for force protection and substantial increas in funding iraq and afghan security forces as well as over 1 b illion for military construction f unding in fy2007 see crs report rl33900

since the nd of the vietnam war with roughly half of all army units both active and reserve at the lowest readiness ratings for currently available units70 because dods standard ratings known as cratings assess readiness relative to the full range of standard wartime s cenarios however they do not necessarily reflect whether units are ready to depl oy to iraq and afghanistan to conduct counterinsurgency operations for example when asked about his readiness concerns during hearing of the house armed services committee general sc hoomaker chief of staff of the army stated that i have concerns about how we are equipping training and manning the forces that are going across the berm into harms way but i do have conti nued concerns about the strategic depth of the army and its readiness referring to other potential missions of the army italics added71 general schoomakers testimony may reflect an alternate dod readiness system that assesses units about to deploy to carry out missions that are not their traditional ones in this circumstance the services use an alternate readiness reporting system known as percent effective or pctef like standard ratings which largely reflect specific quantitative criteria percent effectiveness ratings reflect subjective assessment of the units ability to execute its currently assigned nontraditional mission72 unit commanders are

left behind in iraq and replacement equipment has not been delivered problems with reserve readiness are longstanding because until the afghan and iraq operations reservists were seldom deployed for

like thos of the reserves are longstanding it is not clear how long other readiness probl ems have persisted or how long they will continue this debate about readiness has sharpened with the presidents decision to increase troop levels in iraq and afgh anistan by about 35000 and congressional consideration of withdrawal options at issue may be how long readiness problems are expected to persist and whether problems reflect lack of resources or management problems such as an inability to identify ongoing reset and hence ensure that equipment that is needed most urgently is fixed or replaced first httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33110crs33 congressional options to ffect military operations as interest in alternate policies for iraq has grown congress may turn to the vietnam and other

services expenditures or outlays take place when payment is provided past attempts or provisions to restri ct funding have follo wed several patterns including those that cut off funding for particular ty pes of military ac tivities but permit funding for other activities eg prohibiting funds for combat activities but permitting funds to withdraw troops cut off funds as of certain date in specific country cut off funds at the earliest practi cal date which essentially gives the president leeway to set the date cut off funds if certain cond itions are met such as new authorization or certain events take place such as the release of us prisoners of war other nonfunding approaches to restrict military operations have required that troops be withdrawn by specified date in the future or at the earliest practical date withdrawn funds unless there was declaration of war or specific congressional authorization of the war activities or repealed previous congressional resolutions

us military forces and overseas deployments by richard f grimmett while only handful of provisions have been enacted congressional consideration of these various limitin g provisions placed pressure on the administration and thus influenced the c ourse of events for example the well known cooperchurch provision that pr ohibited the introduction of us ground troops into cambodia was enacted in early 1971 after us for ces had invaded and then been withdrawn from cambodia that provision was intended to prevent the reintroduction of troops78 although president nixon did not reintroduce us troops the united states continued to bomb cambodia for the next three years later in 1973 congress passed two provisions that prohibited the obligation or expenditures of any funds in this or any previous law on or after august 15 1973 for combat in or over or from off the shores of north vietnam sout h vietnam laos or cambodia79 the final version reflected negotiations between the admin

enacted two mcgovernhatfield amendments and an earlier cooperchurch amendment were also part of this vietnam era jockeying between the administration and congress one mcgovern hatfield amendment

prohibiting spending funds to support more than specified number of troops unless the president notified the congress of the need for 60 day exte nsion the earlier coope rchurch amendment prohibited

while dod has provided considerably more justification material for its war cost requests beginning with the fy2007 supplemental many questions remain difficult to answer such as the effect of changes in troop levels on cost s and there continue to be unexplained discrepancies in dod s war cost reports how might congress get better ccurate information on war costs to provide congress better basis for oversight dod could provide estimates of the allocations of all budg et authority provided for oif and oef and compare those to outlays to date provide past current and future estimates of average troop strength both deployed and total for each operation and other key cost drivers such as operating tempo set up separate appropriation acc ounts for war funding to create visibility on outlays and

expected to include the number of troops deployed or anticipated to deploy changes in the pace of operations or optempo changes in the amount of equipmen t and number of personnel to be transported to the theater of operations whether support is designed to be temporary or longerterm force protection needs how quickly equipment breaks down and how quickly it is to be replaced or upgraded and military basing plans that unde rlie construc tion requests troop levels would be expected to be the ba sic underlying factor that determines the cost of military activities and s upport ranging from the number of miles driven by trucks which in turn affects how quick ly trucks break down purchases of body armor varying with the threat or m eals served and housing provided troop levels however have risen far less than costs little of the 93 billio n dod increase between fy2004 and fy2007 appears to reflect changes in the number of depl oyed personnel which has grown by only 15 see table 2 rather the increase is attributable to several factors certain unanticipated requirement s for force protection gear and equipment the cost of training and equipping afghan and iraqi security forcesx and even more broadened definition of th types of programs that dod considers part of war reconstitution or reset funds to repair and replace warworn equipment84 changes in troop strength in testimony and supplemental requests dod typically cites the number of boots on the ground at particul ar time to illustrate military pers onnel levels for example dod figu res show that there were bout 139000 troops in iraq and 19000 in afghanis tan or about 158000 as of october 1 200685 similar figures are cited by dod witnesses in hearingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33110crs37 86 dod fy2007 emergency supp p

operations or capture the annual aver age as troops rotate in and out of the theater during the year nor does it capture activated reservists in the united states who are training backfilling for depl oyed troops or supporting dods enhanced security one mission for these reasons boots on the ground figures understate the number of military personnel dicated to these operations for example in fy2006 average troop strength was some 297000 for operations in iraq afghanis tan and other counterterror operations or almost twice as high as boots on the ground figures see table 5 in its new supplemental request dod cites about 320000 for its tr oop strength in fy2007 acknowledging the higher troop levels for the first time86 the reported average for the year was 303000 see table 5 in fy2004 the first year of occupa tion dod figures s how average troop strength for all three missions of 304000 in its fy2007 supplemental request dod projected total of about 319000 troops 5 increase since fy2004 costs would more than double from 72 billion in fy2004 to 165 billion for fy2007 see table 2 reported troop strength for fy2007 was 303000 see table 5 some would argue that the average number of deployed troops dedicated to iraq and gwot operations would be provide better metric to explain war costs because those are the troops carrying out ongoing ope rations under this reasoning reservists in the united states whether training up or backfilling are considered the support tail for deployed troops between fy2004 and fy2006 average deployed troop strength increased from about 216000 to 247000 or by about 14 wher eas funding levels increased by 60 see table 5 dods surge or plusup for fy2007 of about 30000 troops increased average troop strength by only 10000 or about 4 over fy2006 taking into accounts dips earlier in the year and th fact that additional troops would be in place for only part of the year that brought troop strength for fy 2007 to about 256000 or about 19 above

modest 8 decrease in cost from 88 billion to 81 billion it is not clear why cost figures are inconsistent with average troop levels but gao has found various in consistencies in dod reporting of military personnel costs88 reliance on reservists falls between fy2004 and fy2006 dod reduced its reliance on reservists as their share of total personnel dedicated to war missions declined from 30 to 24 see figure 1 this change reflects the fact that some reservists have bumped up agains t dodimposed policy set after the 911 attacks that limited their total deployment time to 24 months since

if troop streng th remains the same operational costs could grow if operating tempo intensifies repair costs increase or support costs grow these factors appear to explain some but not all of the 17 billion increase in operating costs from 43 billion in fy2004 to 60 billion in fy2006 see table 7 based on dod reporting of oblig ations this increase reflects more body armor and other protective

equipment wears out growthof 4 billion and 2 billion increase in command communications controlcomputers and intelligence support 91 with the exception of force protection gear where congressional interest has been high dod has provided little explanation for these changes with enactment of the fy2007 supplem ental operating costs jump from 60 billion in fy2006 to 75 billion in fy2007 or by 25 this increase reflects the administrations surge in troop levels nd naval presence about 5 billion higher repair costs 3 billion more force pr otection gear about 1 billion doubling in transportation costs for unspecified reasons 2 billion increased logcap contractor support 300 million and higher operating tempo92 these factors account for some but not all of the increas though the rationales for

equipment in and around iraq and afghanistan these reasons do not fully explain the sc ope of increases thus far or sort out whether the new requests are warrelated em ergencies rather than being part of ongoing modernization or transfor mation programs dod has provided little rationale or explanation for its requirements or changes in requirements for replacing warworn equipment or extensive upgrades in some cases requirements do not appear to be strictly related to war needs for example congress included funds for c17 ai rcraft in order to keep the production line open though its relationship to curre nt war needs is tenuous congress also agreed to fund the cost of equipping newl configured army nd marine corps units prewar initiative known as modularity or restructuring initiative in the fy2005 and fy2006 supplemental see sec tion on reset belo w and crs report rl33900 on fy2007 supplemental typically war funds do not include rdte or military construction because both activities take considerable time and hence do not appear to meet an emergency criterion in this respect the iraq nd gwot conflicts are breaking new ground dod is now receiving war funding for rdt in both specific programs and in the joint ied defeat fund new account wh ere dod transfers funds after enactment with prior reporting to congress in the fy2007 supplemental dod is receiving an add itional 17 billion for military construction almost doubling the previous peak in fy2005 funding for military construction has been controversial for two reasons concerns among some members that construction indicates an intent to set up permanent bases in iraq and construction funding in the united states th at is part of proposed plans to increase the size of the force and not clearly an emergency although dod has not ruled out retaining bases in iraq current guidelines limit the use of concrete structures and emphasize building relocatable units nd the fy2007 supplemental continues prohibition on spending funds to set up permanent bases in iraq in fy2008 dod receives an additional 27 billion fo r warrelated military construction special funds and the flexibility issue since the 911 attacks congress has relied on variety of special account s that give dod additional flexibility to respond to the uncertainty of wartime need s congress has also been more willing to approve higher levels of transfer aut hority which allow dod to move funds into different accounts after enactment the fundi ng in these new accounts generally does not reflect troop levels or immediate operational needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33110crs44 94 congress appropriated 20 b illion in the governmentwide emergency res ponse fund which could be spent by the president at his discretion pl

rescinded 35 billion of the 156 billion originally appropriated to the iff and included ceilings for certain purposes such as intelligence within the total table 6 shows the funding provided in th flexible accounts including afghan and iraq security forces funds for training and equipping police and security forces the joint improvised explosive device ied defeat fund forproviding funds to be transfe rred to procurement rdte or operation and maintenance to develop and field solutions to the ied threat the iraq freedom fund set up to cove r war operations cost in the first year of the invasion and occupation iff the natural resources risk re mediation fund set up to cover expected damage to iraqi oil fields and the defense emergency response fund derf typically congress has give n dod latitude in how to use these funds and required afterthefact quarterly reporting the afghan and iraq security forces funds provide lump sums which dod could then allocate between equipment and training needs similarly the joint ied defeat fund allows dod to decide where funds are n eeded to meet this threat although the new accounts are designated to meet particular goals they are similar to funding flexibility given to dod after the 911 attacks in the first two years after the 911 attacks congress gave dod substantial leeway to move funds after enactment to meet war needs by appropriating funds to special accounts initially dod received 17 billion in its defense emergency response fund derf spending those funds in broadly defined allocations such as increased situational awareness and increased worldwide posture94 in the fy2002 supplemental congress appropria ted 13 billion for war costs including 119 billion in the derf transformed into transfer account with guidelines set in the conference report95 in the fy2003 supplemental congress appropriated tota l of 774 billion in war funding including 156 billion in new iraq freedom fund iff where dod could transfer funds after enactme nt and then report to congress96 since fy2004 congress has appropria ted most war funds to specific accounts but has given dod larger amounts of transfer authority wher dod can move funds after enactment with the consent of the four congressional defense committees see table 6 as well as setting up new transfer accounts for specific pur poses such as training iraqi security forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33110crs45 congress has also set caps or ceilings on funding within om accounts for specific purposes rather than set pr ogram limits these include funding for various types of coalition support wh ich pays us allies for their logistical support in counterterro r operations related to oif and oef or other counterterror operations and commanders emergency

fy2008 dod appropr iations act pl 110116 and the fy2008 consolidated appropriations ac t pl 110116 dod has relied on both its regular funding and the 86 billion alread appropriated for wa r costs which has provided some cushion before passage of the remaining war request in the last couple of months dod has been financing its war costs by using funds for its regular activities that are slated to be used at the end of the year practice known as cash flowing unless congress restricts the use of these funds dod for example can pay for fixing truck in either iraq or kansas using operati ons and maintenance funds appropriations pr ovided in either its regular or supplemental appropriations the funds are mixed in the same account111 at issue has been the extent to whic h congress will approve and dod is willing to exploit available tools to transfer f unds from other accounts to meet army needs should the supplemental not be passed as planned and when funds run out now familiar dilemma see table b1 for list of tools available to dod last year while awaiting passage of the fy2008 fund dod adopted similar approach but assumed that civilian workers needed to be notified of

claimed that the supplemental needed to be enacted by the nd of april 2007 to avoi d disruptions to army operation and maintenance activities including childcare centersalthough dod prefers to use its transf er authority to make programmatic adjustments later in the year financing war costs is consistent with the standard criteria for transferring funds the need to meet higher priority needs and would be less disruptive than furloughing civilians or planning to close down operations as dod has proposed dod could also tempor arily free up monies by delaying the signing of contracts for nonessen tial base support or depot maintenance contracts where there is currently large backlog see table b1 for listing of tools available113 based on an analysis of past obliga tions current funding and dod authorities crs estimates that dod could continue to finance war costs for an additional one to two months by using currently available tools such as transfer authority to provide additional resources to the army until passage of the supplemental similar arguments about the disruption nd harmfulness of delays in providing war funds have been made in previous years dod contended that if congress did not pass the fy2007 supplemental in the spring of 2007 the army would run out of funds for its wartime and peacetime operations and face serious readiness problems and disruption in army operati ons to cope with the delay the army adopted series of restrictions to slow nonwarrelated activities to conserve funding that would not affect readiness projecting that 36 billi on

midjune for military pers onnel and early july 2008 for om dod could extend that time line by one to two months or until early august 2008 if necessary by using available authority to tr ansfer additional funds to the army or by temporarily slowing spending with the current bridge fund the army has 625 billion available in regular and emergency appropriations to cover its total costs both wartime and regular for army operations and maintenance alt hough army obligations for operation and maintenance om dipped and spiked from month to month in fy2007 crs estimated that monthly obliga

tools to extend how long the army can last table b1 outlines tools that are currently available to dod that could extend financ ing of army military personnel and operations and maintenance shoul d passage of the fy2008 supplemental be delayed and outlines pr ecedents and potential consequences of using these tools although these tool s are routinely used by dod to meet unanticipated needs tapping these au thority for war needs would reduce dods flexibility to finance other unanticipated higher priority needs the most readily available tool for dod to extend financing of war costs is to transfer funds into army military pe rsonnel and om accounts from other accounts in fy2008 dod has available two sources of transfer authority that total 77 billion which permits dod to respond to unanticipat ed higher priority needs by moving funds between accounts this total includes 37 billion in general transfer aut hority where funds can be moved from dods baseline program to war needs and 40 billion within the 70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations which could be moved between wartime needs eg from procurement to operations 21 billion in excess cash in the working capital funds other available tools that dod could use to extend funding such as using excess working capital fund cash often done in the past deferring placing depot maintenance orders or slow ing baseline operations woul d need to be implemented before funds run out to be effective slowing spending as the army did st spring could temporarily save 36 billion but would have to be implement ed soon dod has argued that slowdowns or belttightening achieved mostly by delaying contracts to upgrade facilities and deferring orders of nonessen tial supplies by relying on cu rrent inventories at bases would not be worthwhile in light of th amount of time gained vs the potential disruption to army operations last spri ng while the slowdown was in effect the armys regular om obligations slowed c onsiderably without evidence of harmful effects perhaps partly because obligations we re higher in the early part of the year deferring placing depot maintenance orders would not necessarily delay equipment repairs because the armys s 7Â½ months backlog of work awaiting repairs at depots defe rral all new fy2008 depot main tenance contracts for four months would reduce the backlog to about three months similar to backlogs in previous years in addition the army coul d use this hiatus to evaluate which orders should be placed first in line to meet the needs of troops preparing to deploy bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33110crs58 gao and cbo have criticized the army for its lack of priority setting for repairing items in depot maintenance that are need ed by troops preparing to deploy another longstanding authority that has b een used in emergency situations is to invoke the feed and forage act an emerge ncy authority that allows dod to contract for emergency operational needs without having the necessary appropriations although dod has mentioned this civil war er authority that pe rmits the department to sign contracts to provide support fo r troops even if appropriations are not available and it has been used periodically the authority has been criticized for eroding congressional authority particularly the war powers act if implemented at the maximum level used in the past it would finance one month of army needs at the same time dod might have to c onvince contractors to accept delayed payment which could raise priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33110 crs59 table

would be to transfer funding and manageme nt responsibility for certain warrelated support functions from the army such as 62 billion in wartime logistical support for all the rvices logcap other base support 3 billion 11 billion contract for linguists and 675 million in subsistence costs for dod civilians and contractor personnel118 to the air force and navy this could finance an additional month or two of ar my operations and would reduce funding for air force and navy by about two months assessing whether such change is worth considering now and for future year s could also depend on the likelihood that providing war funds continues to be contentious issue under statute the secretary of defense has the authority to transfer support functions for deployed forces to any servi ce title x section 165 provides that the secretary of defense may assign the res ponsibility or any part of the responsibility for the administration and support of forces assigned to the combatant commands to other components of the partment of defense119 the secretary also has authority to detail civilian pe rsonnel from one service to anot her as part of his general responsibility for managing the department so army personnel currently managing these contracts could be detailed to another servi ce to ensure continuity120 if the secretary were to transfer res ponsibility for these types of activities the army could be relieved of 5 billion to 10 billion of funding responsibility for wartime support activities wh ile this would extend the time the army or marine corps could operate without supplementa l it would reduce the funding for air force and navy operations by about two months war costs of the air force and navy are much smaller than those of the army121 congress might be concerned by this action because it could undermine congressional limitations on funds and the integrity of the account structurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33110crs63 appendix c war appropriations by
