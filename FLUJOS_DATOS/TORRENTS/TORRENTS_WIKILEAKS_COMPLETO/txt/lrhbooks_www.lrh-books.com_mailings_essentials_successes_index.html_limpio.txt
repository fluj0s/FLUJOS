date without the data from those lectures the route to infinity i never would have dreamed such wild dream and been able to hold it there until it came true my wife and i have been scientologists for over 25 years for variety of reasons we got stalled on the bridge i was at clear my wife at ot iii although we had the purpose and intention to move up the bridge it just wasnt happening as any scientologist would agree this creates serious failed purpose i started listening to the route to infinity tapes while in my car driving to and from sales and service calls and key datum that ron repeats frequently began to sink in from my own duplication of lrh it was as follows the mest universe is reality only because we all agree to it but that it is really an illusion and shabby one at that ones own universe is the actuality as thetan slides down the scale he reverses this concept so that his own universe becomes seemingly insignificant illusion the mest universe becomes the reality and that the actuality is lost to that thetan somewhere around the fourth tape the datum finally sunk in and i cognited on what he was saying that the reason i was so pressed back having my intention blunted etc was because i believed that i could survive only if i agreed with mest until it would permit to survive when i got home i put aside all of the problems i was facing located myself in the room i was in and then created the illusion that i was in fact quite successful in anything i wanted to be that had all of the space i needed and could enjoy the game of life and get up the bridge less than two weeks later i pulled in the money to get going on the bridge again and to do it full time this year i have moved from stalled clear to ot iv my wife has completed ot iv and v and in less than two months we will be going to flag for vi and vii now from this viewpoint i see that i was imprisoned in structure of my own making unable to get out even though i was holding the key in my hand which i had forgotten about and i wasnt even aware that i held anything in my hand without the data from those lectures i never would have dreamed such wild dream and been able to hold it there until it came true i share this data with you with the hope and postulate that you can use the data in these lectures and if you are stuck trapped or blunted on your progress up the bridge i cannot recommend this data highly enough mt ot iv the route to infinity lectures the material covered in this series is designed to remove the selfcreated barriers that keep person from arriving at sane prosurvival decisions in these lectures ron introduces the gradient scale of beingness from zero to infinity and thus bridges the gap between beings ideal and current conditions click here for information on this lecture series 2003 bridge publications inc all rights reserved for copyright and trademark information removelink grateful acknowledgement is made to l ron hubbard library for permission to reproduce selections from the copyrighted works of l ron hubbard lrh ot scientology flag the bridge l ron hubbard and dianetics are trademarks and service marks owned by religious technology center and are used with its permission bridge publications inc is registered trademark and service mark in california and is owned by bridge publications inc scientologist is collective membership mark designating members of the affiliated churches and missions of scientology
