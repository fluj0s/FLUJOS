us position and issues for congress the state department maintains that us influence over the direction and program content of undp ensures that us broad foreign policy interests are represented in the work of the organization for example administration officials note that us pressure in opposition to burmas military junta resulted in more than 50percent cut in undps june 1993 plan for burma the state department further argues that us contributions help leverage those of other aid donors that for every dollar provided by the united states 8 more are supplied by others supporters also contend that the large us contribution has helped maintain an american as the undp administrator other donors have long argued that there are too many us heads of agencies and will again raise it when mr speths term expires in 1997 the us contribution has also helped to keep undp in new york in 1994 the german government offered to pay the costs of moving undp to germany both as way for it to play more active role in the united nations and to fill the empty office buildings in bonn although only the volunteers moved the german offer remains undp purchases from us businesses in 1993 were more than twice the us contribution critics both within and outside the united nations have long argued that undps goals are too broad and urged the united nations to establish more attainable goals many complain that the development programs of various agencies have grown without direction and that their independence makes coordination impossible some argue that reducing us funds to undp and other development entities will encourage this consolidation for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95578
