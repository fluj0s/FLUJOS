were by most standards among the worst in the past 50 years many argue that the th reat of severe wildfires has grown because many forests have unnaturally high fu loads eg dead trees and dense undergrowth and an histori cally unnatural mix of plant species eg selectively logged or containing exotic invaders fu treatments have b een proposed to reduce the threats from wildfires including prescribed burning commercial logging and other treatments eg preco mmercial thinning proponent s of fuel reduction argue that needed treatments often are delayed by environmental studies administrative appeals and litigation howeve r many project opponents fear that simplifying fuel reduction projects could enable timber companies to increase logging on federal lands and that such projects might not receive proper environmental review14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31999crs11 15 for more information see crs report rs21408 nasas space shuttle columbia quick facts and issues for
