they were introduced in the 1970s touchscreen and ot her dres using computerstyle displays are arguably the most versatile and userfri endly of any current voting system each machine can display ballots in different languages and for different offices depending on voters needs it can also display voters ballot choices on single page for review before casting the vote finally dre can be made fully accessible for persons with disabilities including visual impairment and can prevent several kinds of voter error other kind of vo ting system possesses all of these features the popularity of dres particularly the touchscreen variety has been growing and many expect that growth to conti nue the help america vote act of 2002 hava pl 107 252 while not requiring or prohibiting the use of any specific kind of voting system promotes the use of dres through some of its provisions2 the act has encouraged the replacement of punchcard and lever machines through buyout program it specifically

fischer election reform and electroni c voting systems acts requirements for prevention and corr ection of voter errors about 30 of registered voters are expected to us dres in the november 2004 election4 however there is currently some cont roversy about how secure dres are from tampering by voters election personnel in ternet hackers or even manufacturers for detailed discussi on see crs report rl321395 the controversy stems in part from another characteristic of current dres the ballot itself consists of electronic records which the voter cannot see inside the machine therefore there is way for the voter to know if the ballot that is cast is the same as the electronic representation of it on the face of the machine the security of dres and other voting systems was not major issue in the debate leading to the enactment of hava6 although they issue was discussed during at least one hearing7 it became prominent only with the publication in july 2003 of an analysis of computer code for one type of dre8 there has been some disagreement am ong experts about both the seriousness of the security concerns and what shoul d be done to address them while it is generally accepted that tampering is possible with any computer system given sufficient time and resources some experts believe that the concerns can be addressed using current practices others be lieve that significant changes are needed among the steps proposed are requiring th use of open source software code which would be available for public insp ection the development of systems that effectively mimic electronically the observa bility of manually c ounted paper ballot systems and the printing by dres of doc ument ballots where voter could verify the choices made and that would be ndcounted if the election results werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32526crs3 9 however hearings have been held at which issues addressed by the bills were discussed on june 24 2 004 the subcommittee on environment tec hnology and standards of the house science committee held hearing on testing and certification for voting equipment how can the process be improved the house committee on house administration has held an oversight hear ing on the election assistance commission and implementation of the help america vote ac t on june 17 and hearing on electronic voting system security on july 7 on july 20 the subcommittee on technology information policy intergovernmental relations and the census of the house committee on government reform held hearing on the science of voting machine technology accuracy reliability and securitycontested some experts have called for such changes before dres are more widely adopted others believe that procedural and other safeguards make dres sufficiently safe from tampering that use of printed paper ballots would create substantial problems that would more than outweigh any benefits and that th controversy risks drawing attention away from the demonstrat ed utility of dres in addressing known problems of access to and usability of voting systems several bills have been introduced in the 108th congress that would amend hava to address these and other issues in various ways the issues these bills address and the major differences in the wa ys they address them are discussed below the bills that this report covers are hr 2239 voter confidence and increased accessibility act of 2003 introduced may 22 2003 by representative holt identical to s 1980 s 1980 voter confidence and increased accessibility act of 2003 introduced december 9 2003 by

in more than one loca tion inside the machine which can protect against certain kinds of recording and countin g problems but these ar not truly independent records 11 these and most other hava requirements go into effect in january 2006 see deadline for compliance belowprovisions and issues addressed the bills contain broad range of provisions concerning the verification of ballots by voters including those with disabilities before ballots are cast the use of interim paperbased systems the use of ma ndatory recounts the availability of voting system software for inspection by the pub lic or by states prohibitions on wireless communications security testing and cer tification requirements posting of voter information changes in deadlines for compliance with hava requirements extension of deadlines for payments under hava nd other matters those provisions and associated issues are discu ssed below this report also includes table providing sidebyside comparison of the provisions voterverified ballot requirement voter verifiability refers to the capability of the voter to determine that his or her ballot is cast and counted as intended voting system currently in use in federal elections provides true voter verifiability however paperbased document ballot systems handcounted paper ballots punchcards and optical scan ballots arguably exhibit somewhat more verifiability than the nondocument systems lever machines and dres with current dres voter sees representation of the choices made on computer screen or ballot face but ca nnot see what choices the machine actually records when the vote is cast there is independent record of the voters choices that the machine totals can be checked against10 document ballots on the other hand permit voter to check the actual ba llot before casting it although the voter cannot verify that the votes on the ballo t were counted as the voter intended many computer security experts view the lack of transparency of dres as significant security vulnerability and some advocate addressing this vulnerability by requiring paper record of the voters choi ces that the voter can verify before casting the ballot this approach is often called voterverified paper audit trail or vvpat hava currently requires that permanen t paper record be produced for the voting system and that the record be ava ilable as an official record for recount 301a2 but it does not requi re either that the paper r ecord consist of individual ballots or that the paper record be used in recounts hava also requires that the system permit the voter to verify in private and independent manner the votes selected by the voter on the ballot be fore the ballot is cast and counted 301a1ai11 however it does not specify the method of verification httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32526crs5 12 see fischer election reform and elec tronic voting systems all of the bills discussed in this report except s 1986 and hr 4966 modify hava to require 1 that voting systems provi voterverification via paper ballot that the voter can inspect be fore the vote is cast 2 th at voters have the opportunity to correct any errors detected before castin g the ballot and 3 that the paper ballot will be permanent record of the vote s 1986 has the same requirements except the voting system is to use the most accura technology which need not be paper based some alternative t echnologies in development show promise of providing stronger voter verification capabilities than paperbased systems12 all bills except hr 4187 and hr 4966 specify that the voterverified ballot be the official record for any recounts all except s 1986 hr 4187 and hr 4966 require that the voterverified ballot system be at least as suitable for manual audit as paper ballot box system presumably meaning handcounted paper ballots s 2045 and s 2313 also prohibit the use of thermal paper for the permanent ballot record hr 2239s 1980 s 2045 and s 2313 require voter verification beginning with the november 2004 federal election the other bills retain the current hava 2006 deadline for meeting 301a requirements there are two main ways that vvpat can be implemented in one the paper ballot is used for the initial count as well as being preserved fo r audits and recounts this is how current documentballot sy stems handcounted ballots punchcards and optical scan ballots work some observers have pr oposed separating the votechoice and votecasting functions of dres to create an analogous singleballot system also called modular voting architecture but dres do not use this method the other approach records votes electronically within the dre but creates parallel paper ballot record that the voter can verify and that would be used only in audits and recounts this parallelballot approach also called contemporaneous paper replica or cpr is most often discussed with respect to implementation of vvpat for dres the use of vvpat has several potential advantages including the following any recount would be based on an independent record that the voter had had an opportunity to verify each election could be audited nd any significant discrepancies between the electronic and paper ta llies would trigger full recount if the recount were performed by hand that would take advantage of the transparency and observability that can be associated with that approach the method could help ensure voter confidence in the legitimacy of election results since voters woul d know that ballots they had verified would be available for recounts the approach also has potential disa dvantages including the following the use of printers could substantially increase both the cost of administering an election and the risk of mechanical failure of voting machine httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32526crs6 13 this estimate is based on data received from the election reform information project httpwwwelectionlineorg and election data services httpwwwelectiondataservicescom in march 2004 14 nevada uses the sequoia avc edge and will be using vvpat printer developed by sequoia and certified for use with that system 15 see california secretary of stat kevin shelley voting systems httpwwwsscagovelectionselections_vshtm since the use of vvpat with dres is largely untested it is not clear to what extent it would improve security in practice and what impacts it might have on voter s it may make voting more complicated and timeconsuming by requiring extra steps hand counting of the paper ballots would be timeconsuming andarguably more errorprone than machine counting it may also provide opportunities for tamper ing that do not exist with nondocument systems the method will not necessarily pr ovide the level of confidence in the results of an election that proponents project since initial counting will still be done by computers while there have been several studies of the security vulnerabilitiesof dres there have been comp arable studies for paperbased or lever voting systems such studies are necessary to determine what the relative security risks are of dres in comparison to other kinds of voting systems although hava does not prohibit or require any particular voting system the accessibility requirements effec tively encourage the use of dres given the state of current technology therefore if vvpat is deemed essential to ensure the security and integrity of dre voting an argument can be made that hava should be revised to require it however to the extent that the need for vvpat is not settled and that requiring it might stifle innovation and given the focus of hava on leaving specifics of implementation to the states it could be argued that the decision of whether to implement vvpat is best left to the states most observers appear to agree that widespread implementation of vvpat for the november 2004 election is not feasible among the roughly 30 states expected to use dres in that election 13 only nevada is requiring vvpat fo r all machines in the 2004 election14 however california requires either vvpat or set of other secu rity requirements15 interim paper system hr 2239s 1980 s 2045 and s 2313 require that if state certifies that it cannot comply with hava 301 requireme nts as modified by these b ills by november 2004 the election assistance co mmission eac will provide the state with an interim paperbased voting system that the eac will deem to comply with the requirements for that election s 2045 includes deadline of 1 july 2004 for states to certify that they cannot comp ly and requires that the eac reimburse jurisdictions for the costs of implementing the paper system s 2313 provides for reimbursement and further stipulates that the interim system provision will apply alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32526crs7 16 this estimate is based on data received from the election reform information project httpwwwelectionlineorg march 2004for federal elections held in 2005 the bills also require that any state receiving title i payment to replace voting systems and requesting an extension of the deadline for replacement to 2006 will use paperbas ed voting system for the november 2004 election however s 2313 also permits states required to use an interim paper system to apply for waiver if comp liance is technologically impossible the paper system is to be based on pa per systems in use in the jurisdiction if any hr 2239 s 1980 stipulate that the state w ill receive the system at eac expense it is not clear whether the interim system will be chosen by the state or by the eac s 2045 and s 2313 stipulate that the state will use the required system with costs reimbursed by the eac presum ably this means that the state will choose the system the four bills also require that whatever system is used shall be deemed compliant by the eac with hava require ments under hava the eac currently has role in determining compliance with the requirements of the act however it is responsible for voluntary certification of voting systems but by laboratories that it has accredited not by the eac itself it is not clear whether the language in these bills significantly expands the authority of the eac or alternatively if compliance of any paperbased system state chooses is automatic it is not clear what the cost of this provision would be as it would depend on how many states would require interim paper systems it would presumably include at minimum any jurisdictions that were intending to use lever machines in the november 2004 election as well as states with dre systems that could not modify them to include vvpat for that election more than 30 states are expected to use either lever machines or dres or both in at least some jurisdictions roughly 75 80000 precincts in 200416 voter verification for individuals with disabilities and alternative language needs hava requires that voting systems b accessible for individuals with disabilities including nonvisual accessibility for the blind and visually impaired in manner that provides the same opportunity for access nd participation including privacy and independence as for other voter s 301a3 it requires that there be at least one accessible syst em in each polling place starting in 2006 and that any voting systems purchased with hava title ii funds starting in 2007 be fully accessible it further stat that properly equipped dr will meet the accessibility requirement hava also requires that votin g systems provide lternativelanguage accessibility pursuant to the requirements of the voting rights act 42 usc 1973aa1a dres can provide improved accessibility in several ways they include magnified ballots for the visionimpair ed audio ballots for blind voters

httpwwwusdojgovolcdrevotingsystemshtm 18 an optical scan voting system is kind of modular system with pencil serving as the ballotgenerating device and the reader as the ballotscanning device potentially voters whose primary language is unwritten or english speakers with substantial reading difficulty and special interfaces for physically challenged voters four of the bills require that hava acce ssibility requirement s be met through use of modular voting architecture that does not require the use of paper hr 2239s 1980 s 2045 or does not require the voter to view or handle paper s 2313 those bills also move the deadlin for meeting accessibility requirements from 2006 to the november 2004 federal elec tion they move the 2007 deadline for all new machines purchased with title ii funds ahead one year to 2006 they require that jurisdictions unable to comply with this requirement and using an interim paperballot system provide disabled voters both the option of voting with that system with assistance from another person as provided for by the voting rights act 42 usc 1973aa6 and the option to us another system providing for disability access if such system is available the bills therefore appear to provide an interim exemption for jurisdictions from providing for voterverifiability for disabled persons by the november 2004 election as required for other voters what effect this exemption might have on voting by disabled persons in 2004 is not clear especially given the requirement in the bill that all jurisdictions use vvpat or paperbased voting systems in that election for exam ple jurisdiction that had planned to replace punchcard system with dres before november 2004 might delay implementation and rely on punchcards for 2004 rather than attempting to add vvpat to the system in such case ssisted voting would be the only option for blind voters in the election s 1986 requires that the method of verifi cation used guarantee accessibility for persons with disabilities and alternative language needs but does not specify particular method see above memorandum opinion from the us department of justice states that electronic voting systems that produce voterverifiable paper ballots are consistent with both hava and the americans with disabilities act pl 101336 so long as the voting system provides similar opportunity for sightimpaired voters to verify their ballots before those ballots are finally cast17 vvpat requires additional technology be yond the use of printer to provide fully accessible voting for persons with disabi lities including the bli nd the four bills requiring vvpat for the 2004 election hr 2239s 1980 s 2045 and s 2313 address this need by requiring use of modular voting system for voters with disabilities but not for other voters with such system one device generates the ballot recording it on medium such as memory card or paper and another device is used to scan and verify the ballot nd presumably to cast and count it although that could also be done by third device18 both devices would need an audio program and hardware that would read th ballot back to blind voter and otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32526crs9 19 election systems and software has made available the automark voter assist terminal which provides accessibility and language features like dre but uses optical scan ballots with the device printing the choices made by the voter onto the ballot however it does not appear to provide mean s of independent voter verification for those voters who cannot read the marked ballot at least one other company populex has developed modular singleballot system that prints paper ballot that is read by separate barcode reader modular system using elec tronic smartcards rather than paper has been in use in belgium for several years 20 this may be inadvertent the bills repl ace the language of th subparagra ph with provision that does not include the requirement but also cites the subparagraph and moves the deadline it currently contains as if th intention is to retain the requirementfeatures to meet other accessibility requi rements such as lternative languages while such devices and programs exist and are in common use by persons with disabilities only one such system appear s to be certified unde r the federal voting systems standards19 concerns about accessibility have led some advocates for the blind to strongly oppose the impos ition of vvpat requirement t hose advocates express additional concern that vvpat requirement would draw attention and resources away from efforts to make voting systems more accessible and to reduce the number of votes that are not counted or not cast as intende d as result of voter error stemming from poor usability of voting systems proponents ar gue in contrast that addressing the security issues associated with dres is critical need and vvpat is the only way it can be done effectively advocates for the disabled also have expressed concerns that voting systems must not provide means of identifying whic h ballots were cast by disabled persons of the four bills requiring modular votin g architecture for disa bled persons three hr 2239s 1980 s 2045 appear to eliminate the hava requirement that all future voting systems purchased with title ii funds be accessible 301a3c20 if as result jurisdictions maintain distinct voting system for persons with disabilities it might per mit such identification some observers have pointed out th at underlying concerns of voting accessibility advocates and vvpat proponent s are similar blind voter cannot know that the person providing assistan ce is recording the votes as the voter instructed and vvpat proponents argue th at voter using dre cannot know that the machine is recording the votes as the voter instructed both sides appear to agree that solutions are possible that would sa tisfy the needs of both and major points of contention appear to revolve around percei ved differences in the relative urgency needed to address the different concerns appropriations for voterverified systems two bills specifically provide funding for the required voterverified systems s 2045 appropriates but doe s not specifically authorize such sums as necessary and requires payments by the eac to assist

provisions but authorizes and ppropriates 150 million for the payments plus 15 million for interim paper systems nd 15 million for implementation improved security and recounts see below for discu ssion of those provisions the other bills contain additional authorizations to fund their voterverification provisions the cost of adding vvpat capacity to dres is difficult to estimate industry estimates have ranged from roughly 500 1000 or more per machine however some believe that such estimates are significantly inflated it is also difficult to estimate the number of dres that would n eed to be fitted w ith printers about 50000 precincts may use dres in 2004 on average there are about 875 registered voters per precinct21 the number of registered voters per machine can range substantially among jurisdictions from as low as about 100 voters to as high as 900 some vendors recommend one dre for ev ery 250 400 voters depending on local requirements thus the total cost of adding vvpat to all existing dres is difficult to estimate but could range from as w as 45 million or less to more than 200 million not including operational and maintenance costs for jurisdictions using lever machines bout 25000 precincts the voting system would have to be replaced the 17 states currently using lever machines all have indicated that they plan to replace them by the end of 200522 almost all have received or expect to receive hava funds to assist in the re placement adding vvpat for those jurisdictions could increase the total cost estimate for vvpat by about 50 65 300 million altogether under the assumptions above requirement for mandatory recounts there are two major benefits generally cited for vvpat first it gives the voter the opportunity to verify that the ballo t that is cast is the one the voter intended to cast second it provides permanent reco rd of such verified ballots that can be used in recount voter verification is not by itself sufficient to determine that votes are counted as cast it is possible for ex ample that an optical scan reader could misread sufficient number of ballots to ch ange the outcome of an election if the results are not sufficiently cl ose or contested recount mig ht not be performed one way to address the question of verifying the results of an election is to perform automatic recounts for sa mple of ballots hava involves the eac in studies of recount procedures and laws but does not involve it in the performance of recounts three bills require the eac to conduc t and publish the results of mandatory manual recounts of the vote rverified paper ballots in small percentage of jurisdictions in each state for every federal contest hr 2239s 1980 requires surprise recounts of one in every 200 jurisd ictions it

comparison of methodologies and their relative effectiveness at achieving it httpwwwvoteherenetpaperselectionconfidencepdf continuedunannounced recounts s 2313 requires unannounced random recounts of 2 of jurisdictions neither of the latter two bills contains the appeal provision the method of implementation of th recount pr ovisions appears to be ambiguous the term jurisdiction is not defined in these bills or hava but given how it is used it likely refers to the unit of government within state whether county town or township that administers an election it is not clear if under these bills at least one jurisdiction per state w ill be subject to recount for each federal election or if straight probability rule w ill be used this is an issue b ecause the number of election jurisdictions per state varies substan tially texas for example has 254 counties it would th erefore have at least one county recounted each election under hr 2239 s 1980 and s 2045 which require recount of 05 of jurisdictions or 1 out of every 200 in each st ate however ce there are more than 200 counties in the state it is not clear whether 2 counties would be recounted each election for an actual rate of 08 or just one 04 or if second county would be recounted every four years on averag 05 in contrast maryland has 24 counties it is not clear whether one c ounty would be recounted each election for an actual rate of 42 or 1 county every eight years 05 similar ambiguity applies with respect to s 2313 which requires recount of 2 of jurisdictions in each state these ambiguities would be subs tantially reduced if precincts rather than jurisdictions were chosen for recounts since most states have more than 2000 precincts23 as practical matter it is not clear how the eac would conduct r ecount in every state even on limited basis on av erage the eac would need to recount by hand roughly 14 million votes per election under the first two bills and 56 million under the third that might pose signifi cant logistical challenge and considerable costs also it is not clear what standard of what constitutes vote would be used with given system under hava each stat is required to defi ne what constitutes vote and what will be counted as vote for each category of voting system used 301a6 for the results of the recounts to be comparable to the original counts the eac would need to use the state standa rds but since states are free to adopt different standards the eac would then n eed to use different standards in different states also some states such as califor nia already do partial recounts it is not clear whether the eac recount would repl ace such state procedures or be done in addition to them at least one analysis has questioned the effectiveness with which recounts of small percentage of votes can detect irregularities for example in california recount of 1 of precincts is estimated to detect di screpancy of 01 fewer than one out of four times on average for statewid race with far lower rates of detection for races for the house of representatives24 similar study has been done for ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32526crs12 24 continued 2 december 2003 25 for example if errors occurred at five out of 100 precincts simple mathematical analysis predicts that recounting 1 would ve 5 chance of detecting the problem that is 95 out of 100 times problem would be detected 5 recount w ould yield only 30 chance of detection it would be nece ssary to recount 8 to achieve 50 chance of discovering one of the problem precincts to achieve 95 chance of detecting one problem precinct would require recounting 20 26 see jeffrey w seifert computer software and open source issues primer crs report rl31627 17 december 2003 27 see fischer election reform and elec tronic voting systems for more detailnationwide recount but it is likely that to be effective at detecting irregularities partial recount would need to sample much higher per centage of jurisdictions than proposed by these bills25 currently federal executive agency counts votes in an election the conducting of the recount by the eac woul d therefore presumably constitute new federal authority some observers may object that such authority is unconstitutional or at least that it runs counter to the wellestablished practice reinforced by hava that states not the federal g overnment administer elections requirement for opensource software and prohibition of wireless co mmunications hr 2239s 1980 s 2045 and s 2313 require that the software code used in voting system be disclosed to the eac and made available for public inspection open source that the system contain wi reless communication devices and that eacaccredited laboratories certify that systems meet those requirements s 1986 is similar except it does not require opensource software h r 4966 requires manufacturers of voting system software to provide updated copies of the software to states that use it but does not require that the code be publicly disclosed hava provides for voluntary certification of voting systems but does not include requirements for software or for communi cations devices almost all software currently used in voting systems is proprie tary the federal voluntary voting systems standards vss do not requi re opensource software nd do not prohibit wireless communications opensource software some computer security experts believe that opensource code is more secure than propr ietary or closedsource code while others believe that closedsource code can be at least as secure26 voting systems currently in use rely on closedsource code some observers particularly proponents of modular voting architecture advocate third approach in which the device with which the voter initially makes choices is closed source to facilitate innovation in improving usability and other aspects of the voting experience and the device on which votes are cast and counted uses simple opensource code to maximize transparency and take advantage of the security benefits of this approach27 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32526crs13 28 if the reason for loss of competitiveness were security vulnerabilities that were revealed as result of the disclosure the withdrawal might be warranted but if what would be revealed were legitimate intellectual property ch as innovations in the user interface then withdrawal might reduce the oppor tunity for further innovationthe bills requiring opensource code would resolve the issue of which approach is more secure in favor of those advocating open source since the bills prohibit the use of undisclosed software in the voting system they would appear to foreclose some benefits of the modular architecture approach as describe d above also given that some current voting systems in widespread use employ proprietary commercial offtheshelf cots software such as microsoft windows this provision seems to require that those systems be reengineered to use other software or that they be withdrawn from the marketplace since it is doubtful that company providing closedsource cots software would be willing to disclose the code furthermore since voting system using such softwa re would not meet the requirements of hava as amended by these b ills it would need to be repl aced by paperbased system that did meet the requirements for the november 2004 election even if the current system met the vvpat requirement in the bill in addition hava defines voting system to include components other than those in the voting machine per such as the computer code used to define ballots and to make materials available to the voter such components are part of all voting systems and probably use proprietary software operating systems word proce ssors database software and so forth in all cases therefore it is possible that all voting systems currently in use in the united states except handcounted pa perballot systems where the ballot is not generated with the aid of computer would fail to meet the opensource requirement in the bills it is also not clear what impact an opensource requirement would have on the marketplace for voting systems while it may draw in new companies that specialize in using opensource code and provide new opportunities for innovation it could also cause some current voting system manufacturers to withdraw from the marketplace especially if they believed that revealing the code of their systems would substantially reduce the co mpetitiveness of their products28 these potential problems could presumably be addressed by more precise language relating to what components of what voting systems the opensource requi rement applies wireless communications the use of wireless communications in computer systems provides unique risks with respect to attack by hackers and therefore requires special attention with regard to security some observers believe that voting systems should not use wire less communications because of those potential security risks while others believe that such communications can be made sufficiently secure however any mode of electronic communication by modem internet or memory card as well as wi reless provides poten tial points of attack for voting system but some means of communication is required many computer experts would argue that proper use of cryptographic methods would provide more security than prohibition of any one mode of communication but that if wireless communication were to be prohibited then internet and possibly even modem communications should be as well nevertheless

and accountability the technolog element focuses on the development acquisition and implementation of hardware and software the operations element focuses on policies and procedures both maryland and ohio have undertaken studies of the security of dres31 while the studies took different approaches and examined different aspects of dre security they addressed aspects of the above elements and each found concerns in whatever areas of security it examined those included computer software and hardware and security polic ies and procedures includi ng personnel practices along the supply chain from the manufacture of th machines to their use in the polling place the studies made specific recommendations for addressing the risks and concerns identified with many of the recommendations relating to

controversial the vss have been criticized for inadequately addressing usability security administrative procedures and practices performance in act ual use voter registration systems and other

it often refers to st rategies policies pr ocedures and other actionrelated elements that are generally accepted as being the most successful or costeffective for meeting specified set of goals unfortunately there does not appear to be any overall agreement on how best practice should be identified ideally perhaps it would involve set of practices that were empirically and objectively demonstrated to be the best am ong various alternatives for achieving stated set of goals that is rarely achieved and more often best practices are the result of consensus process involving sel ected experts such an approach can be effective but in the absence of empirical comparisons there is the risk of gap between what is generally pe rceived to be best practi ce and what in fact would be best therefore the utility of the sets of practices required by the bills would depend to significant extent on the met hods by which they were developed security consultation services few election

ex cept as otherwise specified conclusion the bills discussed in this report would all increase the federal role in the administration of elections some of th em substantially hava does not specifically require any particular method of voting or prohibit any particular type of voting system see for example 301c nor does it give the eac any explicit authority or operational role in the adminis tration of elections it leaves methods of complying with the requirements of title iii to the states 305 federal guidelines and certification of voting system s remain voluntary under hava several of the bills discussed in this report in contrast would significantly change those aspects of hava by for ex ample effectively prohibiting any voting system that does not use or produce pape r ballot requiring that only eaccertified voting systems be used or that the eac certify the security of state computerized voterregistration lists or requiring the eac to perform recounts of portion of election results in each state while congress has the authority to regulate federal elections some of the proposed provisions might be subject to legal challenge while potential impacts of these bills if enacted on the implementation of hava are difficult to assess there are at least four potential areas of impact the administration of the november 2004 nd subsequent elections the costs of complying with the provisions of the bills effects on accessibility provisions of hava and potential impacts on the marketpl ace these potential impacts have been discussed to some extent bove and are summarized here moving up deadlines would ve the potential benefit of accelerating compliance with hava requi rements however to the extent that states have devel oped and are implementing plans in response to the current deadlines such changes could be disruptive furthermore many of the change s to hava requirements contained in the bills would also require significant changes to current state plans and activities because elec tions are complex to administer such changes could have unpredictable and possibly negative effects the bills could add significantly to the costs of implementing hava implementing the vvpat provision alone could cost several hundred million dollars ot her costs are more difficult to estimate but could be substantialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32526crs21 42 see fischer election reform and elec tronic voting systems the vvpat requirement and relate d provisions could slow the adoption of dres and therefore impede the development of fully accessible voting in the united states however its actual likely impact is difficult to assess at the same time several of the bills accelerate adoption of fully accessibl voting systems by moving up deadlines for their deployment if the provisions in several bills caused significant changes in thevoting industry more jurisdicti ons might be required to change voting systems because of withdrawal of some manufacturers from the marketplace that could disrupt the implementation of state plans and increase costs at the same time however such changes to the industry might open opportunities for innovative companies to enter the market for example the vvpat requirement might increase market demand for modula rarchitecture documentballot systems in lieu of pa rallelballot dres th at may be likely under some of the bills given that all new voting systems would have to use modular voting architecture fo r disabled voters beginning in 2006 in the longer term the vv pat requirement could result in greater uniformity of state voting systems with attendant benefits and risks but it could also impede the development of new superior approaches to voting some of wh ich are currently in development 42 with short time remaining until the november 2004 election several of the issues addressed by the bills discussed in this report may be expected to persist beyond it close scrutiny of the election by the media and public interest groups is anticipated prospects for further consideration of the provisions in these bills after the election by the 108th or 109th congress is likely to depend in
