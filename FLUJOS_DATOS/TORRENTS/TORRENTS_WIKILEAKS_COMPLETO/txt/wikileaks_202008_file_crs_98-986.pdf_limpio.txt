special condi tions for the retransmission of network6 station signals under the 19 94 shva network stations are those that are owned or operated by or affiliated with one of the television networks in the united states networks are defined as entities offering an interconnected program service on regular basis for 15 hours or more per week to at least 25 affiliated televisio n licensees in 10 or more states existing networks therefore include at least abc 7 cbs nbc fox and pbs the united paramount network warner brother s network and the new pax network may also fall within the definition of network when the satellite license was originally legislated the statutory mechanism for retransmission of network signals rested upon the policy assumption that satellit providers should not be permitted to retr ansmit network signals already receivable by television household through standard overtheair reception equipment th commercial networks resisted any compulsory license for satellite retransmission on the ground t hat their signals already blanketed the country in the end th networks had to concede that while virtually all us television households d access to network signals perhaps one to two percent of the households could t receive the network signals these households fall in the socalled white areas with respect to retransmission of network signals the satellite license was therefore made available only to unserved households unserved households are primarily located in remote rural areas where the terrain or the distance from the nearest transmitter whether primary transmitter or translator station make overtheair reception of viewable signal not feasibl without special equipment to justify carriage of network signals the satellite provider submits to eac h network within 90 days after commencing retransmission the names and addresses of its subscribers the networks and th eir affiliates may then use this list to determine whether the subscriber resides in an unserved household household i s unserved by particular network if i the household cannot receive the signal of network station overtheair at predicted gr ade b intensity as defined by the fcc8 or ii within 90 d ays before the date service began to that household the household has not received the network signal through subscription to cable servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98986crs4 this burden of proof provision took effect january 1 1997 with respect to actions affecting9 subscribers who received the satellite service before october 18 1994 the effective date of the 1994 shva under claim of unserved household status the 1994 shva had enacted transitional provisions which established procedures fo r10 testing the viewability of network signals these procedures which were in effect only i n 1995 and 1996 distinguished between signals that were within or without the station s predicted grade b contour the basic concept was that satellite providers had the burden of conducting tests within the predicted grade b contour subject to reimbursement by th challenger broadcast station if the test proved the hous ehold was unserved if the household apparently fell outside the predicted grade b contour of the station the challenger station had the burden of conducting the signal intensity test however few tests were conducted by any party because of the expense of the test and the inability of the parties to agree on testin g procedures and the standard for determining viewable television picture the version of hr 2921 reported by the house judiciary committee on september 1011 1998 would have deleted the 90 day waiting period for former cable households hr rep 105661 part ii 105 cong 2d sess 1998 the version of hr 2921 that passed th eth house of

broadcast stations may challenge satellit retransmiss ion of its signal on the ground the household is already served by th network upon receiving an objection the satellite provider may either conduct signal measurement st to prove the household is unserved terminate service to the household or continue service and place itself at the risk that the network or it s affiliate station will sue for copyright infringement in any civil action litigating the eligibility of the househol d to receive the network signal the satellite provider bears the burden of proving that the retransmission of

exclusivity protection for satellite retransmissions of broadcast signals13 the copyright office als observed that technological solution would be the best solution in the unserved households debate the problem can be eliminate d entirely if technology and business practices advance to enable satellite carriers t retransmit local network affiliates to their subscrib ers if the subscribers can purchase the signals of their local network affiliates they have need to import distan t network signals and there will be unserved household 14 pending further technological developments if t he

since has resulted in extrem controversy and dispute on both sides 25 the sbca placed its hopes on voluntary negotiations between the satellit providers and the broadcasters to reach an agreement on mutually acceptabl working arrangement regarding selection of white area eligible consume r households the plan under consideration entails the creation of red lightgreen light zones determined by topographical maps and broadcast tran smission plots within each dma designated market area the zones would demarcate areas of subscribe r eligibility on bright line basis final agreemen t on the

decisions these obligations include mandat ory carriage of all local broadcast signals ie must carry compliance wit h syndicated exclusivity rules and nonduplication of network programs and sport s
