act ecpa3 concerning law enforcement and intelligence investigative tools were origina lly scheduled to expire on december 31 20054 section 6001a of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act irtpa of 2004 concerning lone wolf terrorists was so scheduled to sunset on that date without any legislative action these provi sions as well as amendments to them would have ceased to exist after the sunset date and most of the preexisting provisions of law would have been revived automatically during the 109th congress the house and senate each passed usa patriot reauthorization acts hr

this section unless the library is providing the services defined in section 251015 of this title53 this provision makes very clear that libraries operating in their traditional role including the lending of books including making books available in digital form including providing basic internet access are not subject to national security letters54 however if the library provides the services described in 18 usc 251015 which are electronic communication services then such library would still be subject to nsls 18 usc 251015 defines electronic communication service to mean any service that

provider under 18 usc 251015 library must independently ope rate the means by which transmission routing and connection of digital communication occurs55 in contrast local county library likely has service contract with an internet service provider isp to furnish the library with the electronic communication service as many businesses and individuals do the fact that the library has set up

section 114 remove s unduly delaying trial as one of the adverse consequences that justifie s delayed notification so commentators have noted that seriously jeopardizing an investiga tion which is retained by the act as ground for permitting delayed notice is an overly broad catchall provision that law enforcement officials could abuse78 there may also be some question of whether it qualifies as constitutionally accep table exigent circumstance however justice department officials defend this pr ovision observing that before the delayed notice can be approved federal judge must agree with the governments evaluation of the circumstances that indicate that contemporaneous notice of search might seriously jeopardize an ongoing investigation79 finally section 114 enhances oversight of delayed notice search warrants by requiring that later than 30 days after th expiration or denial of such warrant the issuing or denying judge must notify th administrative office of the us courts of

the hijacking incidents described above most of the perpetrators we re older than in their twenties when they committed their crimes the imposition of preguidelines sentence of life imprisonment for

the report of the interagency commission control of access to the seaport or sensitive areas within the seaport is often lacking such unauthorized access is especially problematic because inappropriate controls may result in the theft of cargo and more dangerously undetected admission of terrorists in addition to establishi ng appropriate physical procedural and personnel security for seaports it is important that us criminal law adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense128 however critics might point out that the section does not deal with all unauthorized access only access accomplished by fraud and they argue even if the seriousness of such unauthorized access to seaport restricted areas with criminal intent might warrant imprisonment for up to 10 years there is nothing in conference or commission reports to explain the necessity for the comparable penalty increase for the other forms of trespassing upon the other areas covered under section

thus has not heretofore been the beneficiary of examination in committee or on the floor the change is captioned uniform procedures for criminal forfeitures but it is not facially apparent precisely how the procedures for various criminal forfeitures are disparate or how the amendment makes them more uniform part of the difficulty flows from the fact that both section 2461 c and the acts amendment are somewhat cryptic nevertheless it seems crafted to make default procedure into an exclusive procedure in its original form 28 usc 2461c states if forfeiture of property is authorized in connection with violation of an act of congress and any person is charged in an indictment or information with such violation but specific stat utory provision is made for criminal forfeiture upon conviction the government may include the forfeiture in the indictment or information in accordance with the federal rules of criminal procedure and upon conviction the court shall order the fo

whenever civil forfeiture is permitted in sum when there is provision for criminal forfeiture the government may use civil forfe iture provision if it includes such allegation in the indictment in

act of congress for which the civil or criminal forfeiture of property is authorized the government may include notice of the forfe iture in the indictment or information pursuant to the federal rules of crim inal procedure if the defendant is convicted of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture the court shall order the forfeiture of the property as part of the sentence in the criminal case pursuant to the federal rules of criminal procedure and section 3554 of title 18 united states code the procedures in secti on 413 of the controlled substances act 21 usc 853 apply to all stages of cr iminal forfeiture proceeding except that subsection d of such section applies only in cases in which the defendant is convicted of violation of such act casual reading of the original sec tion 2461c might suggest that it only applies in the case of criminal forfeiture statute which fails to indicate what procedure should be used to accomplis h confiscation in fact section 2461c originally allowed confisca tion under its criminal forfeiture procedures where civil forfeiture was authorized by statute but criminal forfeiture otherwise was not157 on its face however it did not allow the government to merge every civil forfeiture with the criminal prosecution of the property owne r in its original form section 2461c was only available if there was other cr iminal forfeiture counter part for the civil forfeiture158 under the act the distinction longer exists moreover since section 2461c speaks of treating civil forfeitures as criminal forfeitures after conviction so courts have held th at pretrial freeze orders available in other criminal forfeiture cases may not be invoked in the case of section 2461c gap filler159 it is unclear whether the act is intended to change this result as well on the one hand the nguage of conviction s till remains on the other hand the description of the role of 21 usc 853 which authorizes pretrial restraining orders may signal different result the

attorney general on all matters relating to the nationa l security activities it is independent of any division and reports directly to the deputy attorney general in contrast both the counterterrorism and count erespionage sections are located in the criminal division but they each report to two different deputy assistant attorney generals if there is method to this madness neither we nor any other official with whom we spoke could identify it there is reason to believe that the this awkward and outdated organizational scheme has created problems between the justice department and the intelligence community in our classified report we describe one such problem that cannot be discussed in our unclassified report we believe that bringing the office of intelligence policy and review closer to its operational counterparts like the counterespiona ge and counterterrorism sections would give the office better insight in to actual intelligence practices and make it better attuned to operational needs attorneys in the counterterrorism nd counterespionage sections routinely work alongside fbi agents and othe r intelligence officers by contrast oipr is largely viewed within the department as an assembly line operation not requiring any special grounding in the facts of particular matter oiprs job is to process and adjudicate fisa requests not to follow case from start to completion one of the advantages of placing all three national curity components under single assistant attorney general is that they will see themse lves as acting in concert to serve common mission the bellows report final report of the attorney generals review team on the handling of the alamos na tional laboratory investigation identifies further reason to have single individual below

continuous ly sought to streamline in the same vein should the judges of the fisa court conclude that the oipr has been shackled and ceased to function as an independent gatekeeper for the court they
