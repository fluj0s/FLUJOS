regulatory cooperation trc and are at the heart of todays us eu economic relationship this report is intended to serve as an introduction and primer on complicated broad and often highly tec hnical set of policy issues since the mid1990s both us and european multinational companies have viewed divergent ways of regulating markets for both goods and services as th most serious barriers to transatlantic commerce the primary reason why thes companies seek to achieve greater harmonization in standards nd regulatory procedures is to reduce costs imposed by complying with two different sets of regulations and standards trc must deal with number of key differences between the united states and eu concerning approaches to regulation these differences i nvolve political support for regulation and public attit udes towards risk and transparency until they converge or are realigned transatlantic gap in regulatory policies is likely to persist regulatory cooperation is an umbrella concept that in corporates broad range of activities at one end of the spectrum are information exchanges and dialogues among regulators that are designed to build trust and confidence at the other end of the spectrum are activities designed to harmonize regulatory approaches through acceptance of common principles and stan dards in between are activities that involve varying degrees of intrusi on into the autonomy of regulators trc initiatives have made progress in reducing costs to businesses and consumers in some sectors but not in ot hers one of the key obstacles to more extensive cooperation frequen tly cited is the domestic orientation of regulatory agencies involved in the process to promote more effective trc two policy options are commonly advanced 1 attrac ting highlevel

regulatory cooperation background and analysis introduction the united states and the 27member european union eu share huge dynamic and mutua lly beneficial economic partnership1 not only is the useu commercial relationship what many call the transatlantic economy the largest in the world it is also arguably the most important2 while the transatlantic market is today highly integrated due in large part to massive amount of fore ign direct investment by both us and european companies in each others markets differences in regulatory approaches standards and ph ilosophies militate against an even tighter and more integrated marketplace from developing regulatory differences are also behind some of the most politically sensitive bilateral trade disputes to deal with this situation variety of governmenttogovernment efforts and transatlantic dialogues have been cr eated to increase understanding between policymakers and regulators on both sides of the atlantic to minimize existing regulatory barriers and to prevent the emergence of new regulatory barriers these efforts falling under the rubric of transa tlantic regulatory cooperation trc are seen as being important to today s ususeueu economic relationship proponents maintain that t rc undertakings can not only prevent disruptive and costly trade disputes from occurring but also spur trade and investment flows by reducing costs for producers and consum ers on both sides of the atlantic since the establishment of the new tr ansatlantic agenda nta in 1995 there have been number of new trc initiatives all aimed at removing or reducing regulatory barriers to trade3 while each of these initiativ has made some progress towards reducing regulatory burdens many us and european companies heavily engaged in the

accelerating the reduc tion and elimination of barriers to international trade and investment with the ultimate objective of achieving barrier free transatlantic market they also agreed on framework for advancing transatlantic economic integration the framework and created new institutional structure the transatlantic economic c ouncil tec to advance the process of regulatory cooperation and barrier reduction headed on both sides by ministerial level appointees the tec is designed to oversee the efforts outlined in the framework with the goal of accelerating progress and guiding work between the summits4 whether the tec will herald new era of more effective cooperation remains to be seen much could depend upon wh ether the tec can exert enough political leverage to convince regula tors to make reforms that will result in reduction of regulatory barriers between the eu and the united states as well as increase the role that legislators on both sides of th atlantic play in the process in this context congress might play an important and pivotal role in transatlantic regulatory c ooperation through authoriz ation and appropriations of many different independent regulatory agencies congress is in position to facilitate or impede progress in this undertaking as domestic regulation takes place in an increasingly integrated transatlantic marketplace congress must try to

greater benefits deri ved from regulatory competition and independence whereby each side is free to maintain its own approach to regulating consumer health and envir onmental issues the case fo r

liberalizing product markets and reducing barriers to international trade and in vestment the case of the united states and european union may 26 2005 13 the initial impetus for promotin g transatlantic dialogue on regulatory standards was the european communitys 1992 internal market prog ram at the heart of this program was an effort to establish europeanwide standards progress along these lines raised concerns in continuedeconomic rationale the primary reason why many export industries seek to achieve greater harmonization in international standards is to reduce costs associated with complying with two different sets of regulations and standards to the extent that transatlantic regulatory standards and pro cedures differ the costs of engaging in transatlantic commerce increase10 good example comes from the auto industry according to trade association usbased producer of light trucks looked into exporting model to europe and found that its design was inco mpatible with european regulation on exterior edge projection the us has co mparable standard the truck was never exported because it would have required major and costly redesign the same truck manufacturer then undertook to ensu re that another model on the drawing boards would have maximum export potential built into its design in order to sell this product in europe the manufactur er reportedly utiliz ed 100 unique parts incurred an additional 42 million in design and developmental costs and committed an additional 130 people to the program yet the performance of the vehicle in terms of safety was unchanged european based manufacturers face the same issues in reverse when contemplating selling europeandesigned model in the united states these separate regulations in turn may cost manufactures millions of extra dollars to comply with but may result in changes in the vehicle in terms of safety or fuel economy11 2005 oecd study is often cited to illust rate how costly regulatory barriers to producers and consumers on both sides of the atlantic this study estimates that regulatory divergences between the us and europe costs the united states sum that is equivalent to 13 of gdp annually12 in addition to cost savings that mig ht be derived from the harmonization of regulations so as to facilita open markets it is argued that regulatory cooperation between states will help ensure that regulatory standards will not serve as obstacles to freer trade or unfair trade advantages13 just as internal regulatory divergences canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34717crs6 13 continued the us business

served to justify large expansion of federal legislation and institutions in the united states in the areas of environmental regulation consumer protec tion health and safety and labor protections similar fears of trade distortions and races to the bottom led to the implementation of sweeping harmonization programs and cen tralized legislation in the eu14 cast in the context of the global economy some view trc as way for the us and eu to promote global regu latory standards in the absence of world standards the us and europe are often competing for acceptance of their respective regulations in third markets proponents of trc indicate th at the net effect of this competition is that india and china can play the united states off against europe developing their own technical standard s and financial regulations complicating world trade for everyone15 political rationale supporters of trc note that since the nd of the cold war the united states and europe have been searching for various ways to bolster the foundation of the relationship absent the common enemy embodi ed in the threat posed by the former soviet union both sides have felt freer to pursue their own

cooperation regulatory cooperation now entailing an expanding group of stakeholders and netw orks has become significant component of the useu economic relationship supporters argue that through such cooperation the partners may be able to find ways to amicably and expeditiously resolve commercial disputes as well as establish joint approaches to number of common regulatory challenges that have global importance16 because the united states and european union collectively represent over 50 percent of global production in areas wher they can agree on common regulatory policy or approach they are wellpositi oned to promote it globally where they disagree there is often deadlock reflecting the equal size of their economies and markets17 while there are other forums such as the world trade organization and international trea ties to promote regulatory coope ration they are seen as having shortcomings the wto for example pr omotes regulatory cooperation by giving some international standa rds legal effect nudging wto members to actively participate in internationa l standardization bodies it also puts national provisions to the test in various committees and offers its members platform to facilitate regulatory cooperation18 but the number of transatlantic regulatory differences that fall within the scope of wt rules constitute relativ ely small proportion of the regulatory policies and proce dures that involve firms on both sides of the atlantic moreover the few regulatorybased trade disputes that the wto has decided sometimes exacerbate rather than lessen tensions between the us and eu19 for this reason it is argued that the united stat and eu need to develop bilateral mechanisms for coordinating their regulatory policies20 counterarguments although there is strong support fo r trc among business and government leaders on both sides of the atlantic the concept and rationale have their critics this opposition is based in part on an altern ative view of the

way of disciplining overarching governments and creating incentives for bureaucratic efficiency they argue that regulatory competition leads to the adoption of standards of varying stringen cy that efficiently match the needs and desires of each jurisdicti on b ecause conditions tastes and incomes tend to vary across jurisdictions this school of thoug ht maintains that an optimal regulatory policy for one jurisdiction will not necessarily be op timal for another some consumer groups caution against th influential role that business groups play in transatlantic regula tory cooperation the concern is that safety and health concerns may be compromised if busine ss groups play such prominent role in negotiations over testing re quirements and standards fo r their own products rather than reducing barriers per the trans atlantic consumers dialogue maintains that the purpose of regulatory cooperation between the unite d states and eu should be to promote higher health and safety sta ndards thereby improving consumer welfare on both sides of the atlantic21 opponents of trc assert from this perspective that great number of centralized regulatory programs should be dismantled and regulatory powers should be decentralized they believe that re gulatory cooperation also reaches its limits where there is lack of institutional architecture to enforce decisions22 us eu differences in regulatory approaches transatlantic regulatory c ooperation must deal with number of key differences between the united states and eu cerning approaches to regulation key differences bear on political cycles affecting regulation public preferences and tolerance for risk attitudes towards transparency and institutional capacities to undertake regulatory reforms these ke differences whether they pertain to product safety envir onmental protection securities tr ading or customs procedures in how regulations are developed and app lied in turn raise challenges about whether and how to merge harmonize or converge the varied approaches until the regulatory structures themselves become more convergent or aligned the major divergences in regulatory polic ies are unlikely to disappear political cycles over the last 50 years the political cycle of regulatory policy stringency and expansion in the eu and the us have not moved together in the process many important european and american regulations have diverged23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34717crs9 24 ibid p 7 25 at the same time in 1980s and throughout much of the 1990s much of us policy was driven by efforts to reduce the costs of pr otective regulations on american companies and thus improve the performance of the american economy 26 jackie calmes both sides of the aisle see more regulation new york times october 14 2008 p 1 27 david vogel op cit p 6beginning in the 1960s many us regulatory standards were likely more comprehensive and stringent than those adopt ed by the eu and most member states the us was typically first to identify new consumer and envi ronmental risks and more likely to adopt relatively risk averse or precautionary standards for dealing with those risks for example from the early 1960s thr ough the mid 1980s american standards for the approval of new pharmaceu tical products were more stringent than in any eu member state and american automobile emission standards were consistently more stringent than those dopted in europe the united states also restricted the use of lead in gasoline more rapidly than did europe and also acted more aggressively to restrict th use of ozonedepleting chemicals24 but over the last 15 years number of european standards have become more stringent and comprehensive than us standards25 for example european standards for the approval and labeling of genetically modified g m foods and seeds are far more stringent than those adopted by the united states recently approved legislation on chemicals registration ev aluation and authoriz ation of chemicals or reach has made europ ean standards for the approva l of both existing and new chemicals much more demanding than in the us the eu has also moved more aggressively than the united states to impose restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions however in the aftermath of rising concerns about the safety of imported products and the financ ial crisis caused by the prolif eration of subprime mortgages support for more aggressive regu latory actions are rising in the united states if the pendulum in the united states swings back towards increased regulation this may narrow some of the current transa tlantic regulatory divergences26 values and public preferences some transatlantic regulatory differences reflect different public preferences and values for example many european cons umers tend to prefer naturally produced foods while many american consumers are more accepting of products produced by advanced forms of agricultural production th is difference helps to explain in part why europe has imposed restrictions on the use of growth hormones for both beef and dairy cows while the us has not it so explains in part the relative lack of political controversy in the us surr ounding the introduction of biotechnology compared to the more negative res ponse to this technology in europe27 the us and eu also operate two differe nt systems of risk management as in the

because eu and national regulators operate with dual missions to promote free trade within the internal market while ensuring public safety but enforcement is usually left to member states which often results in different levels of enforcement and different treatment of eur opean and us companies30 in general us regulatory agencies have the mandate and funding to focus on domestic regulatory issues and they enjo fair amount of independence on policy and implementation matters however the us lacks clearcut institutional mechanism to coordinate c ooperative efforts and neither the commerce

professional services such as engineering and architecture are all subject to state regulation and some sectors exclusively32 forms of transatlantic regulatory cooperation regulatory cooperation is an elastic concept that subsumes broad range of activities at one end of the spectrum these activities may include simple discussions and sharing of informati on between regulators most often on prospective regulations at the other end of the spectrum these activities may can involve attempts at harmonizing regu latory approaches through acceptance of common principles and standards in be tween are activities that involve varying degrees of intrusion into the autonom of regulators one such category is agreements that recognize each others sta ndards or certification procedures these agreements are known as mras or mutual recognition agreements the line between each category can be arbitrary and vague and there are other activities associated with regulatory c ooperation that may not fall neatly into one of the above categories33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34717crs12 34 reinhard quick regulat ory cooperation op cit p 402to date most efforts at transatlan tic regulatory c ooperation have been associated with information exchanges and dialogues considerable efforts have also been made at negotiating mras for rang of goods as well as other attempts to recognize the adequacy of each others standa rds in specific areas such as data privacy and accounting little has been undertaken in regard to harmoni zation of standards what follows is short elaboration of activ ities that apply to each of these regulatory activities information exchanges and dialogues the most basic form of regulatory c ooperation involves the establishment of working group or dialogues for an exchan ge of information the group which may be comprised of technical experts or regu lators from different jurisdictions may meet on an ad hoc and informal basis or may be more structured primary objective of these consultations may be to better understand technical differences in standards or regulations and to consult with each other prior to new regulations becoming effective making an effort to work with or consult with each other prior to new regulations becoming effective is vi ewed as one way to minimize unnecessary regulatory barriers the exchange of people and information is also expected to build trust and confidence with the hope of ma king for more informed and coordinated regulations and may eventually lead to agreement on what constitutes best regulatory practice while an exchange of views and discussion of different issues will not necessarily bring about meeting of the minds in the technical assessment of certain field of regulation it is necessary first step if convergence is to take place where there is attempt at dialogue efforts to restrain unilateral legislative actions that could create new regulatory barriers are unlikely to be successful34 in the transatlantic context number of us regulatory agencies eg the securities and exchange commission th food and drug administration the national highway traffic ad ministration and the occupa tional safety and health administration have engaged in these kinds of information exchanges and non binding dialogues with their european c ounterparts over the past decade these exchanges were encouraged by the guidelines on regulatory cooperation and transparency which the united states and eu negotiated as part of the 1998 transatlantic economic partnership tep the guidelines were intended to enhance cooperation between eu and us regulators in the development of technical regulations and specifically referred to re gular consultation exchange of data and information as well as informing

well as the elimination of obstacles to investment in addition high level regulatory cooperation forum comprised of regulators from both sides was established to find common ground on horizontal issues such as risk assessment costbenefit analysis and impact analysis when promulgating regulations mutual recognition agreements stronger form of cooperation involve s mras this cooperation entails an agreement by regulators to accept products or services from another jurisdiction under specified conditions so that actors complying with the regulations of one jurisdiction will be considered to be in compliance with the rules in another jurisdiction these kind of agreemen ts can focus on the mutual recogn ition of conformity assessment certifications or the alignment of relevant standards under full recognition of standards companies for example could sell pharmaceuticals in the united states after m eeting european standards without first obtaining fda approval an agreement on conformity assessment procedures is smaller step requiring domestic regulators to accept the competency of their foreign counterparts to conduct produc t testing inspection or certification the basic premise behind this kind of mra is th at products could be tested once and considered to have been tested in both markets35 in 1998 the us and eu completed an mra for testing and certification requirements covering multiple sectors including telecommunications and information technology equipment pharm aceuticals electroni cs electromagnetic compatibility sports boats and medical devices the mra did not provide for mutual recognition of product standards but it identified certification bodies in the exporting country that could assess the conf ormity of range of traded goods with standards of the destination country the mras thus introduced competition between assessors or certification bodies competition among certification entities was familiar in europe where private firms had long provided certification but was new in the united states where government agencies had dominated the pr ocess as result while some us officials believed that the mras would lead to cheaper and more rapid certification others were concerned about its implications for product safety36 the mras did not result in any kind of binding legal agreement between the united states and the eu rather they were accomplished through an exchange ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34717crs14 37 stuart eisensta dt op cit p 24 38 the us chamber of commerce for example has proposed an agreement on regulatory cooperation arc legally binding regulato ry cooperation agreement that would oblige both sides to operate under common set of regulatory principles and core beliefs the arc would require regulators to assess the cost impact of forthcoming regulations on transatlantic commerce adopt others best pr actices where possible and utilize similar methodology to assess costs and benefits of proposed

ulatory cooperation p 401letters between the heads of the relevant regulatory agencies to be implemented successfully mras require that regulato rs on both sides of the atlantic have confidence that the other side will not try to attract more business by being deliberately lax similarly regulators n eed to recognize that each others safety standards and inspecti on requirements are ba sically equivalent37 harmonization agreement on regulatory standards the strongest form of regulatory cooperation involves harmonization or agreement on the same standards or rules applied across jurisdictions this could extend not only to regulatory targets eg the permissible level of particular pollutant in each jurisdiction or reserve requirements among banks but also to the manner by which regulators ensure compliance with their regulations in the transatlantic context few preced ents exist for acceptance or adoption of similar or identical standards while there have been numerous political declarations calling for regulatory convergence and harmonization few changes have been enacted in each sides existing laws that would move their regulatory regimes in this direction the transatlantic market of course is not single market with common institutions pushing for further economic in tegration but various stakeholders frustrated by the slow progress in transa tlantic regulatory cooperation have made proposals that could push the two sides in the direction of adopting new institutional architecture such as bi nding regulatory cooperation agreement38 those who see binding treaty or regulatory cooperation agreement as necessary institutional architecture to achieve transatlantic single market point to eu integration as model in moving towards the completion of single european market the commission issued white paper that listed the pieces of legislation requiring harmonization and simultaneously identified th institutional mechanisms to achieve specified ends39 us public support for such an appro ach could depend on whether the goal of such treaty or legal agreement was the development of identical legislation or comparable legislation if the goal was id entical legislation much resistance to this kind of deeper integration could be exp ected from number of quarters this is particularly true from stake holders who view movement in this direction as leading to loss of regulatory autonomy for us authorities if the goal was thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34717crs15 40 ibiddevelopment of similar or comparable legislation that facilitates mutual recognition much less resistance perhaps could be expected40 results of past initiatives at regulatory cooperation the united states and eu have pursued variety of policy initiatives and new mechanisms over the past 15 years to reduce or eliminate regulatory barriers the results have been mixed an varied number of these initiatives have been successful in some regulatory areas while transatlantic regula tory cooperation has not made material differences for busine sses or consumers in some other sectors assuming it is concluded that stronger regulatory cooperation is desirable an assessment of past effo rts could be useful highlights of past initiatives beginning in 1990 with the transatlan tic declaration regular useu summits were initiated to reinvigorate and upgrade the bilateral relationship attended by the us president the president of the european commission and the president of the european council the summits were in tended to bring highlevel focus to cooperative activities succe ssive summits have led to number of agreements relating to transatlantic regulatory cooperation at the 1995 summit in madrid the us and eu formally adopted the new transatlantic agenda nta in an effort to provide new foundation for the partnership the nta was accompanied by detailed action plan in addition the nta set up comprehensive and regular governmentto govern ment dialogue as well as four dialogues between stakeholders on both sides of the atlantic these included the transatlantic bu siness dialogue tabd the transatlantic labor dialogue tald the transatlantic environmental dialogue taed and the transatlantic consumer dialogue tacd pursuant to the nta the two sides focused particular attention on problems posed by divergent standa rds and certification systems in addition to promoting the convergence in regulatory systems efforts were undertaken to negotiate mras covering several sectors in 1998 mras affecting sectors ch as electrical equipment pharmaceutical products telecomm unications and information technology equipment were reached at the 1998 mmit in london the transatlantic economic partnership tep was created to improve

and understanding on the various concer ns involved in biotechnology at the may 2002 summit in washington the two sides reached agreements on guidelines for regulatory cooperation and transparency these sought to take the idea of an early warning system step further by encouraging us and eu regulatory agencies to consult on voluntary basis sharing work plans that identify areas of anticipated regulatory action for the coming year and offering opportunities for r eaction before regulations are finalized41 moving towards more system atic cooperative approach roadmap for euus regulatory cooperation and transparency was developed in june 2004 it listed 10 specific projects for regulatory discussion and also ex panded the approach to horizontal initiatives the 2005 euus summit produced

and institutional learning processes43 4 mras discussed previously c overing over 50 billion in trade were implemented in three sectors leading to significant cost savings for us businesses several of the agreements provided for us and eu testing facilities to recognize each others standards over time thus allowi ng firms to have products tested only once on either side of the atlantic th commerce department estimated that the agreement would save us industries more than 1 billion in testing and certification costs44 5 the 2002 guidelines for regulatory cooperation promoted number of procedural steps that most likely have facilitated more effective dialogue these steps included arrangements to permit sharing of non public information between regulators the roadmap for regulatory cooperation

disappointments specific disappointments include the following 1 enthusiasm for mutual recognition as regulatory strategy faded when three of the six agreements failed to become operational by established deadlines48 in the view of some analysts these mras were never implemented due to the us reluctance to recognize the equivalency of european certifiers in the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors for example the fda had continuing doubts about the capability of some eu member states to oversee high pharmaceutical standards in laboratories in the electrical equipment sector osha refused to cede its right to designate which laboratories in europe could evaluate and certify new electrical products for sale in the united states49 related obstacle on the european side was the eu

of annual summits the tep by some accounts went into hibernation from 1998 to 2004 despite the many reco mmendations and political declarations issued during this time period there were few material accomplishments51 3 pieces of legislation adopted unilatera lly by both sides in 2002 served to put break on regulatory coope ration by violating the 2002 guidelines on regulatory cooperation and the early warning system on the one side the eu imposed its views on how to regulate chemicals by dopting legislation known as reach which affected the testing and approval of ch emicals without much input from us stakeholders on the other side the unite d states adopted legislation sarbanes oxley which reformed public accounting st andards without taking into account eu views both pieces of legislation created considerable difficu lties for transatlantic businesses from companies attempting to raise capital to firms that manufacture everyday goods 4 despite extensive effort s at cooperation for nearly two decades the transatlantic regulatory divide remains large in the area of chemicals the two sides still maintain fundamentally different regulations on issues such as hormones genetically modified organisms gmos cosmetics and the re gistration and restriction of chemical substances us and eu regulators c ontinue to operate with starkly different regulatory philosophies and styles and the record of transatlantic regulatory cooperation in this sphere s been highly contentious prompting the us to file legal complaint with the wto52 5 there has been lack of material progress in many other sectors such as autos and pharmaceuticals moreover past trc in itiatives have tended to be fragmented poorly coordinated and lack ing in political accountability for success and failure53 obstacles and options for more extensive cooperation in evaluating the history of past initiatives number of observers have pointed to several key obstacles to more effective regulatory c ooperation high on this list are the independence of regulatory agencies involved the lack of committed resources for transatlantic re gulatory collaboration and th sheer complexity of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34717crs20 54 kalypso nicolaidais and rebecca steffenson p 145undertaking to promote more effective trc by overcoming these obstacles three policy options are often put forth 1 attracting highlevel political support for trc 2 increasing dramatically the involve ment of legislators on both sides in the process and 3 developing an institutional architecture that can prioritize the problems and challenges that need to be addressed regulatory cooperation pa rticularly mutual recognition requires domestic regulators to accept the competency of th eir foreign counterpa rts to conduct product testing key obstacle however is that regulators remain accountable to domestic legislators for the product standards that are applied both to domestic and foreign products as result regulators on both side s of the atlantic are generally reluctant to transfer authority to foreign body and the mra negotiations demonstrated that some regulatory bodies are mo re reluctant than others54 based on the premise that enhanced regu latory cooperation pa rticularly through mutual recognition will never happen if matters are left to individual regulatory agencies highlevel political pressure is commonly prescribed such pressure either from the white house the congress or both may be employed to convince regulators to adopt reforms that result in reduction of barriers between the united states and eu andor to make greater efforts to accommodate transatlantic interests when promulgating new regulations successful regulatory cooperation also requires resources for the necessary meetings and dialogues to take place at least on the us side the regulatory agencies have dedicated budgets to s upport these activities accordingly some stakeholders such as the us chamber of commerce have proposed that congress consider the creation of specifically funded mandates to enable us agencies better participate in these transatlantic dialogues the scope of the transatlantic regulatory agenda is also extremely broad and technical encompassing most regulatory agencies ranging from the food and drug administration fda and the consumer product safety commission cpsc to the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and the environmental protection agency epa and diverse sectors ranging from pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to telecommunications and marine safety the status of the agenda at any one time is not easy to ascertain to move issues forward that are by their nature abstract and technical some observers have called for creation of institution that is capable of setting priorities and deciding on which issues are ripe for resolution with the help of higherlevel political intervention the transatlantic economic council predicated on the notion that past initiatives failed to make significant progress in enhancing regulatory progress the transatlantic economic council tec was established in april 2007 at the

trade the summit leaders also created an adviso ry group to the tec and invited the us congress along with the european parliament to accept new more substantive role in transatlantic regula tory cooperation by becoming part of an advisory group in short the tec and the framework are designed to deal with some of the suggested shortcomings described above of previous tran satlantic regulatory initiatives lack of high level political l eadership and not nough involvement of legislators and other stakeholde rs in the regulatory process the tec consists of two cochairs ministeriallevel appointees with cabinet rank from each side as well as number of eu commissioners and us cabinet members for the broad ranging policy areas covered in the framework currently the cochairs are daniel price assistant to the president for international economic affairs and guenter verheugen vice president of the european commission permanent members of the tec include the secretaries of the treasury and commerce and the us trade representative and the european commissioners for external relations for trade and internal market and services in addition other us cabinet members and european commissioners may participate when the agenda covers issues fa lling under their jurisdiction55 given that the two tec leaders are cabinetlevel appoi ntees the tec was expected to have the kind of highlevel political support that previous efforts at economic integration may have lacked such clout it is argued may be needed to persuade domestic regulators to yield some of their aut horities or to better cooperate with their counterparts across the atlantic in harmonizing regulatory approaches56 trcs efforts to foster cooperation and reduce regula tory barriers focus on two main types of issues 1 differences in regulatory processes nd approaches and 2 sectoral or bilateral barriers and disputes the goal in the first issue area is to find ways to reduce barriers to transatlantic economic integration posed by new regulations and or prevent them from happening the primary avenue for accomplishing this objective entails effo rts to reform harmonize or converge regulatory

sectors this is to be accomplished by intensified sectorbysector cooperation including the promotion of the 2002 useu guidelines for regulatory cooperation nd casebycase examination of specific projects called for by the road map for regulatory cooperation57 the initial meeting of the trc was he ld november 9 2007 in washington and second meeting was held may 13 2008 in br ussels both meetings appeared to stumble over efforts to resolv disputes involving sales of poultry cosmetics and electrical equipment the us side in pa rticular expressed di spleasure and concern about the pace of changes in eu regula tions that would allow the importation of poultry meat using pathogen reduction treatments as well as concerns that the implementation of the eus reach regulation not cause trade in cosmetics and personal care products to be disrupted on the other hand the eu expressed concerns that osha regulations are c ontinuing to make it unduly difficult for eu electrical and electronic equipment producers to gain certification in the us market the scant progress made in settling these disputes highlighted the limited capacity of the trc to break new gr ound in the area of dispute settlement composed of cabinetlevel officials from both sides the trc is transatlantic inter governmental entity that skirts the normal channels for affecting policy changes in both the us and eu as transatlan tic entity or coalition the trc may have difficulty matching the power of domestic constituencies that plead for trade protection or support regulations that tilt the playing field in one direction or another nor may the trc be wellpositioned to change the domestic dynamics of who supports any particular regulatory regime58 that is to say that domestic coalitions in both the united states and europe ac ting in support of regulatory competition may have more success in cha llenging other domestic intere sts that support the status quo than transatlantic coalition59 while changing existing regulations and resolving disputes is formidable challenge the tecs efforts to foster regulatory cooperation and reduce regulatory barriers may prove more fruitful as it focuse s on

marketplace in some cases the tec value may be able to help resolve differences in views among agencies that are blocking regulatory progress and try to ensure that transatlantic impacts and inte

politically feasible61 role of congress since it began nearly two decades ago tr ansatlantic regulato ry cooperation has been for the most part wholly run unde rtaking between the ex ecutive branches and independent regulatory agencies on both si des of the atlantic by and large trc exchanges and dialogues have been confin ed to regulators and officials of the executive branches on both sides of the atlantic the guidelines on regulatory cooperation and transparency in fact do not apply to congress or the european parliament the role of congress in tr ansatlantic regulatory coope ration in the past has been limited mostly to oversight hearings see appendix for listing and the introduction of few resolutions62 but congress has on occasion taken actions that have both thwarted and f acilitated regulatory coopera tion for example on the one hand some members of congress became cerned in the late 1990s that the mras the administration was nego tiating could harm consumer s and undermine health and safety standards as representative he nry waxman dca put it there is question that international agreements of this kind can enhance the efficiency of commerce but it is equally clear that they can potentially depress american health and safety standards according to one observer such concerns made some us regulators reluctant to participate in the mra

same observer inclusion of the mra language in the gislation was an important step toward finishing the agreement64 these examples highlight larger and mo re pivotal role congress could play in regulatory cooperation if it chose to become more involved to the extent that an overwhelming domestic orientation of regulatory agencies is problem in moving trc initiatives forward congress has the power through both the authorization and appropriations process to mandate that us regulato rs cooperate congress can also ensure that the us agencies involved in regulatory cooperati on have the necessary budgetary and organizational resources to ge t the job done conversely if congress views transatlantic initiatives as moving too far in the direction of trade expansion at the expense of safety and health concerns or other priorities congress can make it difficult for us agencies to c ontinue on that course of action beyond providing guidance to us regulatory agencies on trc initiatives congress also could play bigger role in preventing new legislation from causing new transatlantic regulatory barriers currently taking the transatlantic impact trade and investment effects into account is not considered in any structured or formal fashion during the legislative process yet political declarations from past useu summits backed by the transatlantic business community have urged more institutionalized process for making congress more aware of the potential impact of new legislation on transatlantic trade how this could be done is the subject of considerable speculation one of the factors that has to be considered is the wide range of congressional committees that have primary jurisdiction over issues that ar high on the agenda of trc as shown in appendix b many different authorizing committees have primary jurisdiction over some of the main regulatory agencies invol ved in trc activities on the house side the energy and commerce transportati on judiciary and
