god with this is mind during ourpreparation we ask godto forgiveour sinsspeakingto him out ofthe depths ofahumble andcontriteheart ccc2559 you mayhave heard itsaid that ifreligion is mans searchfor godchristianity is gods search forman with this inmind the second actionof ourpreparation is toremember that we always pray inresponse to the great lovethat godhas forus alludingto the storyofjesus andthe woman atthe well the ccc 2560 states ifyou onlyknew thegift of god thewonderofprayer isrevealed beside thewell where wecome seeking water there christcomes tomeet everyhuman being it ishe whofirst seeks usand asks usfor drink jesus thirstshis askingarisesfrom the depths of gods desirefor us whetherwerealize itor notprayer isthe encounter of gods thirstwith ours godthirsts thatwemay thirstfor him the following prayer or something similar can be used to help us cultivate both spirit of humility and greater understanding of the reality of gods great desire for our hearts my lord and my god 1firmly believe that you are here that you see that you hear 1adore you with profound reverence 1ask you for pardon of my sins and grace to make this time ofprayer fruitful my mother immaculate st joseph my father and lord my guardian angel intercede for consideration ithas been saidthat one cannot lovewhat onedoesnot knowconsequently during the firstpart ofthe bodyof ourprayer we seekto fill ourmind withknowledge and thoughts of god andthe virtuesthat will leadus to knowhimmore so thatwemight lovehim more in order to dothis we talkto god ingeneral aboutour chosentopic we consider the topic in our mind using ourunderstanding toattempt to fathomthe subjectcalling onour focus til chadter 1 to knowchristjesus 112 memory to recall what relates to it and ifour topicis astoryfrom the gospelsusing our imagination to tryto picture what itwould have been liketobe aparticipant inthe story ourselves for exampleif onewas meditating onthe story ofthe annunciation onemight talk to jesus about marys humility and herperfect abandonment to the willofherheavenlyfather one could meditate onwhat mary would have been wearingwhat hervoice would have sounded like andhow shewould have feltwhen gabriel first spoketoher insum the aim ofthe consideration sectionis to use our mindsto thinkabout ourtopic to fillour intellect with these ideas andto speakto our lord about all that arisesduring ourreflection conversation inthe secondpart ofthe body ofourprayer weseek to love ourlord more throughmeditation onhow ourchosen topic relates tous personally pouring outour hearts to our lord andtelling him everything that rises from ourdesires and ourwillas aresult ofour consideration itis during this time especially thatwe strive to fallmore deeply in lovewith our lordmaking actsofadoration contrition thanksgiving and intercession aswe meditate onthe intersection ofthe circumstances ofour lives and thetopic ofourprayer for exampleusing the storyofthe annunciation onceagainwe mightpraise god forthe beautiful example wehave in our lady we might make aselfexamination ofhowwe areliving outthe virtue ofhumility in our lives callingto mind specific instances wherewe

that is to sayby mundane knowledge failthe only path is communion with christ achievedin sacramental lifethe sequela ofchrist isnot aquestion ofmoralitybut amysteric themean ensemble ofdivine action

cross omits the essence of christianity see 1corinthians 22 4eternal life lastcentral element ofevery true evangelizationis eternal life todaywe must proclaim our faithwith new vigor indaily life here iwould only like tomention oneaspect ofthe preaching jesus which is often omitted todaytheproclamation ofthe kingdom ofgod isthe proclamation ofthe god present the godthat knows us listen to us the god that enters into history to dojustice therefore this preaching is also theproclamation ofjustice the proclamation ofour responsibility man cannot door avoid doingwhat he wants to hewillbejudged hemust account forthings this certitude is ofvalue both forthe powerful aswellas the simple ones where this ishonored the limitationsofevery power inthisworld aretraced godrendersjustice andonly he may ultimately dothis we will be able to dothis better themore we are able to liveunder the eyes ofgod andto communicate thetruth ofjustice to the world thus the article offaith injustice its force inthe fonnation of consciences is centraltheme ofthe gospeland is truly goodnews itis for all those sufferingthe injustices ofthe world andwho are looking forjustice this is alsohowwe can understand the connection between the kingdom ofgod andthe poor the suffering andallthose spokenabout in the beatitudes inthe speechon the mountain they areprotected by the certainty ofjudgment bythe certitudethat there is ajustice this is the truecontent of the article onjustice about god asjudge justice exists theinjustices ofthe world are notthe finalword ofhistory justice exists onlywhoever doesnotwant thereto bejustice can oppose this truth ifwe seriously consider thejudgment andthe seriousnessofthe responsibility forus that emerges from this wewill be able to understand full well the other aspect ofthis proclamation that is redemption the fact that jesus in the cross takeson our sinsgod himself in the passion ofthe sonbecomes the advocate forus sinners andthus making penance possible the hope for the repentant sinner hope expressed inamarvelous way by the words of stjohn before god we willreassure our heart whatever he reprovesus for for godis greater than ourhearts andhe knows everything 1john 319ftgods goodness is infinite butwe should not diminish this togoodness tomawkish affectation without truth only bybelieving inthejust judgment of godonlyby hungering and thirsting forjustice see matthew 56will we openup ourhearts ourlife to divine mercy this can be seen itisnt true that faithin eternallifemakes earthly life insignificantto the contrary only ifthe

say the our father to begin discipleship ii discuss spiritual issues gracebuildingonnature this is section of discussion that is critical in discipleship it is in striving to attain habits that are christ like that each will grow in holiness it is focus main mission to form and encourage sanctity within the missionary staff as well as on college campuss this iswhy it is imperative that the staff remains cheerfully hopeful and on fire for christ we need to avoid becoming lukewarm in our struggle for holiness it iswithin the area of discussing spiritual issues of discipleship that focus missionaries will challenge one another to greater sanctity prayer great place to start is by asking ones disciple how is your prayer life do you have set time that you pray every day if so when are you able to stay committed to that time making it priority everyday if not why or what do your think you can change in order to make it happen ever day do you think you should change the time etc once adisciple has nailed daily prayer for at least to minutes aday then challenge himlher to do more like 5 more minutes gently working each missionary up to 30 minutes to an hour of prayer daily b

focus encourages each staff member to live sacramental life this entails going to mass more often than on sundays the context of the discipleship relationship is great opportunity to discuss the spiritual life and how to challenge oneself to attend mass on daily basis that can be done gently by adding one more time each week as resolution or challenge under the issue of grace it is also great time to challenge disciples on making the focus examination of conscience each night before going to bed and then regular confession attendance the idea is that we will grow in knowledge of our faults and become more aware of what each cando to become more holy this is best done when one attends confession on regular basis d reading spiritual book spiritual reading will aid all staff in acquiring supernatural sense for our daily tasks and routines each focus staff member is encouraged to read some spiritual book this could range nom biography of saint classic spiritual book or recommended book focus has the beginning of list of options for staff to reference in order to give recommendations to disciples it is focus recommendation for each staff member to spend 1015 minutes day doing this type of spiritually enriching reading it is up to the disciple to suggest book and then hold the disciple accountable to finding the time to read again candid questions about the suggested time and length of time how successful the attempt to read is etc are appropriate questions for the mentor to pose to the disciple copyright q2003focus fellowship of catholic university students donot

introduced with some thought provoking questions and brief discussion then each disciple will be asked to take the followup home to read and study before the next weeks meeting b questions discussion during the following meetings the mentor and disciple will discuss the followup and the disciple will be given ample opportunity to ask questions and voice misunderstanding or concern for clarity it isup to the mentor to question the disciple on the information contained in the followup and up to both to come prepared for meaningful discussion an overall understanding of the concepts presented in the monthly followup is needed before the disciple is ready to give the followup to the next generation disciple iv discuss focus outreach bible studies it is important to ask each disciple about the focus bible study or studies heshe is leading ask how many students have signedup how many actually attend if the response is low ask why then help the disciple come up with possible remedies for low attendance maybe the time is too stiff and boring and needs to be more social and fun or maybe it is too chatty and loose and needs more structure and accountability ask questions and find solutions together ask if the students are responding to your disciples efforts is the missionary able to see leaders within the group is the missionary able to keep students on track is heshe making it through the focus study in atimely manner chapter week is suggested if the missionary has second generation studies or disciples cover those topics as well b disciples it may take an entire semester or even up to year of relationship building before missionary finds three students that are facf faithful available contagious cheerful and teachable as mentor it is up to you to keep encouraging your disciple to leading by example and waiting for god to show the leaders once disciples are in place then it is appropriate to inquire about the next generation of disciples ups downs joys concerns leadership potential etc if the disciple has questions about how to handle certain situations or issues with specific disciples then this is the place to discuss that and developsolutionsor

is during discipleship time that mentor can help fonn hislher disciple in areas dealing with the natural world focus will provide systematic listof natural virtues to work on and progress through discipleship giving guidance in modest dress personal hygiene counsel in public manners etc these will be brought up in discipleship so that each disciple will be challenged to greater natural virtue each mentor may help the disciple develop virtue and better habits by suggesting ways of rooting out the bad ones and replacing them with goods ones if someone always talks with food in their mouth they need to be made aware of the impropriety and encouraged to fonn good habit of not talking with food in their mouth if staff has bad habit of not showering regularly then they need to be encouraged to set higher goals of personal hygiene if staff member has difficult time listening and is always talking then heshe needs to beinade aware of the situation and encouraged to set goals to be better listener and less talkative many of these personal items will be easily addressed and changed ifwe take the time to mentor and teach our disciples with true charity this is great time to
