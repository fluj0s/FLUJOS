although the office of member of congress is not automatically forfeited upon conviction of felony sitting memb er of the house of representatives convicted of an offense that may result in two or

the floor of the house til his or her presumption of innocence is restored or until the individual is reelected to congress the rule is phrased in advisory not mandatory language because the house has raised issues concerning its authority to mandatorily suspend member from voting by process less than an expulsion9 members of the house however are explicitly instructed to follow both the spirit and the letter of the house rules10 and members are expected to abide by the abstention rule this instruction was emphasized in 2002 letter from the house committee on standards of official conduct to member of the house who had been convicted of multiple felony ffenses and was awaiting sentencing the committee stressed to that member in the strongest possible terms that if you violate the clear

hrept 1477 94th cong 2nd sess at 2 1976 the committee on standards of official conduct believe s that the house of representatives when considering an action against member who is currently involved in an active nondilatory criminal proceeding against him ordinarily should follow policy of taking legislative action until the conviction is finally resolved however in more recent cases the house has demonstrated that it will take action after members conviction but before appeal see discussion in this report below of members who have been convicted 13 see eg historical summary of conduct case s in the house of representatives committee on standards of official conduct november 2004 noting at least four such postponements or deferrals in 1982 1987 1988 and 1998house you risk subjecting yourself to action by this committee and by the house in addition to any other disciplinary acti on that may be initiate d in connection with your criminal conviction11 comparable provision in house rules exists regarding member who is merely under indictment for an offense congressional discipline indictment each house of congress has th express authority under article i section 5 clause 2 of the united st ates constitution to punish member for disorderly behaviour and with the concu rrence of twothirds to expel member although the breadth of authority and disc retion within each house as to the timing nature and underlying conduct involved in an internal discipline of member is extensive the traditional practice in congress in cases where member of congress has been indicted has been to wait to impose congressional discipline such as expulsion or censure against the member until the question of guilt has been at least initially resolved through the judicial system12 members of congress it should be noted like many other indivi duals have been indicted and charged with various offenses and then been subsequently exone rated in judicial proceedings the house has thus been reluctant to remove from c ongress individuals who have been lawfully elected as representatives by their c onstituents based merely upon charges in an indictment however imped iment in law or rule exis ts for ongoing congressional inquiries concurrent with criminal pr oceedings although such actions may complicate some evidentiary issues in subsequent judicial proceedings and certain internal concurrent congre ssional inquiries have in the past been postponed or partially deferred at the request of the department of justice13 in recent change to the house rules the house committ ee on

status as committee chair it was noted that in compliance with an unwritten rule of the house mr zihlman refrained from active participation in the proceedings of the house and the committee was represented on the floor by the ranking memberwith criminal conduct in an state or federal court14 the committee is instructed to either empanel the investigative subcommittee within 30 days of the indictment or other filing of charges or to report to the house the reasons for not empaneling such an investigative subcommittee such as as noted by the sponsor of the provision if the committee members do not feel that going forward is appropriate15 an attempt to mandatorily suspend an indicted member from voting or participating in congressional proceedings however raises several issues in general elected representatives and senators ar not in the same situation as persons appointed to positions in the government with indefinite tenure nor as private professionals who might be suspended for period of time merely upon suspicion or charges being levied because member s of congress are directly elected by answerable to and personally represent the people of their district or state in the congress the authority of either hous to mandatorily suspend member from participation in c ongressional business has thus b een questioned on grounds of both policy and power because such action would in effect disenfranchise that members entire constituency deprive the people of their full constitutional representation in congress and would not allow the constitu ents to replace member such as they could in an expulsion action16 in the past some members have voluntarily refrained from participating in congressional matters wh ile under indictment17 but this does not appear to be common practice in more recent times in the past century conviction conviction of crime may subj ect and has subjected in the past member of the house to intern disciplinary action including resolution for

there is impediment for the people of district or stat to choose an individual who is under indictment or who is convicted felon to represent them in congress furthermore because the qualifications
