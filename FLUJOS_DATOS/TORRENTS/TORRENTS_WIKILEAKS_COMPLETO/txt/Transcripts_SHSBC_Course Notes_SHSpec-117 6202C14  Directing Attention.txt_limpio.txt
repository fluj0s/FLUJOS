6202c14 shspec117 directing attention if you cant easily release an arc break or easily get rudiment in it is always safe to assume that havingness is out when the pcs attention is distracted havingness drops and the bank tends to collapse on him details of running routine 3dxx dont hesitate to check ruds question twice if you are in doubt about read be careful be precise dont put looking good over doing good job put accuracy first the only person who loses otherwise is the pc it is the same with being kind to the pc or failing to direct the pcs attention or anything that adds up to noauditing and keep the should have knowns cleaned up and you will never get arc broken pcs it is interesting to note that if you look over an old sec check and find the missed withhold at the point where the pc went into past life you will find one in this lifetime it is connected and it restimulates the past life and maybe it is hot one that got missed by going backtrack it is true that withholds in past lives are causing all the pcs real difficulties but they are handled in 3dxx not missed withholds the pc never forgives you if you let him give up if you dont direct the pcs attention you will get gains in session if you let pcs attention wander that is more productive of arc breaks than directing his attention even if it doesnt seem nice or kind your attitude to the pc mean kind or whatever doesnt much matter as long as you are effective you dont overwhelm the pc with mood you overwhelm the pc with inval and eval it is not being ladylike or gentlemanly that gives the pc gains it is directing the pcs attention however crudely and badly and being effective the liability of prepchecking and the withhold system of hcob 12feb62 is that every time the pc comes close to the key withhold he is likely to get cross with the auditor it is an indicator the missed withhold mechanism with curve in it you innocently ask the pc who didnt know about that who should have known or whatever get down to all and have the pc irritated now you are on the edge of it thats all if you dont head the pc on down the alley to face that withhold you will have an upset pc primary withhold pulling flubs 1 the pc natters about joe the auditor gets only motivators thus letting the pc commit more overts by making damaging statements 2 letting the pc give you other peoples withholds that being interesting gossip waste of time 3 taking critical thoughts without getting the underlying overts this gives gain 4 stenographic auditing failure to direct the pcs attention it lets his run his havingness down and commit overts of defaming people critical thoughts are an indicator of overts and can be used to trap the pc into leading into the overts fifteen or twenty seconds of listening to them is enough under the withhold system critical thought can be one question all will get the rest where you can coax the pc into revealing the rest the one question is never the question you work hard on it is just used to test this is especially true when it is critical thought you are after all the done the critical thought question wont clear until youve got all the done the withhold system helps you direct the pcs attention to where it should be put but it is still not rote robotic action put little invitation and coax into it plus little insistence to look if you want to know the answers and you are interested you will operate much more effectively you can meterdate to help the pc to look because withholds do scramble or group the track and make it difficult for him to spot when your rancor if any should only be directed at the aspect of the pcs looking not at his telling you even if the meter reacts the pc doesnt know in fact it is because the pc doesnt know that it reacts if you imply that he is deliberately not telling you put him into games condition use whatever trickery persuasion or skill you like to direct the pcs attention but direct it get the pcs interest in it too if you get an irregular response to the withhold question ask the pc if repetition of the question is causing an arc break because the emeter has confusion point data in the bank and an arc break can both give response cleaning clean will produce an arc break on the missed withhold of nothing lot of auditors ran goals and terminals lists up to thousands of items by getting protest reads on the demand for more items commonly though after you clean up the arc break in running the withhold system the pc will have more on the withhold the pc gets misemotional with the auditor because the auditor represents all the people who should have known about the withhold and didnt if the pc doesnt get misemotional it is sign that you are not getting anywhere because you havent hit anything hot if the pc stays bright and cheerful through the session and never gets anything that makes him feel bad or look bad he is liable to arc break after the session feeling that it was wasted time dont expect the pc to go on gradient scale of getting better on the withhold system he goes on gradient scale of looking worse life has begun to loom as grim serious proposition they may go into this curve and out in twenty minutes or in four sessions depending on the beefiness of the zero question how hot button it is with how much avoidance in it the hotter the question the more charge there is to be bled the milder the charge the shorter the cycle of action this cycle is not the usual processing cycle it is is alerted goes down to the bottom then shoots up to the top see fig 7 the entire force of an aberration is directed to pulling the attention in while buffing it off you dont have to pull the pcs attention to the middle of any aberration because it is fixed there dut every aberration has buffer that bounces the pc out again it is not clear inflow or outflow the mind is actually concentrated on it 100 so the more you get him to look in that direction the paler and worse he will look until he gets it all cleaned up then you get to the last remnants of it you really have to help the pc out because he is stonied he just cant force his attention into it so letting his attention ride all over the place is letting the pc be the effect of the withhold and the charge and he will never forgive you as the cognition figure 7 the cycle of pulling withhold graphics inserted approaches the attention is harder to direct into the center of the withhold given something the pc has really nonconfronted at the time he will often have some bit of it that he has utterly fictionalized written script for etc he backs out of all responsibility for it and as his attention gets directed at it he tends to veer off and gets chargy and irritated at the auditor you must differentiate between the pc who is arc broken because he is in games condition with the auditor and one who is introvertedly arc broken and snapping at everything they look quite different if you direct the pcs attention terminatedly to the whole precise withhold you will get fine resurgence if you dont the pc will be miserable because his whole bank is kicking him in the head because there is one helping him hold it down you have to keep your eye out for the pcs tendency to go general on you to never give you anything specific and to just gloss over the top of it all you have to get the pc to look he has to tell you when he has seen it but he will tell you only when he knows if he says i dont know just say lets find out lets look lets dig bit dont think the pc is upset with you when he is upset with the bank emphasize looking not telling the pc will tell you what he can see you can clean up pc who has had some auditing some sec checking with recurring withholds by getting what withhold kept coming up and using the withhold system steps 2 3 and 4 when all and who see page 186 above used repetitively to discharge the what question or one question on it to find what has been missed in it you can also start from who the pc has complained about lot but knowing 3dxx you wont sail in towards target that is terminal your zero question should be on doingness knowingness or havingness not beingness probably any terminal that has been located on 3dxx could be moved in on and prepchecked by this system this hasnt been tried yet but those would be the beingnesses to take up if any
