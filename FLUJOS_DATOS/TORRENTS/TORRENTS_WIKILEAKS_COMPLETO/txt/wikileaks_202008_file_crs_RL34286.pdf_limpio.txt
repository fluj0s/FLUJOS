wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34286 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rl34286 modernizing insurance regulation optional federal charter legislation baird webel government and finance division december 14 2007 abstract optional federal charter ofc legislation was ﬁrst introduced in the 107th congress with bills being introduced in the 109th and 110th congresses as well speciﬁcs of ofc legislation can vary widely but the common thread is the creation of dual regulatory system inspired by the current banking regulatory system ofc bills generally would create federal insurance regulator that would operate concurrently with the present state system insurers would be able to choose whether to take out federal charter which would exempt them from most state insurance regulations or to continue under state charter and the 50 state system of insurance regulation given the greater uniformity of life insurance products and the greater competition faced by life insurers some have suggested the possibility of ofc legislation that would apply only to life insurers but such bills have been introducedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34286g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

financial services industry unlike the other two banks and securities insurance is primarily regulated at the state rather than federal level the primacy of state regulation dates back to 1868 when the supreme court found in paul v virginia 75 us 8 wall 168 1868 that insurance did not constitute interstate commerce and thus did not fall under the powers granted the federal government in the constitution 1n 1944 however the court cast doubt on this finding in united states v southeastern underwriters association 322 us 533 1944 preferring to leave the state regulatory system intact in the aftermath of this decision congress enacted the mccarranferguson act of 1945 pl 7915 59 stat 33 which reaffirmed the states as principal regulators of insurance over the years since 1945 congressional interest in the possibility of repealing mccarranferguson and reclaiming authority over insurance regulation has waxed and waned in recent years particularly since the grammleach bliley act of 1999 glba pl 106102 113 stat 1338 the financial services industry has seen increased competition between us banks insurers and securities firms and on the global scale complaints that the 50 state regulatory system puts insurers at competitive disadvantage in the marketplace have been rising whereas the insurance industry had previously been united in preferring the state regulatory system it has now splintered with larger insure rs tending to argue for federal system and smaller insurers tending to favor the state system some members of congress have responded since the 107 th congress with different proposals ranging from complete federalization of the inte rstate insurance industry to leaving the state system intact with limited federal standards and preemptions the most common proposal has been for an optional federal char ter ofc for the insurance industr this idea borrows the idea of dual regulatory system from the banking system both the states and the federal government would offer chartering system for insurers with the insurers having the choice between the two the proposed national insurance act of 2007 s 40 and hr 3200 is currently the only ofc legislation offered in the first session of the 110th congress proponents of ofc legislation typically cite the effi ciencies that could be gained from uniform system along with the ability of federal regulator to better address the complexities of the current insurance market and the need for sing federal voice for the insurance industry in international negotiations opponents of ofc legislation are typically concerned with the inability of federal regulator to take into account local conditions the lack of consumer service that would result from faraway bureaucracy in washington dc and the overall deregulation contained in some of the ofc proposals this report offers brief analysis of the forces prompting ofc legislation followed by discussion of the arguments for and against an ofc and summaries of various ofc legislation that has been proposed it will be updated as legislative events warrant

pillars of the financial services industry unlike the other two banks and securities insurance is primarily regulated at the state rather than federal level the primacy of state regulation dates back to 1868 when the supreme court found that insurance did not constitute interstate commerce and thus did not fall under the powers granted the federal government in the constitution1 in 1944 however the court cast doubt on this finding2 preferring to leave the state regulatory system intact in the aftermath of this decision congress enacted the mccarranferguson act of 19453 which reaffirmed the states as principal regulators of insurance over the years since 1945 congressional interest in the possibility of repealing mccarranferguson and reclaiming authority over insurance regulation has waxed and waned in 1974 congress enacted the the employee retirement income security act4 erisa preempting state laws governing many health benefit plans offered by employers thus essentially federalizing much of the regulation of health insurance in 1980 the congress curtailed the authority of the federal trade commission ftc to investigate the insurance industry reducing small avenue of federal oversight on insurance5 in the early 1990s bill6 to repeal the limited antitrust exemption granted insurers in mccarranferguson and thus expand federal oversight of insurance was reported out of committee in the house but never reached the house floor in 1999 congress enacted the grammleachbliley act 7 glba which specifically reaffirmed the states as the functional regulators of insurance glba may have statutorily reaffirmed the primacy of state regulation of insurance but it also unleashed market forces that were already encouraging greater federal role glba removed legal barriers between securities banks and insurers which along with improved technology has been an important factor in creating more direct competition among the three groups many financial products have converged so that products with similar economic outcomes may be available from different financial services firms w ith dramatically different regulators insurers face 50 different state regulators and state laws many of which differ on some particulars of insurance regulation this has lead to industry complaints of overlapping and sometimes contradictory regulatory edicts driving up the cost of compliance and increasing the time necessary to bring new products to market these complaints existed prior to glba but the insurance industry generally resisted federalization of insurance regulation at the time facing new world of competition however the industry spli t with larger insurers tending to favor some form of federal regulation and smaller insurers tending to favor continuation of the state regulatory system life insurers tend to more directly compete with banks and securities firms so they tend to favor some form of federal charter more than propertycasualty insurers some members of congress have responded to the changing environment in the financial services industry with variety of legislation in the 108 th congress senator ernest hollings 1 paul v virginia 75 us 8 wall 168

the 108th and 109th congresses representative richard baker drafted but never introduced the smart act8 that would have left the states the primary regulators but harmonized the system through various federal preemptions the most consistent response has been the introduction of legislation calling for an optional federal charter ofc for insurance ofc legislation was first introduced in the 107th congress with bills being introduced in the 109th and 110th congresses as well specifics of ofc legislation can vary widely but the common thread is the creation of dual regulatory system inspired by the current banking regulatory system ofc bills generally would create federal insurance regulator that would operate concurrently with the present state system insurers would be able to choose

argument that the regulation of insurance companies needs to be modernized at the federal level to make insurers more competitive with other federally regulated financial institutions in the postglba environment other arguments advanced for dual chartering include the following the need to have federal insurance regulator who could have knowledgeable voice and be an insurance advocate in washington dc the success of the comptroller of the currency occ in expanding bank products through preemption of state laws the need for speed to market for product approval so insurers will not be at distinct disadvantage in product creation and delivery the creation of more accommodating regulatory environment as result of competition between federal and state regulators as in the case of banks the ability to achieve national treatment so that single charter would allow insurers to do business in all states and avoid higher costs of state regulation due to the need to comply with 50 state regulators the difficulty insurers have in expand ing abroad without regulator at the national level greater supply of insurance and lower cost to consumers as insurance companies are forced to compete on national scale 8 this act was the subject of june 16 2005 hearing in the house financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises entitled

the arguments of those who oppose any federal regulation of insurance companies but prefer that the state insurance regulatory system be maintained include the following state insurance regulators unique knowledge of local markets and conditions the flexibility and adaptability of state regulation to local conditions the diversity of state regulation which reduces the impact of bad regulation and promotes innovation and good regulation the reduced risk that regulator who pursues bad policies will be able to affect large numbers of insurers the existence of strong incentives such as direct election for state regulators to do the job effectively at the state level the danger of costly overlay of new federal bureaucracy fiscal damage to the states should state premium taxes be reduced by the federal system9 the fragmentation of the overall insurance regulatory system that could result from dual chartering and statefederal oversight the possibility of race to the bottom as state and federal regulators compete to give insurers more favorable treatment and thus secure greater oversight authority and budget in the abstract the ofc question could be simply about the who of regulation should it be the federal government the states or some combin ation of the two in practice however ofc legislation has had much to say about the how of regulation should the government continue the same fine degree of industry oversight that it has practiced in the past the ofc bills that have been introduced to this point have tended to answer the latter question negativelythe federal regulator that they would create would exercise less regulatory oversight than most state regulators this deregulatory aspect of past and present ofc bills can be as great source of controversy as the introduction of federal regulation itself g17g153g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g5g145g138g155g157g142g155g146g151g144g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561

affairs house financial services and house judiciary and neither has been the specific subject of hearings or markups two general hearings on insurance regulatory reform however were held by the house financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises in october 2007 and the possibility of an optional federal charter was major topic of discussion in the subcommittee chairman paul kanjorski indicated in his opening statement of the october 3 hearing 10 that there would be series of hearings on insurance reform but further hearings have not been scheduled at this point s 40 and hr 3200 are very similar but not iden tical bills both would create the option of federal charter for the insurance industry includ ing insurers insurance agencies and independent insurance producers the bills would create federal regulatory and supervisory apparatus including an office of national insurance and national insurance commissioner this federal regulator would generally be overseen by the secretary of the treasury but the secretary would be forbidden from interfering in specific matters before the commissioner the budget for the office would be paid for by fees and assessments on insurers the commissioner would be appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate for fiveyear term holders of national license would be exempt from most state insurance laws thus nationally licensed insurers agencies and producers would be able to operate in the entire united states without fulfilling the requirements of the 50 states insurance laws some significant aspects of the bills include the following 11 the federal system would apply to propertycasualty and life insurance except for title insurance and including surplus lines insurance12 rate regulation would not be applicable to national insurers form regulation the ability of the regulator to control what will and will not be included in an insurance policy would be reduced substantially compared to most states fees covering the cost of the system would be assessed on those operating under the federal system national insurers would continue to pay state premium taxes so there should be loss of premium tax revenue to the states national insurers would continue to be subject to state laws requiring participation in residual market entities but only if rates charged by the residual market entity covers all costs incurred and only if there are rate and form requirements concurrent with participation reform of the state regulation of surplus lines insuranceonly the state in which the insured resides or does business would be allowed to tax surplus lines insurance 10 see httpwwwhousegovappslisthearingfinancialsvcs_demoskanjorski100307pdf visited on december 13 2007 11 complete

insurance would apply federal antitrust laws to national insurers except to the extent that state laws continue to apply to them differences between s 40 and hr 3200 are relatively minor including the following hr 3200 would specifically allow nonus reinsurers to file financial data in accordance with international financial reporting standards hr 3200 would limit jurisdiction over nonus reinsurers to federal courts rather than including state and local courts hr 3200 would broaden slightly and clarify antifraud language beyond the general aspects inherent in the ofc concept such as the dual competing regulatory structures and uniform regulation across the country the most striking specific aspect of s 40 and hr 3200 is the lessening of the rate and form regulation under these bills as compared to the current system currently every state has some measure of rate and form regulation 13 in some states insurers must get specific prior approval for changes to rates and forms while in others insurers may have some freedom to change rates and forms with the possibility that the state insurance commissioner could disallow the change after the fact s 40 and hr 3200 specifically
