dadis and beyond ref rabat 1009 b rabat 0988 rabat 00001018 0012 of 002 classified by dcm robert p jackson for reasons 14b and d 1 snf summary xxxxxxxxxxxx told poloffs on december 30 that despite dadis camaras apparent desire to depart morocco ref he is in condition to travel and will not be able to resume control of the country minister of national defense sekouba konate and an assistant mr bah along with minister of communications idrissa cherif have been in rabat to visit dadis but konate planned to return to guinea by december 31 possibly to present to the guinean people case for his assumption of power in place of dadis the next ten days would be telling and potentially chaotic for the country according to xxxxxxxxxxxx but with the assistance of the international community konate should be able to control the army and avert violence that could have regional implications end summary 2 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx told poloffs on december 30 that dadis camara was in condition to travel and would not be able to control guinea again xxxxxxxxxxxx said that dadis camara still had bullet in his head suffered from impaired vision and speech and was not fully aware of his surroundings xxxxxxxxxxxx himself admitted that he had not seen dadis according to him only konate and bah were allowed into his room regarding earlier news reports that dadis was preparing to speak to the guinean people xxxxxxxxxxxx said that if dadis could speak to the media he certainly would have by now evidently dadis also suffered from heart problems unrelated to the gunshot wounds 3 snf konate evidently was not in the best of health either and sought medical consultation while here in rabat reportedly heavy drinker konate suffered from liver problems consistent with his intake of large amounts of alcohol on december 30 senior moroccan military officials separately questioned konates fitness to lead calling him weak 4 snf for xxxxxxxxxxxx konates travel to rabat allowed him to return to guinea and report on the basis of his firsthand knowledge that dadis was unable to continue in his role as leader of guinea paving the way for konate to assume power for transitional period were konate to attempt to take control without having undertaken the trip to rabat to see dadis he would have been perceived as traitor to dadis and have legitimacy before the guinean people and army konate would then have cherif and claude pivi another cndd leader arrested xxxxxxxxxxxx said 5 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx went on to say that cherif was behind demonstrations being planned for conakry while pivi who was from the same ethnic group as dadis might organize supporters on an ethnic basis and incite clashes with other groups given that ethnic and national boundaries are not coterminous this could affect neighboring countries and plunge the entire region into chaos ref b asserted xxxxxxxxxxxx with the help of the united states and european countries konate would be able to take power and control the army which lacked discipline and had too many crooks and militias but xxxxxxxxxxxx did not specify what sort of assistance from the international community would be necessary 6 snf comment xxxxxxxxxxxx urged intervention both to keep dadis out of guinea and to support an effort by konate to take power in the country in order to forestall devastating ethnic violence his argument that dadis would rabat 00001018 0022 of 002 have made public statement by now if he could have is compelling while his comment that konate would have other cndd leaders arrested suggests that the fate of guinea does not depend on dadis alone dadis has amassed militias and enjoys some popular support ref b and for xxxxxxxxxxxx his return would undoubtedly lead to violence and unrest his continued absence however might not preclude it end comment 7 u tripoli minimize considered visit embassy rabats classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalmoro cco kaplan
