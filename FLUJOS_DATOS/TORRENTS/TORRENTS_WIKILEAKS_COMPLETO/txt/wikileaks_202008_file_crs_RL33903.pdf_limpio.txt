primarily by the us chamber of commerce since the first bills were introduced in the 103rd congress many of the arguments nd positions supporting and opposing genetic nondiscrimination legislation have remained largely unchanged supporters of nondiscrimination legislation feel that cu rrent laws are not sufficient to protect individuals from discrimination in health insurance or employment supporters of the legislation further contend that without protection individuals are hesitant to seek potentially beneficial genetic services or pa rticipate in much needed clinical research opponents believe that current law provides sufficient pr otection they are primarily concerned that new legislation will provi further incentives and additional opportunities for litigation against

with respect to genetic discriminati on namely whether the potential for genetic discr imination by employers and insurers merits protections for genetic information that are more extensive than those already in place for health information in genera l there are several fundamental points that it may wish to consider thes include an understanding of what genetic information and discrimination are how current laws affect employers and insurers use of genetic and other health informa tion how proposed legislation would amend current law and the arguments that have b een made both in favor of and against the passage of legislation properly defining genetic information in potential nondiscrimination legislation is essential as the scope of the definition will largely determine the types of activities that are permitted and proscribed yet this basic concept may prove to be complex as many types of health in formation have genetic co mponent genetic information may be defined and rived in number of ways of course it may be obtained via genetic testing however it may also be discernable through ot her laboratory testing that does not involve specific examinati on of genes such as some protein or molecular testing it may sometimes be derived through physical examination for example downs syndrome which has genetic basis has specific physical characteristics such as single crease across each palm finally genetic information may be discernable from familys medical history which might reveal risks for certain types of cancer hypertension and myriad of other diseases with genetic component once the definition of genetic information is settled the question of what constitutes discrimination based on that information can be addressed in the context of the current debate in congress genetic discrimination can be defined as the potential use of an individuals genetic info rmation by employers or health insurers to discriminate against that individual in employment decisions hiring promotions firing or health insurance coverage deci sions eligibility or premiums although the use of health information including genetic information by employers and insurers is currently regulated some argue that genetic information merits special protections under the law three federal laws and presidential orde r touch on the issues raised by the use of genetic information

prevent potential discrimination on the basis of genetic information argue that current federal and state protections are sufficient the insurance industry also ar gues that additional regulation would be confusing unnecessary and costly they claim that it would be unfair to prohibit them from acquiring genetic informati on when they already use other health information some groups such as the am erican association of health plans now part of the americas health insuran ce plans support the premise of federal nondiscrimination legislation and have indicated support for legislation that is consistent with their principles10 however others would further limit the definition of genetic information11 one bill introduced in the 108th congress hr 3636 would have prohibited health insurers from discriminating based on predictive genetic information but would not have affected employers the bill had cosponsors and many consumer groups indicated that they would not support nondiscrimination legislation without both insurance and employment provisions some employers question whether legislation is necessary because there are few documented cases of discr imination based on genetic in formation and there is evidence that employers would use the information if they had it in addition employers argue that existing law provi des adequate protec tion against genetic discrimination in employment randy j ohnson vice president of the us chamber of commerces office of labor policy stated that if the legislation were to pass it should be narrowed to acknowledge that employers should be able to make employment decisions based on information that some workers with specified genetic markers could pose signi ficant risk to others12 other business coalition members

framework for discussion about whether ex tra protections are necessary for genetic information and if so which protections ar most appropriate health information which includes genetic information is cu rrently used by health insurers and employers it is often presumed confidential but increasing capabilities to store and rapidly transfer data electronically escalate the challenge of protecting privacy both the ways in which health insurers and employers use and are restricted from using health information are discussed in the sections that follow use of genetic and other health information by health insurers several federal laws help provide some protection against genetic discrimination in health insurance these laws include the health insurance portability and accountab ility act hipaa of 1996 specifically title i health care access portability and renewability the social security act ssa and the hipaa privacy rule hipaa prohibits group health plans from imposing preexisting condition exclusion on the basis of genetic information or establishing eligibility requirements for any indivi dual based on genetic inform ation however hipaa does not prohibit group health plan from charging all members of group higher premiums on the basis of an individual s genetic information the ssa contains provisions that prohibit discrimination in th pricing or issuance of medigap policies on the basis of health status13 however those protecti ons generally expire six months after person becomes eligible for medigap and they do not expressly extend to genetic information in add ition the ssa does not currently prohibit an issuer of medicare supplemental policy from requesting or requiring genetic testing the privacy rule gives patients the right of access to their medical

covers all individually identifiable health informati on including genetic tests and information about an individuals family history the ru permits group health plan to disclose individually identifiable health information to an employer that sponsors the plan provided the information is used onl for plan administration purposes health insurers typically use family history among many health factors in the process of placing individuals or groups in risk category for determining their premiums underwriting indi viduals or groups at higher risk may be charged higher premiums to cover the anticipated costs of their care traditional approaches to underwriting also use age sex type of occupa tion financial st ability of group members employee turnover and prior cost of care experience to determine what groups insurance premium should be in general premiums for large group with one or two sick members can remain relatively stable as the cost of the sick individuals is spread among all members of the group however as groups b ecome smaller the cost of insurance for the group is more dependent on the health of the individual group members since one sick individual in small group can re sult in high premiums for the whole group individuals who are not part of group coverage seeking to purchase individual health insurance must bear the entire premium increase associated with any illness thus making such insurance prohibitively expensive for many sick individuals insurers claim that most genetic information is not currently useful to the underwriting process because the clinical si gnificance and relations hip to the severity of illness is not known for many conditions however once the link to future illness is established and the costs thereof become predictable insurers use of genetic information might be different than the use of other diagnostic information some actuaries agree that adding diagnostic information significantly improves the power of traditional underwr iting methods to predict future medical expense14 one author has provided model dem onstrating how genetic information including family history that has known correlation to specifi c disease such as huntingtons disease or breast cancer coul d be used to underwrite life insurance15 some health care providers nd consumers fear that the m odel could also be applied to health insurance the models author suggests that insurers support screening for genetic mutations for which preventive interventions can reduce the risk of death however health insurers may disagree depending on the nature expense and effectiveness of the interventions in preventing symptoms and other medical costs of treating an acute or chronic illness that which reduces the risk of death may not reduce health or disability expenses and lower life insurance premiums in addition health insurers may be reluctan t to bear the costs of preventive care particularly in climate in which individuals change health insurers frequently anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33903crs7 16 statement of tom miller director of health policy studies the cato institute on genetic privacy before the

working conversation on continuedinsurer that pays for prevention may not ultimately reap the financial benefits of avoiding the illness the problem of adverse selection the predictive power of genetic testing raises concern for insurers bout the possibility of adverse selection adverse selection can occur when an insu rance applicant knows and the insurance company does not know that the applican t has some health risk possibly due to genetic information in this case the applicant may be motivated to purchase insurance with greater coverage and may be able to do so at lesser premium some argue that the specter of adverse selection requires that insurance companies have access to gene tic information or else th eir financial solvency may be threatened because individuals might obtain insurance at premiums that did not accurately reflect their risk of expenditures16 others argue that concerns about adverse selection with respect to ge netic information may be unfounded the majority of americans receive their insurance through their employers which are group rated ie premiums ar based on an assessment of the average risk among all employees this system creates incentives for lowrisk individuals to purchase coverage thus diminishing the potential imp act of adverse selection in addition some note that genetic information about di sease risk may prove to be so complicated as to be essentially useless to an insurer17 for example for complex multigenic disease there may be numerous genes invol ved each of which contributes relatively little to an individuals risk of developing disease in addition these variants will be modified by environmental factors that further complicate the analysis use of genetic and other health information by employers one federal law the americans with disabilities act ada may provide some protections against employers use of employees genetic information the ada prohibits employers from revoking an ffer or from making other promotion decisions on the basis of that health info rmation though genetics is not specifically addressed by the ada the equal empl oyment opportunitie s commission eeoc interprets the ada to mean th at employees andor job pplicants cannot be required to undergo genetic screening however current law permits employers to require medical examinations of prospective em ployees who have been given conditional offers of employment if all employees in similar situation are given the medical exam employers may also receive information related to applicants or employees current disability or

risk of harm another federal law the occupational safety and hazard act osha may permit employers to conduct some genetic tests on empl oyees osha establishes legal duty for employers to protect employees from hazards in the workplace although the statute does not require an empl oyer to perform particular tests the employer may choose to implement prog rams that monitor employees potential exposure to toxic or hazardous elements standards for these programs allow for genetic testing20 genetic monitoring for acquired damage resulting from exposure to toxic element is different from genetic screening for an inherited predisposition to an occupationally related disease21 for example monitoring may be used to determine if an employee is developing dna damage from being exposed to asbestos on the other hand different type of test could potentially termine if the employee were more susceptible to asbestos damage to begin with the distinction may be relevant should questions arise regarding whether any illhealth effects sustained by the worker were result of occupational exposure genetic information as noted in the introduction the definition of genetic information is key issue for congress in its consid eration of genetic nondiscr imination legislati on because the broader the definition the more expans ive the prohibitions on discrimination the definition of genetic

from an individual or an individuals family members informa tion about an individuals current health status such as sex age results of physical examination and chemical blood or urine analysis where

different from other hea lth information second if so do the differences indicate that genetic information merits additional protections genetic information has been describe d as being different from other health information because of factors such as its stability its unique predictive qualities its potential use for individual and familial iden tification and the impact that public fear of discrimination is having on the behavior of patients and healthcare providers some argue that these factors may ma ke the misuse of genetic information particularly detr imental to individuals and therefor that the information deserves special protections further they argue that the public health benefits that could come from largescale genetic research and the utilization of new genetic technologies may not be fully realized unl ess public fear is assuaged by genetic nondiscrimination legislation those opposed to special protections assert that genetic information is fundamentally

have argued that legislation is not necessary because genetic discrimination is not occurring there have indeed been relatively few reported cases of genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment rothenberg and terry hypothesize that this is because 1 the use of genetic information by employers and insure rs is not widespread 2 affected persons may not know the underlying basis for adve rse employment or insurance decisions and 3 many cases may go unreported because of disincentives associated with publicizing discrimination lawsuits24 reports of cases of genetic discrimination

settings and these studies are quite dated one study reported that 22 of survey re spondents indicated that they or family member were refused health insurance as result of genetic condition25 this study was strongly criticized by the health insurance association of america hiaa at the time which argued that there is evidence showing that insurers engage in genetic discrimination and that

decision to seek insurance reimbursement in nother study of 68 pa tients offered genetic testing for breast cancer while 18 had access to free testing and 13 sought insurance reimbursement the remaining 37 chose to pay out of pocket citing concerns over insurability and confidentiality reasons48 other authors have postulated that those with the lowest income who were covere d by government healthcare programs such as medicaid may be less c oncerned about genetic disc rimination because their eligibility for health insurance does not depend on health stat us or underwriting decisions49 the role of genetic counseling when viewing evidence of the ways in which fear of genetic discrimination affects behavior some have questione d whether genetic counseling itself may inadvertently add to the fear the risk of discrimination by employers and insurers is often discussed in the counseling session that accompanies testing most counselors typically spend up to 15 minutes of one to two hour counseling session discussing patient concer ns about discrimination even in states with more comprehensive antidiscrimina tion laws counselors typi cally note that actual cases of discrimination are few and will provide information regarding the various legal protections50 while many counselors indicate th at significant proportion 2550 of patients may decline tes ting due to potential discr

discrimination either way counselors note that the potential risk adds to an already stressful situation in order to reassure patients about pr ivacy genetic counselors may vary their practices in several ways th ey may be discreet about how visit is documented ie for cancer screening not genetic testing they may not send the results to the referring physician unless as ked specifically by the patient to do so or they may request that the physician keep the results in separate medical record some will forward coded samples to the laboratories for testing many genetic counselors will themselves maintain patient files that are separate from the rest of the hospital or medical centers records to minimize the possibility that an insurer will obtain genetic information in the process of reviewing medical record for reimbursement51 genetic counselors note that the fears associated with predictive testing for future adult onset illness are not as apparent in testing in the prenatal and pediatric populations presumably this is because of the crisis atmosphere created with the diagnosis of potential birth defect and th parents decision of whether or not to terminate pregnancy in some cases in cluding those involving newborns the fear of insurability may be mitigated by the f act that children ar covered under their parents policies however some counselors have expr essed concern about the way in which genetic information will be viewed when children become adults and have to find insurance on their own52 the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2007 s 358hr

an understanding of how the hipaa privacy rule currently governs insurers and employers use of health information is useful the sections that follow present background about the privacy rule and then present several of the issues that have been the topic of debate over time privacy rule background in general the privacy rule covers all individually identifiable health information that is created or received by health plan or health care provider including ge netic information and information about an individuals family medical history55 plans and providers may use and disclose health information for their own treatment payment and other routine health care operations without patient au thorization and with few restrictions the rule however does not apply to other entities that collect and maintain health information such as financial institutions that offer lif insurance employers that sponsor health plans on behalf of their employees present challenge for the rules implementation because of their interrelationship with the insurer or health maintenance organization hmo that typically administers the plan in their role as plan sponsor employers may seek health information to carry out various plan functions while the rule in general does not regulate employers it does address the use and disclosure of health information including genetic information by employers that sponsor group health plans the rule permits group health plan health insurance issuer or an hmo acting for group health plan to disclose health information to plan sponsor employer provided the plan documents are amended so that they limit the uses and disclosures of information by the sponsor to those consistent with the privacy rule in addition an employer must certify to group health plan that it will not use the information for employmentrelated actions eg hiring and promotion decisions the em ployer must agree to establish adequate firewalls so that only those employees th at need health information to perform functions on behalf of th group health plan have access to such information56 title i is the privacy rule sufficient to protect consumers s 358 and hr 493 would extend privacy rule pr otections to insurance and employment functions to clarify the permitted uses of information as exchanged between plan sponsors employers and group health plans

expressed concern that the legislation which was inte nded to increase utilization of health care services and participation in clinical studies would actually reduce utilization because the overly burdensome separate file re quirement would raise the cost of providing genetic services and would affect insurers willingness to pay for them others argued that the separate file requireme nt was not particularly bur densome the privacy rule already requires employers limit access to empl oyees protected health information they further argued that the separate file requirement was restricted to employers and would not affect insure rs or their customers title i would the minimum pena lty encourage frivolous lawsuits the bills provide that when title i is vi olated and willful neglect is found there is minimum penalty of 2500 for more vere or prolonged violations the minimum penalty is 15000 some have argued that the establishment of minimum penalty would increase the incentive for indivi duals to sue health plans for violations of privacy or denial of coverage based on genetic information and could act as disincentive for settling disagreements others have argued that the penalty clauses are equivalent to those contai ned in other civil rights gislation and th at appropriate penalties are necessary to ter discriminatory practices title ii do the bills specify how information may flow between group health plan and an employer s 358 and hr 493 generally prohibit employers from requesting or requiring ge netic information about their employees this is more restrictive than what hipaa currently permits hipaa allows group health plans to disclose health inform ation including genetic information to plan sponsors employers if certain conditi ons are met the conditions are generally designed to allow sponsors to use the info rmation to perform f unctions on behalf of the group health plan ie administer th plan and develop of new insurance contracts

insurers can release to employers particularly if genetic information which w ould have to be separated from other health information and be withhe ld from employers is not clearly defined supporters of the legislati on indicate that the bills would not change the foundation of protections established by hipaa and the privacy rule instead the net affect would be to build upon that foundation to cl

voting services in certain states and political subdivisions with significant numbers of nonenglish speaking citizens the voting rights act was last reauthorized in 2006 and extende d for period of 25 years pl 109246 see 42 usc 1973aa1a title ii would the bills create an incentive for suing employers the bills would permit individuals to sue without first filing complaint with the eeoc some have argued that this coupled with the absence of cap on compensatory and punitive damages would encourage frivolous litigation57 others argue that as with title i penalties are c onsistent with remedies under existing civil rights legislation eg ada and argue that they are necessary to assure compliance with the provisions title ii do the bills strike the right balance between public and individual risk s 358 and hr 493 would not pe rmit an employer to make an employment decision based on predictive ge netic information even when there may be some resulting risk to public healt h osha currently has guidelines for monitoring for genetic changes associated with exposure in the workplace and susceptibility to exposure 29 cfr part 1910 some argue that the bills should permit employers to make decisions based on predictive genetic information in situations where the public might be harmed such as an employee carrying gene predisposing him or her to epilepsy when the employee is bus driver others stated that it was unfair to deny healthy people opportunities when only possib ility of becoming ill existed even if it could be known that person would definitely become ill as in the case with those that have gene for huntingtons disease the precise time that the illness would prevent the employee from doing his or her job could not be known furthermore they ar gue that allowing the use of predictive genetic information in these circumstances would create bias against those people who happened to be predisposed to diseas for which test existed if two people were genetically destined to become incapacitated at the same time but by different diseases and if there happened to be pr edictive test develope d for only one of the diseases the person with predisposition for that disease may be subject to adverse consequences from the availability of the information while the other person would not title ii should the bills have sunset clause s 358 and hr 493 do not have sunset clause some opponents argue that any genetic nondiscrimination legislation s hould have an expiration date to enable public policy to keep pace with scientific advances and allow congress to decide how effectively the law has worked this type of sunset cl ause is unusual in civil rights legislation there is only one example of civil rights legislation that has an expiratory term58 supporters of nondiscr imination legislation point out that congress always reserves the right to evaluate the effectiveness of laws and make modifications as deemed necessary further they do not believe that discrimination issues will go away in the near term for example sunset provision may not prot ect person who agreed tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33903crs26 59 ma hall and ss rich genetic privacy laws and patients fear of discrimination by health insurers the view from genetic counselors journal of law medicine and ethics vol 28 3 fall 2000 pp 245257be tested when the laws were in effect but whose genetic information would then be in his or her record after the laws expired title ii should the bills re quire separate medical files s 358 and hr 493 require employers to keep empl oyees genetic information in separate medical files the house committee on education and labor adopted an amendment to hr 493 on february 14 2007 specifying that genetic information protected by the act could be maintained with and treated as confidential medical record under ada 102d3b s 358 contains parallel provision federal or state law s separate file requirement for group health plans acting to provide medical services even though some studies show some physicians and genetics professionals are already k eeping separate files in the absence of protecting legislation59 in fact executive order 13145 already requires federal agencies acting as employers to maintain genetic information as part of their confidential medical records which must be kept apart from personnel files some have argued that requiring maintenance of genetic information in separate files increases potential for medical error others point out that because the language states that the requirement applies only to employers the risk of medical error would only increase if title ii could be cons trued to include group health plans administering employersponsored benef its which is contrary to precedent title ii should the bills create safe harbor s 358 and hr 493 would not preempt state laws the legisl ation would set floor of basic federal nondiscrimination regulations th at would apply in all stat but would permit states to keep or enact their own more comprehensive gene tic nondisrcrimination legislation the bills would not provide safe harbor which would protect federallycompliant employers from prosecution under state genetic nondiscrimination laws because states vary widely in their approaches to genetic nondiscr imination opponents of federal legislation proposed that any federal law should include safe harbor provision supporters of the legislation argue that federal floor is appropr iate and that states should conti nue to be able to enact and test the effects of additional ge netic nondiscriminati on provisions within their borders title i and title ii how do s 358 and hr 493 protect genetic information an overarching question regarding s 358 and hr 493 is how the bills would protect genetic information the answ er depends both on ty pes of protections specifying what can be done with gene tic information and on the definition of genetic information itself specifying what is protected and what is not as discussed in previous sections the ty pes of protections would primarily be restrictions on the manner in which genetic information coul d be used in determininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33903crs27 60 srept 108122 for s 1053 108th 61 first degree relative is defined as parent br other sister or child of an individual second degree relative

second cousins are fifth degree relatives third cousins are seventh degree relatives even degrees such as fourth and sixth refer to different generations ie first cousins once removedeligibility for health insurance establishing premiums for health insurance and in making decisions regarding employment the definition of genetic information is discussed in detail below the bills define genetic information as and therefore protect knowledge derived from genetic test performed on individuals or their family members that relates to the occurrence of disease or disorder the protections would apply to predictive genetic tests that provide information regarding future possible health status of currently nonaffected person the bills precise definition of genetic information and thus protections that they would provide hinge on factors discussed below including the definition of family medical history differences between title i and title ii and predictive versus manifested disease information combined with the type of genetic test performed family medical history s 358 and hr 493 specify that genetic information includes the fact that an individual or hisher family member has taken genetic test the bills define family members to include distant relatives and adopted children which have blood re lationship and therefore would not be affected by genetic information in the family historically genetic nondiscrimination act bills ve stressed the importance of family history the senate report to accompany s 1053 108th stated that the committee realizes that family medical history could be used as surrogate for genetic trait by health plan or health insurance issuer it is important to include family medical history in the definition of genetic information60 the report further clarified the concept of family medical history as being consistent with the american medical association definition and expected that the definition would evolve over time some debate has ensued over the question of who should be considered to be in ones family the risk of sharing genetic traits or conditions is greatest in first and second degree blood relatives61 the risk of sharing genes decreases as the blood relationship becomes more distant for exam ple first degree relatives share onehalf of their genetic material second degree re latives share onefourth and third degree relatives first cousins sh are oneeighth fourth cous ins which are ninth degree relatives share only 1512 of th eir genetic material at th is level of relationship only very rare conditions appear more frequently in family members and the risk of sharing many common diseases is virtually the same as in the general population proponents of the legislation argue that th inclusion of individuals that have blood relation ie adoptive children is nece ssary to insure that the family remains insurable as unit that adoptive childre n or adoptive parents are not penalized because one or the other has genetic trait that they themselves could not havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33903crs28 62 related question is whether or not information derived from genetic tests performed on fetus or parental material from in vitro fe rtilization procedures g polar bodies or pre implantation embryos would be protected inso far as blood relatives are concerned since predictive testing for adult diseases is not currently recommended in prenatal situations presumably the information gained from such testing would be diagnostic for the fetus or embryo however such diagnosis could provid genetic information about parents siblings and other blood relatives which presumably then could be used by health insurers or employers in making insurance or employment decisions for other individuals in the family 63 see lee r russ couch on insurance 3rd ed 14428 andover uk sweet maxwell ltd 2005opponents argued that inclusion of distan t or nonblood related individuals further extends the potential for litigation against insurers or employers62 the house education and labor committee chairmans version of hr 493 as reported by the committee defined family member as someone related by blood within four generations s 358 contains parallel provisions during the february 14 2007 house education and labor co mmittee markup proposed amendment to expand the definition of family member to include fetuses was defeated however the chairmans amended version of the bill contains provisions in title i and title ii specifying that the definition of genetic information rather than family member would include that of fetus s 358 contains similar provisions although prenatal testing may be either diagnostic or predictive in nature coverage for child does not usually begin until the moment of birth63 in general medical insurance covers the named insu red and dependents of the named insured any genetic information collected about fetus while woman is pregnant would likely arise in the context of providing prenatal care to the insured woman because the fetus would not appear to be separate insured individual it seems likely that any genetic information collected about the fetu s would probably be attributed to the woman as the named insured and protected from discrimination to the extent that her own medical information was protected differences between title i and title ii the bills two titles define genetic information differently and th erefore apply different rest rictions to employers and insurers see table 1 title i health insurance provisions specifically excludes from its definition of genetic informa tion and therefore does not protect medical information that is not genetic information including the analysis of proteins or metabolites directly related to manifested disease disorder or pathological condition this exemption is not present in title ii employment provisions making the definition of genetic information and the scope of what is protected broader for employers than insurers in addition th bills would permit health insurers to use or disclose the individuals current hea lth status as determined without genetic test consistent with existing law this permission is not present in title ii as employers are already prohibited from usin g persons current health status in specific ways by existing lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33903crs29 table 1 the definition of genetic test and genetic information in title i and title ii of s 358 and hr 493 title i health insurancetitle ii employment genetic

limitations or exemptionsgenetic information does not include information about the age or sex of an individualsame as title i title i predictive vs manifested disease information and type of test title i of the bills focuses on protecting predictive information ie information about future or potential health state in currently symptom free individual it does so by exempting fro m the definition of genetic information analyses of proteins or metabolites that are directly related to manifested diseases insurers could thus use this type of genetic information in accordance with current law governing insurance and employment pr actices the definition of genetic test in the bills is more limited than the medical or scientific definition of genetic testhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33903crs30 64 for reference the medical definition of genetic test includes the analysis of human proteins and certain metabolites which are predominantly used to detect heritable or acquired genotypes reflective of the individuals dna mutations actual changes in dna from the normal sequence or phenotypes tr ait which is visible this definition covers both diagnostic and predictive information with re spect to current or future health statuswhich covers both predictive and diagnostic reasons for testing64 instances in which the distinction is blurred between predictive information and that related to manifested disease may cause some confusion if the bills are enacted based upon the definition of ge netic test in title ii analyses of persons dna or rna would be protected regardless of wh ether any related dis ease had manifested by contrast as mentioned above the definition of genetic test in title i does not include analyses that are both conducted on proteins or metabolites and are directly related to manifested diseases thus information derived from studying protein or metabolite would only be protected before symptoms appeared these provisions create potentially unclear results when single genetic test which could be performed on dna or proteins yields results that are both related to manifested disease or condition and are predictive in nature the potential dilemma is illustrated by the following example if person had cancer test of the tumor dna or proteins may simultaneously provide information about the tumor itself manifested disease and its likelihood of recurrence predictive probability if surgery were performed to remove the tumor and the patient went in to re mission the information obtained from the patients tumor could be considered both diagnostic for the previously manifested tumor and predictive regarding potential recurrence if the test had been performed on tumor dna the information would be protected matter whether it was considered to be diagnostic or predictive however if it had been performed on tumor proteins if it were considered diag nostic it would not be protected if it were considered predictive it would be see table 2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33903crs31 table 2 examples of genetic testing scenarios and protected information under s 358 and hr 493 scenario s 358 and hr 493 test of tumor proteins information is diagnostic the tumor has not been removednot protected because analysis is of protein is directly related to manifested disease test of tumor dna information is diagnostic the tumor has not been removedprotected meets basic criteria for genetic test only protein or metabolite tests meet exclusion for manifested disease test of tumor proteins tumor has been removed information indicates the likelihood of tumor recurrencenot protected if the removed tumor is manifested disease protected if tumor removal means that the disease is longer manifested test of tumor dna tumor has been removed information indicates the likelihood of tumor recurrenceprotected meets basic criteria for genetic test so manifested is not an issue limitation only applies to tests of protein test of tumor protein information requested for diagnostic purposes indicates resistence to therapynot protected if information about possible drug response is considered directly related to manifested disease protected if not directly related test of tumor on patients dna information requested for diagnostic purposes indicates resistence to therapyprotected meets basic criteria for genetic test so directly related is not an issue only protein or metabolite tests meet exclusion for manifested disease this same lack of clarity may create issues in the case in which person undergoes pharmacogenetic test which is genetic test to determine whether person is susceptible to adverse reactions to or beneficial results from certain drug or other treatment information fro m pharmacogenomic tests reveals normal variability in how different peoples bodi process different medications personalized medicine it is unclear whet her this type of test would be protected under current legislation pharmacogene tic tests for individual susceptibilities to certain drugs can be performed at any poi nt in an individuals life ie when an individual does not have manifested disease thus the scope of protections afforded to pharmacogenomic test resu lts might depend on whether the person already had disease for which the treatment was indicated under the current definition it is possible that in the presen ce of manifested disease information that person would not likely respond to drug could pot entially be used in negative manner by health insurers this may be of particular concer n if only one treatment exists
