for the most recently completed and current fiscal years under the 1921 act the deadline for submi ssion was set as the first day of each regular session of congress the deadline was changed in 1950

presidents submitted their annual budgets to congress in toward the beginning of the session but were not required to update the budget submissions ter in the session as the federal budget became larger more complex and more dynamic congress felt greater need for more extensive and updated budgetary inform ation from the president this view was expressed by the house rules committee in its

1982 in 1990 new sections 501 and 602 dealing with credit reform and spending allocations were added to the congressional budget actvery often as the appropriations process moves forward conditions relating to the presidents budget change frequently members are not fully informed about such changes and what effect they will have on the total budget official executive pronouncements are made subsequent to the budget submission supplementary budgetar information is presented firm foundation except the january budget is av ailable in the congress this inexact imprecise and haphazard system must be substantially improved if the congress is to analyze effectively the presidents program and with any degree of accuracy forecast the expenditure and revenue levels of the national government1 the legislative reorganization act of 1970 made several changes in the federal budget process in response to congresss need for more budgetary information from the president chiefly by requiring that his budget cover not just the upcoming fiscal year but the four ensuing fiscal years in addition section 221b of the act requires the president to submit to congress an update of his budget in the middle of the legislative session the requirement which was first effective in 1972 is codified at 31 usc 1106 see the appendix for the current text of the statut ory requirement the update commonly is referred to as the midsession review but sometimes is referred to as the supplemental summary of the budget it often is printed as house document subsequent modifications congress and the president have made two changes si nce 1970 pertinent to the requirement for midsession re view first in conjunction with change in the start of the fiscal year from july 1 to octobe r 1 made by the congressional budget act of 1974 pl 93344 the deadline for sub mission of the midsession review was changed from june 1 to july 152 the second change pertained to the budget enforcement procedures established on temporary basis by the balanced budg et and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 commonly refe rred to as the grammrudmanhollings act under section 241 of the act the pr esident was required in the preparation of his annual budget to adhere to statutory deficit targets that were enforced by sequestrati on secti on 242 of the act 99 stat 1063 extended the same

which in part amended the balanced budget and emerge ncy deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 to modify the sequestrati on process require ment was added that the president include in the midsession review preliminary sequestration estimates as well as the economic and technical assumptions that would be used in the initial sequestration report for the fiscal year due in august the

excess and net deficit reduction computed using the economic and technical assumptions that he will use in the initial sequestration report for that fiscal year it is imperative that the director of omb actually deliver this midsession report by july 15 when he issues the initial sequestration report he is required to use those same economic and technical assumptions3 the increased significance given to the midsession review by virtue of this change in the sequestration process probabl accounts in part for the improved record of submission beginning with fy1989 pres ident reagans midsession review for that year was only 13 days late the imp roved record of submission continued for all four years of the george h w bush administration covering fy1990fy1993 the requirement under the 1985

the midsession review for fy1994 so that it would reflect the impact of the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1993 which was then pending before the house and senate on that date the

domenicis amendment stated it is the sense of the senate that the president should submit the supplementary budget as required by law later than july 16 and the requisite information therein required but in event later than july 26 1993 senator larry craig discussed various patterns in the timing of submission of the midsession review during years in which the house and senate considered reconciliation legislation6 president clinton used the midsession re view for fy1994 in part to recount the actions that led to the enactment of obra of 1993 and to discuss the features of that act he used the midsession review for fy1995 and subsequent years to discuss the status of legislation under th discretionary spending li mits and the p aygo requirement president clinton fy1998 as had been the case for fy1994 the submission of the midsession review fo r fy1998 was delayed until after congress completed action on reconcilia tion legislation the delay in this case until september 5 1997 was the longest incurre d during the 26year period 52 days unlike the experience for fy1994 however the delay was not accompanied by controversy in may 1997 the clinton administrati on and congressional leaders reached agreement on plan to balance the budget by fy2002 on july 31 and august 5 president clinton signed into law the two reconciliation acts that implemented most of the balancedbudget policies the dela yed issuance of the midsession review for fy1998 allowed president clinton to render final accounting with respect to the budgetary impact of the two measures which amounted to 247 billion in savings over five years yielding an estima ted surplus of 63 billion for fy2002 president george w bush fy2002 the issuance of the midsession review again was associated with cont roversy in 2001 although probably more for its contents than the timing of its release president george w bush submitted his transition budget for fy2002 to congress on april 9 his budget recommended among other things that congress enact 10year tax cut of about 16 trillion while at the same time preserving the entire surp lus in the social security trust funds in may congress adopted the budget resolution for fy2002 hconres 83 affirming its commitment to somewhat smaller tax cut about 135 billion and to preserving the social security surplus the onbudget surplus which excludes the transactions of the social security trust funds was estimated at that time to be abouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32509crs8 7 the congressional b udget office issued the budget and economic outlook an update on august 28 indicating that the onbudget surplus for fy2002 had fallen to 2 billion and had become an onbudget deficit of 9 billion for fy200130 billion for fy2001 and 48 billion for fy2002 these amounts represented the resources that could be allocated during the remainder of the session for additional defense spending and other budget prio rities principally under reserve fund procedures without violating the pledge to preserve the social security surplus following the adoption of the budget re solution the house and senate agreed to revenue reconciliation measure providing the recommended level of tax cuts president bush signed it into law on june 7 as pl 10716 during the remainder of june and into july the house and nate focused on the consideration of the regular appropriations bills the fy2002 midsession review was issued on august 22 38 days late while the house and senate were in recess it indicated that owing largely to unexpected weakness in the economy the estimates of the onbudget surpluses for fy2001 and fy2002 had dropped to 1 billion for each year7 accordingly the amount available for allocation to defense spending and other priorities had been reduced significantly the returning house and senate faced the prospect of completing action on the regular appropriations measures for fy 2002 with less than month before the beginning of the fiscal year on oct ober 1 and under much tighter budgetary constraints than had previously been assumed circumstances of accel erated submission in 1998 president clinton submitted the midsession review for fy1999 nearly two months 50 days early on may 26 in february 1998 the presidents budget for fy1999 estimated 10 billion deficit for the current year fy1998 the mid session review revised this estimate to surplus of 39 billion the presidents reestimate for fy1998 and subsequent year s paralleled sign ificantly improved reestimates made by the c ongressional budget office and private forecasters the prospect of the first surplus in n early three decades and growing surpluses in the following years sparked congressional interest in acting on sizeable taxcut legislation during the session presiden t clinton argued instead that the budget surpluses should be reserved until change s could be made in the social security program to strengthen its longterm financial soundness according to some members of congress the issuance of the midsession review may have been accelerated to st rengthen the presidents hand had the president waited until the july 15 deadline they assert the surplus estimates might have been much higher fueling even greater interest in the taxcut proposals to which he objectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32509crs9 appendix statutory requirement for midsession review
