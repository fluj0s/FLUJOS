john mccain september 29 2008 vitaly churkin 136 67th st new york ny 10065 dear friend the choice america will face on november 4h is very clear it will be choice between one of most liberal governments in modern history or government dedicated to upholding longheld conservative principles of limited government strong national defense and individual freedom and if i have learned anything in these past months of traveling across america listening to the citizens of our great nation it is this victory will only come when we republicans unite around our core principles of individual freedom small government and unflagging dedication to defending our nation that i believe you and i and most americans hold in common now with only 36 days remaining before the ballots are cast in this extraordinarily important election for our country it is essential for all of us to join together and fight to win it is secret that ever since barack obama broke his personal promise to the american people and refused to abide by presidential campaign spending limits that the obama democrats have been raising enormous sums of money they will rely on their massive fundraising machine and other national liberal democratic groups like moveonorg and the democratic national committee to spend and do whatever it takes to bring our candidates down from here on out the full scope and power of the democrats relentless and battletested money churning engine is aimed at one target capturing total control of our government thats why we have established mccainpalin victory 2008 joint fundraising committee with the republican national committee that has been created to raise the funds needed to battle back against the obama democrats over please po box 7805 merrifield va 22116 wwwmccampalinvictory2008com paid for by mccainpalin victory 2008 joint fundraising committee by and composed of the republican national committee the michigan republican party the missouri republican state committee the ohio republican party state central executive committee the republican federal committee of pennsylvania and mccainpalin compliance fund 1530507 2 today i am reaching out to you to ask you to sign and return the enclosed 2008 pledge of support along with campaign contribution of 35 50 100 500 1000 2500 or even 5000 to the mccainpalin victory 2008 as we have already witnessed this has been an extremely tough hard fought campaign and it will be to the very end in recent years elections have been fought within the margins of small differences this one clearly will not be the differences between our republican candidates and that of the obama democrats could not be greater and we intend to fight as hard as we can to ensure that our principles prevail on issue after issue never in recent memory has there been such stark difference in the direction the candidates want to lead america the obama democrats continue to show weak judgment by stubbornly refusing to acknowledge the success of the surge strategy in iraq and clinging to their reckless and unconditional timeline for withdrawal we intend to win the war iraq is truly the test of generation for america and for our role in the world we will finish the iraq war with victory and bring our troops home with honor when the mission is truly accomplished we will apply our successful tactics in afghanistan and see that conflict through to success and we will promote freedom and democracy throughout the world the obama democrats will increase the size of the federal government we republicans plan to reduce it washingtons irresponsibility with your tax dollars is national disgrace we will continue our ongoing fight to end wasteful spending by vetoing every porkladen spending bill seeking the lineitem veto and rooting out the earmarks that have opened the floodgates to corruption and fiscal irresponsibility and we will not permit any expansion whatsoever of the entitlement programs that are bankrupting us on the contrary we intend to reform those programs so that government is longer in the habit of making promises to americans it does not have the means to keep the obama democrats wont back away from the massive tax hikes they have proposed even though we are facing serious economic difficulties we republicans want to cut them taxes should be simple fair and as low as possible we will work to repeal the alternative minimum tax tax that will be paid almost exclusively by 25 million middle class families make the income and investment tax cuts permanent and make it harder for congress to raise taxes by requiring 35 majority vote to raise taxes next page please 3 the obama democrats will offer biggovernment solution to health care coverage the republican answer to providing families with quality affordable health care is to harness the power of market competition while giving americans maximum freedom to choose the health care best suited for them we believe big government is not the answer to rising health care costs big government is the problem the obama democrats will appoint to the federal bench judges who are intent on achieving political changes federal judges who take it upon themselves to write national policy or advance political agenda we will confirm judges who have proven themselves worthy of our trust and who fully understand the importance of using our nations judiciary to interpret the us constitution and laws as written and not to write new laws and who can be relied upon to respect the values of the people whose rights laws and property they are sworn to defend the obama democrats refuse to acknowledge that the price of gas is too high and oppose domestic oil drilling that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil we will immediately begin work to drive down the price of gas and reduce our dependence on foreign oil through domestic drilling and increased reliance on clean safe american technologies like nuclear and windpowered energy these are but few of the differences that will define this election they are very significant differences and as we battle to uphold our conservative principles of government our countrys future hangs in the balance that is why i hope you will join in this fight by signing the enclosed pledge of support and returning it immediately along with your campaign contribution of 35 50 100 500 1000 2500 or even 5000 to the mccainpalin victory 2008 the reason for urgency is simple the outcome of the november election will not be determined on the day we go to the polls it will
