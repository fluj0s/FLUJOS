running shortrun deficits governments can avoid raising taxes during economic downturns helping households to smooth consumption over time running deficits can stimulate aggregate demand in the economy giving policy makers valuable fiscal policy tool that can help suppo rt macroeconomic stability longrun deficits allow transfers of economic resources from younger to older generations enabling older generations to enjoy anticipated benefits of future economic growth but also may be used to impose large burdens on future generations anticipation of changes in partisan control of government according to some economists provides political motive for running deficits as current policy makers may wish to restrict their successors options research on state and foreign governments suggests that balancedbudget rules force governments to adjust spending and taxes sharply during economic downturns balancedbudget rules also appear to hold down taxes and spending at least in the short run deficits can seriously harm national economies in the short run fiscal overstimulation leads to inflation in the long term deficits either reduce capital investment which retards economic

first governments can prevent sudden changes in taxes by borrowing second debt finance gives governments powerful macroeconomic policy tool third debt finance can redistribute resources among generations if government borrowing can shift revenues and expenses into different time periods more easily or more cheaply than can households then government can make taxpayers better off by smoothing tax levels using deficits1 the federal government can spread the cost of major capital investment over many years by issuing debt in the form of bonds or treasury bills deficit finance can spread an especially large cost such as major war over several generations or even centuries2 debt financing also allows governments to keep taxes steady during temporary economic downturns thus smoothing consumption for households of course governments must eventually pay back what they borrow or go bankrupt3 second increased government spending financed by borrowing can stimulate economic activity giving government fiscal policy tool to counteract recessions countercyclical fiscal policy in which taxes are cut or spending is increased can dampen economic fluctuations and limit the depth of economic downturns procyclical fiscal pol icy in which taxes are raised or spending is cut during recessions tends to amplify economic fluctuations during economic downturns government revenues fall and expenditures rise as more people become eligible for unemployment insurance and income support programs causing deficits to increase or surpluses to shrink these programs are known as automatic stabilizers because deficit spending then provides countercyclical stimulus to economic activity in the short run without the need for new legislative action 4 both of these rationales presume that governments run surpluses during economic expansions to repay debt or accumulate reserves critics of deficit finance and active fiscal policy argue that policy makers are more willing to increase gove rnment spending when economic growth slows than to cut spending when growth accelerates5 in addition designing fiscal policy is slow and deliberative process whereas economic downturns can emerge suddenly and are difficult to predict because economic shocks affect spending patterns with substantial lags economic conditions may have changed significantly before new federal spending actually reaches the public few economists believe that large changes in fiscal policy designed to counterbalance shortterm economic downturns can be timed precisely although many economists believe fiscal policy is an important tool during prolong ed periods of slow or negative growth 1 socalled rainy day funds used by many state governments allow smoothing of tax levels without deficit finance 2 the british government still pays interest on co nsol bonds issued duri ng the napoleonic wars 3 more precise definition of fiscal sustainability is that the public debt does not grow without bound 4 the congressional budget office cbo computes measure of the deficit that adjusts for business cycle effects to allow more meaningful comparison of shortterm fiscal stance across different years 5

helping households smooth income is primary justification for shortrun deficits according to standard public finance theory if governments must balance their budgets in each fiscal year so that current spending is constrained by available cash reserves and incoming revenues then negative economic shocks require spending cuts or tax increases public spending tends to rise during recessions due to the effect of automatic stabilizers while revenues fall thus strict balancedbudget requirements force governments to run procyclical fiscal policy which can either strain household budgets via tax increases or force painful cuts in public programs economists have studied balancedbudget require ments in us states as well as budgetary restrictions used by other national governments 6 all states except vermont have balancedbudget requirements though the strictness of those requirements varies many studies have found that the strictness of the balancedbudget requirement affects fiscal performance inman and bohn found that tight balancedbudget rules cause states to reduce deficits by cutting spending whereas softer constraints have little shortterm effect 7 other researchers found that balancedbudget rules force governments to adjust spending and taxes sharply during economic downturns8 fiscal crises may put strains on states and their citizens but may also force policy makers to face tough fiscal decisions that would otherwise be avoide d balancedbudget rules also appear to hold down taxes and spending at least in the short run over the longer term both spending and taxes adjust although state and local governments with tight budgetbalance measures appear to spend less than those with less stringent requirements

instruments of macroeconomic policy9 deficit spending can be used to increase aggregate demand in the economy causing output and prices to increase when the economy is running below its potential level of output expansionary fiscal policies such as deficits stimulate economic activity bringing idle economic capacity back into use and pushing the economy back toward its full potential on the other hand if the economy is running near its full potential expansionary fiscal policies lead to inflation running government surpluses reduces aggregate demand in the economy and helps restrain inflation fiscal policy in coordination with appropriate monetary policies can bring an economy closer to its potential while restraining inflation economists associated with the new classical macroeconomics criticized the underlying assumptions of standard keynesian theory arguing that market forces naturally lead to equilibrium and economic efficiency the concept of rational expectations

rational and foresighted nevertheless economic agents make mistakes because of changing circumstances and uncertainty the rational expectations approach presumes those mistakes are not systematically wrong in any direction the combination of neoclassical microfoundations for macroeconomics and the assumption that economic agents are foresighted and rational even when faced with complex dynamic decisions led economists associated with the new classical macroeconomics to criticize keynesian demand management policies for example robert barro argued that deficit spending has fiscal effect because households save in anticipation of future tax increases offsetting any shortterm stimulative effects this concept is known as ricardian equivalence 10 the theory of ricardian equivalence implies that only the net present value of government expenditures and taxes needed to pay for them matter but that the timing of taxes does not 11 empirical research has failed to find evidence of ricardian equivalence in its pure form but some research has identified some ricardian effects in savings behavior12 contrary to the predictions of ricardian equivalence the overwhelming evidence of economic research and macroeconomic experience suggests that deficit spending creates shortterm fiscal stimulus despite the imprint that new classical macroeconomics has left on macroeconomic modeling nearly all economists believe deficits affect prices and output in the short run and recognize the usefulness of fiscal policy as tool for macroeconomic management at least in some circumstances more recent research sets older keynesian theories upon more modern foundations this research stresses that the structure of labor markets creates wage rigidities for example the price of soybeans may change by the minute but the wages of employees do not these wage rigidities lead to the appearance of involuntary unemployment or excess capacity during economic downturns and thus provide role for traditional keynesian demand management new keynesian theories like the new classical macroeconomics treat economic expectations of the future in serious way unlike traditional keynesian theory for example if traders in bond markets anticipate that deficits will cause inflation in the future that will cause interest rates to rise in the present rising interest rates will then change current decisions of firms and households g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g7g161g153g149g138g151g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the political business cycle literature provides theory of economic

rational and not myopic but are unable to distinguish between sustainable prosperity based on policy and administrative competence from temporary prosperity based on deficit spending14 drazen reviewed the literature and found strong evidence that voters react to economic conditions but weak evidence that macroeconomic policy is manipulated to sway elections15 the alternation of partisan control of government may explain persistent tendency towards deficit spending several articles in the economics of politics literature such as alesina and tabellini or persson and svensson contend the government of the day can constrain its successors choices by running budget deficits16 if successor government has different spending priorities the current government may be tempted to influence future fiscal policies by using debt to change the incentives and constraints facing future decision makers such policies are highly unlikely to be as economically efficient as more consistent fiscal policy g11g151g157g142g155g144g142g151g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g22g155g138g151g156g143g142g155g156g561 one explanation of persistent deficits is that future generations do not vote even if they will be asked to pay for programs enacted by older generations generations now alive face temptation to pass on the costs of programs that benefit themselves to following generations that have say some shifting of resources to older generations however can be justified on the basis of equity to the extent that technological change leads to greater prosperity over time future generations will have access to higher standards of living to the extent that population growth increases the size of the economy the burden of financing payasyougo retirement systems is reduced if some of those gains are shifted from younger to older generations then incomes and levels of wellbeing would be more equal among generations furthermore fiscal policy that shifts some resources from younger to older generations can raise living standards of all following generations by transferring portion of the benefits of future economic growth into the present simple example illustrates this possibility 17 consider an economy with fixed population divided among agespecific cohorts for the sake of simplicity suppose individuals live 75 years also assume for the sake of simplicity that income of each cohort is the same arrives from source outside the economy and grows 3 per year consider fiscal policy that causes each agespecific cohort except the oldest to transfer 2 of its income to the oneyearolder cohort all transfers except for the oldest and youngest cohorts cancel out the youngest cohort gets 98 of its pretransfer income and the oldest gets 102 of its pretransfer income although the loss of the youngest cohort and gain of the oldest cohort balance out for each year each 13 nordhaus william d the political business cycle review of economic studies vol 42 2 april 1975 pp 169190

return for us treasury bills the policy of shifting resources to older generations makes all generations better off18 this highly simplified example shares the same basic structure as payasyougo social insurance programs in which young workers pay contributions that are more or less immediately used to pay benefits to older retirees19 the possibility of raising standards of living by shifting resources from younger to older generations has its limits the example above relies on the assumption that the policy continues indefinitely into the future with finite ending point this policy would be unsustainable because some young cohorts near that end point would be made worse off and would be unwilling to give up resources the current fiscal policies of the united states imply that large transfers will be made to the baby boom generation from younger generations20 computations by auerbach gokhale and kotlikoff indicate that future generations will pay much more in taxes than they will receive from the government21 in 2000 gokhale and others estimated that newborn male in 1998 would pay 142500 more in taxes than what he would receive from the government the corresponding estimate for newborn female was 7130022 due to increased federal deficits and the introduction of medicare part d those estimates would be higher for current newborns despite the projected magnitude of these intergenerational transfers younger generations might not be worse off than their parents if economic grows at sufficiently swift pace these generational transfers are largely driven by the growth in the number of beneficiaries of entitlement programs relative to the work force as well as by rapid increases in health care costs the possibility that some future generation may eliminate fiscal policies that it perceives will lower its standard of living introduces political risk into social insurance programs funded by payasyougo mechanism 23 if generation anticipates that younger generation will stop 18 goetzmann and ibbotson found that the real rate of return on us treasury bills from 19242004 was less than 1 per year see table ii in william n goetzmann and roger g ibbotson

larger portfolios of stocks bonds and other assets the flow of interest payments dividends and repatriated profits abroad increases as well third central government can print money to reduce the real value of debt denominated in domestic currency all three options have unpleasant consequences over time each can seriously damage national economies simple supply and demand theory implies that smaller supply of savings for private investment will lead to higher interest rates and lower growth in private capital stocks lower stocks of private capital threaten economic grow th and slower economic growth translates into lower average living standards in the future borrowing from the rest of the world permits higher levels of investment and faster growth at the co st of sending higher fraction of earnings abroad if foreigners lend capital by purchasing stocks and bonds rather than by building auto plants for example they may decide suddenly someday to take their investments elsewhere this could strain domestic and international financial systems thus constricting firms and households access to capital finally inflation caused by printing money distorts the flow of information generated by the price system and disrupts financ ial markets investors if they wish to avoid capital losses in real terms demand higher interest rates when they see signs of inflation major reduction in the real value of the federal debt would require significant acceleration in inflation few economists believe that the restrictive monetary policies needed to squeeze rapid inflation out of an economy would not require substantial economic disruption at least in the short run on the other hand reducing government deficits can improve economic performance in at least three ways first paying off government debt increases the supply of investment funds available for domestic investment second paying off government debt held by foreign governments or investors reduces the amount of interest payments going abroad alternatively paying off debt held by domestic investors gives them the opportunity to rebalance their portfolios by buying foreign assets which offsets some of the flow of dividends and profits going abroad or by buying domestic assets that otherwise would have been bought by foreign investors third scaling down the federal debt decreases the temptation to reduce its real value by printing money lessening the possibility of major acceleration in inflation finally most economists believe reducing government borrowing lowers interest rates which in turn have positive effects on investment and growth 24 altruistic impulses play an important role in many questions concerning intergenerational transfers for an overview of recent research

to run deficits can help avoid shortterm fiscal crises caused by adverse economic shocks longterm deficits can be used to allow older generations to enjoy some of the anticipated fruits of future economic growth government can sustain debt indefinitely so long as the size of the debt relative to the size of the economy does not grow without bound maintaining large debt requires large interest payments and can retard economic growth thus deficits can serve as useful tool of economic management but also can cause substantial economic damage to an economy
