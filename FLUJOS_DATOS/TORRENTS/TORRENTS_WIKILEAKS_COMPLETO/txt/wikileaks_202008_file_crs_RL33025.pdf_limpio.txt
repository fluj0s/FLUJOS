the largest sources of federal tax revenue loss with an estimated annual cost of 72 billion is intended to encourage homeownership empirical studies suggest that the mortgage interest deduction subsidizes mortgage lending which has more impact on housing consumption than homeownership rates other homeownership subsidies like downpayment assistance programs are proven to be more effective at increasing homeownership among lowerincome families and are less expensive than the mortgage interest deduction recent enhancement to the mortgage interest deduction was enacted in the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432which mporarily allowed for tax year 2007 mortgage insurance premiums paid for personal residence to be tax deductible as mortgage interest the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 hr 3648 pl 110142 extended that provision through the end of 2010 early in the 109 th congress tax reform was major legislative issue president bush appointed bipartisan panel to study the federal tax code and to propose options to reform the code the panel produced report in the fall of 2005 that included proposal to change the mortgage interest deduction legislation for fundamental tax reform was introduced and some bills proposed to change the tax base such that income tax credits and deductions like the mortgage interest deduction would have been eliminated late in the first session of the 110 th congress house ways and means committee chairman rang indicated that fundamental tax reform might still be considered in the 110th congress there are many possible options to alter the mortgage interest deduction if the deduction were eliminated as result of fundamental tax reform the resulting effects would depend on variety of variables including the nature of tax reform the resulting changes in the tax base and tax rates changes in interest rates and other economic variables if the deduction were eliminated without other tax policy changes federal income tax revenues would increase the tax base could be broadened and the federal budget deficit could be reduced modifications to the mortgage interest deduction could take any one of several approaches congress could choose to allow the deduction for only one residence andor to reduce the allowable principal debt which is currently 1 million these changes would reduce the amount of tax revenue loss associated with the provision congress could choose to improve equity by allowing more lowincome households to claim mortgage interest either as an abovetheline deduction or as tax credit finally the mortgage interest deduction could remain unaltered this report which will be updated to reflect legislative developments describes the deduction for home mortgage interest provides economic analysis

january 2005 president bush appointed ninemember bipartisan panel to study the federal tax code and to propose options to reform the code proposals for fundamental tax reform would have changed the tax base from income to consumption or changed the way income is taxed in pure consumption tax system income tax credits and deductions like the mortgage interest deduction would be eliminated other proposals for tax reform could have simplified the existing income tax system in these cases modifications to the mortgage interest deduction could have simplified the tax code it was unclear whether changes to the mortgage interest deduction would occur given the strength of support that exists for the provision in 2005 president bush indicated that homeownership tax incentives are important and should be preserved as tax reform is being considered specifically in the executive order that established the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform one of the very few restrictions was request that the panel recognize the importance of homeownership and charity in american society 1 some analysts concluded that the administrations statement indicated its support for preserving the mortgage interest deduction along with all of the other homeownership tax incentives in one tax journal it was written in plain english the mother of all tax subsidies the mortgage interest deduction shall remain untouched2 there are three principal tax provisions for owneroccupied housing and one implicit tax benefit the deduction for mortgage interest is the most costly provision with an estimate of 737 billion in revenue loss for fy20073 the exclusion of capital gains on the sales of homes is the second largest tax provision for homeowners with an timate of 285 billion in tax revenue loss for fy20074 the deduction of state and local real estate taxes is the third provision with an estimate of 168 billion in tax revenue loss for fy20075 the exclusion of net imputed rental income from taxation which is not provision in the tax code but exists implicitly is estimated to cost 332 billion in uncollected tax revenue for fy20076 this would bring the total projected revenue cost for owneroccupied housing in fy2007 to 152 billion the amount of revenue foregone by the federal government to promote homeownership greatly exceeds government spending on housing appropri ations made in the department of housing and urban development hud budget totaled 315 billion in fy2005 most of the appropriations for hud address rental housing problems most of which are faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs 1 executive order 13369 presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform website httpwwwtaxreformpanelgovexecutiveordershtml visited july 22 2005 2

fundamental tax reform has not been on the legislative agenda in the 110th congress changes to the mortgage interest deduction have been enacted the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 temporarily allowed for tax year 2007 mortgage insurance premiums paid for personal residence to be tax deductible as mortgage interest the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 hr 3648 pl 110142 extended that temporary provision through the end of 2010 mortgage insurance which guarantees loan repayment in case of death or disability of the borrower is often required by lenders for individuals who do not have sufficient funds for full down payment on residence premiums paid or accrued for qualified insurance on mortgage loans can be treated as qualified residence interest and deducted from income tax qualified mortgage insurance is mortgage insurance provided by the veterans administration v the federal housing administration fha the rural housing administration rha and private mortgage insurers as defined under section 2 of the homeowners protection act of 1998 12 usc sec 4901 the deduction of qualified mortgage insurance premiums generally applies to amounts paid or accrued only during tax years 2007 through 2010 with respect to contracts issued during those years the provision terminates for premiums paid or accrued after december 31 2010 this deduction is also subject to phaseout for every 1000 or fraction thereof by which the taxpayers adjusted gross income exceeds 100000 the amount of deductible mortgage insurance premiums is reduced but not below zero by 10 in the case of married taxpayer filing separately the amounts are lowered to 500 and 50000 the purpose of this phaseout is to prevent taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes greater than 109000 54500 for married taxpayer filing separately from claiming this tax benefit prepaid mortgage insurance amounts that are allocable to periods beyond the year in which they are paid are attributed to capital account and treated as paid in the allocable year contracts issued by the v or rha are excluded from this provision if the mortgage is paid off before the end of its term deduction is not allowed for the unamortized balance of the capital account

of earned income wages salaries professional fees over standard deduction deduction for cash charitable contributions and deduction for home mortgage interest the deductions the bill proposed to allow were consistent with the previously mentioned mandate given by president bush to the tax reform panel hr 1040 the freedom flat tax act proposed to allow taxpayers to choose an election to be subject to flat tax in lieu of the existing income tax the rate would have been 19 of wages for the first two years after an election was made and 17 thereafter the bill proposed to allow basic standard deduction and an additional standard deduction for each dependent in the household but made mention of allowing the mortgage interest deduction s 1099 the tax simplification act of 2005 proposed similar flat tax structure with 19 tax rate on wages for the first two years that would then have been reduced to 17 thereafter the ninemember panel appointed by president bush produced report in the fall of 2005 that included proposal to change the mortgage interest deduction specifically the panel recommended converting the deduction to tax credit equal to 15 of interest paid on mortgages the principal amount of debt associated with the interest that could be claimed would have been limited to regional house prices in the range of 227000 to 412000 this range would have been based on the house price ceilings that the federal housing administration fha sets for the amount of home mortgage loan that it will insure these amounts vary by county across the country thus if the principal amount of mortgage loan was 500000 interest on the first 41200 of loan principal would have qualified depending on where the house was located the remainder of this report describes the deduction for home mortgage interest and explores rationales for subsidizing homeowners the report then provides an economic analysis of the value and performance of the deduction and concludes with discussion and analysis of the possible changes to the mortgage interest deduction that could occur under different tax reform scenarios

taxpayers may claim an itemized deduction for payments of qualified interest related to primary or secondary residence the payments of interest that qualify include home mortgage interest which is the interest paid on any loans secured by either the taxpayers main home or second home the loans may be mortgage first or second line of credit or home equity product qualified residences can include cooperative apartments condominiums and mobile homes mortgage interest associated with recreational vehicles and boats can be included in the deduction as long as the vehicles have sleeping cooking and toilet amenities the debt must also be collateralized by the vehicles to be eligible for the mortgage interest deduction two types of indebtedness are associated with the interest that can be deducted acquisition and home equity acquisition indebtedness is debt incurred in acquiring constructing or substantially improving qualified residence and secured by such residence home equity indebtedness is all nonacquisition debt that is secured by qualified residence the interest on such debt can be deducted even if the proceeds are used for personal expenditures unrelated to the home

of up to 1 million plus home equity indebtedness of up to 1000008 any secured debt used to refinance home acquisition debt is treated as home acquisition debt up to certain point the new debt qualifies as home acquisition debt only up to the amount of the balance of the old mortgage principal just before the refinancing any additional debt is not home acquisition debt but may qualify as home equity debt9 thus when refinancing acquisition debt may not rise and home equity loans may not exceed 100000 for example if homeowner with 150000 mortgage refinances the debt for 300000 the original 150000 would be considered as acquisition debt an additional 100000 would be considered as home equity debt and the interest on these amounts would be deductible the interest on the remaining 50000 of debt would not be deductible g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g6g142g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 the mortgage interest deduction was not introduced as provision to subsidize homeownership it evolved over time as result of the tax treatment of interest initially the federal income tax instituted in 1913 contained deduction for all interest paid with distinction between interest payments made for business personal living or family expenses at that time most interest payments represented business expenses for example farmers borrowed money to buy land that would be used for both their residence and their business mortgages and other consumer borrowing were much less prevalent than in late r years over time and with the increasing sophistication of lending markets mortgage interest became distinguishable from other kinds of interest for several decades up until the tax reform act of 1986 tra pl 99514 there were restrictions on either the dollar amount of residence interest that could be deducted or the number of homes for which the interest deduction could be claimed as part of an effort to limit deductions for personal interest the tra imposed limits on the amount of underlying mortgage loans for which interest could be deducted these limits restricted loan amounts up to the purchase price of the home plus any improvements and debt secured by the home but used for qualified medical and educational expense the interest deduction was also restricted to mortgage debt on first andor second home in addition to changes to the deduction of mortgage interest the tax reform act also eliminated the deduction of personal interest creating tax treatment distortions between homeowners and renters homeowners with sufficient equity and credit worthiness could use home equity loans to replace personal credit card debt thus preserving the income tax deduction for interest on their debt renters and homeowners without sufficient home equity or credit worthiness became unable to transfer personal debt in order to continue the tax savings and thus were made worse off relative to some homeowners by the 1986 tax law 8 the alternative minimum tax amt rules for deducting mortgage interest are different from the rules for regular taxes mortgage interest paid for home equity indebtedness taken out after june 30 1982 does not qualify as deductible for amt purposes unless the loan proceeds are explicitly used to buy build or improve the home 9 us department of treasury internal revenue service publication

mortgage interest was further restricted by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 pl 100203 that act created an upper limit of 1 million 500000 for married filing separately10 on the combined acquisition indebtedness for principal and second residence acquisition indebtedness included any debt incurred to buy build or substantially improve the residences additionally the exception for qualified medical and educational expenses was eliminated and an explicit provision for home equity indebtedness was enacted 11 in addition to interest on acquisition indebtedness interest can be deducted on loan amounts up to 100000 50000 for married filing separately for other debt secured by principal or second residence such as home equity loan line of credit or second mortgage12 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 enacted another group of revenue raising provisions that further influenced the mortgage interest deduction that act limited the amount of itemized deductions that upperincome households could claim some highincome taxpayers face reduced marginal benefits from the deduction of mortgage interest due to the limitation on itemized deductions in particular taxpayers with income above the threshold amount of 145950 for 2005 are required to reduce the amount of itemized deductions including the mortgage interest deduction by 3 of the excess of

deduction is federal subsidy that treats homeownership favorably compared to other economic activity the major justification for the deduction for mortgage interest is that it encourages homeownership which proponents deem desirable homeownership is believed to promote continued growth and stability of neighborhoods and communities this effect results in part because homeowners are more likely to participate in community and political activities to promote neighborhood cohesion and to be more socially stable and less mobile like all tax benefits economic theory suggests the deduction can be

that the mortgage interest deduction creates subsidy for housing the underlying issue regarding the taxation of owneroccupied housing is the exclusion of imputed rent net imputed rental income is the difference between the income homeowners could receive from renting their homes and the associated cost of the home which includes mortgage interest taxes insurance ma intenance and depreciation this net imputed rental income is not taxed unlike the rental housing market where owners of rental property receive income from their tenants and are taxed on that income net of the same expenses as homeowners economists contend that if net im puted rental income were taxed similarly to income from rental housing then the deduction of mortgage interest real estate taxes maintenance and depreciation costs and other expenses would be considered appropriate for homeowners congress considered the taxation of net imputed rental income for homeowners during tax reform efforts in 1986 congress believed that it would not be advisable to tax imputed net rental income though it continued to allow the deduction of mortgage interest according to the congressional joint committee on taxation jct while congress recognized that the imputed rental value of owneroccupied housing may be significant source of untaxed income the congress nevertheless determined that encouraging home ownership is an important policy goal achieved in part by providing deduction for residential mortgage interest13 g11g151g159g142g156g157g150g142g151g157g561g3g156g156g142g157g156g561 the nontaxation of imputed rental income contributes to asset choice distortions individuals who own home have an imputed rental income from that home in much the same way as holders of financial assets receive dividends and interest from the assets they hold yet homeowners are not taxed on their imputed income stream while stockholders are taxed on their income stream this tax treatment causes households to hold more of their assets in owner occupied housing than they may have in the absence of the taxpreferred treatment the deduction of mortgage interest further expands the preferential treatment of owneroccupied housing relative to other investment assets homeownership is usually an attractive investment even before tax benefits are included in recent years from 1999 through 2004 real estate prices increased more than 56 as compared to the sp 500 index that declined 6 over the same time period14 when the mortgage interest deduction is combined with other housing tax provisions like the deduction for state and local real estate taxes the value of housing as an investment good rises even further some economists feel that this preferential tax treatment encourages households to overinvest in housing and less in 13 us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of the tax reform act of 1986 committee print 100th cong 1st sess may 4 1987 washington gpo 1987 pp

is that it allows neutrality with respect to debt versus equity financing 16 the cost of equity financing is the aftertax yield that would be earned if funds were invested elsewhere the cost of debt financing is the aftertax debt interest rate because interest earned is taxable income and mortgage interest is deductible the choice of financing the cost of buying home is tax neutral as an example if taxpayer chooses to withdraw 250000 from an investment account to purchase home the cost of that equity financing option is the interest earnings forgone after taxes assuming an interest rate of 6 and marginal tax rate of 28 the annual earnings would have been 15000 and the aftertax yield would have been 10800 alternatively if the taxpayer borrows 250000 to purchase home assuming the same interest rate of 6 and marginal tax rate of 28 the aftertax cost would be 15000 in interest paid reduced by 4200 in mortgage interest deducted for total cost of 10800 thus the two financing options are neutral with respect to taxation 17

for most tax provisions including the mortgage interest deduction it is useful to examine efficiency loss efficiency loss which is also referred to as deadweight loss is the loss in economic welfare associated with distortions caused by taxes or tax preferences 18 these distortions arise when taxpayers are induced to make substitutions in response to the impacts of tax or tax preference tax preferences for housing encourage some households to substitute increased spending on housing for spending on other goods and services most estimates of inefficiency include broad tax treatment of owneroccupied housing incorporating the mortgage interest deduction the deduction of real estate taxes and the exclusion of imputed rental income poterba estim ated that the deadweight loss for homeowners in 1990 was 53 for households with incomes of 30000 326 for households with incomes of 50000 and 1631 for households with incomes of 25000019 deadweight loss was found to increase as the marginal income tax rate rises and the nominal interest rate declines20 poterba 15 n edward coulson housing policy and the social benefits of homeownership business review federal reserve bank of

such as 401k retirement programs other investment earnings may be taxed at preferential rates in these cases neutrality may not exist 18 james m poterba taxation and housing old questions new answers

according to economic theory in most cases an economy best satisfies the wants and needs of its participants if markets operate free from distortions by taxes and other factors if there is market failure and subsidy remedies that failure then there is economic justification for the subsidy based on efficiency but if there is market failure tax benefit lowers efficiency market failures occur when market left on its own fails to allocate resources efficiently in particular market transactions are inefficient when the marginal benefits are less than the marginal costs market failures may be due to variety of factors including the presence of externalities and common resources public goods imperfect competition andor asymmetric or incomplete information 23 there are socially undesirable phenomena that many consider valid targets of public policy like inequality poverty and inflation but they are not problems that meet the definition of economic inefficiency 24 in this context some of the issues related to homeownership like affordable housing and low rates of homeownership among minority groups are not considered as market failures the deduction for mortgage interest is not economically justified on efficiency grounds in these cases the market failure often attributed to homeownership is that of positive externalities an externality exists when the activity of an individual directly affects positively or negatively the welfare of another and that effect is not inco rporated in market prices proponents claim that homeownership causes positive externalities since it generates not only private benefits for individuals but also social benefits for the public at large the individual does not capture all of these social benefits and thus under invests in real estate from this perspective the private demand for homes is less than social demand and too little investment in homeownership occurs government subsidies to homeownership can stimulate private demand for real estate in order to attain more optimal levels of homeownership that achieve market equilibrium outcomes 25 21 ibid p 239 22 jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital

claimed that homeownership fosters social stability social involvement and socially desirable behaviors among youths and adults26 these social benefits from homeownership may take on the form of better citizenship increased investment in beautifying property and civic involvement that promotes the best interests of the homeowner and the neighborhood there are some specific reasons cited as to why homeownership creates positive externalities they include homeowners are civically involved because the asset value of the home is tied to the strength of the community homeowners are less mobile which adds stability to communities and homeowners take better care of their homes 27 while subsidies for homeowners are justified by economists because of the presence of positive externalities from homeownership there are some ambiguous aspects of these attributes of homeownership which cast doubt as to whether homeownership deserves extensive subsidies few studies have distinguished difficulties in the research on the positive externalities of homeownership in these studies the authors have noted their inability to distinguish whether homeownership caused the desirable behaviors that led to positive externalities or rather people who possessed the desirable behaviors tended to become homeowners thus the individual not homeownership would be the source of the positive externality for instance cox 28 found that homeowners as compared to renters were more likely to be civically involved as did rohe and stegman29 yet these studies showed that the type of involvement varied widely across levels of activity and was not correlated with any of the expected homeownership and neighborhood attributes like house price level of crime and voter participation if the source of the positive externality lies with the individual and not with their ownership status then the arguments in favor of subsidizing homeownership would be diminished even if the existence of positive externalities from homeownership goes unquestioned the appropriate magnitude of subsidies for homeownership is difficult to quantify as previously mentioned the tax provisions and benefits for owneroccupied housing add up to 139 billion in tax revenue loss for fy2005 one could argue that the social benefits of homeownership may not be worth that amount of cost

costs such as real estate broker fees and time costs if the household is selling the property from which it is moving labor immobility interferes with the ability of the economy to adjust to changing market conditions this is more true during regional downturns in the economy for example community experiences the loss of an industry and joblessness rises homeowners are reluctant to move because their house may not sell at price that exceeds the existing mortgage debt on the house and the transaction costs of selling the home thus labor becomes more immobile and the area may remain depressed longer than it might otherwise

g17g160g151g142g155g156g145g146g153g561 all of the externalities discussed above depend on whether an individual rents or owns the externalities do not depend on how much housing is consumed yet the efficiency of the mortgage interest deduction depends upon how many marginal or additional households are induced to buy homes the deduction is not considered effective if it either fails to increase home buying or subsidizes home buying that would have been undertaken in the absence of the tax incentive the presence of subsidy for owneroccupied housing creates an increased demand for housing among renters some of whom respond by becoming homeowners yet that same subsidy also creates increased demand for housing among homeowners some of whom consume more housing most notably homeowners who increase their demand for housing increase the amount and quality of housing demanded in this case as the mortgage interest deduction subsidizes existing homeowners it fails to increase homeownership rates it is however difficult to prove the mortgage interest deductions efficiency or lack thereof because of its continued presence as subsidy and availability to all home buyers for so many years some economists theorize the value of the mortgage interest deduction is capitalized into housing prices 30 buyers of housing it is thought bid up the price of owneroccupied housing to the point where the price of owneroccupied housing including tax benefits is equal to the cost of renting thus the subsidy is perceived to have given homeowners capital gain in the past but new buyers entering the market face higher prices that offset the subsidy if the deduction is capitalized this way it would not induce nonhomeowners to become homeowners though loss of the mortgage interest deduction might adversely affect housing prices some analysts have in an effort to determine the effectiveness of the mortgage interest deduction made comparisons to other countries in particular israel and australia have homeownership rates well above those of the united states and yet they do not allow for the deduction of mortgage interest 31 canada and japan have homeownership rates at about the same level as the united states and those countries do not allow mortgage interest deductibility32 these rates suggest that homeownership may not be sensitive to the deductibility of mortgage interest 30 michelle j

deduction and then repealed the provision their ability to provide comparative value to the united states is limited g7g150g153g146g155g146g140g138g149g561g21g157g158g141g162g561 few empirical studies have addressed this issue one study found that the deduction for mortgage interest subsidizes housing consumption but its impact on homeownership rates was minimal 33 specifically the authors found that there was essentially relationship between the home mortgage interest deduction and the rate of homeownership34 the authors examined more than 30 years of data on the mortgage subsidy rate which is the marginal subsidy to mortgage interest from the deduction for the average taxpayer and the level of homeownership and found that 1 increase in the mortgage subsidy caused homeownership to rise by 000935 in this context housing consumption reflected the dollar amount spent on housing and homeownership rates reflected the number of new homeowners the choice of homeownership according to the authors was influenced by variables other than the mortgage interest deduction like house structure house type and family size g14g152g160g561g20g138g157g142g561g152g143g561g20g142g157g158g155g151g561 to the extent that the mortgage interest deduction promotes homeownership it can be criticized on the grounds that the provision yields too little return relative to its cost in other words the amount of increase in homeownership generated by 1 in tax revenue loss due to the mortgage interest deduction can be far outweighed by allocating that same 1 to other subsidy programs results of recent study of mortgage rates and changes in homeownership provided evidence that direct spending programs and other policy opti ons are more successful at increasing rates of homeownership 36 the study reviewed underwriting simulations and found that down payment reductions had larger effects than mortgage rate reductions on increasing rates of homeownership in particular reduction in the required amount of down payment for home from 5 to 0 of the purchase price caused an increase in the number of renters who became owners this increase equaled 2 to 25 percentage point increase representing roughly 720000 renters 37 different simulation which examined tenure choices indicated that reducing the amount that was required for down payment on the purchase of home increased the probability of ownership by 45 percentage points for all households and 5 percentage points for africanamerican households 38 further simulations reported in that study showed that cash payments starting at around 5000 had larger effects than other policies on the ability of renters to purchase homes 5000 down payment assistance grant was reported to increase the percentage of renters who could buy homes 33

improvements but home equity indebtedness is not limited to this kind of spending for example home equity indebtedness can be used to pay for vacations reduce credit card debt and other personal consumption expenses home equity financing used for purposes unrelated to homeownership does not serve the congressional intent of the provision to encourage homeownership g7g154g158g146g157g162g561 tax benefits such as those available for homeowners can result in individuals with similar incomes paying different amounts of tax in particular homeowners and renters who are equal in all other respects are treated differently as result of the tax incentives for homeowners this differential treatment is deviation from the stan dard of horizontal equity which requires that people in equal positions should be treated equally another component of equity in taxation is vertical equity which requires that tax burdens be distributed fairly among people with different abilities to pay housing tax deductions like all deductions benefit those who have sufficient income to owe federal taxes and the higher the income the greater the benefit 40 those individuals without sufficient income do not have the opportunity to benefit from the provision the disproportionate benefit to individuals with higher incomes reduces the progressivity of the tax system which is often viewed as reduction in equity an example of the effect an income tax deduction has on vertical equity can be seen by identifying two individual homeowners both of whom incur 10000 in mortgage interest the tax benefit to the two differs if they are in different tax brackets homeowner with lower income who may be in the 15 income tax bracket receives an exclusion with value of 1500 while the other homeowner with higher income in the 28 bracket receives an exclusion worth 2800 thus the higher income taxpayer with presumably greater ability to pay taxes receives greater tax benefit than the lower income taxpayer besides renters there are few reasons why the mortgage interest deduction may not be available to certain homeowners some homeowners may not have mortgage debt on which they pay interest according to the census bureau 30 of all homeowners own their homes free and clear with mortgage interest to deduct in particular seniors comprise large portion of homeowners with mortgage debt41 39 ibid p 73 40 some highincome taxpayers face reduced marginal benefits from the deduction of mortgage interest due to the limitation on itemized deductions taxpayers with income above the threshold amount of 145950 for 2005 are required to reduce the amount of itemized deductions including the mortgage interest deduction by 3 of the excess of their income above the threshold amount 41 us

for mortgage interest though they still benefit from the nontaxation of imputed rental income in the case of homeowners without mortgage debt their net imputed rental income is relatively higher than those with mortgage debt so as mortgage debt falls along with mortgage deduction claims the value of the exclusion of net imputed rental income rises other homeowners may not claim the mortgage interest deduction because claiming the standard deduction is more advantageous g11g157g142g150g146g163g142g155g156g561g159g156g495g561g16g152g151g556g11g157g142g150g146g163g142g155g156g561 the mortgage interest deduction can be claimed only by those taxpayers who itemize itemizers tend to be primarily middleand upperincome households nationally the percentage of taxpayers who itemized was 34 in 2003 35 in 2002 34 in 2001 and 33 in 200042 lower income taxpayers generally do not itemize and claim the standard deduction amount instead in 2005 the standard deduction amounts are 10000 for married couple filing jointly 7300 for heads of household and 5000 for single individuals when the value of the standard deduction is increased the difference between it and the value of the mortgage deduction diminishes for lower income households this effect reduces the incentive to purchase owneroccupied housing but does not make the taxpayer worse off for those households on the homeownership margin the tax incentives influence on their decision to own as opposed to rent depends on the amount by which the households total itemized deductions exceeds the standard deduction taxpayers would need to have itemized deductions including deductible taxes such as real estate taxes state and local income or sales taxes or other deductions that exceed the standard deduction amount to make itemizing worthwhile g6g138g157g138g561g152g151g561g6g142g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g156g561g5g149g138g146g150g142g141g561 income tax and tax expenditure data indicate that high income households claim the majority of the deductions for mortgage interest and receive the majority of tax savings from claiming those deductions the most recent tax year data available from the internal revenue service 2001 shown in table 1 indicated that nearly 67 of taxpayers claiming deduction for mortgage interest had incomes of 50000 or more these households represented only 29 of the total number of taxpayers filing returns 43 additionally households with income of 50000 or more claimed majority 76 of the value of the deduction44 continued mainhtml_langen website visited on nov 15 2004 42 as

claimed by households the amount of tax savings received by households or alternatively the amount of federal tax revenue loss is calculated by the congressional joint committee on taxation jct the actual cost of the mortgage interest deduction is determined by the amount of federal tax revenue loss that results from taxpayers claiming the deduction tax revenue loss depends on many factors which include the composition of the household ie number of adults and dependents the households marginal income tax rate and the households income as an example two households could both claim 20000 in mortgage interest deduction that results in different tax revenue loss if one household is in the 33 income tax bracket they would reduce their taxable income by 6600 if the other household is in the 25 bracket their taxable income is reduced by 5000 the tax revenue savings to individuals thus tax revenue loss to the government differs across households as shown below in table 2 the jct estimated that 942 of the 2001 tax savings associated with the mortgage deduction were from households with adjusted gross income of 50000 or higher

costs which can be difficult to isolate and measure are often excluded in the costbenefit analysis of the provision the complexity of the tax code adds to the time cost of taxpayers in either learning how to claim various incentives and doing so or an increased direct cost of paying tax professionals to perform the service for the taxpayer also the more complex the tax code is the more opportunity for tax evasion and avoidance exists g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g22g138g161g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 federal tax policy changes cause unintended consequences for housing subsidies enacted through the tax code several significant tax cuts have been enacted recently all of which have affected the pool of potential beneficiaries of housing tax policy most notably the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 increased the value of standard deductions and reduced marginal income tax rates for individuals causing lower tax burdens in providing tax relief that was designed to stimulate the economy likely unintended consequence was to reduce the number of taxpayers claiming the housing tax deduction as an example the standard deduction for married taxpayers filing jointly rose from 7600 in 2001 to 9700 in 2004 an increase of 276 for most households residing in the same home during that time period mortgage interest was likely to be lower 45 such that some households who may have been itemizing on their tax returns began to claim the standard deduction 45 this statement assumes the homeowner has fixedrate mortgage and is making the same amount of payments towards interest and principal each month

fundamental changes in the federal tax system these changes could have been as far reaching as eliminating the current income tax system and replacing it with an alternative tax system like national sales tax this change could have eliminated deductions and credits including the mortgage interest deduction alternatively congress could have chosen to si mplify the existing tax code by modifying or eliminating provisions like the mortgage interest deduction finally tax reform could have occurred and the mortgage interest deduction could have been unchanged in the absence of tax reform congress may or may not make changes to the mortgage interest deduction congress may choose to modify or eliminate the deduction for homeowners for variety of reasons including revenue raising strategies to reduce the deficit or addressing the equity issues surrounding the provision alternatively congress may choose not to alter the mortgage interest deduction

for cash charitable contributions and home mortgage interest in general flat taxes would eliminate the th ree primary tax provisions for owneroccupied housing the mortgage interest deduction the deduction of state and local property taxes and the exclusion of capital gains on sales of primary residences46 as mentioned previously the cost of these tax provisions combined with the exclusion of net imputed rental income is estimated to be 139 billion in tax revenue loss for fy2005 47 while that amount is sizeable it is unclear as to what the net change in federal revenue may be as result of moving to flat tax it is notable that the fundamental tax advantage of owneroccupied housing the nontaxation of imputed rental income would remain unless specifically addressed by legislation however the flat tax would eliminate the favorable treatment of owneroccupied housing relative to other assets because the returns to all new investment would be untaxed not just the returns to homeownership estimates of the effect of the eliminations of these tax provisions were made in the midto late 1990s when fundamental tax reform was last being considered 1996 report estimated that the elimination of both the mortgage interest and property tax deductions would reduce house prices by an average of 17 but could range from as low as 11 to as high as 34 depending on the region of the country 48 in 1996 crs examined the effect of flat tax on housing49 the principal finding was that if flat tax were instituted eliminating the mortgage interest deduction demand for owneroccupied housing and homeownership would likely contract crs found that the overall price of housing could fall by 22 but that only onethird of that amount of price decline would be due to the loss of housing tax deductions50 the remaining portion of the price contraction would occur as result of other factors one of which would be the elimination of the preferential tax treatment of housing relative to other investment assets assets would shift from housing to business investment which would improve economic efficiency the report stated economists would typically view this shift as benefit of tax reform because the current tax system encourages an inefficient overinvestment of funds in housing and consequent underinvestment in business assets 51 crs found much smaller effects than private sector reporting which had suggested that the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction would cause larger more adverse effects on housing prices and on the economy 52 for example private sector report concluded that enacting 46 under flat tax there is capital gains tax 47 us congress joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 2002 to 2006 jcs102 washington

specifically because of the elimination of the deduction for mortgage interest the price decline would in turn eliminate 17 trillion of homeowners equity53 capozza green and hendershott examined the ef fects of flat tax on housing and found house price declines ranging from 10 to 3054 the authors noted that house price changes that could occur under flat tax would vary based on what changes occurred with interest rates and with property taxes the higher these two variables were found to be the greater the percentage decline in house prices 55 after performing regional analysis the authors further concluded that the degree of house price decline would vary by region and would be dependent on the rate of property taxation and the existing price level of houses in the region highpriced metropolitan areas in california as an example would be hardest hit while lowpriced metropolitan areas in the south would experience the smallest degree of house price decline the issue of fundamental tax reform and housing was further examined in working paper from the national bureau of economic research nber 56 the authors simulated tests of housing market response to fundamental tax reform and found that tax reform proposals would cause contraction in the quantity of housing stock though the degree of contraction varied depending on the type of tax reform57 the authors reported that the removal of the deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes would cause 19 decline in the housing stock while flat tax enactment would cause an 8 decline 58 the authors note that their results are constructed under partial equilibrium assumption that the longrun supply of housing is perfectly elastic and that if housing demand were to grow more elastic the impact of eliminating tax benefits for owner occupied housing causes greater decline in the stock of housing59 g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g20g142g157g138g146g149g561g21g138g149g142g156g561g22g138g161g561 movement to sales tax system from the current income tax system would eliminate existing tax subsidies to owneroccupied housing including th mortgage interest deduction and would also eliminate the significance of the net exclusion of imputed rental income national retail sales tax would repeal the personal and corporate income tax code and replace it with tax on all final sales of goods and services to consumers national retail sales tax would impose tax on newly built homes which would cause existing homes to enjoy tax advantage under most concepts of national retail sales tax the sale of an existing home would be categorized as the sale of used property and would not be taxed in this context the value of existing homes relative to newly built homes would rise if rental payments for housing were taxed owners of existing homes would also enjoy tax advantage over renters 53 roger brinner mark lasky and david wyss residential real estate impacts of flat tax legislation lexington ma

mortgage interest deduction separate from tax reform would harm itemizing homeowners with the highest amounts of mortgage debt and in particular those homeowners who could not easily replace that bt with equity homeowners with mortgages would be expected to reduce their debt and new homebuyers would incur less debt than they would have previously for some homeownersh ip would longer be an optimal choice60 if this were the case reduction in the demand for homes would occur and housing prices would decline at least in the short run and lead to decrease in the quantity of owneroccupied housing in the long run 1996 study examined the possibility of eliminating the mortgage interest deduction noting that the benefits of the mortgage interest deduction accrued overwhelmingly to young households and to high income households 61 the authors found that the younger households had limited wealth and were forced to borrow to finance homeo wnership while higher income households participation with the mortgage interest deduction was to engage in tax arbitrage for the higher income households the loss of the deduction would lead these households to use financial assets to reduce or eliminate their mortgage debt this alternative however is not available to households without financial assets some economists theorize that the loss of the mortgage interest deduction separate from tax reform would adversely affect housing prices because the value of the subsidy is capitalized into housing prices buyers of housing it is thought bid up the price of owneroccupied housing to the point where the price of owneroccupied housing including tax benefits is equal to the cost of renting62 thus the subsidy is perceived to have given homeowners capital gain in the past the loss of which could be factored in to housing prices63 the full economic implications of eliminating the mortgage interest deduction depend upon whether or not the subsidy is capitalized into real estate prices if it is fully capitalized eliminating the subsidy would not affect the cost of owning but many owners would experience significant changes in wealth64 gyourko and sinai found that in 2003 the value of the subsidy amounted to about fifth of property value on average in the united states in particular they found there were more than 40 metropolitan areas including many densely populated ones in and around boston new york city washington dc angeles and san francisco for which the present value of the subsidy flow is greater than 25 of house values the increased revenue associated with eliminating the subsidy could be redistributed back to taxpayers in the form of lower taxes according to the authors the net wealth effect of lower taxes would likely be significant enough 60 the presence of high transaction costs make selling seem impractical for homeowners renters on the other hand could choose to forgo home purchases 61 dennis r capozza richard k green and patric hendershott taxes mortgage

deduction65 the report did not address how these decreased property values would effect state and local government revenue if the tax subsidy is not capitalized into real estate prices the cost of ownership rises when the deduction is eliminated in 2003 gyourko and sinai determined that the rise in cost of ownership could equal between 4 and 6 of annual household income in over half of the nations metropolitan areas however in 20 metropolitan areas including many in california hawaii and massachusetts costs of homeownership amounted to 10 of income or more their analysis indicated that if the tax savings from eliminating the subsidy were rebated through the implementation of tax credit this rebate would more than offset the increase in the cost of ownership in most areas however the authors noted that returning the tax savings through the existing tax system would not provide similar offset 66

relative to equity value in the home would fall by more than 30 and that house price declines of 10 could accompany mortgage lending declines of about 4067 mortgage interest rates could fall in response to lower demand for mortgage debt lower mortgage rates could attract new homebuyers which could increase demand for homes and cause house price increases thereby reversing declines in

possibility of the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction and offered plan for phasing out the provision that would minimally affect housing demand68 citing that proposals to limit the mortgage deduction are opposed on the grounds that existing homeowners would suffer huge capital losses the authors proposed 15to 20year period of phasing in the elimination of the tax provision this type of elimination the authors argued would not adversely affect demand for housing or the capital values of the existing stock 69 finally the repeal of the deduction could be justified as secondbest policy to address the absence of taxation on net imputed rental income net imputed rental income from homeownership has never been included as taxable income in the federal income tax this is due in

further many economists doubt that imputed rent could be accurately taxed in the united states as practical matter little is known for example about the probable rental value of owneroccupied homes only rough estimates could be made from available data on assessed house values available data on rental rates is not useful because of the differences in size and quality of rental units as compared to owneroccupied properties

could choose to modify the provision to either simplify the tax code increase tax revenue or both in the event of tax reform these modifications could be considered and included in various reform proposals for instance congress could choose to implement flat tax and allow some modified version of the mortgage inte rest deduction the possibilities in this regard could be endless thus the modifications listed below describe possible policy options that could be taken without regard to particular form of systematic tax change

the mortgage interest deduction would be to reduce the maximum allowable mortgage debt limit from 1 million to lesser amount this choice would reduce the tax benefit for those homeowners with debt in excess of the allowable amount presumably high income households with very large houses the reduction in tax savings could cause the prices of homes worth more than the allowable debt amount to decline which would reduce demand for those homes there are few possible consequences of reduci ng the debt limit some homeowners would use equity to pay down some or all of their mortgage debt other households may reduce their level of housing consumption by moving to less expensive homes marginal homeowners who are typically not high income households or purchasers of expensive homes are unlikely to be affected by reduction in allowable debt in february 2005 the congressional budget of fice cbo examined this policy option it estimated that reducing the amount of mortgage principal that could be allowed from 1 million to 500000 would affect 700000 taxpayers with large mortgages and raise 27 billion in fy2006 70 the number of taxpayers affected by the year 2010 would rise to 13 million with an increase in revenue of 43 billion that year over the period of 2006 through 2010 the total revenue increase from limiting the principal debt that could be claimed for the mortgage interest deduction would be 479 billion cbo estimated that less than 1 of all homeowners and about 3 of new homebuyers would be affected by the limit71 this policy option would not be any more complex than the existing tax code though there would be increased administrative costs associated with the change there would be increased costs to make taxpayers aware of the change and also increased costs to change tax forms if the reduction 70 us congress congressional budget office budget options congressional study washington gpo 2005 p 278 71 ibid

indebtedness is another possible modification to the mortgage interest deduction as mentioned previously home equity debt often finances personal consumption rather than financing homeownership which causes disparate treatment among similarly situated taxpayers as an example two taxpayers can incur 20000 in consumption debt the taxpayer who finances this debt with credit card as opposed to home equity loan is unable to receive tax benefit by deducting the interest charges the taxpayer who uses home equity loan to pay off the credit card debt can deduct the interest and thus is favorably treated by the tax code the interest deductions disparate treatment of homeowners also reflects differences in housing appreciation and values homeowners with housing price appreciation can take advantage of home equity debt while other homeowners with flat or declining home values may not be able to benefit from home equity debt 72 allowing home equity indebtedness deductibility also favors those homeowners who have sufficient credit worthiness to incur home equity debt this effect further contributes to disparate treatment of taxpayers to the extent that some homeowners are unable to obtain home equity loans on the other hand eliminating home equity deductibility negatively affects households who have significant pool of funds from which to finance needed repairs or improvements these households who are more likely to be lowerincome andor elderly households would lose the benefit of the tax savings if home equity indebtedness were disallowed yet this loss only applies to those households who were benefitting from the tax savings which may have been small portion of the affected population this policy choice has been presented as an option to improve tax compliance and reform tax expenditures by the joint committee on taxation jct the option was estimated to raise 03 billion in tax revenue for fy2006 and 226 billion in tax revenue over the 10year period beginning in fy2006 73

mortgage interest deduction could be limited to acquisition indebtedness associated with principal residences only presumably it is higher income households that are able to afford more than one residence so disallowing the mortgage interest from debt on second residence or mobile home yacht or other qualifying property would contribute to making the provision more equitable by reducing the amount of benefit that higher income households can receive this modification may contribute to decrease in demand for housing vacation homes in particular which could lead to shortterm decrease in the price of vacation homes the supply 72 ibid p 55 73 us congress joint committee on taxation options to improve tax compliance and reform expenditures jcs 0205 washington gpo 2005 pp 5256

taxpayers to households with particular income levels the imposition of an income threshold as in the case of certain other tax provisions would increase tax revenue by reducing the number of taxpayers eligible to claim the deduction as an example the tax credit for new homebuyers in washington dc is nonrefundable credit against federal taxes of up to 5000 for the firsttime purchase of principal residence in the district of columbia the credit is phased out for individuals with adjusted gross income agi of 70000 to 90000 and for joint filers with agi of 110000 to 130000 in particular for every 1000 of agi above 110000 for joint tax filers the credit is reduced by 250 once agi exceeds 130000 credit may be taken imposing an income cap could increase equity because the cap would disallow highincome households from claiming the deduction in doing so the provision would subsidize homeownership for households with less income which may add progressivity to the tax code it would still be the case that lowincome househol ds with tax liability or those who claim the standard deduction would not benefit from the provision this policy choice would add complexity to the tax code by further complicating the tax provision this option would require taxpayers to do more work in determining their eligibility for the provision the internal revenue service would also have increased administrative effort to enforce income restrictions for those claiming the provision g3g139g152g159g142g556g157g145g142g556g14g146g151g142g561g6g142g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 an abovetheline deduction which would be available to taxpayers regardless of whether they claim the standard deduction or itemize deductions could increase equity this possibility would allow the deduction of mortgage interest to be available to more modest income taxpayers than is currently allowed by tax law this change would contribute to progressivity in the tax code but would also increase tax revenue loss by allowing more individuals to claim the deduction at its initial introduction an abovetheline deduction would add complexity to the tax code and tax filing forms because of its newness the provision would increase the administrative work taxpayers experience in filing their income tax returns and the work the irs performs in

provision would not be any more complex than the existing deduction the enactment of an abovetheline deduction could however be perceived as undermining the concept of the standard deduction which exists in part to simplify the tax code g22g138g161g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561 another possible change that would increase the equity of the deduction would be to transform the mortgage interest deduction into partial tax credit this change would benefit lower income individuals by allowing them to benefit from cl aiming mortgage interest those taxpayers who claim the standard deduction could also claim tax credit for mortgage interest this policy option would provide taxpayers at different income levels with the same rate of subsidy for mortgage interest payments unlike the current deduction which varies with the marginal tax rate the tax credit would also allow lower income households that currently do not claim mortgage interest perhaps because the interest they pay is less than the value of the standard deduction to benefit by claiming tax credit for mortgage interest this option could either increase or decrease federal revenues depending on the amount of credit chosen estimates for this policy option were made by the congressional budget office cbo 25 years ago 74 at that time cbo determined that moving to 25 tax credit would increase revenues by about 24 billion in the year the study was conducted and by 43 billion in the next year at that rate of 25 only small group of wealthy taxpayers would be worse off credit of 30 or more would have decreased revenues cbo also found that tax credit of this amount would raise house prices for less expensive homes and lower them for higherpriced units this effect could lead to some upperincome homeowners experiencing decrease in the value of their homes as well as an increase in their tax payments allowing current owners the choice of deduction or credit could have limited those capital losses but the revenue tax revenue losses from doing so would have been substantial 75 higher income taxpayers may be less well off by the transformation of the current mortgage interest deduction to tax credit if the tax credit were only partial credit for higher income taxpayers the value of the current mortgage interest deduction is likely to be greater than the value of proposed tax credit which could cause an aftertax reduction in price for high income households yet higher income households are less sensitive than lower income households to changes in price so the loss in value of the mortgage interest deduction if it were to become tax credit may not be significant enough to cause high income households to abandon homeownership if high income households responded at all they may reduce their housing consumption perhaps by purchasing less expensive housing as result this proposal could increase homeownership because it is most likely to alter decisions about homeownership at the margin more families in the lowerand middleincome groups may choose to own rather than rent others in those same groups may choose to buy more housing than they currently own 74 the more recent policy proposal by the tax reform panel established by president bush in 2005 did not include cost estimates 75 us congress congressional budget office tax treatment of homeownership issues and options

income for taxation purposes tax analysts believe tax credit is not appropriate under pure income tax system tax credits are dollarfordollar reductions in taxpayers federal andor state income tax liability while tax deductions are offsets to taxpayers pretax income since income taxes are meant to raise revenue from taxpayers according to their ability to pay tax deductions alter income to best reflect taxpayers ability to pay deductions unlike credits reduce the base amount of income to be taxed and in doing so affect the variable benefits correlated to taxpayers particular income tax rate or bracket 76 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 tax reform proposals made in the 109th congress promoted consumptionbased tax systems most of which would have eliminated the mortgage interest deduction in the case of either flat tax or sales tax all credits and deductions as they exist in the current income tax system would have been eliminated the deduction of mortgage interest would longer be allowed unless specifically addressed by legislation as an example s 812 proposed flat tax that included the preservation of the mortgage interest deduction ong with the charitable contributions deduction although the mortgage interest deduction is generally defended on the basis of supporting access to homeownership most studies conclude that it s primary effect is on housing consumption not homeownership most of the benefits of the deduction accrue to households with wellabove average incomes while households on the cusp of homeownership tend to have lower income depending on how they are structured most stud ies suggest that lower income households would be aided more by downpayment assistance than by the deduction for mortgage interest eliminating the mortgage interest deduction separa from tax reform would have several effects it would tend to reduce debt relative to equity by ending the neutrality between equityand debtfinancing it would lead some households who may have been considering homeownership to choose to continue to rent some ownerhouseholds may choose to consume less housing either by choosing smaller homes or fewer amenities the elimination could lower home prices relative to rents in the market and could cause households to convert housing assets to business investment if the deduction were eliminated as result of fundamental tax reform the resulting effects would depend on variety of variables these variables include the nature of tax reform the resulting changes in the tax base and tax rates changes in interest rates and other economic variables if the deduction were eliminated without other tax policy changes federal income tax revenues could increase the tax base could be broadened and the federal budget deficit could be reduced this elimination could lead to greater economic efficiency increased equity and simplification of the current income tax system modifications to the mortgage interest deduction could also have several effects congress could choose to allow the deduction for only one residence rather than two or reduce the allowable principal debt from 1 million to some lower amount perhaps 500000 these changes would reduce the amount of tax revenue loss associated with the provision without adding complexity to 76 babette b barton et eds study of federal tax law the taxation of

equitable nature of the provision by allowing more low income households to claim mortgage interest either as an abovetheline deduction or as tax credit finally the mortgage interest deduction could
