editors receive 21 nd bilateral creditors 22 of the total little of th bilateral debt is owed to th united states in recent years multilateral agencies and bila teral creditors have forgiven substantial amounts of debt in order to reduce the poor countries debt burden to sustainable levels however debtors many still have difficu lty servicing their debts there have been calls for 100 forgiveness of multilateral debt many analysts suggest however that such forgiveness could substantially limit the ability of the multilateral agencies to provide future aid africas debt burden overview the countries of subsaharan africa owed 2089 billion to foreign creditors at the end of 2001 according to data published by the world bank1 of this 81 1687 billion was longterm debt 16 338 billion was shortterm debt repayable within year and 3 63 billi on was mediumterm debt owed to the international monetary fund imf the basic structure of africas debt is very similar to most other regions most have longterm debt levels in the low 80 range nd shortterm debt in the midteens there are two exceptions south asia has kept its s hortterm debt level be low 4 thus raising its longterm ratio to over 95 of total debt by contrast the middle east and north africa region carried 22 of its obligations as shortterm debt lowering its longterm ratio to 76 the structure of countrys debt has considerable influence on the annualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21329crs2 level and flexibility of its pa yment obligations the annual co st of servicing longerterm debt is lower because the payments for prin cipal are spread over longer period of time debt structure of africas total longter m debt 782 billion was owed to bilateral official creditors 533 billion to multilateral creditors and 371 billion to private creditors most 86 of the debt owed to multilateral agencies was the result of concessionalrate loans 45 of the bilateral debt was from concessional loans loans by official exportfinance agencies to facilitate commercial export sales comprise substantial share of all bilateral debt t oday most countries provide most of their bilateral development aid in the form of grants rather than concessionalrate loans of the debt owed to private creditors 67 wa s guaranteed by african governments debt payments in 2001 african countries paid 145 billion in debt service principal and interest to their foreign cr editors most of this 129 billion went to service longterm debt while about 09 bi llion paid shortterm obligations and 08 billion went to repay the imf africas bt payments in 2001 we re the smallest ratio 7 of its outstanding debt for any region in the world in africas longterm debt service private creditors received 73 billion multilateral creditors 27 billion and bilateral creditors 28 billion in other words private creditors received most of the loan payments even though they owned the smallest part of the debt wh ile bilateral creditors got small portion of the repayments even though they owned the largest share of the debt at the end of 2000 african countries were 237 billion in arrears in their payments to official creditors most of this is owed to bilateral creditors arrears to multilateral development banks mdbs mostly th world bank and african development bankfund totaled about 247 billion countries in arrears more than 6 months to the mdbs are ineligible for future loans debt burden most observers agree that the foreign debt burden of the african countries is very heavy it is not the absolu size of the debt owed by african countries however which is the problem on the aver age each african owes 251 share of the regions total foreign debt this is double the per capita share for people in south asia 116 about the same as that for people in ea st asia 284 and much less than that for people in latin america 1306 compar ed to its export income africas debt obligation is high but again it is not dispropor tionately large by world standards africas ratio of debt to export inco was 179 in 2001 this compares to 142 for south asia and 167 for latin america the rate fo r east asia however was only 74 when one considers only the amount of debt servi ce that was actually paid however africashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21329crs3 2 the numbers for africa and other regions are drawn from global development

the salmon book in reference to the color of its cover debtservice ratio declines in 2001 africas actual debt service pa yments were equal to 12 of export income this is comparable to the rates for south asia and east asia both 12 and less than the rates for europe and central asia 18 and latin america 33 africas debt burden is heavy because the region is very poor in 2 001 its total gross income was about 294 billion2 this means that each dollar of africas income is matched by 71 cents in external debt th is was roughly twice the ratios for all other regions south asia 24 east asia 29 the middle east 33 latin america 43 and eastern europe and central asia 49 to ve foreign debtgross income ratio comparable to those for other regions by this method of calculation subsaharan africa would either need to double its annual in come or reduce its foreign debt by half most analysts agree that reductions in the size of africas debt stock and debt payments are needed many also believe t hough that greater effort is needed on the income side of the equation over the long run they say effort s to stimulate economic growth and to expand and stabilize the regions export income may be at least as important if not more so in reducing the overall burden of africas debt new trade opportunities and exports with higher value and greater price stability may be needed debt owed to the us government at the close of calendar 2000 the total fo reign credit exposure of the united states in subsaharan africa was 764 billion3 by comparison the total us worldwide exposure was 9055 billion

owed 11 of the regions multilateral debt and received 23 of all multilateral debt serv ice payments in 2001 net transfers on net basis the flow of resources from multilateral agencies to african countries is positive in 2001 they disbursed 366 billion and r eceived 272 billion in debt service principal and inte rest the net transfer being positive 094 billion the pattern is not even however for all multilateral prog rams in 2000 the net transfer from mdb concessional loan prog rams to africa was positive 121 billion for nonconcessional mdb prog rams by contrast it was negative 127 billion and for imf programs as whole the ne t transfer was negative 21 million5 on country basi s the situation is also uneven some african countries had negative flows even for concessional mdb pr ograms most of the negative net flows occurred however in nonconce ssional programs and in count ries which are not deemed creditworthy for much future nonconcessiona l aid consequently their repayments or old loans exceed the disbursements for new loans nigeria is prominent examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21329crs5 6 international monetary fund heavily indebted poor countries hipc

purpose of wh ich all but 28 million had been disbursed hipc many poor countries have had diffi culty however meeting their payment obligations for mdb concessional loans in 1996 the g7 countries approved plan to forgive up to 90 of the foreign debt owed by heavily indebted poor countries the plan was modified and its requirements eased in 1998 the world bank and imf have the lead in

and consideration may be given to the size of the countrys debt compared to its fiscal revenue two countries have qualified for this treatment recently the bank has come to agree with critics that

funding id as assistance program may 21 2002for the 26 countries that have reached th eir decision or completion points the hipc program has agreed to provide 405 billion in debt service relief this is equal on an npv basis to 259 billion over the repayment period of the cancelled loans of this amount on an npv basis multilateral agencies are providing 53 and bilateral official creditors 45 of the total commercial creditors are providing 2 of hipc relief of the total the world bank is providing 24 and th imf 8 of hipc debt forgiveness the afdbafdf is providing another 7 the world banks receipts from debt repayments will decline by bout 500 million annually from 2003 to 2009 and will continue declining at roughly that level for decade th ereafter repayments to the imf will decline from about 300 million dollars in 2003 to 48 milli on in 2009 this is consistent with the shorter debt repayment periods for most imf loans until recently the world bank has absorbed the cost of its portion of the hipc program from its own resources through december 31 2001 the world bank had forgiven or announced plans to forgive 102 b illion in debt owed to ida by hipc countries only small portion of the cost of this forgiveness had been realized however as that cost is only incurred on the date the forgiven loan repayment would have otherwise been received the bank offset lost loan repayments through transfers from the ibrds annual income and it receive d 778 million in reimbursements from the hipc trust fund the bank says that it will cont ribute between 200 million and 220 million annually to hipc in the next four years through 2005 completing its earlier pledge to provide substantial contribution to the program thereafter it says the cost of offsetting lost ida reflows will need to be borne by the ida donor countries otherwise the annual size of idas assistance pr ogram will have to shrink by about 500 million the amount of the lost repayments in effect the futu re cost of ida debt forgiveness under the hipc program will need to be carried either by the donors through higher annual payments or by the ida recipients through re duced levels of future aid7 more mdb debt relief is it feasible for the world bank to provide greater levels of debt relief to african or other countries jubilee usa and others have called for 100 cancellation of all debt owed the multila teral agencies by poor countries as of june 30 2001 ida borrowers owed 866 billion to ida african countries comprised 319 billion of the total the world bank s 196 billion in retained earnings in the ibrds financial reserves but transferring resources from one world bank program to another is process beset with serious legal institutional and political complications large percentage of the banks membership would need to agree to the transfer and the banks bondholders to whom it owes over 100 b illion would need to agree not to sue the bank for damages loan reflows curre ntly account for about 40 of the resources ida uses to fund its assistance program the world bank and the ida donors expect that this share will increase to 70 in the next few decades if the amount of idas debt forgiveness is greater than the amount it recei ves in offsetting transf ers or contributions it will lack resources in those future decades to fund its program in that case the united states and other donor countries either will need to increase their future contributions substantially or they will need to let the ida program shrink substantially in size
