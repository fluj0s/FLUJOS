subsequently revoked by the senate and the othe r senator during the late 1700s for disloyal conduct the house of representatives has expelled only fi ve members in its history three during the civil

expelling senators from the senate in imposing legislative discipline against their members the sena and the house operate through their rulemaking powers1 and the express provision fo r legislative

rules of its proceedings punish its members for disorderly behaviour and with the conc urrence of two thirds expel member the underlying justification for legisla tive discipline has traditionally been to protect the integrity and dignity of the legislative institution and its proceedings rather than merely to punish an individual2 and such internal legislative process is additional to any potential criminal or civil liability that member might incur for any particular misconduct3 senators are subject to in ternal congressional discipline for any conduct which the institution of the senate believes warra nts such discipline the express constitutional authority drafted by the framers of the constitution was influenced by british parliamentary practice as well as our own colonial

house of congress to expel member appears to have been influenced by the parliamentary practice in england whereby members of the house of commons were expelled regardless of the nature or timing of the offense as disciplinary action as well as remedial measure to deal with those deemed unworthy or unfit for membership11 distinguished from exclusion it should be noted that the disciplinary action of expulsion is different than and is distinguished from the action of exclusion an exclusion is where the senate or the house refuses to seat memberel ect generally upon the objection of another member or memberelect by simple majority vote on the grounds that such challenged memberelect has either not met the three standing constitutional qualifications of office age citizenship and inhabitancy in the state from which elected or was not duly elected12 the authority of the senate to exclude memberelect by simple majority vote of the body although there had been some legitimate minority argu ment to the contrary in the past is now clearly understood to be limited to questions of whether memberelect meets the constitutional qualifications for office13 or the question of whethe r the memberelect had been duly elected question which is genera lly resolved in socalled contested election case14 the supreme court in powell v mccormack stated clearly that the constitution leaves the house nd the senate without authority to exclude any person duly elected by his constituents who meets all the requirements for membership expressly prescribed in the constitution15 the precedents in the senate which predate the 1969 powell v mccormack decision and which consider moral character andor past misconduc t in assessing the suitability fitness or qualifications of an

conduct16 authority as to grounds and timing there is limitation apparent in the text of the constitution nor in the deliberations of the framers on the author ity to expel member of congress other than the twothirds vote requirement on study of the expulsion clause summarized the framers intent as follows from the history of article i section 5 clause 2 and in particular its course in the committee of detail it is clear that the framers did not intend to impose any limitation on congressional power to determine what conduct warranted expulsion nor do the debates in the convention suggest any desire to impose any other substantive restri ctions on the expulsion power17 justice joseph story similarly concluded that it would be difficult to draw clear line of distinction between the right to inflict the punishment of expulsion and any other punishment upon member founded on the time place or nature or the offense and that expulsion may be for any misdemeanor which though not punishable by any statute is inconsiste nt with the trust and duty of member18 the supreme court of the united states citing justice storys historic treatise on the constitution found an expansive aut hority and discretion within each house of congress concerning the grounds and the timing for an expulsion in in re chapman the supreme court noted the senate expulsion case of senator william blount19 as supporting the constitutional author ity of either house of congress to punish member for conduct which in the j udgment of the body is inconsistent with the trust and duty of member even if ch conduct was not statutable offense nor was it committed in his official character nor was it committed during the session of congress nor at the seat of government20 the supreme court has thus recognized very broad discretion and authority of each house of congress to discipline its members under its own chosen standards generally without established right to judi cial review descri bing

to impeachment in the senate the supreme court found as non justiciable political question challenge to the senates impeachment proceedings under article i section 3 cl 6 the court in nixon v united states 506 us 224 1993 found that the claims of the federal judgepetitioner were nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine and its separation of powers implications as the court found textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to coordinate political department since these are matters specifically assigned in the constitution to the senate the senate has broad discretion in establishing the procedures that it uses and the courts would not review such procedures absent conflict with another specific section of the constitution 23 in powell v mccormack the houses exclusion was found to contravene the qualifications clause in ar ticle i section 2 cl 2 24 bond v floyd 385 us 116 131 1966 25 395 us at 553disciplinary process the supreme court in united states v brewster noted in dicta the process of disciplining member in the congress is not surrounded with the panoply of protective shields that are present in criminal case an accused member is judged by specifically articulated standards and is at the mercy of an almost unbridled di scretion of the charging body from whose decision there is established right of review21 it is thus likely that court would fi nd in similar fashion to the above quoted dicta of the supreme court in brewster regarding established right to review of congressional disciplinary action that the issue of an expulsion of senator by the senate or representative by the hous is nonjusticiable political question in which there exists textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to coordinate political department of government22 unlike the factual premise in the powell exclusion an expulsion of member for misconduct would not appear to involve another expre ss constitutional provisi on which may be in conflict with the exercise of such authority of the legislature23 nor would such action arguably impinge upon the constitutional rights of an individual24 in fact in powell v mccormack justice douglas in his concurring opinion noted the difference in justiciability between that exclusion case based on qualifications other than those established in another express provision of the constitution as opposed to an expulsion case based on misconduct by noting th at if this were an expulsion case i would think that justiciabl controversy were presented25 although the authority and power of each house of congress to expel appears to be within the broad disc retion of the institution or as noted by the supreme court in dicta at the unbridled discretion of the charging body policy

when the conduct complained of occurred in prior congress when the electorate knew of the conduct but still reelected the member to the current congress27 on occasion this restraint has been characterized such as in dicta by the supreme court as evidence th at both houses have dist rusted their power to punish in such cases of past misconduct28 the court in powell v mccormack supra in distinguishing the exclusion of powell from an expulsion observed that congressional precedents have shown that the house will not expel member for misconduct committed during an earlier congress29 the court noted specifically however that it was not actually ruling on the houses authority to expel for past misconduct30 and as noted above justice doug in his concurrence stated specifically that if this were an expul sion case i would think that justiciable controversy were presented since douglas agreed with senator murdock of utah in 1940 exclusion case that each house may expel anyone it designates by two thirds vote31 it should be noted that the principal congressional case cited by the supreme court for its assertion in powell v mccormack that the house will not expel for prior misconduct the case involving repres entative john w lang ley involved many other relevant considerati ons although the committee in that instance did question the ability of the house to expel an i ndividual for misconduct resulting in criminal conviction prior to his election as member the committee also found that the house could not permit in its membership person serving sentence for crime32 in resolving this apparent conflict the committee reported to the house thatrepresentative langley whose conviction prior to his reelection was pending on appeal had agreed not to participate in house proceedings while the appeal was pending and had agreed to resign if hi s appeals were denied after langleys appeals were denied by the suprem court he resigned his office 33 it should also be noted that many of the arguments opposed to proceeding against member of the house for misconduc t in prior congress were based on the concept that the existing house should not take recognition of injuries

integrity and dignity of the senate in the past may not have the same character of being arguably against different institution or body in the report on the mccarthy censure the select committee to study censure charges specifically stated the following precedents in both the senate and house for expulsion or censure for conduct occurring during preceding congress may be found in hinds op cit 1275 to 1289 precedents in the house cannot be considered as controlling because the house is not continuing body36 careful reading of congressional precedents would appear to indicate that although there has certainly b een some questioning of the right of the body to expel member for past misconduct when reel ected with knowledge of his constituents of that conduct there have been divisions of opinions on this subject for example there were two conflicting opinions of two different house committees in the credit mobilier investigations on the discipline of re presentatives ames and brooks in the 42nd congress in 187237 in adopting disciplinary resolution of censure and not expulsion in that case however the house specifically refused to accept preamble to the substitute resolution for censure which had expressly questioned its authority to expel for past misconduct38 differences of opinion so arose in other expulsion and disciplinary cases39 in modern congressional practice and in light of supreme court rulings and dicta it would appear to be more accurate to say that restraint concerning members expulsion after reelection has arisen from questioning by the institution of the senate or the house of the wisdom of such policy rather than formal recognition of an absence of constitutional power to expel for past misconduct the reticence of the house or the senate to ex pel member for past misconduct after the member has been reelected by his or her constituents with knowledge of the members conduct appears to reflect the ference traditionally pa id in our heritagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs93875crs8 40 see footnote 4 of this report supra note also discussion of the infamous wilkes case in england shortly before the time of the drafting of the united states

the expulsion vo to receive the required twothirdsto the popular will and election choice of the people40 justice story while noting the necessity of expulsion of one who disgraced the house by the grossness of his conduct noted that such power of the institution of the house to expel duly elected representative of the people is at the same time so subversive of the rights of the people as to require that it be us ed sparingly and to be wisely guarded by twothirds requirement41 similarly cushing noted that the power to expel should be governed by the strictest justice since in expelling dulyelected member without just cause power of control woul d thus be assumed by the representative body over the constituent wholly incons istent with the freedom of election42 in 1807 senator john quincy adams disc ussed in select committee report on proposed expulsi on of senator john smith for his alleged part in the aaron burr conspiracy the issues of the authority of the senate to expel member even after the senators indictment had b een dropped although the indictment as well as the alleged misconduct occurred s ubsequent to the time of senator smiths election to the senate by the ohio legislature nator adams discussed in broad terms the senates authority to expel finding that by the letter of the constitution the power of expelling member is given to each of the two houses of congress without any limitation other than that which requires concurrence of twothirds this sole limitation that is the twothirds requirement was in the opinion of the select committee wise and sufficient guard against the possible abuse of this legislative discretion43 the distinction between the power of the house of representatives to expel and the judicious use of that power as policy of the house was cogently explained in house judiciary committee report in 1914 in the judgment of your committee the power of the house to expel or punish by censure member for misconduct occurring before his election or in preceding or former congress is sustained by the practice of the house sanctioned by reason and sound policy and in extreme cases is absolutely essential to enable the house to exclude from its deliberations and councils notoriously corrupt men who have unexpectedly and suddenly dishonored themselves and betrayed the public by acts and conduct rendering them unworthy of the high position of honor and trust reposed in them but in considering this question and in arriving at the conclusions we have reached we would not have ou unmindful of the fact that we have been dealing with the question merely as one of power and it should not be confused with the question of policy also involved as matter of sound policy this extraordinary prerogative of the house in our

corruption convictionscases and always with great caution nd after due circumspection and should be invoked with greatest caution where the acts of misconduct complained of had become public previous to and were generally known at the time of the members election to exercise such power in that instance the house might abuse its high prerogative and in our opinion might exceed the just limitations of its constitutional authority by seeking to substitute its standards and ideals for the standards and ideals of the constituency of the member who had deliberately chosen him to be their representative the effect of such policy would tend not to preserve but to undermine and destroy representative government44 the power to expel is thus used cautiously when the institution of congress might be seen as usurping or supplanting its own ins titutional judgment for the judgment of the electorate as to the character or fitness for office of an individual whom the people have chosen to represent them in congress45 the principal manner of dealing with ethical improprieties or misconduct of representative senators were not at the time of the adoption of the constitution and until 1 913 chosen directly by the people but were selected by the state legislatures was intended by the framers to be and has historically bee n reliance upon the voters to keep their members virtuous

adopted by the senate did not use any specific term of disapproval such as censure condemn or denounce but merely st ated the relevant findings and the conclusion that senator pickering in 1811 committed violation of the rules of this body60 and that senator tappan in 1844 was gu ilty of flagrant violation of the rules of the senate and di sregard of its authority61 during the floor discussion of the 1844 censure it was stated by member of the select committee examining the matter that the use of express word of disapproval in the previous censure resolution of senator pickering in 1811 wa s evidently designed as mild form of censure62 senators bingham of connecticut in 1929 and mccarthy of wisconsin in 1954 were c ondemned by the full senate in resolution while the

senator watkins of uta h was questioned in colloquy by another member of the select committee concerning the uses of the terms censure and condemn mr case let ask the senator from utah how he refers

the words and condemn in section 1 although the senator from utah still refers to the resolution as censure resolution mr watkins that is difference of semantics some persons believe that condemn is stronger word than censure and some persons believe that censure is stronger word than condemn i do not know which is which66 the select committee and its chairman in the mccarthy censure did not officially distinguish between the meaning of the two terms employed however it is clear that at least one member of the senate at the time felt that the term condemn was the stronger term and that the senator was not necessarily dissuaded from that perception by the select committee chairman67 at present it may be argued that the use of the verb conde mn in censure resolution although not officially distinguished from using any other word in such resolution may be perceived to be somewhat stronger disapproval than merely using the term censure based in large part on the feelings associated with the last senator to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs93875crs14 68 we debated at considerable length the use of the word censure or the word condemn speaking first for myself i was convinced

report that it was using the term denounce in the resolution to distinguish the facts in the talmadge case from those earlier matters in which the senate censured or condemned member so that the co mmittee may express its judgments and recommendations with words that do not depend on analogy to dissimilar historical circumstan ces for interpretation70 the committee report did not expressly explain why the talmadge matter was distinguishable from past matters nor if it considered the term denounce as stronger or weaker than the terms censure or condemn in the additiona l views of senator schmitt in the senate report however the senator argued that the terms are essentia lly equivalent but that the term denounce was employed because only gross neglect of duty of member towards the administration of hi s office affairs was found while the actual wrongdoing was perpetrated by staff such words as reprehensible and denounced have legal or historic precedents for their use as do censured and condemned however they should by viewed now by history as quivalent in meaning to censured but applied to special cases where the fina ncial duties of senatorial office have been subject to gross neglect and where years of illegal activities by subordinates have been overlooked if not encouraged thus even though the committee avoided the use of the word censure and even though the

senator talmadge71 from the full senate consideration of the matter it appears that common opinion was that the term denounce was em ployed to recognize that there were mitigating circumstances involved in the cas and to recognize that it had not been concluded by the committee that the improprieties were engaged in by the senator willfully and with actual knowledge nd thus the term censure would not be used72 the senate select committee on ethics in its report in the matter of senator durenberger did not state an express r eason or justification for using the term denounce rather than censure or conde mn in the resolution it recommended for adoption although the special counsels re port to the committee suggested that the precise verb in censure resolution is not as important as

ethics senator lott of mississippi noted that an amendment offered during committee procedures to subs titute the term censure for denounce was defeated and it was th senators opinion that

twothirds majority does not specify the reasons for such expulsion but does in that same provision state that either house of congress may punish its members for disorderly behavi or article i sec 5 cl 2 some early commentators thus felt that the authority to punish member by way of cen sure or condemnation was thus expressly limited unlike expulsion to cases concerning disorderly or unruly behavior or conduct in c ongress that is conduct which disrupts the institution76 the authority to discipline by way of censure however has come to be recognized and accepted in congressional practice as extending to cases of misconduct even outside of congress which the senate or house finds to be reprehensible and to reflect discredit on the institution and which is therefore worthy of condemnation as stated in srept 2508 83d cong 2d sess 22 1954 by the senate select committee to study censure charges it seems clear that if senator s hould be guilty of reprehensible conduct

its authority to discipline its members by way of expulsi on or censure in the 63rd congress the house judiciary committee described th power of the house to punish for disorderly behavior as power which is full and plenary and may be enforced by summary proceedings it is discretionary in character restricted by limitation except in case of expulsion the requirement of the concurrence of

censure was based upon noncooperation with and abuse of senate committees this discretionary power to punish for di sorderly behavior is vested by the constitution in the house of representa tives and

capacity on the subject permitted and we found that uniformly the legislative history of the united states had tended for serious matters always to use the word censure or the word condemn we found that there was some precedent in the house of representatives in connection with the use of the word reprimand after passing resolution of censure to require the member to present himself at the bar of the house and be publicly reprimanded there by the speaker it has been the custom in the house of representatives in censure resolution to require the member of the house if he is so censured by resolution to come down before the bar and be publicly reprimanded by word of mouth by the speaker however that has never been done in the senate we did not like the idea of doing that members of the senate i will put this in this way as to what we found as to the meaning of reprimand in legislative parlance it just does not mean anything it means what you might call just slap on the wrist it does not carry any weight we looked and looked and looked and we feel certain that our research was complete and therefore we totally rejected for the reason i have given the mild legislative word reprimand which has meaning or means nothing more than just disapproval and put in the word censure which we thought was the mildest of the words that have legislative meaning and would carry the idea of the senate taking stand with reference to the matter85 in the case of senators tillman and mcla urin who were censured by the full senate in 1902 for fighting on the floor of the senate the committee to whom the matter was referred considered the options for the senate including reprimand of the members which it considered only more formal reiteration of an earlier contempt vote and not sufficiently severe found that the conduct should be condemned by the senate and recomme nded resolution which censured the members the committee explained the senate may punish the senators from

representative blanton of texas to the bar of the house and liver to him its reprimand and censure88 more recently however there has come to be distinction in the house whereby it is considered that reprimand involves lesser level of disa pproval of the conduct of member than that of censure and is thus less severe re buke by the institution89 procedurally in the house cen sure resolution will generally instruct the member to go to the well of the house and for the speaker of the house to read the resolution as verbal castigation of th member in the case of reprimand however the resolution is merely adopted by vote of the house90 such procedures are not relevant to the senate which merely adopts censure resolution and does not require member to go to the well for verbal rebuke91 resolution which is adopted by form vote of the senate using the word reprimand would thus ve the same effect and be governed by the same procedures as censure in the senate and might thus possibly be considered as distinction without difference in the nate and technically form of censure as have been the recent denouncements in the senate resolution which uses the word reprimand in the senate althoug h without historical precedent might however be publicly perceived as similar to the modern house practice that is minor rebuke and may arguably be seen by the public as lesser form of

us of senator although there is specific disability that automatically fo llows censure by the senate the public reprobation and formal rebuke by ones p eers in the senate may have arguably

members presen t and voting resolution disapproving of senators conduct is consider ed by parliamentarians nd historians as censure of that member there is precise tec hnical requirement conc erning the required words in resolution of censure nor is th ere an official hierarchy or ranking of terms employed in such resolution th senate has thus censured its members by way of resolution condemning cen suring or denouncing the member or the conduct of the member as well as by way of resolutions which do not include any express term of opprobrium in prac tice and perception however although there is official ranking or fficially recognized hierarchy of terms employed it may be contended that the connotati on of the verb condemn in censure resolution is more severe than the term censure based in large part on the association of the term condemn with the discipline imposed by the senate on the late senator joseph mccarthy while the connotati on of the term denounce in censure resolution may be one of less severe form of censu re because of exte nuating or mitigating circumstances that have been recognized in past disciplinary actions adopting that particular term the authority and grounds for censure extend to misconduct which may or may not violate an express statute or written senate ethics rule the full senate has thus censured members when the conduct was f ound to be
