introduction the mk 32 mod 2 advanced radiographic system hereafter referred to as ars is fully digital xray imaging system designed to rapidly acquire radioscopic images in the field and provide image enhancement tools to facilitate image evalua tion the system consists of controller an imager and interconnecting cables though image acquisition is fast and uncomplicated image quality is excellent image manipulation capabilities range from simple to sophisticated and accommodate variety of applications images are stored on disk in an industrystandard format that can be readily manipulated and annotated by third party software 11 safety information operating precautions the xray generator used with the ars produces radiation that can be harmful to personnel it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the ars is properly used by trained personnel who follow recommended operating procedures and applicable regulations the following safety precautions are recommended by the xray generator supplier and saic operating personnel should review and follow applicable regulations see appendix cpersonnel in the vicinity of the system may be required to wear an approved radiation monitoring device when the system is being operated see appendix cpersonnel should stand at safe distance from the xray generator and remain outside the direct beam during image acquisition however if personnel cann ot be kept outside of the beam angle they should at least remain 5 meters away from the xray generator see figure 11although the xray beam angle is only 40 degrees as safety precaution all personnel should stand at least 15 meters away from the xray generator outside the beam angle the radiation dose measured outside the direct x ray generator beam is negligible see figure 11the control units interlock key should be turned to the off position when not acquiring the xray generator cannotfor official use only for official use onlyfire when the control units key is in the off position the xray generators power key should be turned to the off position when not acquiring images the xray generator cannot fire when the key is in the off position the system operator should remove the control unit and xray generator keys when not operating the system to ensure that the system is not accidentally or improperly operated fcc compliance this equipment has been tested and found in compliance with the limits for class digital device pursuant to part 15 of the fcc rules these limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference when the equipment is operated in commercial environment this equipment generates and can radiate frequency energy and if not installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual may cause interference to radio communications operation of this equipment in residential area may cause interference which is the responsibility of the user to correct changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance could void the users authority to operate the equipment note this product was fcc verified under test conditions that included the use of shielded andor filtered io cables and connectors between system components to comply with fcc regulations the user must use shielded cables and connectors and install them properly chapter 2 setup and operation setup of the ars figure 21 is simple task that can be accomplished by single individual in less than five minutes the compact size of the versatile ars allows it to be used as portable system with the system set up around the target object or as stationary system with items placed in front of the imager once the system has been assembled images can be acquired and viewed immediately cabling is provided with the standard system that allows for the control unit to be located as far as 100meters away from the imaging area 21 component overview control unit the control unit figure 22 figure 23 and figure 24 is fully integrated system comprised of pentium processor flat panel display with powersave feature internal hard drive 14 mbyte floppy disk drive and modem packaged in lightweight carrying case xray generator and imager when acquiring an image the imager and xray generator should be positioned as shown in figure 25 or figure 26 below the target object should be positioned so that it is as close as possible to the imagers conversion screen face which is denoted by the white rectangular outline on the flat side of the imager the xray generator should be positioned approximately 60 cm from the imager with its beam centered on and perpendicular to the imager facefor official use only for official use onlycaution the knobs on the imager must be loosened prior to moving the handle if the knobs are not loosened prior to adjusting or moving the handle the imager may be damaged this would require return of the unit for repair this configuration may be appropriate when evaluating objects on the ground that cannot or should not be moved the imager is oriented so that its face is located as close to the ground as possible the imager handle is used to support the imager so that its face is nearly vertical the xray generator is set on the ground or slightly elevated so that the xray generators beam is centered on the imagers conversion screen in figure 26 the imager is oriented so that the bottom of the conversion screen is11cm above the ground surface the xray generator must be elevated for the xray generators beam to be centered on the screen 22 setup procedures 1 remove the ars components from the shipping containers 2 place the control unit on desktop or other stable work area as far from the imaging area as is practical 3 place the imager as close to the object to be imaged as possible refer to the previous xray generator and imager section for more information 4 place the xray generator level with and perpendicular to the imagers screen verify the xray generators exposure selector led at the back of the inspector 200handle is 99 pulses 5 run the 3meter gray cable from the appropriate connector on the xray generator to the appropriate connector on the imager this gray cable passes signals from the imager to the generator 6 run the 20meter black colorcoded cable from the appropriate connector on the imager to the connector identified as imager on the control unit this cable supplies power to the imager carries the xray generator control signal and routes the image back to the control unit caution when unreeling the cable be sure to grasp the cable rather than the connector and unreel the cable before connecting the cable to either the imager or the control unit 7 the golden engineering inspector 200 xray generator is battery operated insert an operable battery 8 the ars control unit can plugged into 110 vac 60 hz or 220 vac 50 hz power outlet using the power cable provided to an external 9528 vdc generator or can be battery operated 9 the xray generator power key must be turned to the on position before x rays can be producedfor official use only for official use only10 the control units interlock key must be turned to standby before any x rays can be produced 11 make sure that all personnel adhere to applicable radiation safety distance recommendations for field operation see chapter 1 for more information 23 power considerations the ars is configured with powersaving feature that will make the screen blank after period of two to four minutes of nonusage of the system pressing the shift key or moving the mouse will reactivate the screen do not press any other key as it may perform an undesirable function the ars control unit will automatically switch between internal battery us standard110 vac and international standard 220 vac line power the system is frequency insensitive between 45 and 65 hertz the control unit also powers the ars imager therefore special power consideration is required for the imager the ars control unit can directly accept external dc power input that is connected to the control units connector labeled dc in see figure 23 also an optional 3 meter cable part vbc12 is available that connects the control unit to 12 vdc automobile cigarette lighter receptacle lastly an optional cable with battery clip ends is available for connecting the control unit to an external battery the golden engineering inspector 200 xray generator is powered by rechargeable144 vdc internal battery pack refer to the manufacturers operation manual for more information 24 battery power considerations 108volt rechargeable battery is located in the hinged compartment below the keyboard of the control unit fully charged battery permits about 60 minutes of operation the battery in the control unit will automatically begin recharging as soon as the unit is plugged into line power outlet and will take approximately 8 hours to completely recharge for instructions on using the span drc221535 recharger see appendix the control unit does not need to be powered on for the battery to recharge to access the battery compartment first loosen do not remove the two thumb screws in the front of the hinged battery compartment panel see figure 24 the compartment swings open from the top to remove the battery pull the fabric battery lifting strap and the battery will lift out to install battery first note the slots in the battery and align them with the metal flanges in the battery compartment put the slotted end of the battery in first then glide the battery horizontally until the flanges enter the slots and the battery drops into the recessed battery holder caution improper insertion of the battery while difficult is possible and can render the system useless if the battery connector is bent please be careful when inserting the battery the external battery charger can charge optional spare batteries outside the control unit fully recharging discharged battery with an external rapid charger takes about 3 hours table 22 provides information about the battery charge indicator and the led charge status of the battery caution when the red led starts to flash images should be saved and the system should be shut down immediatelyfor official use only for official use only25 the main menu when power to the control unit is turned on the computer will automatically enter the rs softwares main menu which is in familiar windowsbased st yle sho wn in figure 27 the system is then ready for imaging 26 acquiring an image to acquire an image click on acquire on the main menu this activates the pulldown menu shown in figure 28 figure 29 shows dialog box that contains warning ensure the radiation area is clear before proceeding to remind the user to clear the imaging area of personnel before proceeding 27 editing an image after acquiring an image the user can then select other pulldown menu options to enhance or edit the image if the image just acquired is under or overexposed or the features of interest in the image are not properly oriented for definitive evaluation another image may be acquired after adjusting the exposure duration or rearranging the placement of the xray generator or imager relative to the target object resetting the xray pulses option in the acquire dialog box refer to chapter4 on imaging techniques will help with acquiring better image an acquired image can be visually enhanced using the functions found in the modify pulldown menu most images will benefit from the modify enhancements offered in the modify menu the options under the annotate pulldown menu can be used to label or comment on features of interest or to date and title the image note that image data and time are kept with the image header visible via the show header info menu option once the quality of the image is satisfactory the image can be stored to hard disk or floppy disk using the options found in the file pulldown menu chapter 3 the ars menu options 31 the main menu as each menu bar function is selected the definition of each selection is displayed left of the status bar at the bottom of the screen refer back to figure 27 to review the diagram of the control unit display screen the left side of the status bar shows specific function keys or key combinations and the action they initiate the middle of the status bar indicates which of the two images original or modified buffers is currently displayed the right side provides information on cursor location in pixels and pixel gray scale value image brightness at that location many of the functions on the menu bar and pulldown menus have corresponding icons located in the icon toolbar along the right side of the screen table 31 lists the functions starting from the first menu item and the corresponding options for accessing that particular function 32 the acquirefunction acquire an acquire request can be canceled at any point by selecting cancel or pressing the esc key twice this will return the user to the main menu when the acquire option table 32 is selected the xray generator pulses after the preset time delay and an image is acquired the system then returns to the main menu and the image is displayed on the screen figure 31when delay timer value other than 0 seconds has been set message box appears on the display with counter that counts downfor official use only for official use onlythe preset number of seconds see figure32 cancel may be selected to abort image acquisition at any point during the count down once the delay timer has been changed that value becomes the new default the delay timer value automatically resets to 0 when the program is restarted golden engineering recommends not firing more than 99 pulses in fiveminute period to minimize the likelihood of the xra tube overheating in the inspector 200 or thexr200 xray generators sum the sum function can be used to accumulate more than 99 pulses for an image the first image is taken then sum is used to collect subsequent image and then it is added to the existing image and may be repeated as the operator desires this is useful when the object being imaged is thick or made of material denser than typical objects selecting fire and sum xray captures the first image the acquire dialog box appears again automatically if the first image was adequate select cancel if not set the option values and select fire and sum xray again this will add the two images together caution golden engineering recommends not firing more than 99 pulses in fiveminute period to minimize the likelihood of the xray tube overheating in the inspector 200 or the xr200 xray generators 33 the file menu open to retrieve previously stored image from the hard drive or floppy disk select openfrom the file menu when open is selected dialog box is displayed on the screen as shown in figure 33 select the desired file by double clicking on the filename or by clicking on the filename then clicking open the file may also be selected via the tab arrow and return keys when the enable preview box is selected thumbnail image of the file will be displayed quick save the quick save option allows images to be stored without specifying filename the system selects an automatic filename which is function of the system date and time specifically the first two numbers in the filename will refer to the day of the month the next two will be the hour of the day the next two will be the minute and the final two will be the second this is done to minimize the possibility that two images will have the same name it is recommended that the image files be renamed as soon as possible after they have been stored so that they can be given filenames that are more descriptive than the computer generated names select quick save dialog box appears with the automatic filename and the option to save or cancel by selecting yes or figure 34 save as to store an image see table 33 on the hard drive or floppy disk under userspecified filename select save as when this option is selected dialog box is displayed on the screen as shown in figure 35 select the desired location for the file and provide descriptive name then select ok or cancel note the new directories may be created within this window via the icon with the folder and the asterisk the folder with the arrow ascends directory and the iconfor official use only for official use onlyon the right shows the dates and time for the tests listed please save all files in tiff format to maintain compatibility and to preserve all the ancillary data with the images print selecting the print function activates the print dialog box set options for printing as in normal windows applications figure 36 print setup the print setup dialog box provides the user with format options for the printed output options for printing setup are as in normal windows app lications figure 37 exit when exit is selected the ars program is terminated all unsaved buffers are discarded 34 the display menu the options provided in the display menu allow images to be enhanced so that evaluation is easier none of the functions in the display menu will change the image permanently figure 38 shows the main menu with the display pulldown menu activated zoom when zoom is selected dialogue box appears with three sizing option s selecting the options x1 x2 or x4 will enlarge the image by factor of one or two or four scroll bars will appear on the right and bottom of the screen for panning and scrolling through the image to zoom back or unzoom the user has three options select zoom and x1 select the magnifying glass icon containing the minus sign and click on the image or use the page down key on the key board palettes selecting any of the palette options changes the display colors of the images these color schemes may improve the appearance of details and therefore make the evaluation of the image easier figure 39 default this option return the image to positive view of the image inverted grayscale this option provides negative view of the image figure 310 inverted rainbow this option provides reversedcolor view of the image rainbow this option provides colored view of the imagefor official use only for official use onlyautostretch this option allows the ars processor to adjust automatically the brightness and contrast of the image it will select settings that frequently maximize image clarity contrast stretch this function is used to change the distribution of the color or graylevels of the image dialog box will appear on the screen over the image this will contain histogram with two thin blue bars located along its left and right sides the histogram is graphical display showing intensity along the horizontal axis and their corresponding number of pixels with that intensity along the vertical axis image contrast and brightness can be altered by adjusting the location of the blue bars within the histogram figure 311 the blue bars can be repositioned along the horizontal axis using several methods the position of an individual blue bar can be changed by clicking once on the bar moving the mouse to the left or right to the desired position and then clicking second time both bars can be moved simultaneously to capture more precise array within the histogram by clicking once within the blue bars and then using the arrow keys to move the selected area along the horizontal axis contrast stretch does not change the original data in the display memory buffer this allows the user to exit the contrast stretch function with the appropriate contrast values still in effect and continue to acquire new images and perform other tasks note contrast stretch and grayscale invert act only on the displayed image when images are stored to disk the underlying data will not be stretched or inverted and the original appearance may be restored by selecting the default pallet grid overlay ars provides two methods for measuring the size and location of features of interest in the displayed image the grid overlay function overlays onecm square grid on the screen over the image figure 312 this allows the user to quickly estimate device dimensions and determine the positioning of device components within package distance measurement the distance measurement function allows the user to place two points and measures the distance between the cursors in inches or centimeters by selecting distance crosshair cursor appears move this cursor to the desired first location and click to set the position next moves the cursor to the second location as the cursor is moved to the second point mobile line is displayed second click sets the second mark and the distance between the two set points is displayed in message box as shown in figure 313 show this function gives two options by selecting image header box appears on the screen that displays the date and time that the particular image was acquired it also shows the serial number of the control unit used and whether the image has been modified or not figure 314cumulative pulse count displays the total number of pulses fired by the xray generator since the last reset figure 315 this can be usedfor official use only for official use onlyto give an indication of remaining battery or xray tube life there is an option to reset the count this should be used when new xray tube is installed see the xray generator operators manual for more details the expected life of the tube in the golden engineering xr200 is 35000 pulses note the cumulative pulse count function records the number of pulses requested not the number actually fired switch buffers there are two image memory buffers in ars the original image data acquired by the system are stored in the original buffer the image resulting from processing is stored in the modified buffer alternating between the two buffers is done with the switch buffers function the current buffer on the display is highlighted in the status bar clear buffer this function erases the image located in the display buffer clearing the display 35 the modify menu the processing functions in the modify menu irreversibly change the data in the images these functions act on the original image data located in the original buffer and produce modified image which is in turn stored in the modified buffer the buffer being displayed is automatically switched from the displayed buffer to the displayed buffer when these functions are performed modified image can be saved to floppy disk independent of the original raw data figure 316 region of interest roi processing when roi processing is activated the cursor changes to crosshair clicking moving the crosshair and clicking again on the image defines the regionofinterest roi enhancement functions can then be applied and will only affect the roi when this function is selected the display and modify functions are applied to the data in the selected roi rather than on the whole image figure 317 shows the roi toolbar below title labels have been provided here to identify the icons annotate the annotate function allows for the addition of text and lines to the displayed image when text is selected another submenu appears which gives the option of selecting either black or white text dialog box is then displayed allowing text to be entered rectangle showing the text is then displayed together with hand cursor this cursor allows positioning of the text rectangle the text is placed in white or black rectangle background so that it is always visible independent of the shade of the background an example of black text on white background is shown in figure 318 below the lines option allows straight lines to be drawn on the displayed image once lines is selected the same color option of black or white can be made and across hair cursor appears move this cursor to the desired first location and set the first point by clicking once next move the cursor to the second location as the cursor is moved to the second point rubberband line is displayed between the first point and the current location of the cursor second click sets the second mark and the line is drawn between the two set points as shown in figure 319for official use only for official use onlysharpen this operation makes edges pronounced and can improve the resolution of the image it makes lines and edges in an image much more defined there are three options to this function fine moderate and extreme the fine option will slightly sharpen the image and can be used when subtle adjustment is necessary the moderate option is more obvious and improves the clarity of the image without drastically increasing the apparent noise level for an explanation of noise see the following page the extreme filter will dramatically increase the sharpness of the image but becau the noise will also be increased in the processed image it produces grainy effectfigu re 320 smooth these filters essentially produce the opposite effect of the sharp functions the filters smooth out edges producing slightly smoother softer image reducing speckle and noise as with the sharpen function there are three options fine moderate and extreme the moderate option also has an icon button and function key applying one of the smooth filters will slightly reduce the resolution of an image figure 321 noise reduction this function has three options in its submenu average median and despeckle noise in an image is pixels with randomly distributed brightness levels noise reduction will help filter out problem areas such as spots in an image average replaces the center pixel of threebythree array with the average of those nine pixels median replaces the center pixel of the threebythree array with the median value of those nine pixels despeckle removes 1pixel speckle from the image and shrinks some larger speckles figure 322 edge detect this function has three options horizontal vertical and diagonal as each option is selected those particular edges in the image will be displayed as white lines on black background this tool may be helpful in locating items with characteristic shapes in cluttered image by removing the shading and features figure 323 shows the same image of pipe bomb with the horizontal edges in the image shown in white the menu is also selected to show its location and options emboss this function will make an image appear raised or stamped by suppressing the shading within the image and tracing its edges with black or white figure 324 add images the add images feature allows the user to add images together to enhance the users ability to discern objects within dense containers or housings this feature is useful when the highest pulse rate setting 99 provides dim image this feature allows the user to add multiple 99 pulse images together the user must begin the add images process with the original image located within the original buffer and the image to be added located within the modified buffer the user may switch between thefor official use only for official use onlybuffers using the f7 key while viewing the original buffer select the add images function to add the images together the resulting image appears in the modified buffer to view the combined images select the automatic stretch function from the display menu automatic stretch should make the image viewable most of the time note the add images function clips the maximum pixel intensity to 255 subtract images the complement of the add images function the subtract images feature allows the user to subtract images from one another this feature can be used to remove systeminduced artifacts in images by taking background image and subtracting the image of the object the user must begin the subtract images process with the original image located within the original buffer and the image to be subtracted located within the modified buffer the user may switch between the buffers using the f7 key while viewing the original buffer select the subtract images function to subtract the images the resulting image appears in the modified buffer to view the combined images select the automatic stretch function from the display menu automatic stretch should make the image viewable most of the time note the subtract images function truncates resultant pixels that would be less than zero to zero histogram equalize this function makes nonlinear change to the image to enhance more subtle details than auto contrast it automatically adjusts the brightness of pixels to balance the brightness across the range of brightness within an image to enhance visual interpretation figure 325 in some cases histogram equalize may provide better enhancement of the image than auto contrast rotate image this function allows the image to be rotated three options are available within rotate image 180 degrees allows the image to be rotated 180 degand is useful when the image was acquired with the imager set upside down figure 326 flip leftright and flip topbottom are additional options to reflect the image lefttoright or toptobottom 36 the preferences menu the preferences pulldown menu allows the user to alter the behavior of the user interfaces figure 327 shows the preferences pulldown menu checkmark next to each menu item indicates whether or not the item is activated checks next to the menu items indicate they are selected as preferences icon bar this option shows or hides the icon toolbar located at the top of the screen just below the main menu bar removal of this toolbar allows more of the image to be viewed without scrolling or panning the system will revert to showing the icon bar when the application is restarted status bar this option shows or hides the status bar which is located across the bottom of thefor official use only for official use onlyscreen the system will revert to showing the icon bar when the application is restarted distance in cm this option toggles between measurement units in centimeters or inches to suit user preference the system will retain this user preference when the application is restarted the distance measurement and grid overlay are affected by this setting buffer protection this option turns the buffer protection on and off check mark indicates its status when on the system will prompt when buffer is about to be discarded before that buffer has been saved when not on warnings are given the system will retain the buffer protection on when the system is restarted invert all images this option allows the user to select negative or positive view of the images check mark indicates its status the system will revert to noninvert function when the system is restarted automatic stretch all choosing this option sets ars preferences to automatically optimize the contrast of the all displayed images to manually set the contrast for individual images use contrast stretch under the menu option the system reverts to the nonautomatic stretch when the system is restarted 37 the help menu the help pulldown menu allows the user to display information on system operation help selecting the help function brings up dialogue box containing the contents of this user manualfigure 328 key map key map when this function is selected message box containing list of the function keys with their corresponding functions is displayed on the screen as shown in figure 329 about this function activates message box containing information on the ars software version installed on the system figure 330 chapter 4 imaging techniques 41 target density and exposure duration exposure duration the ars figure 41 allows the user to adjust the xray exposure duration number of pulses before acquiring an image this is useful when the target objects vary byfor official use only for official use onlythickness and composition the xray generators exposure duration is adjusted using the xray pulses input field of the acquire function dialog box as described in chapter 2 the default acquisition of 7 pulses should be used when imaging very thin or lightweight objects which do not readily absorb xrays longer exposure time settings higher number of pulses should be used if the target object is not sufficiently penetrated with 17 pulses the xray pulses feature allows the operator to gradually add pulses to captured image until the object is sufficiently penetrated refer to chapter 3 for more information about the sum function setting the xray pulses higher than necessary will result in saturated pure white image or saturated areas of the image to avoid this set the xray pulses to lower exposure setting then increase or decrease it as necessary to achieve bright image that is free of saturation an insufficiently long exposure time for an object will result in dark image that provides little or information about the internal structure or content of the object note the best way to achieve satisfactory image is to refer to the histogram contrast stretch feature under the display menu if the histogram graph is bunched to the left the number of pulses should be increased if the histogram graph is bunched to the right it is likely that the number of pulses was set too high distance another more subtle method for adjusting the target xray illumination is to vary the distance between the xray generator and the imager although distance of approximately 60 to 90 cm between the xray generator and imager is recommended to provide sharp proportional image this separation distance can be decreased to penetrate thicker or denser materials regardless of the distance between the xray generator and imager it is always best to place the object as close to the center of the imager screen as possible which will result in maximum penetration and resolution note an object located between the xray generator and imager will produce an enlarged image this is because xrays are emitted radially out from small spot diverging and the xray shadow of the object is projected onto the imager screen therefore the further the object is away from the imager and the closer it is to the generator the larger its projection and consequently the larger its features will appear in the acquired image objects that are closer to the imager will more closely reflect their true dimensions objects that are further from the imager will measure larger than they actually are objects such as thick wood and aluminum thin steel thin plastic or card board enclosures can be imaged easily by adjusting the distance between generator and imager and varying the exposure duration settings the add images function allows the operator to add separately acquired images together to overcome the xray generators limit of 99 pulses this increases the systems ability to image steel and other denser materials 42 xray beam filtering xray generator beam filters may be used to enhance the quality resolution andfor official use only for official use onlycontrast of the image thus improving the visibility of subtle features filter is generally thin metal sheet placed over the xray generators beam aperture this filter by absorption and scatter removes fraction of the low energy xrays that may be contributing to image noise due to scattering the type and thickness of the filter used depends on the thickness and composition of the imaged object examples of recommended beam filters for thin or lightweight objects 012 025 mm copper filter 051 0762 mm a1uminum filter examples of recommended beam filters for denser materials 051 mm copper filter 127 mm aluminum filter chapter 5 procedures

measurements c1 introduction saics ars xray inspection system uses golden engineering inspector 200 xray generator this device emits xradiation which can be harmful to people if theyfor official use only for official use onlyreceive excessive exposures the use of such systems is regulated by both state and federal regulations the use of xray generators outside of cabinets and shielded rooms to form images of objects is termed field radiography most states require operators of such systems to be trained in and demonstrate an understanding of the following subjects characteristics of xradiation units of radiation dose radiation hazards radiation levels from radiation machines methods of controlling radiation exposure time distance and shielding use of radiation survey instruments operation calibration and limitations radiation survey techniques characteristics and use of personnel monitoring equipment use of radiation machines in radiography c2 dose measurements inspector 200 xray generator dose measurements can be made using integrating ionization chambers film badges pocket ionization chambers picsthermo luminescent dosimeters tlds because these measure the energy liberated in the detector from the time the instrument was zeroed inspector 200 xray generator dose measurements cannot be made using pulse counting instruments such as geigermueller gm tube these instruments will only count one event in the short time 50 nanoseconds of the xray pulse survey meters such as an ion chamber operating in dose rate mode the time responses of these survey meters are too slow to measure the dose delivered to the instrument in the relevant time frame radiation dose measurements were made around the ars xray inspection system using victoreen 450b survey meter operated in the integration mode an inspector 200 xray generator the processor to the inspector 200 was used for these measurements the xray unit was set to capture images at the default 17 pulses per image the generator and imager were separated by 69 cm images were taken to assess the dose rate received by the survey meter while it was directly in the beam in addition scattered dose was measured while 10 x 10 cm oak timber was directly in the beam the oak timber provides reasonable upper estimate of the scattered radiation metallic objects will produce roughly the same amount of scattered radiation but will absorb more of it giving smaller amount of scattered radiation than the highdensity oak the survey meter was first zeroed by turning the unit off the meter was then turned on and the instrument placed in the integrate mode when the meter reached dose of more than 1 mr it was rezeroed by turning the meter off the incremental dose recorded in the integrate mode is 10 r for readings less than 1 mr and 1 mr for readings greater than 1 mrthe dose per exposure was calculated by subtracting the reading before the exposure from the reading after the exposure measurements made in the beam resulted in dose of 10 mr per image at distance of69 cm from the generator and 17 pulses per image this corresponds to dose rate of31 mr per pulse at 30 cm from the generator this dose is consistent with the dose of 35 mr per pulse at 30 cm from the generator reported by gei this agreement confirms that the survey meter operated in the integrate mode is measuring the dose correctly the meter is normally calibrated while operating in the dose rate configuration it should be noted that victoreen 450p survey meter cannot be used to measure doses out of the beamthe dose rate outside of the beam was measured by exposing 10 x 10 cm oak timber directly in front of the imager to produce scattered radiation data were obtained by forming images of the wood and using the dosimeter in the integrate mode it appears that the radiation scattered from the wood dominates the measured dose to investigate the shielding effectiveness of normal interior walls to the penetration of the scattered radiation the dose was first measured with shielding present two 127 cm thickfor official use only for official use onlysheets of drywall material were then inserted between the generator and scatterer and the detector the dose per image decreased by factor of 2 normal walls will also include wood framing and other interior material such as electrical cabling and normally will be at an angle to the scattered radiation factor of 2 reduction in the scattered dose caused by normal interior walls should be conservative estimate concrete walls will provide much greater attenuation one can estimate that 10 cm thick concrete wall will reduce the transmitted dose by factor of 50 attenuation 002 c3 legal dose limitations occupational exposures an occupationally exposed individual is limited to receiving 5 rem of radiation per year if the operator remains over 18 meters from the objects being inspected it the operator would need to take more than 1000000 images in year to reach the legal limit for occupationally exposed personnel for minors the occupational dose limits are 10 of the annual dose limits for adult workers for declared pregnant workers the dose to an embryofetus during the entire pregnancy must not exceed 500 mrem furthermore reasonable effort must be made to ensure that exposures to declared pregnant workers are essentially uniform throughout the pregnancy general public the dose limit for uncontrolled areas is 2 mrem in any one hour and 100 mrem in year it was shown above that it is fairly easy to obtain 2 mrem in the beam in short periods of time it was also shown that it would only take 5 images at distance of 3 meters or 10 images if there is an intervening interior wall to reach this level at distance of 18 meters from the scatterer out of the main beam it would take 2300 images to reach the 2 mr dose limit see table 5 alara in addition to the legal limits mentioned above both state and federal laws require that radiation doses to both occupationally exposed individuals and to the general public be held to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable alara if it is reasonably easy for an operator to stand behind wall when he is making exposures this must be done in addition if shield is reasonably easy to incorporate into setup it must be included it should be noted however that the operator must maintain control of the region of the xray beam out to distance of at least 15 meters from the generator when the generator is fired this will impose some limits on where the operator can be positioned c4 monitoring all of the states in the us control the use of xray generators additionally the fda regulates the use of xray generators in cabinets and shielded rooms most states require that personnel radiation dosimeters be provided to and used by all personnel who conduct field radiography most states also require that physical radiation surveys be performed for each set up and that the results of these surveys be recorded it is likely that twopoint radiation survey would be sufficient if one has survey meter like the victoreen450b c5 utilization log each user must maintain records of the use of the xray source this utilization logfor official use only for official use onlymust include the name and serial number of the machine the location date and the identity of the individual operator for each use the number of images produced or the number of pulses produced for each use refer to the sample utilization log shown on the following page c6 source registration most us states require that users of xray sources such as the inspector 200 xray generator used in the ars register these sources with the department of health saic strongly recommends that all purchasers of xray sources regardless of the state or country where they are located pursue registration of these devices with the appropriate local agency c7 references a1 radiological health handbook bureau of radiological health 1970 us department of health education and welfare bureau of radiological health rockville maryland p 151 152 c8 dose control tables table c81 lists the conditions that are necessary to restrict the dose at the indicated positions to less than 2 mr column 1 gives the number of images that the operator expects to take in given location the second column lists the distance along the beam path and 20deg cone around the beam centerline that must be controlled to ensure that all regions outside of this region receive less than 2 mr the third column lists the thickness of concrete that one would need to have behind the imager 9 meters from the generator for the region in back of the wall to be considered as uncontrolled the fifth column yields the thickness of lead that would have to be placed over an interior wall to allow the area behind the wall to be considered as uncontrolled table c82 is similar to tables c81 except it lists the conditions that are necessary to restrict the dose at the indicated positions to less than 100 mr figurec1shows the ars safety zones c9 state radiation safety contact list alabama kirk whatley director division of radiation control state department of public
