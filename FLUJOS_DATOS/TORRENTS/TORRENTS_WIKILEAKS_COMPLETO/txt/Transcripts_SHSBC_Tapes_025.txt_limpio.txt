today i get on this automatic outflow of giving you the date audience the 29th the 29th but what year audience ad 11 thats the right year ad 11 all right 29 june ad 11 and here we go with the saint hill briefing course and boy i tell you how do you manage i mean to say how do you manage anyway i gave talk earlier which some of you heard about wrong target wrong target and ive said since 1947 really and youll find it in the original thesis the auditor plus the pcs analytical mind versus the reactive mind tsk you win the pc versus his own reactive mind nyaaah the auditor versus the pc analytical mind nyaaaah it takes the auditor and the pcs analytical mind to whip the pcs reactive mind did you ever see any any steam locomotives or electric locomotives or so forth go over to grade they keep hooking locomotives on you know they cant pull the slope up to the high hills of birmingham or something so they put an extra locomotive on did you ever see anybody do that did you ever hear of that all right thats the same thing as auditing is youre hooking on an extra locomotive but why why hmm why would you hook on an extra locomotive well its because the locomotive that is on the train cant make it its one of these horribly obvious things see the locomotive thats on the train cant pull the grade so you hook another locomotive on and they pull the grade all right as long as your target is the pcs analytical mind youre not going to win if youre trying to clear his analytical mind it will take you 75 hours to do security check 295 hours to do an sop goals assessment you get the idea i mean scientology will work even in spite of that if you want to know what the drag factor is its just that one wrong target i had letter from peter williams today hes halfway round the bend thats pretty good for clear thats where the auditors have got him he cant figure out what theyre doing see i mean he cant figure out what theyre doing you know well ive had lots of experience i can always figure out what youre doing not only figure out the human mind you have to figure out what the auditors doing because in all honesty and in all decency and trying like mad and through willfulness on his own part he gets the wrong curve on something and all of sudden this fantastic amount of time begins to occur tremendous amounts of auditing begin to elapse processes which would ordinarily work dont work well whats wrong whats wrong theres breakdown here in understanding of some kind or another whenever this occurs you see that all right williams had tremendously successful course he made clear he made couple of them as matter of fact down in australia and it was small feat he was doing fine and all of sudden i get dispatch from him today and hes going wha well id almost lost hope and then i got one of your tapes and im going in again and so forth but this exact i got telex today from london and herbie says that the auditors cant get any sec checking done in running routine 1 because its taking them two and three hours to clear the rudiments well all right theres another one just curve misapplication but its very simple thing hes asking for an extraordinary solution which is wipe out the rudiments on the model session used for sec checking or at least wipe out part of them thats an extraordinary solution see you get driven to the wall think of an extraordinary solution and the next thing you know youre not doing scientology you got the idea thats the ordinary course of human events now ken was asking yesterday about how do you spot do troubleshooting and i told him the first big big pinnacle here of troubleshooting was what the hell is going on i mean thats the big one you know because there youre up against tremendous amount of alteris and countercreate people are trying hard theyre not being vicious about it they are understanding it to the best of their ability and so forth all right youre in the same situation when youre doing something like that that i was with in with regard to life when i was trying to figure this thing out see heres life with this tremendous facade of the supermystery and how you mustnt penetrate it and you cant and all of this sort of thing you see and just wasnt anything you could do about it and all of these weird propositions well thats because theres so doggone much alteris and so darn much countercreate that the truth of what life was all about had been totally obscured you got the idea so naturally in relaying communication about the simplicities of life these things get restimulated and people begin to look around corners you know when actually the cop is standing right in the middle of the sidewalk so they go and peer around the corner and they look up and down alleys and they come back and forth to look up and down the road and then turn around and bump into the cop hes been there all the time just failure to observe some fundamental so dont feel bad if you do this sort of thing because look ive been over this ground i can tell you that i did it constantly and continually thats what life was doing in trying to sort out any of its secrets they werent secrets they were obfuscations there is secret about life it is just the fact that life is surrounded by alteris and obfuscations to such degree that you cant see life you know the fellow cant get his job done because there are so many other things to do this is rather typical you find this in organizations you look around and you say now look we want the halls clean something elementary want the halls clean you see and want the place to look nice you know public come in and all that and the fellow has been hired just to clean the halls you see and there he is cleaning the halls and you think and you come in one morning and you wade through the dust over your shoe soles you see and the next morning its over your toes and the next morning its around your petticoats and the next morning its getting around the waist you can hardly get into the joint you see for scrap paper and you finally say what the hell is going on here we have fellow who is supposed to be cleaning halls well whats he doing and you ask him what are you doing well i cant do that i havent got time to do that but that is your job yeah but i havent got time to do that well whats happening well actually i have to run all these errands and i have to mail and i have to this and i have to that and you say mail what are you talking about we have man over in the mail room thats supposed to take care of mail yeah i know but hes so busy addressing and stamping now look weve got somebody over in the in the in the address department thats supposed to be addressing and stamping and well yes and you go over to the address department and you say why arent you addressing and stamping and they say well we just have to clean these halls and we you see data starts breaking down you see and it goes into concatenation and the first thing you know nobody can do his job because hes too busy and then you dont have any organization you see and its pretty wild when you look at it that way so thats what happens when you try to relay or communicate data about life life is sort of like that you know the government today is doing basically the work of charity organizations well they are thats what socialism is socialism is that perversion of government to point where all social activities and charity activities are undertaken by the government you see and they dont do any governing try to get suit tried itll cost you ten thousand pounds and itll take you about two or three years and so forth but now wait minute thats the business of government justice you try to walk down soho about three oclock in the morning and come out of it unscathed right in the middle of london thats rather adventurous undertaking not as bad as it was perhaps but its fairly adventurous even yet well what happens why well the government is so busy being social worker you see it hasnt any time to arrest anybody or take care of the law get the idea cant cant round up criminals well why cant it round up criminals well because they have to send them to jail what has sending them to jail got to do with handling crime well were not quite sure but thats the way its done but of course we cant send them to jail because as soon as we try to send them to jail this is washington dc which has the highest crime rate i think in the world including port said right now you see thats an interesting comment on government you know i mean that its capital city has the worlds highest crime rate thats really getting there you know heres the center of law and order which has the worlds highest crime rate fantastic you cant get the cops over there to arrest anybody they wont arrest anybody and the reason they wont arrest anybody is the people bug out and bug out is new cop piece of slang meaning they go up they get sentenced to st elizabeth by reason of insanity you see they parked overtime by reason of insanity you see and the judge psychiatrist rushes in rushes him over to st elizabeths they spend few days in st elizabeths and theyre released without any punishment at all and the cops have gotten to point where they just wont do their job thats all why thats because the government is so deeply enmeshed in social work that it hasnt any time to govern you see now it isnt that the government is accomplishing government with social work actually it isnt because in good government production rises the people are more prosperous various other things are always attendant to good government and yet none of these things are occurring thats because the government is so busy doing something else the government is attacking everybody who produces which is an interesting thing for government to do just get in business and youll find the government setting up the lewis machine guns on your doorstep see i dont care whether youre putting yourself into business of fixin shoes or fixin skulls same thing all right this is the offpostness of it its all off post get the idea well where youre living in world where nearly everything is off post everything is trying to force you to wear its hat you see and if you didnt watch it youd simply inherit all the hats there were and for instance if we didnt watch it in the course of the next two decades we would be wearing the hat called government particularly if i continue to keep overts going against it and that isnt my job and it isnt anybody elses job around here you see but heres heres the thing i mean everybody wants you to wear his hat and youre wearing everybody elses hats and so on all right now lets see how we can shortcircuit this so we didnt keep getting off the groove and that is to say in an hgc or an auditing team or any activity in scientology the person who is on the ground observes person who is on the ground observes dont ask other people who are off the ground to do your observation for you i love herbie dearly but to send telex yes hes in trouble but he didnt observe he didnt go down and look he couldnt have he leaves in position where i have to surmise you see what hes doing and because he hasnt looked then i sort of interiorize into his hat you see he sort of he yanks my anchor points out thirtynine miles get the idea and then i have to figure out well i can by experience fortunately for him but i have to figure out what his auditor is doing see what are they doing thats taking two or three hours well in the first place innumerable mistakes are being made the first is that person on routine 1 is not supposed to respond particularly or is not expected to respond particularly to think processes and youre going to run two or three hours of think processes on somebody instead of doing security check and cchs you see thats kind of silly in the first place well the basic mistake which they are making is simple one theyre just running the rudiments with the sensitivity knob too high see theyre not clearing the rudiments for thirdofadial drop theyre clearing the rudiments for 16 and because theyre doing security checks then they think they should clear the rudiments for security check at 16 but then they never get around to security check you know do the security check by all means with an abnormally high sensitivity and check it all out with the sensitivity at 16 by all means but that hasnt anything to do with the rudiments see of running the model session in which security check is going to be done and you set it for thirdofadial drop and this is about the way you would run rudiments on somebody who is going through cchs which will run rudiments faster by the way than any rudiments process youve got you say all right is it all right with you to begin the session now good is it all right to audit in this room fine is it all right if i audit you all right thats good have you got any arc breaks thats fine are you withholding anything good fine thats good do you have any present time problems oh yes you do all right well thank you very much now were going to begin this security check its just practicality thats all youve gone through all the motions cause look youre going to be back on the cchs and oddly enough if you really want to try it sometime you can run present time problem with tr 10 thats right just say notice that wall now notice that ceiling notice that floor the guy is very upset because his wife is going to kiss somebody else and he hasnt been kissing her for years and hes wondering why and you say notice that ceiling notice that floor notice that wall and so on and the guy says well now how do you feel about your wife well its all right thats pretty bad all right you say notice that door notice your auditor notice the chair notice the ceiling notice the floor notice the wall notice that picture over there all right how do you feel about your wife now well not so bad all right good notice that ceiling now notice the floor notice the wall that sounds like funny way to run pt problem doesnt it and yet itll work all right you can run an arc break the same way unless the arc break is so violent with you the auditor that he wont do the auditing command you could get into something kind of like that so you possibly in doing the cchs sometime or another its rare very rare but you might have to run some tr 5n or something like this while bridging over into security check you got so many arc breaks with the pc that its better if you run ten minutes worth of 5n see tr 5n but its just wasting time you see i mean basically the cchs for sure will run all the rudiments the cchs are senior as processes to all or any rudiments process thats for sure so on that all by yourself well you could see that this is the that the thing would all shake out in the wash anyway and then look at your your security check dont you suppose thats bit superior to rudiments well rudiments are just rudiments for heaven sakes and when youre running think process youd better have them awful straight thirdofadial drop does the rudiment register on the needle registry on the needle at thirdofadialdrop sensitivity setting leave it alone do you understand and clear it only back to thirdofadial drop and then youve got speed now i wasnt giving you lecture on this particular subject im giving you an example here that observation should have been done on the ground see then we could have figured out what they were doing instead of getting some extraordinary solution heres the next one thats of considerable importance here this idea of the analytical mind we say the analytical mind is kind of misnomer because most people think its some kind of computing machine and its not its just the pc it was mistake made in early dianetics in research there was something there doing lot of thinking and computing and so i called it the analytical mind to differentiate this because at that time we didnt know anything much about thetans you got the idea all right we mean the thetan now when he directly personally what is conscious of thetan and the attention units available there are attacked by the auditor youre going to get auditing done your target is the reactive mind it is auditor plus pc versus the reactive mind and boy now have you really got it plowing this basically accounts for that five hour twentyfive hour ratio thats been kind of bug to us works like this as matter of fact julia was the one who made this observation she was doing bunch of tests out in phoenix and i was taking on pcs and i was auditing pcs fivehour intensives see and i had whole bunch of pcs one after the other at fivehour intensives see and the days and weeks went by and julia got ahold of whole bunch of profiles and they were the what was not then the guidance center but the staff auditor profiles you see for the same period of time you know and here was the five hours and here was the twentyfive hours and they were the same results you know and she got ahold of this and she pointed this out to and there they all sat in the files and this was rather fascinating i was getting results in five hours and they were getting results in twentyfive hours but we were really running more or less the same thing well when you see wild variable of this character dont assign it as most people would in their overweening conceit pomp and prejudice to how good they are see any time you say well the reason theres big difference is im just good and theyre lousy you see that would be wonderful way to block off any further information on the subject well truthfully speaking where you have all of your auditors working like mad putting in time doing the same thing as anybody else youre working like mad putting in time there must be something different i didnt discover it actually till couple or three weeks ago what the dickens this was all about their reactive mind was apparently choosing out the pc as the randomity got the idea in other words they were auditing the analytical mind they were auditing the pc see they were thinking of the pc as being aberrated and the pc was this and the pc was that dont you see well of course this is true but it isnt something you attack see dont attack the pc attack his bank get this vast difference your target is the reactive mind now i gave you talk about this not too long ago and here it comes up again we havent got this point yet it is big point it is not little tiny niggardly point its big point it was enough to make this five twentyfive hour difference all right so therefore its probably enough to account for doing security check in 75 hours or doing an sop goals in 225 hour assessment see see that all by itself its just that one little mechanic that stretches out this tremendous well you might call it waste of auditing time now if you could just correct this one little thing and save four out of every five hours of auditing hey thatd be pretty good wouldnt it thatd be quite discovery to discover something that was that much and yet i discovered this few weeks ago and i evidently havent communicated it because youre still doing it you see to some degree youre still doing this thing what do i mean by this what do i mean by this i know mary sue has covered this with you but im going to really slam it home here you take an emeter and you look at the emeter and you say have you ever stolen anything now wait this is the first time youve asked the guy the question see you know have you ever stolen anything oh you have huh oh well what do you know about that well hmm all right pc possibly is saying yes i once stole eight apples and i robbed store and so forth and hes saying this you dont pay any attention to that thats completely aside and has nothing to do with you you say and you say well all right ill repeat the question again clause 16 auditors code stay in twoway comm with the pc gong but why youre suspecting the pc of having stolen something youre not trying to find ways and means of getting him to recall ventilate air and get the dry rot out of the reactive bank youre assuming that he knew all about it and has been walking up and down the streets all these years knowing very well that he has stolen everything and he knows it and he did it you got the idea he knows it he did it he is the bird and that his only crime is that he didnt tell anybody now youve shortcircuited it one step yes he did and he notised it and hes got it down in the reactive bank and he doesnt even know about it and he keeps getting these fantastic impulses to steal things now when you do security check at the moment you ask it because its specific question that nobody has ever asked him before he remembers it and he will tell you about it ordinarily now having gotten that far youve just gotten that far on your own steam youve looked at the pc you looked down here at your paper and find out the next question is have you stolen anything all right you look at this and you say all right have you stolen anything and the pc says oh yes yes as matter of fact i did i stole three apples and two bananas and cartwheel and i once belonged to the army enough said and so forth yes i have yeah thats right i sure have all right good thank you hes answered the question hasnt he all right youre going to ask him again you say well have you stolen anything in any wording you care to put it and he says well yes yes as matter of fact when i was young kid we stole an automobile and went for joy ride all right and you say well all right thank you good now have you stolen anything and the guy says i told you all about it thats theres nothing more and you say all right now lets just be sure now all right im going to ask you on this now all right have you stolen anything oh im afraid theres still knock there what else is it come on you can remember it come on what is it now well blessed if i know one im damned if i know i cant remember anything else that i stole now there must have been something there must have been something i did nothing there isnt anything else ive stolen you say all right well lets just check it out and make sure were straight here now all right have you stolen anything in this lifetime knock okay well you so youve been ruddy thief in other lifetimes but you havent stolen in this lifetime so thats fine thats okay all right now heres the next question have you ever buttered any bread it says all right now have you ever buttered have you ever buttered any bread and the guy says buttered any bread hmmm nope and you say all right lets make sure good have you ever buttered any oh wait minute theres hell of knock on this thing now look you can remember that come on now uh buttered any bread yes thats right ill repeat it have you buttered any bread well look at that for gods sakes look at it so he breaks out microscope and telephoto exposure meter and so forth and he looks around buttered any bre oh oh well yes as matter of fact i was god you know id forgotten this i was an attendant in psychiatric ward when i was about twentytwo id forgotten that completely yes and we used to butter bread in there all the time for the insane patients yeah yeah what do you know and you say well all right okay now all right now lets just check this one so we can leave it have you buttered any bread all right have you buttered any bread yeah well thats flat okay all right now heres the next question have you ever been student you understand now look look here this is different demeanor this is different demeanor than the way youre delivering security check youre busy security checking somebodys analytical mind im sure of that because its taking you too long you see first thing i found out about this security check you were taking latent reads the only time you ever say ill repeat the auditing question in security check is when he said somebody else you said have you ever buttered any bread and he said well my aunt gahooseba used you say ill repeat the auditing question dont even let him finish the sentence the devil with it you say ill repeat the auditing question have you ever buttered any bread you oh oh you well i well all right well check it good thats all right fine here we go got the idea its between you and the pc until what signal there is signal audience thats right you learned your lesson well that is the signal and youll have nothing to do with an emeter until you get that signal male voices thank you yes nothing to do with it put it under your chair sit on it butter it who cares but dont have anything to do with an emeter because youre cutting comm with the pc now why you got that emeter under your nose i never security checked anybody in my life in this particular fashion staring at the emeter and looking at it suspiciously yes you criminal i have you sitting in the chair i can security check the most unlikely people now why are you using any model session in the security check at all well its just better it keeps you from yicketyyaketing and takes you too far off the line it actually isnt really model session action it isnt model session type of action theres lot of yicketyyak goes on on the thing you can close it and you can bridge and you can use those model session factors but i get people to talk by persuading them to talk in an emeter im liable to say to somebody now look you want to know youre afraid to tell something about this or i see youre now remembering something about it and youre apparently afraid to tell why are you afraid to tell well hed say you might tell somebody else i said right thats right i said im going to soon as you tell ill get an hco sec and theyll put it on telex and theyll send it to all central organizations as an urgent and the guy says thats silly you know yes thats right its silly now what have you done oh the guy says oh well put in that light well actually i used to kiss goats and you say all right you used to kiss goats very good all right all right okay now lets just check out and see if youve remembered everything there is to remember about that see all right what animalism have you practiced with illicit diamond buying then guy gets another knock and you say aw come off of it you know did you have you remembered this do you know this right now do you know this all the attitude is you couldnt possibly know this and not tell and im helping you fish it up and here you are wasting time here by holding its silly you know this is foolish now come on you did remember this you you now well yes i was embarrassed to tell you oh well all right so youre so bad off that it embarrasses you to tell an auditor something all right now im not going to jump on you for that or anything just give this dope here lets get the show on the road you see you know that kind of thing that is if i suspect that he is remembering it now you see and then sitting there holding onto it or afraid to tell you can ordinarily tell they start to look hunted you know well thats about as far as you ever go in attacking pc but just direct assault on pc to pick up that emeter the first time you ask that question look fixedly at the emeter ask the question in rather suspicious tone of voice and so forth youre being absolutely certain that hes not going to tell you well what are you doing youre cutting comm with the pc you are actually encouraging him to withhold you might as well say to him now i know youre going to withhold and you know youre going to withhold so therefore everybody is going to withhold around here and therefore were going to take five times as long to do security check you see when you sort it out with this kind of an idea of course hes going to withhold even if he knew these things he wouldnt tell i go at an entirely different assumption because im attacking the reactive bank i assume that if he remembers it or knows about it he will tell at once and i do everything i can do to promote that frame of mind its not just promoting that frame of mind its true and by the time hes asked about the third question you know answered about the third question well he says ah this is pretty interesting you know i mean pretty pretty wild yeah you know i can talk to this guy and he starts going into session and here he is hes insession i ask him the next question have you buttered any bread never occurs to him for moment to withhold the thing he says buttering bread well as matter of fact when we were very young i id sure hate to have this known i say well its going to be known now go ahead and ah well when we were little children we used to butter bread you know and wed butter it and butter it and so forth and hide it from our mother and i say all right goodo how do you feel about that now aaahh pretty grim all right good enough well have you buttered any bread ive just told you thats it thats all of it see thats you know then lets say all right now lets make sure weve got all of it and we check it on the meter and were already reading with an advanced sensitivity knob we ask him with the sensitivity knob advanced and then we ask him with the sensitivity knob totally increased further fall thats it we have checked it out we can leave the question and its just onetwothreefour but it is your role as an auditor to persuade him that he can remember and that he can tell you and every time you make suspicious actions in the direction of the emeter you invalidate that little bit so the less those suspicious actions are the better off you are you sit down you put the emeter down so forth its not an attitude of well were gonna find out all about it now because there you are walking around knowing all about these things and so forth and that makes you pretty bad criminal doesnt it hahhahaha hahahaha well twoway communication goes up the chimney right there how could it do otherwise how could it do otherwise you as the auditor can create an atmosphere not of confidence but create an atmosphere of communication dont create an atmosphere of nocommunication you dont have to operate like man you dont have to operate like priest as matter of fact im not above throwing all sorts of dunnage into security check on the basis the fellow is looking very pooff you know youve just asked him well have you ever raped girl you know oooooh yeah well all right now you just remembered something there now what was it wahwahwahwhat i dont know what i did there ughrrohoooooo thats i say what the hell is all this about im not above saying something like this i go you know what the hell is this about do you think im catholic priest or something im going to make you wear sackcloth and ashes for the rest of your life the guy says oh i guess i guess youre not and i say this isnt 1620 this is ad 11 all right now lets hit this thing hard now now have you ever raped girl well tell all about it well all right and he tells you all about it and not because you found it on the emeter but because you just said well look at them sighs and groans moans and writhing and man there is something there and you and had better get this into view all the way and let the turbojet blowers go through the reactive bank you know next thing you know promoted question after question after question he is more and more confident and feels more and more confidence in his auditor and feels better and better and the knowingness is going up in all directions and the emeter is further and further away and is actually only used just to check out the last two checks and you get so that youd never find anything on the last two checks you just never find an additional fall thats all hes given the whole thing to you before you ever went near the meter see you after all are the auditor and when you forget that you are the auditor and matter how marvelous mechanical contrivance is when you forget that you yourself are doing the auditing and that you yourself are handling the pc you get slowdown right there it starts to grind you see now our next level of wasted motion was of course in this thing of latent read and letting the pc wander and so forth exerting control over his communication in the session you say to him well have you ever bitten any snakes and he says oh well yeah once upon yeah as matter of fact my aunt grace she used to bite snakes used to buy snakes down in the market and shed bite them she used to bring them home and bite them and it horrified as small boy and thats why youre getting fall on the meter or would get fall on the meter if you were looking at the meter and you say whoa now whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i asked you if you had bitten any snakes oh oh yeah well thats what the meter would be falling on if i were looking at it oh well all right well the hell with it yes all right i do it all the time as matter of fact i did it last night bit one bit his head right off ive got to bite em and youd say okay all right now well check this one out is there anything more there nothing more you know i mean have you ever bitten any snakes thats the only one thats the only one all right well just check it out on the emeter have you ever bitten any snakes ah thats all right okay fine all right now lets get on with this thing now stop putting on the brakes and the guy gets in frame of mind where he feels perfectly safe and actually his anxieties in life were borne out of the fact that he doesnt feel so safe so you bring about tremendous change in the pc just by this attitude the attitude alone can bring about change in pc use your emeter when he says until he says leave it alone check it out for the advanced read you are already using check out the question again for the most increased read you can get on the emeter and then if you got nothing then go on but of course on the advanced read not the most extreme read you check it out have you ever bitten any snakes and it goes pang again oh i tell you the amount of disappointment which i can get into my voice is histrionic i say theres fall here well he says i told you everything im oh you did you dont remember this one oh all right all right all right well now lets see if we can find it all right ill help you out now have you ever bitten any snakes bang whats that falling on this lifetime all right its this lifetime okay come on spot it you can do it come on you can do it whew yes yes as matter of fact i used to bring snakes in and hide them in the teachers drawer and then when she was gone id take them out and bite them yeah all right whsoooow say yeah all right you say okay now lets check it out have you ever bitten any snakes fall all right all right whats the matter are you afraid of this subject or something of this sort yes as matter of fact it drives nuts well come on remember it now you can do it oooh i dont know i dont remember any more of it all right i will agree with you you dont remember any more lets see if we can find it ill help you out here one way or the other now have you ever bitten any snakes oh its movie i saw once its movie its movie i saw once all right now im going to repeat the auditing question again have you ever bitten any snakes yeah oh yeah theres one i didnt mention that one all right good enough all right now were going to check it out hes told you what it is and you say have you ever bitten any snakes ah theres fall on that good have you ever bitten any snakes nope all right okay good all right lets get on with the next one get the idea its only when he says you use the emeter and then if youre using the emeter and hes still saying you assume not that hes really withholding from you but you merely assume that he hasnt overwhumped the reactive mind this disappoints you you see that he doesnt just bang like this and he gets the idea that he should be able to do it its most remarkable the point is that you can get him in hopeful frame of mind im maybe not putting this point across too good because im not giving you an actual demonstration of this thing but the point is that his confidence comes up and his ability to overwhump the bank comes up and his ability to communicate comes up therefore his knowingness keeps coming up and the security check will start showing up on your profiles like mad and they happen rather rapidly and after little while youll be saying to him something on the order well have you ever stolen anything and the fellow says yes soandso and soandso and soandso name rank and serial number and sold it to the pawn shop and thats it bang and you say all right have you stolen anything else now you check it out itll be blank his noes will be followed by blank his noes are not followed by reaction early in the game yes his noes will be followed by reaction on the meter and youll have to turn around to him and say remember it think about it on the sort of an attitude of mind of you can do this it is possible for you to do this i know that you can do this and he thinks im doing something well yes i am im rememberingsomething what do you know yes i am and i can do it what do you know im not putting any hypnotic charm on him because what im putting on him is the fact that ive demonstrated conclusively to him that he could by just insisting that he did its like getting an auditing command followed the auditing command youre kind of running is recall all your overts and withholds thank you and after while why they just go off like streak of light and itll be very seldom that you ever find knock on the meter after youve asked him to tell all then you can resort to the meter and you say well have you ever been member in an armed force you know and he says and you get down to point where you get much more rapid agreement amongst the auditor and this is when you leave question when you have total agreement on its an agreement the auditor observes it the emeter observes that its the pc observes that its and the reactive bank doesnt churn anyone up and so it agrees that its see and everything is in agreement there is and youre promoting agreement like mad all over the place you see instead of the disagreement the disagreement which youre eliciting is when you sit down and look at the meter and you say to the meter to the meter you say exclusively well have you ever bitten any bread and you know the pc knows this but is only unwilling to tell you and youre going to sniff him out somehow youre going to catch him off base and the whole thing is being conducted in sort of paranoid atmosphere of supersuspicion you see it does him good in spite of all this you see its just slow thats all its just slow you can do security checks all backwards and do them all on the meter and stare at nothing but the meter and never listen to what the pc says and go out of communication with him and you can still get away with it probably and you can still get the security check system working and you can still get an advance with the pc but at what time ratio now were just talking about time ratio and thats all im trying to teach you these days all right you can build up something else that gives an entirely different time ratio and that is when you ask the pc you ask him as friend and with the encouragement that he probably can remember it if he has done it hes certainly going to remember it and then if he has done that he is certainly going to tell you there is other thought ever enters your mind than that this is going to happen and you read him the question and only when he says in one time or another do you check the thing out on the meter and then when you finally have checked it out on the meter you got four things in agreement the auditor the pc the emeter and the reactive bank theyre all in agreement that it is all right then you go on to the next question and you can do that with rather great rapidity because as i say he will keep remembering them faster and faster it isnt that youre you see it looks different way it looks like his confidence in you is increasing so therefore he can tell you that is not whats happening whats happening is he is able better and better and better to overwhump his reactive bank and his withholds and stare them right in the teeth and confront it and own right up to them and when he starts doing that more and more rapidly he of course is taking more and more responsibility and youll find these things are really blowing he doesnt creep out of session and feel like cur dog and so on he feels good about it you know and you get him back in the session again and you get that confidence inspired once more its really rolling its just question he tells you all you check it out its question he tells you all you check it out its question he tells you all you check it out and actually its just more and more easy for him to do this and therefore its easier and easier to conduct the security check and youll find out that if its conducted the way im trying to outline to you here that you will get forty or fifty times the number of withholds off the case oh you mean you get more off the case you said it you get more then he blows it faster and it takes less time to get the more can you see that well what are you doing slowing it down see and the only way you can slow it down is be sure he wont tell you be certain that it is the pc who is withholding it from you be absolutely certain that its only through the greatest of chicanery that you will eventually be able to trap him into point where he has to run up white flag and surrender with sword hilts reversed you see and say well all right ive had game with you and so forth and i give up now and youve won the game now look that isnt the attitude which youre trying to promote at all the other attitude is the one youre trying to promote which is you too can remember your overts you can do it you can do it and there they are and uhhuh all right that was pretty good and you know it is all in an understanding of exactly whats happening now you got subjective reality on this all of you all of you right here at this particular instant undoubtedly have felt tortured at one time or another during security check you know you were perfectly willing to tell but the auditor didnt seem to be willing to listen or yourself couldnt quite put your finger on it and you were trying hard and the auditor seemed to blame you for not being able to put your finger on it you know and the auditor was blaming you but you were trying to remember and you couldnt quite get it untangled and the auditor gave you help have you ever been in that situation in security check the auditor gave you help to remember thats because hes assuming the auditor has assumed at that point that you remembered but that you were just being mean so this is the assumption of games condition in auditing see dont ever assume games condition in auditing never assume games condition if you dont want one you can materialize them left and right you can materialize all kinds of games conditions you can materialize more arc breaks than you can shake stick at now auditing is as workable as the rudiments are in well what about this isnt this better way to establish the rudiments during security check than going over them with an advanced sensitivity reading and plucking them all to pieces and particularly in routine 1 when youre not supposed to be running verbal processes beyond security check on somebody trying to clear up his whole case by running rudiments and all this sort of thing dont you think that its pretty apparent that these rudiments will just get ridden roughshod into the situation i have to confess to you that rudiments go out to the degree that auditing skill is out and as auditing skill comes in the rudiments come in and you take guy who has to have lots of havingness run on him he generally is being audited by somebody whos audited him bit roughly you see theres something going on here which isnt quite good agreement you see so the rudiments are sort of perpetually out well if you can see that profile can be held up and made absolutely static by present time problem if it can be reduced by an arc break if these two things are continuously present naturally the case wont advance very well will it all right so the best thing you can do is to create the operating atmosphere in which these things cant happen now if you are suspicious of the pc continuously suspicious of the pc they will happen because the pc isnt being bolstered by the auditors confidence or the auditors attack on the pcs reactive mind you see the pc isnt bolstered by it the pc is just drifting now you see how you could really speed one of these things up im sure you saw it earlier today and im already going over ground which mary sue has already very very well covered with you perhaps its bit of an invalidation to go over it again but i want you to see it in this operating atmosphere not as mechanical thing but as created atmosphere that an auditor can create in security check and its the basis of creation is simply well there you are and youve got lot of these things occluded and you cant remember them and were going to find them and were going to ventilate them and youre going to feel lot better and after youve answered few questions then you too will be sure that you can remember the remainder very easily and the guy you know this kind of an operating atmosphere he oh yeah yeah well hes remembering faster and faster and so forth and he tells you once in while i dont know if i want to go on with this this is remembering too fast you know well come off of it you can face up to these things have you ever faced up to em before well yes yes yeah ive faced up to em before must have faced up to them before i did em all right face up to them again all right heres the next question did i face up to them hmmmm heh i can do that you know bang and he does can you get some concept of the velocity involved that is to say the speed of advance of the increased speed of advance that you can do with just this single factor hm do you see that that single factor injected into security checking could enormously increase your speed of advance huh you set yourself up as somebody that people cannot help talking to you set yourself up as somebody in whom people have confidence you set yourself up as somebody who can be confided in and you do fantabulous security check you set up yourself as cop who is going to sniff out the crime in spite of everybody preventing you from doing it hehhehhehheh rrrehhehheh and youll have to sniff out the crime ill tell you its direct test of how good an auditor can do this how many times he has to resort to the emeter to get it all thats direct test the more often an auditor has to resort to an emeter to pull the teeth of withholds the less he is using this so you yourself have good test that you can use while security checking if youre finding you have to resort to the emeter resort to the emeter resort to the emeter you know and did you do it and you get another fall and you have to clear that and you get another fall and you have to clear that and so on you have to assume that you dont have the guys confidence thats all you dont have this pcs confidence thats what you have to assume thats the first thing you should assume thats the time for hearttoheart talk time for one of these nice fireside chats you say well whatd be the liabilities of telling about these things ohhhh youll be told youll be told why you didnt werent easily able to bring about this atmosphere of confidence now having brought it about get subjective reality on this you know having brought about better atmosphere of confidence trust and communication with the pc look at the speed with which the security check goes and how seldom you have to check against the emeter well what is this it isnt the pc has become more willing to tell you those things which he himself was knowingly hiding ill tell you he doesnt know these things youve given him enough horsepower now see that he just goes into the bank one way or the other and the fur flies he remembers this and he remembers that and he remembers something else and there it is and bang bang oh yes he can attack that yeah he can overcome that after while hes saying sort of aah bring on your reactive banks who cares i can lick them got the idea thats the way the first clearing was done was in that operating atmosphere well worth remembering that there was an operating atmosphere that had to do with that it was simply increasing somebodys confidence over his bank and increasing his confidence over his bank and increasing his confidence over his bank and they go clear not by running this or that or getting mechanical they will go clear if you just increase their confidence enough over their ability to knock out the bank have i made my point all right well i hope its of some help to you thank you
