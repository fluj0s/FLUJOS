capacity would be needed if human influenza pandemic similar to that of 1918 were to occur as an example dr otoole calculated the data for the atlanta area and provided the following description for those hospitals for example in 1918 type pandemic in the atlanta metro area that region would require 300 of its current preepidemic hospital bed capacity to care for flu patients and the necessary clinical staff to care for this increase in patients 700 of atlantas preepidemic intensive care unit capacity and nearly four times as many ventilators to care just for the flu patients these demands do not take into account the res ources that would be required to meet normal ongoing critical medical needs care of heart attack victims etc4 similarly although efforts are underway to develop vaccines and stockpile antiviral drugs it is unlikely that ther would be sufficient quantities of these medications for all who might seek them during pandemic5 hhs has noted that it will be six

would not be known until there is pandemic matched vaccine supplies w ill be limited or nonexistent at the start of pandemic8 antiviral drugs would also be in s hort supply during pandemic the united states is working toward goal of stockpiling 81 million treatment doses both federal and state9 currently approximately 50 million antiviral treatment courses have been stockpiled10 however since viruses can develop resistence to current antiviral drugs hhs has awarded 103 milli on to develop new influenza antiviral drug11 in situations such as bioterrorism or pandemic influenza where resources are limited issues concerning altered standards of care may arise the allocation of scarce medical resources would be part of this broader issue12 one discussion of the overall issue of altered sta ndards of care noted that under normal conditions current standards of care might be interpreted as calling for the allocation of all appropriate health and medical resources to improve the health status andor save the life of each individual patient however should ma ss casualty event occur the demand for care provided in accordance with current standards would exceed system

of community it will be impossible to provide the level of medical care that would be expected under pre pandemic circumstances18 the plan also notes that approaches to medical care would change in pandemic hospital and icu beds ventilators and other medical services may be rationed as in other situations of scarce medical resources preference will be given to those whose medical condition suggests that they will obtain the greatest benefit from them such rationing differs from approaches to care in which resources are provided on firstcome firstserved bases or to patients with the most

recommendations regarding prioritization of pandemic influenza vaccine and antiviral drugs and includes the rationale for the prioritization the first prio rity individuals for vaccines would be those involved in v accine and antiviral manufacturing and medical workers because they would be needed to ssure maximum production of vaccine and antiviral drugs and to provide medical car the second group would be individuals at high risk of hospitalization and death excluding the elderly in nursing homes and those who are immunocompromised because th ey would not be expected to respond well to vaccination the recommendations so rank various other groups healthy children do not receive prior ity under these recommendations the recommendations for priority treatment differ for antiviral drug use the first priority group to receive antiviral drugs would be pa tients admitted to the hospital due to severe infl uenza illness the second prio rity group would be health care workers the next

pandemic waves pass there will be society to which we can all return38 the infectious diseases society of america idsa issued report in january 2007 containing principles for action dur ing an influenza pandemic and specific recommendations39 idsa emphasized the need for guidance concerning priorities for vaccines and observed that the us must preserve medical readiness by ensuring that health care workers including physicians nurses pharmacist allied health personnel first responde rs and others are able to perform their duties during an influenza pandemic40 in its response to the hhs request for information on vaccine prioritization idsa noted that the principle served by the priorities should be mitigation of suffering and death while sustaining the functioning of society41 the exact implementation of this pr inciple would depend upon the particular epidemiological characteristics of pandemic for example pandemic that caused high death rates among children but not adults would necessitate different priorities generally idsa noted the importance of critical infrastructure personnel and key health care providers however the comments also noted that scheme that incorporates consideration of years of life lost or years of quality life lost should be considered and that the lifecycle proposal of ezekiel emanuel and alan wertheimer which was di scussed previously was good starting point the new york state department of health issued draft plan on march 15 2007 for determinating who would receive ventilator treatme nt during pandemic where there is shortage of ventilators42 the draft plan woul d apply to all patients in acute care hospitals in the state without regard for age occupation or role in the community and would be applicable only as last resort after hospitals had canceled elective medical procedures the plan did not list specific diseases or age as exclusion criteria but focused on functi onality using sequential organ failure assessment score there would be prio rity for health care workers or first responders the proposal also addresses legal issues noting that the document when finalized would provide strong evidence regarding an acceptable standard of care the new york state department of health is seeking comments on the draft plan although detailed analysis of the pl ans of various countries is beyond the scope of this report it should be noted that different countries pproach priorities for vaccines and other medical supplies in va rious ways 2006 analysis of pandemic plans from fortyfive countries found

public services public accommodation and services operated by private entities transportation and telecommunications for individuals with di sabilities congress found that individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination often resulting from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to participat in and contribute to society45 as stated in the act the adas purpose is to provide cl ear and comprehens ive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities46 title ii of the ada prohibits discrimina tion by state and local governments whereas title iii of the ada prohibits discr imination by places of public accommodation which are defined to include hospitals or offices of healthcare provider47 many of the concepts used in the ada originated in section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 197348 and its interpretations and the two statutes are generally interpreted in the same ma nner although their areas of coverage differ somewhat section 504 prohibits discr imination against individuals with disabilities in any program or activity receiving federal financ ial assistance in the executive branch or the us postal service the ada covers the private sector and state and local governments although the ada does not specifically ntion coverage of disasters its provisions are broad and would provide nondiscrimination protec tion for emergency situations the department of justice s observed that one of the most important roles of

these programs accessible is also required by the ada49 the department of justice has issued an ada guide for local governments regarding making community emergenc preparedness and response programs accessible to people with disabilities50 this guide includes planning for individuals who use oxygen or respirators or who have need for medications however the guide is focused on disasters that occur during short period of time and in specific location such as terrorist attack or hurricane rather than on an influenza pandemic which could last more than year and span the world despite this focus the ada would appear to require planning unde rtaken regarding potential influenza pandemic to including planning for individuals with disabilities definition of disability the starting point for an analysis of rights provided by the ada or section 504 is whether an individual is an individua l with disability the ada and section 504 definitions of disability were amended by the ada amendments act pl 110325 to broaden the definition of disability from that provided by supreme court interpretations51 the ada amendments act defines the term disability with respect to an individual as physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment as described in paragraph 352 although this is essentially th same statutory language as was in the original ada pl 110325 contains new rules of constr uction regarding the definition of disability which provide that the definition of disability shall be construed in favor of broad coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the act the term substantially limits shall be interpreted consistently withthe findings and purposes of the ada amendments act an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity neednot limit other major life activities to be considered

individual medical treatment decisions the ada and section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 have been found not to apply to individual medical treatment decisions62 in other words physician s medical judgment concerning treatment will be given deference and generally will not trigger discrimination issues the requirement that an individual with disability be qualified has been seen by at least one court to be geared toward relatively static programs or activities such as education and thus is unabl to be applied in the co mparatively fluid context of medical treatment63 when the disability is related to the condition to be treated courts have found that it w ill rarely if ever be possibl to say that particular decision was discriminatory64 however in one distri ct court case section 504 was found to require the provision of medical treatment to an anencephalic infant despite the advice of physicians and the hospitals ethics committee recommending that the child not be

of equality of health could be constructed67 oregon medicaid waiver proposals similar issues were raised in the early 1990s by the state of oregon medicaid waiver proposal whic h attempted to set priorities for allocating healthcare services68 the methodology used to set the priorities for the ranking in the oregon pl an involved data supplied by healthcare providers eg the likelihood of recovery from certain diseases or conditions and values contributed by the general pub lic through public hearings and community meetings in telephone survey and by the oregon commissioners the values were given weight based on three attributes va lue to society value to an individual needing the services and whether it was essen tial to basic healthcare package the value to an individual included an element described as quality of life which was quantified largely through telephone survey in which the respondents scored the severity of certain sympto ms or functional impairments on scale of 1 to 100 with 0 representing death and 100 representing pe rfect health the survey did not reach 534 of the randomly dialed numbers nd the commissions report indicated that this was due to various factors including deaflanguage barrier69 t h u s department of health and human services hhs denied the waiver application based on conflicts with the ada especi ally the quality of life components70

found ada violation and granted summary judgment for the hospital since the evidence showed that the rejection of the plaintiffs application for kidney transp lant was for medical reasons the doctor

litigation sandra jensen was an indivi dual with down syndrome who needed heartlung transplant surgeons at two hospitals initially rejected her for the procedure claiming that she lacked the mental capacity to participate in her care however pressure from community memb ers and advocacy groups led the hospitals to reconsider and after further examinati on stanford university surgeons determined that they had misjudged ms jensens ab ility to comprehend he r condition and handle her care and performed the surgery75 application how then could these ada and section 504 precedents be applied to proposed priorities for the allocation of scarce medical resources when the scenarios that arise from possible influenza pandemic are imposed on modern society first it should be noted that there are numerous ways in which allocation priorities could be ma and that these priorities vary depending on for example whether the situation involves the distributi on of vaccine or the provision of antiviral medications or the use of ventilators in addition the hhs pa ndemic influenza plan recommendations for priorities emphasize that the recommendations were based on certain critical assumptions that might change76 similarly the guidance issued byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33381crs17 76 continued risk of hospitalization and death would be in fants the elderly and those with underlying health conditions 2 that the healthcar system would be severely taxed if not overwhelmed due to the large number of illnesses and complications 3 that during pandemic wave between 25 and 30 of persons will become ill during six to eight week outbreak 4 that there is limited inform ation available to assess potential impacts on critical infrastructure sectors such as trans portation and utility services and 5 that the us based vaccine production capacity would be 3 to 5 million doses per week with three to six months needed before the first doses were produced these assumptions however could change for example individuals who are at greatest risk of hospitalization and death may not be infants the elderly and those with underlying health conditions in the 1918 pandemic most deaths occurred in young adults see hhs pandemic influenza plan appendix d httpwwwhhsgovp andemicfluplanappendixdhtml 77 an influenza pandemic differs from these other disasters in that it would be

ge neral in nature exactly how the ada or section 504 will ffect priorities for the allocation of scarce medical resources is uncertain event comparable to the scenarios projected by pandemic influenza such as the one of 1918 has occurred since the enactment of the ada or section 504 lthough other national disasters have happened such as the terrorist attacks on 911 and the devastation of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma77 these disasters have highlighted the difficulty of providing medical equipment and supplies to individuals with disabilities including homebound individuals and the importance of planning78 however they do not provide much guidance on how scarce medical resources are to be allocated it should be reiterated that title ii of the ada would apply to policies implemented by states and localities and that ada title iii would apply to private entities such as hospitals whereas secti on 504 would cover recipients of federal financial assistance federal executive agencies and the us postal service after finding coverage the next step is to dete rmine whether the indivi dual is an individual with disability and whether discrimination has

medical continuedcertainly some situations eg denial of vaccine to an individual solely because of visual or mobility impairmen t unrelated to how that individual would respond to the vaccine would most likely r afoul of the adas goal of eliminating actions resulting from stereotypic assu mptions and of its nondiscrimination requirements79 determination of who is to receive vaccines or other medical treatments that are in limited supply shoul d involve careful consideration and safeguards to avoid the reliance on stereotypical assumptions that might trigger violation of the ada or section 504 howeve r determination that an individual not receive vaccine because the vaccine would not be effective given his or her health situation would be unlikely to ra ise ada concerns because it would be based on medical determination of treatment the mere fact that decision would have disparate impact on individuals with disa bilities would not necessarily be sufficient to violate the nondisc rimination mandates80 many of the situations that might occur are likely to be much more difficult to analyze especially if physicians and hospital staff are faced with the kind of extreme situations described in congressional hearings81 for example decisions regarding who should be admitted to hospital when ther is shortage of beds as well as who should receive scarce medications could be difficult to make to the extent that these decisions are based on an individual medical treatment decision eg where the individual is allergic to the scarce medication or would not mount an immune response to the v accine case law under the ada nd section 504 would indicate that violation of these statut would be unlikely however to the extent that the decision is based on stereotypical assumpti ons there may be violation of the ada or section 504 an influenza pandemic with shortages of medical supplies such as ventilators could raise issues concerning whether tr eatment that has be gun should be stopped for example if an individual with vere underlying medical condition such as heart failure were infected with the influe nza virus and as result of the virus was on ventilator with unlikely prospects for survival would the removal of such an individual from the ventilator so it could be used for an individual with stronger likelihood of survival violate the nondiscr imination mandates of the ada or section 50482 this situation would raise novel legal issues83 these issues may be presentedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33381crs19 83 continued equipment for discussion of
