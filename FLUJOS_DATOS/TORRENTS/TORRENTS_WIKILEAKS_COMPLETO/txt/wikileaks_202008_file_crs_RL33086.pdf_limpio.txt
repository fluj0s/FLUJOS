surplus insurers in fact earned record profits in each of the last three years 20042006 in the aftermath of katrina policymakers disaster experts and insurance company representatives have expressed concerns about the potential vulnerability of the insurance industry to future gacatastrophic event and raised questions about what role if any the federal gove rnment should play in financing catastrophe risks most insurance market analysts note that there is state in the union that is not subject to catastrophe exposure and the current state of affairs suggests that the exposures are far greater than the insuran ce industry is now prepared to handle although the insurance i ndustry has emerged largely intact from hurricane katrina and is better capitalized now than ever it simply does not have sufficient capital to pay for megacatastrophe this fact is not new insurers and financial market experts knew after hurricane andrew in 1992 that outside capital was needed to supplement

hurricane katr ina struck several states along the gulf coast from louisiana to the western ed ge of the florida panhandle including mississippi and alabama causing deaths injuries property and infrastructure damage economic loss and human suffering1 the storm caused an unprecedented amount of damage to residential industria l largely oil and ch emicalrelated and commercial property hurricane katrina was different from other hurricanes because of the extensive flooding that resulted fro m record 30foot storm surge and the breaching of three levees that protected new orleans from lake pontchartrain and the mississippi river katrina left over million people without electricity communications and drinking water casualties are expected to number in the hundreds2 in the aftermath of hurricane katrina concerns have been expressed by insurance industry participants emerge ncy managers policymakers and disaster policy experts about the following the unpr ecedented property damages and huge recovery costs and challenges facing the region l ouisiana mississippi and alabama and nation the longterm budgetary implication of federal disaster recovery expenses given that the american people will ultimately be responsible for the cost of hurri cane katrina through either taxes insurance policy premiums or fe deral postdisaster assistance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33086crs2 3 jeff harrington spur for national fund st petersburg florida time s august 30 2005 p 1whether or not in light of the ma ssive floodrelated claims filed by property owners and the resulting financial deficits in the nfip the program should be overhauledrestructured to operate more like private insurance company the vulnerability of the property insu rance industry to future mega catastrophic event of such magnitude that substantial portion of the industry could not support its vari ous obligations which could lead to ripple effect of potential insolvencies of multistate insurers and whether and how the federal govern ment could impr ove our nations ability to insure and mitigate risks of largescale natural disasters there appears to be growing support am ong policymakers and disaster policy experts on the need to reexamine how th country manages and finances economic noninsured and insured losses and to seek new nd innovative ways to do both3 traditional disaster policy s focused on coping with disasters using warnings before the disaster strikes emergency re lief and hazard insurance after disaster occurs and hazard reduction measur such as levees and floodplain managementlanduse ordinances to reduce damages from disasters with this in mind economists note that individual house holds and businesse s have two options to reduce losses from natural disasters predisaster mitigation that reduces physicalenvironmental vulnerabilities and risk financing designed to reduce financial vulnerabilities the first step in the disaster risk management framework is to mitigate damages from disasters the residual ec onomic risk can then be managed with risk financing strategies financing is thus an integral part of managing catastrophe risk it would not be feasible to quickly reconstruct the damaged property and infrastructure following hurricane katrina and also to restore the livelihood of the affected persons w ithout adequate fina ncial arrangements as members of congress explore ways to respond to the destruction caused by hurricane katrina the longterm budgetar implications of disaster recovery expenses incurred by the federal government as well as federal potential alternatives to build national capabilities for financing disaster risk may emerge as prime consideration the 110th congress will likely continue to consider various approaches to ensure the availability and affordability of disaster insurance to protect residential and commercial pr operty against future disast ers this debate could involve finding ways to improve insure rs access to capital in the reinsurance banking and securities markets to ensure adequate capacity and solvency of the industry to meet consumer needs the us economy and natural disasters when disaster occurs productive resources in particular region or state are destroyed or crippled resources from other parts of the country must be redirectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33086crs3 4 iso defines catastrophe as an event that causes 25 million or more in insured property losses and affects significant number of prope rty and casualty policyholders and insurersto compensate the victims and rebuild or repair that which is lost whether the disasteraffected region or state is bette r or worse off depends on what portion of their losses if any are covered by insura nce or government disaster assistance physical damage to the general building stock and the infrastructure following hurricane katrina could very well lead to reduction in the flow of goods and services and an aggregate loss of income to the local state and national economy the degree to which the storm disrupts the economy depends on the magnitude and duration of the disaster the structure of the local economy the geographical areas affected the populati on base and the time of day the disaster occurs the largest effects on output employment wages and cap ital stock occur at the local or regional level and to lesser extent at the na tional level depending on whether economic activity is sufficiently impeded or whet her the disaster affects large enough percentage of the population or an impor tant industry for example the us economy in 1994 was adversely affected by the northridge earthquake and the winter storms in the south midwest and east which affected 50 of the us population disrupted construction in the housing indus try and caused significant reductions in the output of automobiles steel and ppliances national estimates for economic growthoutput were revised downwards as re sult of these series of natural disasters during disaster recovery period the affected region or state will engage in redevelopment and cleanup fforts assuming willingness on the part of investors and the public to redevelop the area that tend to increase local employment and other economic activities insurance payments and disaster assistance government purchases and income transfer payments provide flow of funds into the area realizing the potential for profits investor s will likely be attracted to the building boom in the devastated area although private domestic investment becomes important in terms of facilitating production empl oyment and the demand fo r products the apparent positive contribution to the areas aggregate income from increased investment spending is largely ambiguous the reason is that the investment does not represent net additions to the stock of capital as destroyed physical assets are replaced with assets that incorporate the latest dvanced technology the productivity of communitys physical assets and the incomes generated from those assets will be enhanced depending on how much of the loss is recovered from the rest of the country the affected region may be better off the nation as whole however is unambiguously hurt by the disaster catastrophe losses from 2005 hurricanes according to the insurance services offices iso property claim services unit catastropheinsured losses in 2005 totaled 661 billion from 24 disasters4 as table 1 shows catastrophe losses from hurri cane katrina alone are estimated at about 436 billion making hurricane katrina th costliest disaster in us historyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33086crs4 5 insured loss estimates for hurricane katrina are likely to change as the extent of losses becomes better known disaster experts and ca tastrophe modeling firms expect the insured loss figures to change as more is known about the levels of water contamination and economic losses from business interruption and adjustments for losses covered by residual market mechanisms and foreign reinsurers the figures will also change as the courts resolve lawsuits filed on behalf of policyholders involved in disputes ie

areas commonly known as the flood plain or th flood zone who were not required by federal law to purchase flood insurance9 propertycasualty insurers withstood record catastrophe losses the pc industry experienced fa vorable financial and underwr iting c onditions during 2005 despite record catastrophe losses there are four reasons the pc industry emerged financially strong from record catastrophe losses of 661 billion in 2005 following record losses of 302 billion in 2004 first insurers learned important less ons from hurricane andrew in 1992 and these lessons prompted them to make chan ges to both protect the industrys balance sheets and stabilize the property insurance markets in the aftermath of moderate hurricane10 for example after hurricane andrew the florida state legislature worked with private insurers and regula tors to create hurri cane catastrophe system designed to mitigate losses to the insura nce industry and prevent insurers from withdrawing from the florida insurance ma rket the florida hurricane catastrophe fund was created as reinsurancelike entity funded by portion of insurance premiums and managed by the florida st ate board of administration florida also began using percentage deduc tibles tied to the value of homes instead of dollar amount such as 500 per claim florida created state regulated insurer of last resort to provide insurance when company is w illing to underwrite disaster risks these strategies for countering the challenges presented by hurricanes saved the property insurance industry from financial disast er after the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons second insurers experienced strong underwriting gains following the imposition of sound risk ma nagement practices after the four major hurricanes in 2004 insurers imposed tighter underwriting standa rds and sought regulatory approval forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33086crs6 11 policyholder surplus is referred to as net worth or owners equity in other industries it represents the financial resources capita l that stand behind every policy underwritten by an insurer 12 ross j davidson jr working toward comprehensive national strategy for funding catastrophe exposures journal of

losses journal of b anking and finance 2002 vol 26 p 557583higher rates however insurers faced regu latory scrutiny when they sought to adjust rates to reflect higher catastrophe risk and hi gher reinsurance costs not able to get approval to charge higher rates some insurers opted to limit their overall exposure in hurricaneprone areas along the gulf and atlantic coasts this in turn precipitated an insurance availability and affordability problem that continues through early 2007 third insures were able to withstand record catastrophe losses in 2005 because policyholder surplus11 measure of claimspaying capacity rose unexpectedly by 92 in 2005 from 3935 billion at yearend 2004 to 42 71 billi on as of december 31 2005 table 2 shows that at the end of the third quarter of 2007 the pc industry had 5218 billion in policy holder surplus supporting about 3233 billion in earned premiums only fracti on of this industrywide total surplus however would be available to compensate victims of catastrophic event insurers must rely on this same limited pool of surp lus to pay for other potentially catastrophic and unpredictable risks such as terrori sm mold and medical malpractice and asbestos liability claims prior to hurricane hugo in 1989 the insu rance industry had not experienced any losses from single disaster of over 1 b illion today one billion dollar disaster is quite common predictable and manag eable but most insurance experts would agree that the 100 billionplus catastrophic event remains challenge for the us propertycasualty insurance industry12 estimates of the probable maximum losses pmls from catastrophic earthquake or hurricane striking the us range up to 120 billion and this figure could be even higher depending on the location time and intensity of the event the pml loss from category 5 hurricane directly hitting densely populated area along the gulf and atlantic coasts eg miamift lauderdale could exceed the total capacity policyholder surplus of the us insurance industry13 the fourth reason insurers were able to w ithstand record catastrophe losses in 2005 was their high investment income risi ng interest rates that boost the industrys substantial bond portfolio and st rong stock market gains llowed insurers to generate 495 billion in 2005 and 523 billion in 2006 on their investment portfolio httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33086crs7 14

disasterrelated claims that have low probability of occurrence it is argued would lower insurers costs of holding capital and in turn lower the pre miums they must charge for given level of disaster

catastrophic risks in the financing of catastrophe risk ed kenneth front chicago university of chicago press 1999 p 149opponents to federal intervention in catas trophe insurance markets believe there is sufficient private sector capacity nd federal intervention would only crowd out private capital for insuring disasters and stifle innovative catastr ophe risk financing through insurance moreover critics of federal intervention say such measures would conflict with longestablished soci ological economic and actuarial principles that focus on the true cost of government programs the opportunity cost of the funds the foregone benefits of co mpetitive insurance marketplace eg cost efficiency and rate competition and the absence of consumer choice the ability to decide whether to purchase coverage21 citing the development of new fina ncial instruments to fund catastrophe coverage and expanded reinsu rance capacity critics of pub lic insurance systems say there is need for federal insurance program at this time they insist that such programs would shield the private sector from loss while creating sizable taxpayer financed subsidies that undermine privat esector incentives for efficient risk management moreover it has been argued that these programs would encourage population growth and development in high risk hurricaneprone areas that should not be developed and would llow insurers to cherry pick the best risks and send the federal government the poor risks concluding remarks historically congress has been reluctan t to enact federal disaster insurance legislation because of lack of consen on what will work and concerns about adequate provisions for mitigation and avoidance of unnecessary government intrusion into markets being adequately served by private sector financial entities congressional reluctance to establish fede ral disaster insurance program has been based on the recognition that such prog ram would conflict with sociological economic and actuarial principles that emphasize the true cost of government programs the opportunity cost of the funds the forgone benefits of competitive insurance marketplace eg cost efficiency and rate compe tition and the absence of consumer choice the ability to decide whether to purchase coverage22 the federal government has played an important role in the us economic system by assuming risks that the private s ector either will not undertake at any price or will accept but at price so high that most potential benefici aries will not purchase the coverage for example government riskbearing now

previous congresses responded to similar concerns by considering legislation to create federal catastrophe reinsurance program fo r residential propert despite broad support for several bills over th past few years congress did not authorize federal reinsurance program until the enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 finally most observers would agree th at for the very highest
