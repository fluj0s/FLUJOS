government and finance division federal advisory committees primer summary federal advisory committees are frequently chartered by the chief executive congress and agency heads to render independent advice and to make recommendations an advisory committee can be established by congressional legislation by presidential executive order or directive or by an agency head under general agency administrative authority by virtue of their ad hoc status advisory committees can circumvent normal bureaucratic constraints to provide diverse points of view in matters of public policy within definite time frame whether designated as commissions committees councils or task forces these independent study bodies have dealt with social crises policy issues and technical problems of major proportions commissions provide flexible option since their composition organization and working arrangements may be varied through the specific mandates establishing them congress formally acknowledged the merits of using advisory committees to obtain expert views drawn from business academic government and other interests when it enacted the federal advisory committee act faca in 1972 5 usc appendix federal advisory committee act 86 stat 770 as amended the legislative history pertaining to faca reveals that congress had two major concerns about advisory committees before 1972 the first concern was that the public perceived many advisory committees as duplicative and inefficient and otherwise lacking adequate controls or oversight the second concern was the widespread belief that advisory committees did not adequately represent the public interest and that committee meetings were too often closed to the public congressional enactment of faca established the first requirements for the management and oversight of federal advisory committees to ensure impartial and relevant expertise faca requires that the advice provided by advisory committees be objective and accessible to the public and that committee membership be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented pursuant to faca requirements the general services administration gsa maintains and administers management guidelines for commissions during fy2007 gsa reported total of 922 advisory committees composed of 51755 members which provided advice and recommendations to 57 departments and agencies the total reported cost to operate these advisory committees during fy2007 was more than 3526 million introduced on april 3 2008 hr 5687 would amend faca to require that advisory committee members be appointed without regard to political affiliation the gsa administrator would be authorized to issue regulations and guidelines to ensure that advisory committees provide impartial advice and expertise the legislation would also require faca provisions to be made applicable to any subcommittee or subgroup established by federal advisory committee on april 9 the house committee on oversight and government reform ordered hr 5687 to be reported as amended by voice vote hrept 110650 the house passed the legislation under suspension of the rules on june 24 2008 contents

introduction1 although george washington is usually credited with initiating the tradition of the president seeking outside advice when he appointed an ad hoc group of commissioners in 1794 to deal with the whiskey rebellion it was not until the 20th century that the chief executive congress and agency heads began to make extensive use of such panels to render independent advice and recommendations whether designated as commissions committees councils or task forces these independent study bodies have dealt with social crises policy issues and technical problems of major proportions federal advisory committee act statutory intent congress formally acknowledged the merits of using advisory committees to obtain expert views drawn from business academic government and other interests when it enacted the federal advisory committee act faca in 19722 the legislative history pertaining to faca reveals that congress had two major concerns about advisory committees before 1972 the first concern was that the public perceived many commissions as duplicative and inefficient and otherwise lacking adequate controls or oversight the second concern was the widespread belief that advisory committees did not adequately represent the public interest and that committee meetings were too often closed to the public congressional enactment of faca established the first requirements for the management and oversight of federal commissions to ensure impartial and relevant expertise as required by faca the general services administration gsa administers and provides management guidelines for commissions gsa also submits an annual report to the president and congress based on the information provided by the federal agencies concerning the meetings costs and membership of advisory committees during fy2007 gsa reported total of 922 advisory committees composed of 51755 members which provided advice and recommendations to 57 departments and agencies the total reported cost to operate these advisory committees during fy2007 was more than 3526 million3 1 this report was originally written by stephanie smith who has retired from crs readers may contact wendy ginsberg with questions on federal advisory committee issues 2 5 usc appendix federal advisory committee act 86 stat 770 as amended 3 the faca annual reports and database can be found at httpfidogovfacadatabase crs2 major provisions faca requires that the advice provided by advisory committees be objective and accessible to the public each federal commission meeting is presumptively open to the public with certain specified exceptions adequate notice of meetings must be published in advance in the federal register subject to the requirements of the freedom of information act all papers records and minutes of meetings must be made available for public inspection faca also contains general guidelines for membership mandating that any legislation establishing committee be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed and that the commissions recommendations not be inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest in the 35 years since facas enactment in 1972 congressional oversight hearings have revealed that while facas original goals were still relevant some of its provisions were in need of clarification from 1983 through 1989 legislation was introduced in the senate to strengthen facas management controls as well as to establish new ethical financial and conflict of interest disclosure requirements for committee members4 in 1997 faca was amended to provide for public observation of meetings of committees created by the national academies of sciences and public administration in support of executive branch decisionmaking processes5 gsas administrative guidance each advisory committee must file an annual charter with gsa containing its mandate and duties frequency of meetings and membership there is provision in faca that requires or defines bylaws for advisory committees however as part of its ongoing oversight function gsa began issuing administrative and interpretive guidelines in 1983 pertaining to the implementation of faca these final rules provide guidance for advisory committee chairpersons and are reprinted in gsas annual faca report the gsa guidelines authorize the secretary of each agency to appoint designated federal officer for each commission the gsa administrator makes the appointments for those independent presidential commissions not under agency jurisdiction the designated federal officers are responsible for implementing the procedural rules pertaining to approving and calling advisory committee meetings approving agendas adjourning meetings and chairing meetings when directed by agency heads of particular importance is the guidance that gsa provides to the agency committee management officers cmos for the management and procedural operations of advisory committees their responsibilities include those delegated to the agency head as well as keeping the necessary records pertaining to committee charters and formal submissions to gsas annual report commission statutes can also contain procedural references pertaining to voting requirements elections of chairpersons membership appointments and vacancies 4 s 1641 was introduced on july 19 1983 and s 2127 was introduced on nov 17 1983 s 2721 was introduced on aug 10 1988 and s 444 was introduced on feb 23 1989 5 111 stat 2689 crs3 congressional initiatives in the 110th congress on april 2 2008 the house committee on oversight and government reform subcommittee on information policy census and national archives held hearing to address the implementation and effectiveness of faca testimony was heard from government officials representing gsa the government accountability office the department of defense and from the private sector on ways to strengthen facas membership requirements and applicability guidelines6 the following day hr 5687 was introduced to amend faca and would require that advisory committee members be appointed without regard to political affiliation executive branch agency heads would be authorized to require members serving on agency advisory committees to fully disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest the gsa administrator would be authorized to issue regulations and guidelines to ensure that advisory committees provide impartial advice and expertise the legislation would also require faca provisions to be made applicable to any subcommittee or subgroup established by federal advisory committee in addition hr 5687 would require each executive branch agency to publish advanced notification of advisory committee meetings on the agencys website and to provide written transcripts of all advisory committee proceedings on april 3 hr 5687 was referred to the house committee on oversight and government reform and on april 9 the bill was ordered to be reported as amended hrept 110650 under suspension of the rules the house passed the bill on june 24 2008 commission examples the 12 commissions created by the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 7 are used here to illustrate the various options available for creating independent study bodies they are as follow

canyon ferrybroadwater county trust advisory committee18 and the advisory commission on electronic commerce19 these major policy and technical commissions were established to provide timely policy guidance on diverse issues of importance to congress and the public the complete text of the statutory charters for these 12 commissions can be found at the end of this report commission establishment commissions establishment is generally prescribed in brief introductory paragraph in the first section of the enacting statute the commission on online child protection20 was established as follows there is hereby established temporary commission to be known as the commission on online child protection for the purpose of conducting study under this section regarding methods to help reduce access by minors to material that is harmful to minors on the internet sometimes legislation may authorize an agency head to create an advisory panel at later date as illustrated by the following language the secretary of the treasury should establish an international monetary fund advisory committee 21 as stated earlier the president also has the authority to establish his own commissions by executive order congress can also authorize national or presidential study bodies by statute as it did when it established the presidents council on counternarcotics22 this 18 member council chaired by the president is mandated to advise and assist the president in overseeing and coordinating national drug control strategy commission mandate often one of the initial sections of statute establishing major advisory committee provides congressional findings identifying the conditions justifying the creation of panel for instance the establishment authority for the trade deficit review commission23 contained six major findings pertaining to us trade and 16 112 stat 2681689 17 112 stat 2681716 18 112 stat 2681718 19 112 stat 2681722 20 112 stat 2681728 21 112 stat 2681228 22 112 stat 2681688 23 112 stat 2681547 crs5 account deficits that led to congressional determination of the need to authorize commission study section on duties and functions generally specifies the commissions mandate or responsibilities the statutory charter of the national commission on terrorism24 prescribed three specific duties for the commission to review and assess the federal statutes and policies relating to counterterrorism and to recommend changes in preventing and punishing international terrorism directed toward this country study commissions objectives and the scope of its activities are best stated in specific terms to guide the panels members and staff in carrying out their responsibilities ideally the assigned objectives of commission should be realistic and manageable taking into consideration the time needed for appointment of staff research and approval of the commissions final report the legislation authorizing the trade deficit review commission contained separate issues to be addressed section listing eight specific areas for review as the commission undertakes its deliberations and research in preparation of the final report membership requirements membership requirements in faca are broad enough to allow great deal of discretion in determining the composition of commission therefore the membership of an advisory committee will often depend upon its functions and mandate the legislation mandating commission may require that particular federal officials serve as members the presidents council on counternarcotics is composed of 18 members including the president vice president and other cabinet officers such as the secretaries of state treasury defense transportation health and human services and education the advisory commission on electronic commerce25 requires membership consisting of the secretaries of commerce and treasury and the united states trade representative the president may also be required to make appointments to major policy commissions created by congress the 16member parents advisory council on youth drug abuse26 specifies four presidential appointments from the private sector major policy commissions often require membership appointments by congressional leaders the statutory charter for the trade deficit commission contains the following membership requirements the commission shall be composed of 12 members as follows 24 112 stat 2681210 25 112 stat 2681722 26 112 stat 2681689 crs6 i three persons shall be appointed by the president pro tempore of the senate upon the recommendation of the majority leader of the senate after consultation with the chairman of the committee on finance ii three persons shall be appointed by the president pro tempore of the senate upon the recommendation of the minority leader of the senate after consultation with the ranking minority members of the committee on finance iii three persons shall be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives after consultation with the chairman of the committee on ways and means and iv three persons shall be appointed by the minority leader of the house of representatives after consultation with the ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means commission charters may also require that members be appointed from the private sector to represent particular interests scientific or technical advisory committees are likely to have majority of members who have specialized backgrounds but are still representative of different points of view or employment members appointed to the international monetary fund advisory committee are required to include representatives from industry agriculture organized labor banking and financial services environmental and human rights organizations the selection of members representing different points of view helps to ensure that commissions final recommendations or report does not give the appearance of being inappropriately influenced by any special interests faca does not provide guidance on the number of members commission or committee should have or their terms of appointment the membership generally should be large enough to allow for representation of differing points of view and to facilitate quorum for commission meetings advisory committees of shortterm existence usually keep the same members for the committees duration with any vacancies filled in the same manner as the original appointments were made some advisory panels may have staggered membership terms so that only one portion of the members will be new at any given time thereby ensuring continuity in the committees operations the 16 members of the parents advisory council on youth drug abuse are appointed to threeyear terms however five of the initial appointments are for oneyear term and an additional five appointments are for term of two years to ensure staggered terms of office it is also possible for enabling legislation to specify how officers of an advisory panel are to be selected the chairman of the 11member international financial institution advisory commission27 for example is designated by the majority leader of the senate after consultation with the speaker of the house and the minority leaders of the house and the senate in contrast the chairman and the vicechairman of the parents advisory council on youth drug abuse are chosen by the commission membership the chairman assigns committee duties relating to the council such as authorizing the executive director to convene hearings and other administrative business 27 112 stat 2681220 crs7 the statutory authority of the sevenmember denali commission28 authorizes the governor of alaska or an individual selected by the governor to serve as the state cochairperson in addition federal cochairperson is appointed by the secretary of commerce from nominations submitted by the president pro temporare of the senate and the speaker of the house the federal cochairperson serves as an employee of the department of commerce and may be removed by the commerce secretary for cause this individual is responsible for developing research plan and also casts the deciding vote in the event of tie vote by the commission members member compensation and travel expenses advisory panel members who are not federal employees or officers may or may not receive compensation for their work on commission members of the national commission on terrorism who are not government employees are paid at rate not to exceed the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay prescribed for level iv of the executive schedule under section 5315 of title 5 united states code for each day including travel time during which such member is engaged in performing the duties of the commission they may also be allowed travel expenses and per diem at rates authorized for employees of agencies under subchapter i of chapter 57 of title 5 united states code while away from their homes or regular places of business in the performance of services for the commission commission staffing pressures of time are often not compatible with an advisory committees mandate for detailed research and investigation and staff must be quickly assembled generally speaking the staff is composed of the executive director staff members and consultants the quality of the final report can produce tension between the staff members and commission members however commission members make the final decisions on conflicting interpretations and recommendations provisions in the legislation creating the trade deficit review commission authorize the chairman without regard to the title 5 requirements to appoint and terminate an executive director subject to confirmation by the commission the chairman may compensate the executive director and staff without regard to the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter iii of chapter 53 of title 5 united states code relating to classification of positions and general schedule pay rates except that the rate of pay for the executive director and other personnel may not exceed the rate payable for level v of the executive schedule under section 5316 of such title 28 112 stat 2681637 crs8 the trade deficit commission is also authorized to obtain administrative support services from the general services administration on reimbursable basis advisory panels may also use the services of outside consultants and experts as defined in 5usc3109b the denali commission contains language authorizing the chairman to employ temporary and intermittent services at pay rates not to exceed the daily equivalent for level v of the executive schedule federal employees may also be detailed to staff an advisory committee the commission on online child protection for example is authorized to request staff and necessary resources from the department of commerce statutory language creating the national commission on terrorism authorizes the chairman to request the detail of any federal agency personnel without reimbursement to assist in carrying out its duties commission reports commission may be required to prepare an interim an annual or final report for transmittal to the president and congress or other department heads these reporting requirements usually can be found under the duties or functions sections of panels statutory charter or special section may mandate the production of final report the parents advisory council on youth drug abuse is authorized to issue annual reports in addition to any other reports or recommendations it considers appropriate to the director of national drug control policy and subsequently to congress since the recommendations contained in the final report are only advisory changes in public policy occur on the authority of commission therefore the implementation of such recommendations is dependent upon their expression in statute or presidential or agency directive as appropriate to ensure greater accountability for and oversight of panels final report specific provisions can be included in the establishment authority to require follow up or implementation of the final recommendations as an example the international financial advisory commissions statutory mandate requires the president through the secretary of the treasury to report to the appropriate oversight committees within three months after receiving the commissions final report and recommendations in addition the president through the secretary of the treasury must report annually on the implementation of any of the commissions final recommendations for three years following the commissions termination another approach is to require commission to incorporate its final recommendations into formal legislative or administrative language the final report of the advisory commission on electronic commerce must include such legislative recommendations as required to address the findings of the commissions research crs9 powers of commission explicit authority is needed for accomplishing the special duties for which an advisory committee might be responsible vesting commission with subpoena power however is done on very selective basis depending largely upon the investigatory mission of the panel in another example the trade deficit review commission is authorized to hold hearings take testimony receive evidence and use the franking privilege in the same manner as other federal agencies at the request of the chairperson the commission may also secure information directly from any federal agency bylaws and procedural requirements specific procedural requirements can often be found in the statutory mandate that establishes an advisory panel for example the national commission on terrorisms enabling statute contains section entitled administrative matters which sets requirements for meeting times and quorums commission statutes can also contain references to other procedural rules such as voting requirements election of chairperson membership vacancies and appointments unless otherwise addressed in commissions statutory mandate gsas designated federal officers are responsible for implementing the procedural rules pertaining to approving and calling advisory committees approving agendas adjourning meetings and chairing meetings when directed by agency heads commission funding gsa reported that in fy2007 federal departments and agencies spent total of 6269 million to operate advisory panels compensate members and reimburse travel and per diem expenses of this total nearly 1547 million was spent to reimburse federal staff support assigned by the agencies to assist and monitor their advisory committees29 commissions may be directly funded by congress or provided with monies indirectly through general agency appropriations as in the case of the commission on online child protection congress has authorized onetime appropriation of 2 million for the trade deficit review commission for fy1999 while the national commission on terrorism is authorized 20 million for fy1999 and such sums as may be necessary for fy2000 through fy2003 although it happens rarely federal advisory commission can also receive funds from private sources the advisory commission on electronic commerce is authorized to accept use and dispose of gifts or grants of services or property both real and personal for purposes of aiding or facilitating the work of the commission 29 this information is available at httpfidogovfacadatabase crs10 gifts or grants not used at the expiration of the commission shall be returned to the donor or grantor in addition to its congressional funding the denali commission is also authorized to accept and dispose of gifts donations of services or property when allowing the acceptance of private gifts or donations the commissions statutory mandate might also include reference to the accounting procedures that may be necessary to allow for public disclosure of said funds if commission does not receive congressional funding or agency sponsorship thought must be given as to how the proposed panel will go about finding suitable office space or administrative assistance in general ideally statutory provision in the commissions mandate will provide the necessary guidance if not the newly formed commission will find itself at disadvantage that could hinder and adversely affect the research and work of the group faca exemption congress may exempt an advisory panel from faca requirements as was done in the case of the commission on online child protection and the denali commission when commission is exempted from facas guidelines it also is exempted from complying with gsas management guidelines for advisory committees as result commission would not be required to file an annual report with gsa with membership funding and meeting data it would not have to publish advance notice of meetings in the federal register however the final recommendations of commission can be criticized or ignored if it is perceived that its findings are made without regard to public participation and the consideration of diverse points of view commission termination unless statutorily mandated or otherwise extended by the president or federal officer an advisory committee will automatically terminate two years after its establishment consequently most advisory committees must be rechartered with gsa every two years most statutory national study commissions are mandated so as to terminate 30 days after the submission of final report crs11 appendix commissions created by the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act
