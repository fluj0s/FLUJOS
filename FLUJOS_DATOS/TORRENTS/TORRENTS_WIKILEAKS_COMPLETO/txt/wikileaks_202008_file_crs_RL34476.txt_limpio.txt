ronald orourke specialist in naval affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division navy lpd17 amphibious ship procurement background issues and options for congress summary some members of congress expressed interest in 2008 in the option of procuring 10th san antonio lpd17 class amphibious ship in fy2009 so as to help meet the marine corps goal for amphibious lift capability the navys proposed fy2009 budget did not request funding for 10th lpd17 and instead proposed ending lpd17 procurement with the ninth ship which was procured in fy2008 the navys planned 313ship fleet calls for 31ship amphibious force that includes 10 lpd17s and the marine corps states that 33ship amphibious force that includes 11 lpd17s would be required to fully meet the marine corps amphibious lift goal procurement of 10th lpd17 was the number 2 item on the navys fy2009 unfunded requirements list url and the number 1 item on the marine corps fy2009 url fully funding the procurement of 10th lpd17 in fy2009 the navy and marine corps fy2009 urls stated would cost 1700 million congress as part of its action on the fy2008 defense budget provided 50 million in advance procurement funding for 10th lpd17 the marine corps goal for amphibious lift is to have force of amphibious ships with enough combined lift capacity for the assault echelons aes of two marine expeditionary brigades mebs this goal marine corps officials state reflects responsibilities assigned to marine corps forces in us regional war plans the navys fy2009 30year fy2009fy2038 shipbuilding plan if implemented would achieve and maintain 32 or 33ship amphibious force including nine lpd 17s this 32 or 33ship force would fall short of meeting the 20 meb ae lift goal in terms of square feet of storage space for wheeled vehicles the compromise version of the fy2009 defense appropriations act hr 2638pl 110329 of september 30 2008 provides 9332 million in procurement funding for procuring 10th lpd17 in fy2009 the ship is to be

capability2 the navys proposed fy2009 budget did not request funding for 10th lpd17 and instead proposed ending lpd17 procurement with the ninth ship which was procured in fy2008 the navys proposed fy2009 budget requested 1032 million for lpd17 program closeout costs3 the navys planned 313ship fleet calls for 31ship amphibious force that includes 10 lpd17s4 and the marine corps states that 33ship amphibious force that includes 11 lpd17s would be required to fully meet the marine corps amphibious lift goal procurement of 10th lpd17 was the number 2 item on the navys fy2009 unfunded

shipbuilding plans background and issues for congress by ronald orourke 5 the url is list of items that are not included in the proposed budget for military service for given fiscal year but which the military service would prefer to be funded if additional funding were to be made available to the service for that fiscal year for this reason the urls are sometimes referred to informally as wish lists the military services continued crs2 fy2009 url fully funding the procurement of 10th lpd17 in fy2009 the navy and marine corps fy2009 urls stated would cost 1700 million congress as part of its action on the fy2008 defense budget provided 50 million in advance procurement funding for 10th lpd17 the compromise version of the fy2009 defense appropriations act hr 2638pl 110329 of september 30 2008 provides 9332 million in procurement funding for procuring 10th lpd17 in fy2009 the ship is to be procured using split funding ie twoyear incremental funding with the remainder of the ships procurement cost to be provided in fy2010 the primary issue for congress addressed in this report is whether to procure lpd17s that are in addition to those planned by the navy in its shipbuilding plan an additional related issue addressed in this report is whether the current amphibious lift goal is appropriate congresss decisions on these issues will affect among other things navy and marine corps funding requirements and capabilities and the shipbuilding industrial base background amphibious ships in general functions and uses of amphibious ships amphibious ships are one of four principal categories of combat ships that traditionally have helped define the size and structure of the us navy the other three are submarines aircraft carriers and surface combatants eg cruisers destroyers frigates and littoral combat ships6 the navys amphibious ships are crewed by sailors the primary function of navy amphibious ships is to lift ie transport us marines and their equipment and supplies to distant operating areas and enable marines to conduct expeditionary operations ashore in those areas amphibious ships have berthing spaces for marines flight decks and hangar decks for their helicopters and vertical takeoff and landing vtol fixedwing aircraft well decks for storing and launching their landing craft7 and storage space for their wheeled vehicles their other combat equipment and their supplies although amphibious ships are designed to support marine landings against opposing military forces they can also be used for marine 5 continued submit their urls to congress each year following the submission of the proposed defense budget the number 1 item on the navys fy2009 url is set of improvements to navy p3 maritime patrol aircraft the 10th lpd17 was the number 1 item on the navys fy2008 url 6 the navy also includes mine warfare ships and variety of auxiliary and support ships 7 well deck is large garagelike space in the stern of the ship it can be flooded with water so that landing craft can leave or return to the ship access to the well deck is protected by large stern gate that is somewhat like garage door crs3 landings in socalled permissive or benign situations where there are opposing forces the large storage spaces on amphibious ships and the ability of amphibious ships to use helicopters and landing craft to transfer people equipment and supplies from ship to shore without need for port facilities make amphibious ships potentially useful for range of combat and noncombat operations amphibious ships and their embarked marine forces can be used for launching and conducting largerscale ground combat operations smallerscale strike and counterterrorism operations noncombatant evacuation operations neos peaceenforcement operations operations to train advise and assist foreign military forces other nationbuilding operations such as reconstruction operations peacetime engagement activities such as exercises and disasterresponse and humanitarianassistance operations amphibious ships and their embarked marine forces can also be used for maintaining forwarddeployed naval presence for purposes of deterrence reassurance and maintaining regional stability although the marines have not conducted largescale amphibious assault against opposing military forces since the korean war marine corps officials state that there have been about 85 us amphibious operations of other kinds between 1990 and april 20088 in addition possibility of an amphibious landing can generate tactical benefits even if the landing is not carried out during the 1991 persian gulf war for example the possibility of an amphibious landing by force of about 17000 marines embarked on amphibious ships in the persian gulf tied down several iraqi divisions in coastaldefense positions those iraqi divisions positions were not available for use against uscoalition ground forces moving north from saudi arabia9 types of amphibious ships us navy amphibious ships have designations starting with the letter l as in amphibious landing navy amphibious ships can be divided into two main groups the socalled bigdeck amphibious assault ships designated lha and lhd which look like mediumsized aircraft carriers and the smaller but still sizeable amphibious ships designated lsd or lpd10 which are sometimes called smalldeck amphibious ships the lhas and 8 source for the figure of about 85 amphibious operations between 1990 and april 2008 marine corps briefing to crs on april 25 2008 9 see crs report 91421 f persian gulf war defense policy implications for congress coordinated by ronald orourke p 41 may 15 1991 out of print and available directly from the report coordinator 10 lha can be translated as landing ship helicoptercapable assault lhd can be translated as landing ship helicoptercapable well deck lsd can be translated as landing ship well deck lpd can be translated as landing ship helicopter platform well deck whether noted continued crs4 lhds have large flight decks and hangar decks for embarking and operating numerous helicopters and vtol fixedwing aircraft while the lsds and lpds have much smaller flight decks and hangar decks for embarking and operating smaller numbers of helicopters the lhas and lhds as bigger ships in general can individually embark more marines and equipment than the lsds and lpds forward deployments on any given day some of the navys amphibious ships like some of the navys other ships are forwarddeployed to various overseas operating areas forwarddeployed us navy amphibious ships are often organized into formations called expeditionary strike groups esgs an esg notionally includes three amphibious ships one lha or lhd one lsd and one lpd these three amphibious ships which are referred to as an amphibious ready group arg together can embark marine expeditionary unit meu consisting of about 2200 marines their aircraft their landing craft their combat equipment and about 15 days worth of supplies in addition to the arg and its embarked meu each esg also notionally includes three surface combatants some or all armed with tomahawk cruise missiles one attack submarine and perhaps one or more p3 longrange land based maritime patrol aircraft esgs are designed to be independently deployable strikecapable naval formations but they can also operate in conjunction with carrier strike groups csgs to form larger naval task forces on average two or perhaps three esgs might be forwarddeployed at any given time amphibious ships are also sometimes forwarddeployed on an individual basis to certain lowerthreat operating areas particularly for conducting peacetime engagement activities with foreign countries or for responding to smallerscale contingencies in such deployments an amphibious ship might serve as the core of new kind of navy formation called global fleet station gfs the navy announced the gfs concept in 2006 and is now implementing it in certain areas around the world including the caribbean and the gulf of guinea off the western coast of africa core of gfs consists of an amphibious ship or highspeed sealift ship that is forwarddeployed to region of interest smaller navy ships such as littoral combat ships lcss might then operate in conjunction with this core ship the navy states that the gfs is persistent sea base of operations from which to coordinate and employ adaptive force packages within regional area of interest focusing primarily on phase 0 shaping operations theater security cooperation global maritime awareness and tasks associated specifically with the war on terror gfs offers means to increase regional maritime security through the cooperative efforts of joint interagency and multinational partners as well as nongovernmental organizations11 10 continued in the designation or not all these ships have well decks 11 us department of the navy naval operations concept 2006 washington 2006 pp 30 the navy states further on pages 3031 that like all sea bases the composition of gfs depends on combatant commander requirements the operating environment and the mission from its sea base continued crs5 current inventory of amphibious ships as of the end of fy2008 the navy included the following 32 amphibious ships 7 wasp lhd1 class ships commissioned between 1989 and 2001 each displacing about 40500 tons12 3 tarawa lha1 class ships commissioned between 1976 and 1980 each displacing about 40000 tons 12 whidbey islandharpers ferry lsd4149 class ships commissioned between 1985 and 1998 each displacing about 16000 tons 4 san antonio lpd17 class ships the first commissioned in 2006 each displacing about 26000 tons13 and 6 austin lpd4 class ships commissioned between 1967 and 1971 each displacing about 17000 tons amphibious lift goal14 expressed in terms of mebs the marine corps goal for amphibious lift is to have force of amphibious ships with enough combined lift capacity to simultaneously land the assault echelons aes of two marine expeditionary brigades mebs or 20 meb aes for short this goal marine corps officials state reflects responsibilities assigned to marine corps forces in us regional war plans meb is marine airground task force magtf of 14484 marines and their equipment and supplies the ae of meb is the initial part of the meb to go ashore the remaining part that goes ashore later is called the assault followon echelon afoe marine corps doctrine calls for the ae to go ashore from 11 continued each gfs would serve as selfcontained headquarters for regional operations with the capacity to repair and service all ships small craft and aircraft assigned additionally the gfs might provide classroom space limited medical facilities an information fusion center and some combat service support capability the gfs concept provides leveraged highyield sea based option that achieves persistent presence in support of national objectives additionally it complements more traditional csgesg training and deployment cycles 12 for comparison nimitzclass nuclearpowered aircraft carrier displaces about 100000 tons and cruiser or destroyer displaces about 9000 tons 13 of the nine lpd17s procured through fy2008 three were in service and six were under construction as of the end of fy2008 14 unless otherwise noted

ships and for the afoe to go ashore from lesssurvivable sealift ie cargotype ships controlled by the military sealift command msc the ae of meb includes 10055 of the mebs marines plus equipment and supplies for these 10055 marines the amphibious lift goal as approved by the secretary of defense has changed numerous times since the korean war reflecting changes in strategic or budgetary circumstances one such change occurred in 1991 as the cold war was ending15 the most recent changed occurred in 2006 when the goal was reduced from 25 meb aes to 20 meb aes table 1 shows amphibious

2906 navy personnel b mef stands for marine expeditionary force marine airground task force with more than twice as many troops as meb in discussions of the current 20 meb ae amphibious lift goal the ae part is often dropped for convenience even though the current requirement still relates to meb aes rather than complete mebs marine corps officials state that the 2006 reduction in the amphibious lift goal to 20 meb aes is acceptable because the navy and marine corps also plan to field new squadron of 14 nextgeneration maritime prepositioning force ships called the maritime prepositioning force of the future or mpff the planned 14ship mpff squadron which is to include three modified lhalhdtype ships and 11 sealift ie cargotransport ships is to have capability for putting an additional meb ashore unlike the amphibious ship force the mpff squadron is not intended as assault shipping the sealift ships in the mpff squadron have less survivability and selfdefense capability than the navys amphibious ships and are therefore considered unsuitable for use in forcibleentry operations mpff ships 15 key events marking the end of the cold war include fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 and the disintegration of the soviet union in december 1991 crs7 however are in general less expensive to procure than amphibious ships and they are designed to remain prepositioned at sea in theater of interest for long periods of time before returning the port for maintenance together the navys amphibious ship force and the mpff squadron are to provide total of 30 meb aes of lift or 30165 troops translated into numbers of amphibious ships the marine corps states the 20 meb ae amphibious lift goal translates into requirement for force of 33 amphibious ships including 11 lhaslhds 11 lsd4149 class ships and 11 lpd17s in explaining how the requirement for 20 meb aes translates into this 33ship requirement the marine corps states the following given the lift capabilities of the navys current amphibious ships each meb ae would require 19 operational amphibious ships to lift 6 lhaslhds 7 lsd4149s and 6 lpd17s to arrive at more fiscally constrained goal the marine corps reduced the above 19ship total to 17 operational ships 5 lhaslhds 7 lsd4149s and 5 lpd17s this 17ship force requires about 11 of the meb aes vehicles to be shifted to the afoe which creates degree of operational risk this 17ship force was presented to navy officials in mid2007 to arrive at stillmore fiscally constrained goal navy and marine corps officials in mid2007 agreed to reduce the 17ship total to 15 operational ships 5 of each kind this 15ship force requires about 20 of the meb aes vehicles and about 12 of its cargo to be shifted to the afoe which creates an additional degree of operational risk the marine corps testified in april 2008 that each meb ae requires seventeen amphibious warfare ships however given current fiscal constraints the navy and marine corps have agreed to assume degree of operational risk by limiting the assault echelon of each meb by using only fifteen ships per meb16 16 statement of lieutenant general james f amos deputy commandant of the marine corps combat development and integration before the senate armed services committee subcommittee on seapower concerning shipbuilding and force structure on april 08 2008 pp 67 italics as in the

increase its activeduty end strength from about 180400 at the end of fy2007 to 202000 by the end of fy2011 marine corps end strength like the amphibious lift goal has changed over time changes in marine end strength do not necessarily imply parallel changes in the amphibious lift goal in discussions this year on the amphibious lift goal marine corps officials have not argued that the current expansion in marine corps end strength calls for increasing the amphibious lift goal april 2008 marine corps testimony for additional discussion of the amphibious lift goal see appendix which presents april 2008 marine corps testimony on the topic programmed amphibious force although the marine corps states that 33ship amphibious force including 11 lpd17s would be needed to fully meet the amphibious lift goal the navys 313ship plan calls for 31ship amphibious force including 10 lpd17s in discussing the 31ship objective the navys february 2008 report on the navys fy2009 30year shipbuilding plan stated that the department of the navy is reviewing options to increase assault echelon amphibious lift to 33 ships to meet usmc requirements18 the report also states the commandant of the marine corps has determined that minimum of 33 amphibious ships is necessary to support their assault echelon lift 18 us navy report to congress on annual longrange plan for construction of naval vessels for fy 2009 p 5 crs10 requirements specifically he has requested force of 11 aviation capable amphibious ships 11 lpds and 11 lsds the chief of naval operations supports the commandants determination19 although the navys planned 313ship fleet includes 31ship force including 10 lpd17s the navys fy2009 30year fy2009fy2038 shipbuilding plan if implemented would achieve and maintain an amphibious force of 32 or 33 ships the number varies from year to year including nine lpd17s this 32 or 33ship force also includes the 12 existing lsd4149 class ships and assumes service life extensions for certain existing amphibious ships20 table 4 shows the marine corps calculation of the amount of amphibious lift relative to the 20 meb lift goal resulting from this 32 or 33ship amphibious force the table presents the five different elements of amphibious lift in the table figure of 10 in cell would meet 100 of the 20 meb lift goal for that lift element figure of 15 would

for construction of naval vessels for fy 2009 p a3 20 amphibious ships typically have service lives of 35 or 40 years the navys report on the fy2009 30year shipbuilding plan assumes service life extensions for four existing amphibious ships two lpd4s whose service lives are to be extended to 45 years and 47 years and two lha1s whose service lives are to be extended 43 years department of the navy report to congress on annual longrange plan for construction of naval vessels for fy 2009 washington 2008 february 2008 p a3 in addition cbo testified in march 2008 that the plan also appears to assume an extension of the service lives of the 12 lsd4149 class ships from an earlier goal of 38 years to new goal of 42 years cbo testimony statement of eric j labs senior analyst on current and projected navy shipbuilding programs before the subcommittee on seapower and expeditionary forces committee on armed services us house of representatives march 14 2008 p 27 crs11 exceed the lift goal for troops space for cargo and spaces for lcac landing craft and fall short of meeting the lift goal for space for vehicles21 the projected shortfall in space for vehicles the marine corps says would mean that the 32 or 33ship amphibious force would not be able by itself to simultaneously land 20 fully equipped meb aes the navys report on the fy2009 30year shipbuilding plan states that while the mix of the 33 amphibious ships reflected in this plan differs slightly from the usmc requirement it represents acceptable risk considering the amphibious ships planned for decommissioning are not scheduled for dismantling or sinking to permit mobilization at later date if required the decommissioning ships are being replaced with newer more capable lpd 17 and lha 6 class ships the navy will maintain the 33ship requirement for amphibious shipping through the fydp while these new ships are integrated into the battleforce consequently there will be amphibious ship capability gaps through at least fy 201922 lpd17 program replacements for older amphibious ships the navy initiated the lpd17 program in the 1990s to provide replacement ships for the navys aging austin lpd4 class amphibious ships which entered service between 1965 and 1971 and three other older classes of amphibious ships that have already been removed from navy service construction shipyards lpd17s are built primarily by the avondale shipyard near new orleans and the ingalls shipyard near pascagoula ms that form part of northrop grumman shipbuilding ngsb23 procurement profile as shown in table 5 the first lpd17 was procured in fy1996 and total of nine have been procured through fy2008 as of the end of fy2007 the first three had entered service 21 although surplus is projected in space for cargo that surplus is

substantially more expensive to build than originally estimated the design and construction of the first ship were delayed by about two years delays in building the first ships were primary reason for the fy2001fy2002 hiatus in lpd17 procurement shown in table 5 the first and second ships were delivered to the navy in incomplete form and numerous construction problems have been identified on the first two ships for additional details see appendix b lpd17 program in proposed fy2009 budget as mentioned earlier the navys proposed fy2009 budget did not request funding for 10th lpd17 and instead requested 1032 million for lpd17 program closeout costs procurement of 10th lpd17 however was the number 2 item on the navys fy2009 unfunded requirements list url and the number 1 item on the marine corps fy2009 url fully funding the procurement of 10th lpd17 in fy2009 the navy and marine corps fy2009 urls stated would cost 1700 million this 1700 million would be in addition to the 50 million in advance procurement funding for the ship that congress provided as part of its action on the fy2008 defense budget making the total estimated procurement cost of the ship 1750 million the navy testified in march 2008 that by addressing the 10th lpd in the fy 2010 budget development process the navy will still be able to leverage warm lpd17 production line albeit with inherent inefficiencies however with competing priorities within dod there is guarantee that this 10th ship will be appropriated significant efforts are required to begin planning for the possibility that the production line will be closed as we near the lpd 25 delivery ie the delivery of the ninth ship in 2012 starting in fy 2009 the navy will begin to cover infrastruture like costs related to the lpd 17 production

resources and ms allison stiller deputy assistant secretary of the navy ship programs before the subcommittee on seapower and continued crs13 issues for congress funding for additional lpd17s in assessing the issue of whether to procure lpd17s that are in addition to those in the navys shipbuilding plan congress may consider several factors including those discussed below potential operational implications of not meeting lift goal falling short of the 20 meb amphibious lift goal could preclude or increase the operational risk associated with attempting largerscale amphibious landing which could in turn affect us military options in major regional conflict where the us objective is to evict significant opposing conventional military forces from land area that borders onto the sea potential example of such situation would be conflict on the korean peninsula scenario that has low likelihood of occurring on any given day but which could have significant implications for us security if it were to occur falling short of the 20 meb ae goal could also reduce the navys ability to use amphibious ships for conducting other kinds of operations that are more likely to occur on daytoday basis such as those listed earlier in the section on functions and uses of amphibious ships potential impact on other programs reducing funding for one or more other navy or dod programs so as to make funding available for lpd17 procurement could have its own resulting operational implications which might then be weighed against the operational benefits of additional lpd17 procurement service life extensions for amphibious ships as mentioned earlier the navys projected 32 or 33ship amphibious force assumes service life extensions for certain existing amphibious ships if the navy is not able to achieve all of these service life extensions because of limits on ship maintenance funding or future discoveries of significant problems in the ships material condition then the total number of amphibious ships in service in certain future years will be lower than the navy projects and the amount of amphibious lift capability in certain future years will be less than that shown in table 4 conversely if the navy is able and chooses to extend the lives of these ships even further than currently planned then the amount of amphibious lift capability in certain future years will be less than that shown in table 4 planned mpff squadron as discussed earlier the 2006 reduction in the amphibious lift goal to 20 meb aes is acceptable to the marine corps in part because the planned mpff squadron is to provide capability for putting an additional meb ashore if because of budget constraints or other factors some or all of the mpff ships are not procured shortfalls in combined amphibious shipmpff lift could be greater than what would be suggested by looking solely at the amphibious ship figures in table 4 24 continued expeditionary forces of the house armed services committee on navy force structure and shipbuilding march 14 2008 pp 78 crs14 industrial base procuring 10th lpd17 would provide additional lpd17 related work to the shipyards and supplier firms involved in building lpd17s although lpd17s are built primarily by the avondale and ingalls shipyards that form part of ngsb other shipyards such as general dynamics bath iron works gdbiw of bath are capable of building them25 if additional funding for lpd17 procurement is made available by reducing funding for other navy or dod procurement programs that could reduce workloads for the firms involved in those programs an april 2008 press report stated that congressional approval of the 10th lpd17 amphibious assault ship would be huge help to getting northrop grummans gulf coast shipbuilding workforce fully back on its feet after the hurricane katrina disaster the companys president of shipbuilding said last week it has been nearly three years since the hurricane wrecked the gulf coast damaging the companys ingalls shipyard in pascagoula ms and displacing members of the yards workforce from their homes to date that workforce is not yet at full strength said mike petters president of northrop grumman shipbuilding in brief interview april 24 with inside the navy an additional ship will be essential for the maturation of the workforce petters said we are working our way through several ship deliveries over the next 24 months he said the challenge that i see is as we come through those deliveries what then he added that putting lot of energy into increasing the workforces capability in building ships and then taking away its work few years down the road would not be good for either the company or the navy the issue for is lets think about whats the workload in 2011 and 2012 he said thats why weve been interested in getting the next lpd funding because i think you have to do that now so you can actually have it there to be built in 2011 or 201226 25 the navy in 1996 awarded the contract to design and build the first lpd17 to an industry team that included avondale shipbuilding which was then independently owned by its employees and gdbiw under the teams arrangement avondale was to have built eight of thenplanned class of 12 lpd17s while gdbiw was to have built four in 1999 avondale was acquired by litton industries and in 2001 northrop purchased litton becoming avondales owner on june 17 2002 the navy signed memorandum of understanding mou with gd and northrop under which gdbiws four lpd17s were transferred to northrop and gdbiw in exchange received four additional ddg 51class destroyers that were to have been built by northrop see dod press release 31102 of june 17 2002 navy signs mou to transfer ship construction available

lpd17 could be affected by when the ship is procured if the interval between the 9th ship which was procured in fy2008 and the 10th ship grows beyond certain point the procurement cost of the 10th ship could increase because of break in the lpd17 production learning curve and the incurring of lpd17 production line restart costs the navy testified in april 2008 that if you look at the industrial base and where we are in the lpd production i would say that you could wait until fy2010 to buy that 10th ship with little bit more risk than if you were to procure it in fy2009 but beyond that you would definitely end up with cold production line27 some observers have proposed using the basic lpd17 hull design as the basis for building other kinds of ships for the navy such as the navys planned jccx joint command ship which the navy wants to procure in fy2012 the lsdx the navys projected replacement for the lsd4149 class ships or naval gunfire support version of the basic lpd17 hull which is an option that has been suggested by both cbo and robert work of the center for strategic and budgetary analyses csba28 advocates of building such ships might argue that their procurement costs could be minimized by keeping the lpd17 production line open and avoiding break in the learning curve for producing the basic lpd17 hull amphibious lift goal factors to consider in assessing the issue of whether the marine corps amphibious lift goal is appropriate congress may consider several factors including those discussed below future security environment changes in the international security environment could affect future demands for amphibious ships for performing various missions changes in the political or military situation on the korean peninsula for example could affect demands for amphibious ships for potential use in korean peninsula conflict scenarios while changes in population patterns weather patterns commodity prices or the policies of foreign governments could affect future demands for amphibious ships for performing disasterresponse or humanitarian assistance operations potential to meet demands with other forces it is possible that certain demands for us navy amphibious ships might be met in other ways for example by other us forces or by allied or coalition military forces the us army has forcibleentry forces such as such as the 82nd airborne division and the us army and us air force have substantial logistics capabilities for conducting disaster 27 transcript of spoken remarks of allison stiller deputy assistant secretary of the navy ship programs at

version of the lpd17 hull including citations from cbo and csba reports see crs report rl32109 navy ddg1000 destroyer program background oversight issues and options for congress by ronald orourke crs16 response and humanitarianrelief operations the capabilities and limitations of amphibious ships however differ from those of other us forces consequently depending on the military or geographic circumstances using amphibious ships might be the preferred option or the only option for conducting certain operations in addition other us forces have their own mission responsibilities and consequently might not always be available to act as substitutes for amphibious ships some allied or coalition navies include amphibious ships that are potentially suitable for meeting demands that might otherwise be met by us navy amphibious ships the number of amphibious ships in these navies however is relatively small and the capabilities of these ships are not always equal to that of us navy amphibious ships in addition foreign amphibious ships might not always be available to perform operations of interest to the united states either because they are in maintenance or already committed to performing other missions or because the allied or coalition governments for their own reasons do not want their amphibious ships to be used for the missions in question even when foreign amphibious ships are available for conducting an operation us officials might still prefer to conduct it with us navy amphibious ships so that the united states can receive the political credit for conducting it reduction in operational ships per meb as mentioned earlier the marine corps testified in april 2008 that in limiting each meb ae to 15 ships the navy and marine corps agreed to assume degree of operational risk as shown in table 3 using 17 or 19 operational amphibious ships per meb ae so as to reduce operational risk would generate goal for an amphibious force of more than 33 ships including more than 11 lpd17s competing demands for funding in situation of constrained defense resources increasing the amphibious lift goal could reduce the amount of funding available for other navy or dod funding priorities conversely reducing the amphibious lift goal could increase the amount of funding available for other navy or dod priorities constraints on defense resources could require making tradeoffs between various defense program goals october 2008 press report on draft navy document in october 2008 it was reported that draft version of navy document called the naval operational concept noc suggests increasing the planned size of the amphibious fleet by adding second lpd to each deployed amphibious ready group arg proposal that if implemented would increase the planned size of the amphibious force and the planned number of lpd17s by few or several ships the press report on the draft noc stated that the force structure data sheet associated with the draft noc appears to link numbers of certain ship types with requirements as stated in the draft noc but contains number of areas where information is incomplete among its highlights the ideal amphibious ready group arg to transport marine expeditionary unit meu is four ships bigdeck assault ship lha or lhd dock landing ship lsd and two amphibious transport dock ships lpd crs17 one with enhanced command and control capabilities this is an expansion of the 3ship formation that has been used over the past decade the fourship arg would support split operations by twosection argmeu and provide the ability to more widely disperse the platforms that carry the marines and the ability to embark more capability on the smaller dispersed entities to meet this need the amphibious ship requirement would need to be raised from the current 32 ships to 36 the use of amphibious ships to support special operations forces and mine countermeasures forces also pushes the requirement to 36 ships the document said the value of using amphibious ships to support the five global fleet stations gfss locations further pushes the number of gators assuming that at any time two ships would be deployed on gfs missions and

committee is not convinced the seabase should be composed of noncombatant vessels such as the planned mpf aviation ship mpf lha and the mpf landing platform ship mpf mlp the committee directs the secretary of the navy along with the chief of naval operations and the commandant of the marine corps to report to the congressional defense committees within 60 crs19 days after the date of enactment of this act on the size and composition of the naval amphibious force necessary without the mpf lha and mpf mlp vessels to conduct operations from seabase with force comprising two marine expeditionary brigades meb page 83 the report also states the committee notes the many humanitarian assistance and disaster response missions undertaken by the department of defense each year the committee is also aware of the central role placed on humanitarian assistance and disaster response in the new maritime strategy jointly authored by the navy marine corps and coast guard entitled cooperative strategy for 21st century seapower the new strategy declares that preventing wars is as important as winning wars and that executing the strategy will require globally distributed missiontailored maritime force packages the committee therefore directs the secretary of defense to undertake comprehensive review of current and projected personnel and equipment requirements to meet the humanitarian assistance and disaster response missions described in the new maritime strategy the committee further directs the secretary to review current naval vessels that perform this mission

lift goal the marine corps testified in april 2008 as follows shipbuilding requirements based on strategic guidance in the last several years the navy and marine corps have accepted risk in our nations forcible entry capacity and reduced amphibious lift from 30 meb assault echelon ae to 20 meb ae in the budgetary arena the value of amphibious ships is too often assessed exclusively in terms of forcible entry discounting their demonstrated usefulness across the range of operations and the clear imperative for marines embarked aboard amphibious ships to meet phase 0 demands the ability to transition between those two strategic goalposts and to respond to every missiontasking in between will rely on strong navymarine corps team and the amphibious ships that facilitate our bond the navy and marine corps have worked diligently to determine the minimum number of amphibious ships necessary to satisfy the nations needs the marine corps contribution to the nations forcible entry requirement is single simultaneouslyemployed two meb assault capability as part of seabased mef although not part of the mef ae third reinforcing meb is required and will be provided through mpff shipping each meb ae requires seventeen amphibious warfare ships resulting in an overall ship requirement for thirtyfour amphibious warfare ships however given current fiscal constraints the navy and marine corps have agreed to assume degree of operational risk by limiting the assault echelon of each meb by using only fifteen ships per meb in other words battle force that provides thirty operationally available amphibious warfare ships amphibious ships in that thirtyship battle force ten aviationcapable big deck ships lha lhd lhar ten lpd 17 class ships and ten lsd class ships are

construction problems this appendix provides details on cost growth and construction problems in the lpd17 program cost growth the congressional budget office cbo testified in july 2007 that the first lpd17 experienced cost growth of about 70 and is on perton basis the most expensive amphibious ship ever built for the navy33 when lpd17 procurement began followon ships in the class were estimated to cost roughly 750 million each estimated procurement costs for the followon ships subsequently grew to figures between about 1200 million and about 1500 million the navy estimates the procurement cost of the ninth ship at 1782 million relatively small portion of the cost growth in the program since its inception is attributable to the decision to reduce the programs sustaining procurement rate from two ships per year to one ship per year most of the programs cost growth is attributable to other causes34 33 cbo testimony statement of j michael gilmore assistant director for national security and

httpwwwacqosdmilaraamsar2006decsstpdf states that in thenyear dollars changes in the lpd17 programs production schedule including the reduction in annual procurement rate account for 7681million in increased costs for the program or about 112 of the increased costs caused by all factors the other factors leading to increased costs were economic errors meaning errors in projected rates of inflation which account for 3617 million estimating errors which account for 46488 million and other which accounts for 10934 million the lpd17 programs total cost was also reduced by 40378 million because of the reduction in program quantity from an originally planned total of 12 ships to the currently planned total of 9 ships the resulting net change in the programs estimated cost is an increase of 28322 million crs24 construction problems the first lpd17 which was procured in fy1996 encountered roughly two year delay in design and construction it was presented to the navy for acceptance in late june 2005 navy inspection of the ship conducted june 27july 1 2005 found numerous construction deficiencies35 the navy accepted delivery of lpd17 with about 11 million hours of construction work remaining to be done on the ship this equated to about 87 of the total hours needed to build the ship and with material costs included about 7 of the total cost to build the ship the navy accepted delivery of lpd18 with about 400000 hours of construction work remaining to be done on the ship this equated to about 33 of the total hours needed to build the ship the navy accepted delivery of lpd19 with about 45000 hours of construction work remaining to be done on the ship this equated to about 04 of the total hours needed to build the ship the navy stated that it accepted lpd17 in incomplete condition for four reasons it permitted the fleet to begin sooner the process of evaluating lpd 17 through operational use so as to identify problems with the lpd 17 class design that need to be fixed in followon lpd17s it avoided further delays in giving the lpd17s crew an opportunity to conduct postdelivery tests and trial events that are intended to identify construction as opposed to class design problems with lpd17 itself it permitted lpd17 to leave the shipyard sooner and thereby mitigated schedule and cost impacts on other ships being built at the shipyard other lpd17s lhd8 and ddg51s that would have resulted from having lpd17 remain in the shipyard longer it reduced the cost of the remaining construction work to be done on lpd17 because the work in question could be performed by repair shipyards that charge lower rates for their work than the construction shipyard 35 associated press shipbuilder navy will accept new vessel navytimescom july 21 2005

in the scn account line item that is included in ship end cost the government accountability office gao testified in july 2007 that the navy moved forward with ambitious schedules for constructing lpd 17 and the littoral combat ship despite significant challenges in stabilizing the designs for these ships as result construction work has been performed out of sequence and significant rework has been required disrupting the optimal construction sequence and application of lessons learned for followon vessels in these programs in the lpd 17 program the navys reliance on an immature design tool led to problems that affected all aspects of the lead ships design without stable design work was often delayed from early in the building cycle to later during integration of the hull shipbuilders stated that doing the work at this stage could cost up to five times the original cost the lead ship in the lpd class was delivered to the warfighter incomplete and with numerous mechanical failures resulting in lower than promised level of capability these problems continue today 2 years after the navy accepted delivery of lpd 17 recent sea trials of the ship revealed problems with lpd 17s

particularly in connection with the lpd17 program according to these news reports winters letter contained the following statements among others although not necessarily in the order shown below i am deeply concerned about northrop grumman ship systems ngss ability to recover in the aftermath of hurricane katrina particularly in regard to construction of lpd 17 class vessels i am equally concerned about ngss ability to construct and deliver ships that conform to the quality standards maintained by the navy and that adhere to the cost and schedule commitments agreed upon at the outset by both ngss and the navy even prior to katrina ngsss performance was marginal resulting in significant cost overruns that forces the navy to take delivery of the lpd17 with numerous outstanding deficiencies ngss inefficiency and mismanagement of lpd 17 put the navy in an untenable position by taking delivery of ships with serious quality problems the fleet has suffered unacceptable delays in obtaining deployable assets twentythree months after commissioning of lpd 17 the navy still does not have missioncapable ship these delays create further problems as work must be completed or redone by other shipyards that are not as familiar with the ships design the navy also took delivery of lpd18 uss new orleans in an incomplete fashion albeit more complete than lpd17 persistent shortcomings at the ngss yards are troubling and causing not only grave concern about the lpd program but also the lha and ddg1000 programs the navy does not wish to find itself in the same situation with other ships that it faces with lpd 17 18 it is imperative that ngss deliver future ships devoid of significant quality problems and that it meet its cost and schedule obligations one press report stated continued focused management is necessary to successfully deliver the remainder of the class according to winter crs27 navy acquisition executive dr delores etter will be closely monitoring metrics with ngss and the acquisition team as we move forward38 sugar reportedly sent reply letter to winter dated june 29 2007 according to one press report sugar stated in the letter i share your concern regarding the need to fully recover and improve our shipyards and produce completed lpd 17 class vessels of the highest quality with increasing efficiency irrespective of hurricane katrina northrop has much work to do to meet the needs of the us navy39 another press report stated northrop grumman corp noc has much more work to do to improve its performance on navy ships but problems with 136billion amphibious ship program were not solely the contractors making chief executive ron sugar said in june 29 letter the original acquisition strategy was changed after contract award there was funding instability limited early funding for critical vendor information and the integrated navycontractor design team produced constant design churn and thousands of design changes sugar wrote responding to tersely worded letter from navy secretary donald winter northrop certainly had performance problems but the unprecedented effects of hurricane katrina which severely damaged northrops three shipyards in the gulf region in august 2005 only served to greatly exacerbate the situation sugar said he shared winters concerns and vowed that northrop would invest train and manage its operations to produce navy ships of the highest quality with increasing efficiency irrespective of hurricane katrina northrop has much more work to do to meet the needs of the us navy we are not happy with this history sugar added in the letter obtained by reuters but we are incorporating the lessons from this experience into our operational plans going forward for new ships in the design planning and production stages he noted that navy recently praised northrops work on destroyer that was damaged by hurricane katrina and termed it one of the best ships ever delivered 38 sources for these reported passages

sugar said40 after working to overcome construction problems navy officials in late2007 stated that they were cautiously optimistic that the lpd17 construction effort is stabilizing december 24 2007 press report stated as the navy gears up for the first deployment of the new san antonioclass amphibious transport dock slated for next year senior service shipbuilding official is cautiously optimistic the oncebeleaguered program is on track on dec 15 the navy commissioned the third ship the mesa verde in panama city fla it was the first ship in the class to be delivered without significant problems the san antonio class faced difficulties beginning in late 1998 when the initial construction contract was awarded to avondale industries in new orleans avondale beat out litton ingalls shipbuilding primarily because it planned to use new computer program to design the ships the first time navy ship was designed entirety using computer tools but the computer systems didnt work the navy kept making design changes costs escalated and major delays ensued litton ingalls bought avondale in 1999 its owners mistakenly thinking they could fix the program and in late 2000 the shipyards were acquired by northrop grumman meanwhile succession of service program managers and acquisition executives struggled to hold down the design changes and manage costs which have more than doubled from the 750 million per ship the navy forecast in the late 1990s all those problems and more affected the first two ships of the class the san antonio was delivered incomplete in mid2005 the navy accepted the ship knowing it had numerous construction defects many of which would need to be fixed at extra costs after the shipyards obligation period ended the next ship the new orleans was delivered in december 2007 also with incomplete spaces to make things more challenging hurricane katrina had wreaked havoc on the new orleansbased avondale shipyard in 2005 nevertheless construction on the mesa verde the third new ship went more smoothly the mesa verde was built at northrop grummans ingalls shipyard in pascagoula miss the mesa verde sets new standard for the lpd class as far as being complete ship capt beth dexter the navys supervisor of shipbuilding in 40 andrea shalalesa northrop says katrina exacerbated ship problems reuters july 10 2007 crs29 pascagoula told military times in september my navy team is proud to present it robert work naval analyst at the center for strategic and budgetary assessments in washington said it looks like the lpd 17 program is pulling away from its checkered past he said it appears the program is getting back on track and that it will be exciting to see the first ship as it enters the fleet american shipbuilders have historically had difficulties with lead ships he said stiller told navy times that after hurricane katrina the navy reestablished new milestones to measure the new ships progress so far each ship under construction is meeting these marks she said i believe we are turning the corner stiller said in 2008 she said she hopes the service and industry will be able to not just meet but beat these milestones41 in august 2008 it was reported that the maiden deployment of lpd17 was delayed by two days due to problems with hydraulic system that controls the stern gate used to gain access to the ships well deck42 in august 2008 it was also reported that just under two years after the amphibious transport dock new orleans lpd18 was delivered incomplete the amphib still cant perform the central mission for which it was designed carrying marines their gear and their vehicles into battle according to recent report by the navys board of inspection and survey or insurv the san diegobased new orleans was degraded in its ability to conduct sustained combat operations and has slew of other problems according to the inspection conducted aug 1115 the report obtained by navy times paints the picture of ship not only troubled by the same technical problems as its older sibling the firstinclass gator san antonio but also with many of its own the ship cannot support embarked troops cargo or landing craft the report said navy engineers found serious materials deficiencies in the well deck and vehicle stowage areas the well decks ventilation fans didnt work the vehicle ramps were inoperative and berthing for marines and the ships crew was found to be unsatisfactory 41 zachary m peterson troubled amphib program appears on track navytimescom december 24 2007 see also dan taylor

lost power forcing crews to reset their computer systems the new orleans insurv arrived just as the norfolk vabased san antonio lpd17 is preparing to make its maiden deployment this week that ship was delivered three years ago also incomplete like the san antonio the new orleans electrical system had shipwide problems according to navy inspectors significant electrical and electronic cable plant installation deficiencies exist navy inspectors wrote including deadended cables cables improperly bundled and banded cables exceeding nesting capacity inadequate packing of cables at watertight penetrations the findings make for total of three ships with widespread electrical problems that were built at northrop grummans shipyards along the gulf coast the first two san antonios and the amphibious assault ship makin island lhd 8 northrop grumman announced earlier this year that it had to delay the delivery of the makin island by six months to fix its wiring problems the company agreed to bear the roughly 360 million cost margaret mitchelljones spokeswoman for northrop grumman said the company did not comment on ships it has already delivered to the navy but in written statement tuesday she said the san antonio class was constantly improving while we dont comment on the capabilities of commissioned ships we can say that with each lpd we continue to make significant improvements in all areas and this includes the electrical systems the latest lpd green bay will be delivered this week to the us navy and from material and systems standpoint was more complete than any other lpd at acceptance trials this is testament to the benefits of series ship production and our ability to come down the learning curve resulting in greater efficiencies43 in september 2008 it was reported that after facing bevy of negative survey results for the first two lpd17class ships the navy appears to be headed in the right direction moving away from incomplete work and into serial production navy official said earlier this year the uss new orleans lpd18 came under fire for poor showing by the navys board of inspection and survey insurv last year the uss san antonio lpd17 the

navy was facing challenges with the construction schedule for lpd17 eventually the navy was forced to take delivery of the ship early because they had money to complete the work allison stiller deputy assistant secretary of the navy ships told defense daily in recent interview with lpd18 we knew we were going to be in similar situation financiallythat we were going to have to take delivery with lot less incomplete she said although not nearly to the extent of lpd17 as the navy and northrop grumman noc ship systems began work on the uss mesa verde lpd19 they began to believe that this ship too would have to be delivered incomplete but the combined effort of the shipyard and the navy helped deliver completed ship she added lpd19 wrapped up her shock trials and the navy is now compiling the date from the tests stiller added we saw what we expected to see there were surprises from the shock trial she said the uss green bay lpd20 was just delivered and the followon ships are looking good stiller noted stiller acknowledges there were concerns about delivering finished lpds until the mesa verde northrop grumman had not delivered completed lpd certainly there are still challenges in getting the ship delivered but we are in serial production she said the yard is working hard at it the ships are delivering we are seeing reduced trial cards on everyone of them thats the trend you want to see its good news to get into serial production doubt about it44 in october 2008 it was reported that the us navys third and fourth san antonioclass amphibious transport docks show distinct improvement over the troubled first two ships in the class inspectors have found according to reports by the navys board of inspection and survey the third ship mesa verde lpd19 was much more complete than its earlier siblings when it was accepted by the navy sept 27 2007 44 geoff fein navy seeing improvements in lhd lpdclass ships official says defense daily september 23 2008 12 ellipsis and brackets as in original crs32 and in their report on the fourth ship green bay lpd20 inspectors included something never seen before in an inspection report referred to as an insurv about an lpd 17class ship compliment green bay was found to be highly capable and well built ship they wrote the main spaces fit finish and cleanliness were satisfactory to be sure each insurv still found many problems aboard each ship and it concluded mesa verde was degraded in its ability to conduct sustained combat operations as was new orleans overall however the two inspections seemed to reinforce statements by the navy and shipbuilder northrop grumman that the san antonio class is gradually improving after its initial misfires according to veteran skipper who examined the documents the reports showed that overall build quality on mesa verde and green bay was much improved over san antonio and new orleans and neither amphib seemed to have experienced as many problems with shipwide networks or electrical systems as the first two neither new ship had major problems with their propulsion systems as the first two did other major problems from the san antonio and new orleans including incomplete berthing spaces broken gear in the galleys and medical spaces and nonfunctioning weapons didnt reoccur in mesa verde or green bay meanwhile years of work have helped transform san antonio from one of the navys most infamous ships into fully functional member of the fleet the ships captain said in conference call with reporters oct 6 cmdr kurt kastner said san antonio has had major problems since it sailed in august from norfolk as part of the iwo jima expeditionary strike group45 in november 2008 it was reported that the troubled amphibious transport dock san antonio in the middle of its first deployment has been forced to undergo two weeks of maintenance in bahrain due to leaks in its lube oil piping system navy officials said they had scheduled port visit said lt nate christensen spokesman for 5th fleet in bahrain theyre in port for two weeks for maintenance availability on some lube oil deficiencies its related to the diesel generators pat dolan spokeswoman at

central command spokesman lt nathan christensen the leaky pipes support two of the ships four main diesel engines the lieutenant explained the 684foot san antonio was scheduled for port visit in bahrain in the middle of this month but the visit was moved up due to the piping system problem christensen noted the ship has flexible twoweek maintenance period built into its deployment which is now being used to examine and correct the current problem the leaks were first discovered oct 9 and second incident on oct 17 prompted the need for thorough inspection lt clay doss navy spokesman at the pentagon told itn inside the navy nov 6 we are confident this issue is limited to lpd17 only doss said an engineering team from norfolk va is in bahrain investigating the situation he added the team consists of pipefitters welders engineering testing inspectors and other related personnel47 later in november 2008 it was reported that experts who have examined the photos of major oil leaks aboard the amphibious transport dock san antonio are calling the workmanship on the new amphib sloppy unacceptable and criminal one former chief engineer said any other cheng chief of engineering in the navy would be thankful this wasnt their ship but it is someones ship and despite the fingerpointing experts say the navy has serious problem on its hands the secretary has been briefed on the issue and has been getting periodic extended updates about the progress of the repairs said capt beci brenton spokeswoman for navy secretary donald winter while the brass is watching and the

holly spokesman for the republican side of the house armed services committee said members continue to follow san antonios challenges the seapower subcommittee is aware of the most recent issues although the navy has not briefed us yet rep joe sestak dpa former vice admiral said after viewing the photos it looks like more of systemic problem from when it was built the ones who suffer are the bluejackets said sestak member of the house armed services committee and former top warfare requirements and programs officer for the navy naval analyst and author norman polmar put it more bluntly its criminal its criminal that the navy accepted this ship he said and this is two and half years after the navy accepted the ship its bad enough that it was delivered this way polmar said he thinks the san antonio should be towed back to the shipyard as taxpayer and as naval analyst he said im fuming whos to blame those familiar with the situation do not blame the crew or navy engineers for the problem comparing it with the discovery of flaw in your cars chassis during road trip you may have topped off the oil and filled the gas tank before you left they say but you cant be expected to examine work completed long ago when the car was built at the auto plant even those responsible for ensuring the material condition of the fleet the ultracritical board of inspection and survey do so under certain assumptions one navy source said even insurv wouldnt have found faulty welds the navy source said cmdr jensin sommer spokeswoman for 2nd fleet said her command certifies units for deployment and for integrated training with carrier and expeditionary strike groups so theyre ready for integrated operations crs35 thats different type of readiness than material condition she added pat dolan spokeswoman for naval sea systems command said naval engineers declined request to explain the damage because they refused to comment on photos that had not been officially released the photos were posted on blog and later authenticated by dolan she did say that when the ship pulled into bahrain it was greeted by crew of more than 30 engineers pipefitters and welders flown to bahrain from the us as of nov 13 there were initial cost estimates and available progress reports were still looking at mid to late november for the repairs to be completed dolan said she added that engineers are conducting rootcause analysis and the repair and ship crews are fixing the flaws noting some that require replacing whole sections of pipe earlier dolan said the oil leaks had not posed danger to sailors working near them other problems lurking naval experts and engineers familiar with the san antonios history are concerned that if these welding problems went undiscovered until now what other problems are waiting to pop up jan van tol retired captain who commanded the amphibious assault ship essex said he had deployments during his career commanding three ships that were interrupted by major breakdowns and that its not unusual to have technical experts come aboard but the size of the repair team and the nature of this casualty is notable he said it surprises to see oil leaking from such major points i associate leaks with moving parts he said whats unusual is the sheer number of people who are going out to address what appears to be widerranging problem van tol said he thinks any such flaw if detected would have prevented the ships deployment so how did the ship get as far as it did are these systemic problems in one or more of the ships systems and physical plant if they are that goes to the question of craftsmanship and why did the navy accept the ship are there shipwide problems of similar nature of poor craftsmanship and quality assurance who made the decisions to allow it to reach this point he said it raises the question of supervision and oversight both at the shipyard and on the navys side he wont go as far as other critics but he did say the situation certainly doesnt look good crs36 its imperative to take harsh harsh look at how they got to this place the navy really needs to learn some harsh lessons he said those lessons may soon be in the syllabus sestak the former threestar has called for hard look at the defense acquisition process since his arrival in congress in 2007 he believes the problems aboard the san antonio are symptom of larger institutional breakdown among the defense industry the pentagon and congress as former commander in the fleet he said he finds it hard to believe that the san antonio could have been allowed to deploy if anyone knew these breakdowns were imminent i expected to be handed machines of war that had certain level of readiness i then had to maintain at times there were unexpected problems something could break but i never expected to deploy with machine of war particularly relatively new one that had systemic problems that would take weeks at time to fix said sestak who commanded the george washington carrier strike group when its something that appears systemic to the construction of the machine of war were giving short shrift to our warriors out there he said operators preparing for deployment care about how the ship and the crew perform its not their job to inspect welds quality construction is supposed to be given something certified long before the ship is ever put into action in predeployment certifications theyre not looking inside the welds theyre looking at how its operating at that moment he said sestak said the lpd 17 class is just one weapon system among many with major problems id like to go back to what are the institutional processes that permitted this to happen that is where id like to go back to the sources and find out how this can be done better he said i have proposed that we should have hearings on acquisition reform in the new session with lpd 17 part of that for polmar the naval analyst the navys experience with the san antonio is scandal worthy of investigation he compares it to the infamous air force tanker deal that sent an air force civilian and an industry executive to jail besides the money and shoddy product polmar said putting such problematic ship to sea put sailors lives at risk its as big in some respects as the tanker deal because its difficult to get to the truth of this he said its difficult to find out who accepted the ship people went to jail and were fined in the tanker deal and thats the minimum of what should happen here crs37 whats particularly shocking he said are the repeated problems in such new product were talking about warship he said you can see how the oil is leaking through those welds you may see that on ship that is 20 or 30 years old not ship thats two or three years old one naval historian who asked not to be named because of his affiliations was asked to think of another surface navy program this problematic the only thing id compare it to are the littoral combat ship and ddg 1000 he said it just seems like the navy cant get it right anymore48 it was also reported later in november 2008 that navy secretary donald winter said monday november 17 he continues to be unsatisfied with the performance of the amphibious transport dock san antonio which has been sidelined by emergency repairs since oct 31 but after speech in which he described the need for accountability and culture of quality for navy acquisitions and its privatesector vendors winter did not commit to new changes or penalties for problems with the san antonio and its followon siblings i continue to be unsatisfied with the performance there winter said we are continuing to look at it its matter ill be spending some time on over the next few weeks well adopt an appropriate course of action ahead49 still later in november it was reported that as the navy continues to examine problems with the lube oil system on the uss san antonio lpd17 the service is taking steps to ensure there are similar issues with the remainder of the class of amphibious ships team of 30 maintenance personnel from norfolk naval shipyard mid atlantic regional maintenance center is in bahrain handling the repair work which is focused on the main propulsion lube oil system capt bill galinis program manager lpd17 told defense daily in recent interview galinis said initial inspections found couple of issues one problem was improperly installed or missing pipe hangers second issue were welds that galinis noted were on the lower side of the acceptable criteria in some cases those welds didnt pass visual inspection he added 48 andrew scutro gator oil leaks what went wrong navytimescom november 17 2008 bracketed material as in the original gator as in alligator is an informal term for an amphibious ship 49 philip ewing winter remains unsatisfied with lpd 17 navytimescom november 17 2008 crs38 those items combined resulted in some cracked welds that we found we believe it was fatigue failure he added lot of that analysis is still ongoing as of earlier this week repairs to the san antonio were 50 percent complete and the work was expected to be wrapped up by mid to late november the main propulsion lube oil system problem on lpd17 has led to classwide review navy source told defense daily that review includes inspection of the weld quality and an examination of whether the number of pipe supports on lpd18 19 and 20 are sufficient we are doing engineering analysis and shipboard inspections the source said that includes visual radiological and dye penetration the lube oil leaks occurred in the forward and aft machinery space the source said the inspections take place in two groups one focusing on the welds and the other on the pipe hangers galinis said weld inspections in one of two machinery rooms have been completed on lpd18 galinis added the results of that inspection show the welds are good he noted the ship is underway right now when she pulls back in herewell do the second machinery room galinis said we also just completed the pipe hanger inspection so we have list of pipe hangers we need to add the pipe hanger work likely will get done before lpd18s deployment next year he added the inspections are not limited to the ships however galinis added the navy is also looking at the weld inspection techniques used in the shipyards we are doing that from training aspect looking at the weld criteria that is applied when you do visual inspectionhow thats applied to ensure there is uniformity we are also taking an opportunity to go back and look at the processes that are in place in the shipyard all the way from how the pipe is fabricated in the pipe shop and weld joints that are installed and how the welding is done to installation on the ship and the way the pipe gets hangered on the ship galinis said if you follow that trend all the way from material receipt through the fabrication of pipe details to the installation of the pipe on the ship to the testing of the pipe and inspection of the welds and the installation of the system if you follow that process all the way through there are things along the way here that we certainly can improve on he added and we are taking that opportunity to do this northrop grumman noc ship systems said the quality of its work is something the company takes very seriously crs39 we have rigorous program in place that includes inspecting and evaluating our work to ensure it adheres to the navys requirements when issues arise we aggressively address them in an immediate and methodical way margaret mitchelljones northrop grumman shipbuilding spokeswoman told defense daily upon hearing there may be problem with lube oil leaks on lpd17 we immediately responded with technical staff to

added we have invited and welcomed navy participation throughout our own internal review process northrop grumman builds the san antonioclass amphibious ships at both its pascagoula miss and new orleans shipyards the fourth ship of the class lpd20 was just delivered galinis said lpd21 through 25 are under construction with lpd22 and 24 being built at pascagoula and lpd21 23 and 25 being built in new orleans the navy just received funding for lpd26 in the fy 09 defense bill we are in the process of putting together the rfp documents galinis said lessons learned from the lube oil leak on lpd17 have been rolled into ldp21 he added currently lpd21 is about to begin the process where its lube oil system is flushed galinis said obviously lessons learned from lpd17 were immediately applied to lpd21 because that piping system although it is installed and fully built hasnt been completed with all theinsulation so it was very easy to take what we were seeing on lpd17 and go back and look at lpd21look at the welds look at where the pipe hangers areand in some cases quite frankly even now not all the pipe hangers are installed so we are kind of still in that process for the ships that have already been delivered galinis said there is big focus on lpd18 which is out on the west coast and will deploy next year lpd19 is currently going through her post shakedown availability psa in norfolk va at bae systems we will do weld and hanger inspection on her during the current psa period she is in galinis said the navy is doing an inspection right now on lpd20 earlier this month she was going through an engineering certification with her crew galinis said we didnt want to get into the machinery spaces while she was going through that inspection crs40 that certification wrapped up last week so the navy is now going through the inspection on her he added so far the results look pretty good but we are still in that process50 it was subsequently reported in november that while it might appear that the navys san antonioclass program is fraught with problems the navy and industry team have been able to drastically reduce the number of inspection trial cards and put in place construction practices to cut down on installation work and on cost according to navy official when the uss san antonio lpd17 wrapped up her trials the navys board of inspection and survey insurv wrote up just over 16000 trial cards capt bill galinis lpd17 program manager told defense daily in recent interview in april 2007 lpd17 went into bae systems repair facility in norfolk va to fix the problems found by the inspection the cost of post shakedown authority psa for the uss san antonio was 36 million when the uss new orleans lpd18 finished her trials earlier this year the insurv board wrote up just under 14000 trial cards galinis noted when we delivered the ships they were not quite finished he said of both the san antonio and new orleans when we got to lpd19 thats where we saw the big down shift we had little bit more than 50 percent reduction from hull 2 to hull 3 and that was step increase for us galinis said same thing on part 1 cards where you went from 740 cards to 257better than 50 percent decrease from the second to third ship part 1 cards note deficiencies that would affect mission area of the ship such as defensive systems the ability to get underway and embark marines galinis said part 2 cards are material deficiencies that would not necessarily degrade mission area he added by the time the uss mesa verde lpd20 underwent her insurv inspection the amount of part 1 cards decreased almost 90 percent galinis said thats real credit to the builder and the navy team thats down there on site where literally we go through and prepare ship to go through the trial process galinis said 50 geoff fein navy making sure lpd17 lube oil leak problem doesnt spread to rest of class defense daily november 20 2008 13 ellipses and material in brackets as in the original crs41 the first trial is conducted by the navys supervisor of ships supship galinis said they take the insurv reports from the previous inspections and start from there as we go through the test sequence we are looking at these deficiencies and making sure we are rolling those lessons in he said the shipyard has process where they do that and the supship does that as well but its difficult to roll in those lessons learned thats because two different yards are building the lpd17 class northrop grumman noc ship systems pascagoula miss facility and the companys shipyard in new orleans across the class you dont get true learning because we are building ships in alternate facilities galinis said although there is some part of the workforce that moves back and forth across the two shipyards another issue has been that the lessons learned from lpd17 and 18 have been rolled into the followon ships out of sequence galinis said on lpd19 and 20 lot of these lessons learned were cut inout of sequence in other words if you had to plan how you do the work some of the changes as result of some of these earlier insurv trials were rolled into these follow ships probably not at the optimum time if you had an opportunity to really plan it out he said thats because if you take look at how the ships stack up on top of one another they were just that close in the construction sequence not being able to cut that work in in sequence affects not only the number of changes that can be cut in but also what it cost to do that work galinis added that also affects the end cost of this ship in some cases because it takes more man hours to do that galinis said it is the three two one rule what would take you an hour to do in unit would take you two hours to do when you stack that on and when the ship goes into the water that task would take you three hours to do he said so you can see as ship gets closer to delivery it gets more expensive to do the same amount of work because you close the ship down and are working in much more confined spaceand its more difficult to do the work thats why when i say we are cutting corrections in out of sequence here you dont generally get as much learning and the same leverage galinis added what people will start to see on the uss new york lpd21 and the follow ships however is that lot of this work is being done in sequence galinis said so we are able to sort of pan that in and certainly with lpd 22 and followon you will see even more of that the other thing the navy and northrop grumman have been able to do on these ships is to increase the amount of preoutfit on the units galinis said there are 210 units on lpd17class ship those units are built in modules what the navy would like to try to do is get as much preoutfitting done as they possibly can crs42 by installing piping systems equipment some machinery units ventilation electrical components things of that natureon the earlier ships preoutfitting has probably been in the 70 percent range we are moving up into the 90 percent or even better on these later ships galinis said going back to that threetwoone rule we are doing lot more of that work on the front end of the construction process at lower cost as we start to stack those units there is less installation work to do on the back end the lessons learned in the items that were identified on the previous ships that work is being done more efficiently in sequence on lpd 21 and follow and we are also able on lpd 22 and follow to pull that back further and include that as part of the preoutfitting work that we do we are increasing that amount of work as well51 51 geoff fein lessons learned from insurv inspections lead to improvements on san antonioclass defense daily november 21
