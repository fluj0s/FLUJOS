majority of trade disputes do get resolved attempts to settle some of the disputes have been met with refusal or inability by one or another of the parties to comply in timely manner with the world trade organization wto panel rulings the 108th congress inherits veral of these disputes where the wto has ruled that us laws violate trade oblig ations absent us compliance through legislative action the eu could in some cases decide to retaliate against us exports this year or next in the meantime the eu remains in noncompliance with its wto obligations to allow imports of beef treat ed with hormones beyond raising useu trade tensions noncompliance by key wto member arguably weakens the credibility and authority of the wto and its dispute settlement process the initiation and resolution of disputes under wto agreements is carried out under the uruguay round dispute settlement understanding dsu considered cornerstone of the wto system the wto dispute settlement process has more quasijudicial orientation th an the quasidiplomatic orientation of the prior gatt system in which negotiation and conciliation generally prevailed over multilateral enforcement of rules the dsu provides for virtually automatic establishment of panels adoption of panel nd appellate reports and wher requested authorization to impose retaliatory measures deadlines are set out for various stages of the process these features ensure that complaints are heard and promote implementation of wto rulings thus making available to all wto members the means to clarify trade rules and redress trade injury at the same time the process continues to retain certain diplomatic elements in that its primary aim is to secure positive solution to dispute with the preferred outcome being solution mutually acceptable to the parties to the dispute and c onsistent with the covered ag reements opportunities for settlement are provided at number of points in procedure us and eu instances of longstanding noncompliance have for the most part not involved routine commercial disputes over trade or customs regulations but rather tax policy and internal national regulation particularly of social and health matters while ambiguity in wto agreements may give rise to disputes in these difficult areas the automatic features of the dsu also allow parties to pursue such cases through the full dispute process even though it may be evident from the outset that implementation of an adverse wto ruling may be subject to overwhelming domestic opposition in the defending country to deal with th problem of non compliance in difficult cases both washington and brussels may need to give greater attention to number of concerns and policy considerations including choice of cases initiated limitations on panel decisions role of mediation and conciliation and adoption of remedies that are trade liberalizing assuming that some disputes are not wellsuited for the dsu process greater efforts may be needed to settle differences through bilateral ne gotiations and political compromis through mediation or by agreeing to arbitration from an outside ie nonwto party this report will be updated periodically for

inherits seve ral useu disputes where the wto has ruled that us laws violate world trade obligations in some cases barring abolition or significant modification of th statutes in question the eu could decide to retaliate against us exports this year or next the largest threat involves wto ruling that us export tax benefit is an illegal subsidy other cases in which original wto compliance deadlines passed without needed action by the united states include dispute over the antidumping act of 1916 wh ich provides private right of action and criminal penalties against dumping copyright dispute where the us was found to have violated royalty rights of eu musicians and trademark dispute with implications for cuban rum trademark at the same time the eu has not yet complied in case finding its beef hormone directive to violate wto obligations choosing instead to accept retaliatory tariffs originally imposed by the united states in 1999 bills were introduced in the 107th congress to comply with some of these wto decisions but with the exception of the tablishment of treasury department fund for wto settlements in the trade act of 2002 legislation was not acted upon in the 108th congress discussions are continuing on compliance legislation in the export subsidy dispute with bills introduced in april and may 2003 house and senate legislation to repeal the 1916 antidumpi ng act and the

attempts to settle disputes have met with refusal or inability by one side or the other to comply in timely manner with the wto panel rulings the wto dispute settlement system is viewed by wto members as central element in providing security and predictability to the multilateral trading system1 noncompliance with wto panel and appe llate body rulings by key member arguably weakens the credibility and authority of the wto and serves as poor model for the rest of the world why s hould we comply with wto panel decisions if the united states or eu do not have t other countries may ask noncompliance may also diminish the perceived value of negotiating new trade agreements as well as increase the attractiveness of retaliation as an enforcement mechanism at the same time focusing on

settlement process settlement of trade disputes from 19481995 in the gatt the predecessor organization to the wto was based on blend of two different philosophies the first was diplomatic view that favored conciliation and problemsolving over legal precision in determin ing which country was right or wrong the second was more judicial and rulesoriented pproach that attempted to provide more binding process with sanctions as an enforcement mechanism2 todays wto understanding on rule s and procedures governing the settlement of disputes dispute settlement understanding or dsu one of the

settlement in the world trade organization an overview by jeanne j grimmett 4 dsu art 37 5 idthe dsu which went into effect ja nuary 1 1995 continues past gatt dispute practice but also contains several features aimed at making the system more rigorous and automatic in contrast to the old ga tt system in which member could block decisions at any step of the process the dsu provides that panels will be established and reports by wto panels and the appellate body will be adopted unless there is consensus among wto members against taki ng such action in addition where the losing party does not comply with its wto obligations within reasonable time period and the complaining party request s authorization to impose retaliatory measure the request will be granted absent the same negative consensus deadlines have also been established for each stage of the fourstep dispute process consultations panel deliberations appellate review and implementation of compliance measures3 the dsu is administered by the wto dispute settlement body dsb which is composed of all wto members members are required under the dsu to first determine if invoking dsu procedures would be fruitful in given case4 the aim of the process is to secure positive solution to dispute the preferred outcome being solution mutually acceptable to the parties to the dispute and consistent with the covered agreements absent such solution the primary objective of the process is withdrawal of an offending measure with compensation and retaliation being avenues of last resort5 where retaliation is requested by the prevailing party the defending party has right to have the amount arbitrated to deter mine if the level proposed is substantially equivalent to the level of trade damage however co mpensation and retaliation are considered temporary measures under the ds u pending full compliance where the defending party does take action to comply and the prevailing party questions whether the action is sufficient compliance panel may be established to determine whether the measure fulfills wto obligations the dsu also discourages unilateral actions in wtorelated trade disputes requiring wto members to resolve such disputes using dsu procedures and to observe dsu provisions when determining whether wto violation has occurred or trade injury exists determining what is reasonable time to comply and taking any retaliatory measures the steps in the wto dispute process are as follows consultations art 4 if wto member requests consultations with another member under wto agreement the latter must generally respond within 10 days and enter into consultations within 30 days if the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the request to consult the complaining party may request panel the complainant may request panel earlier if the defending member has failed to enter into consultations or if the disputants agree that consultations have been unsuccessfulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31860crs4 establishing dispute panel arts 6 8 if panel is requested the dsb must establish it at the second dsb mee ting at which the request appears as an agenda item unless it decide s by consensus not to do so the panel is generally composed of 3 persons the secretariat proposes the names of panelists to the disputants who may not oppose them except for compelling reasons if there is agreement on panelists within 20 days from the date the panel is established the wto director at the request of either disputing party appoints the panelists panel procedures arts 12 15 after considering written and oral arguments the panel issues the descriptiv part of its report facts and argument to the disputing parties after considering any comments the panel submits this portion along with its findings and conclusions to the disputing parties as an interim report absent further party comments the interim report is considered to be the final report and is circulated promptly to wto members panel must generally circulate its repor t to the disputants within 6 months of the date the panel is compos ed but may take longer if needed the period from panel establishment to circulation of the report to all members should not exceed 9 months adoption of panel repor tsappellate review arts 16 17 20 within 60 days after panel report is circulated to wto members the report is to be adopted at dsb meeting unless party to the dispute appeals the report or the dsb decides by consensus not to adopt it within 60 days of being notified of an appeal extendable to 90 days the appella body must issue report that upholds reverses or modifies the panel report an appellate report is to be adopted by the dsb and unconditionally accepted by the disputing parties unless the dsb decides by consensus not to adopt it within 30 days after circulation to members the period of time from the date the panel is established to the date the dsb considers the panel report for adoption is not to exceed 9 months 12 months where the report is appealed unless otherwis agreed by the disputing parties implementation of panel and appe llate body reports art 21 thirty days after the panel and any appe llate body reports ar adopted the member must inform the dsb how it will implement the wto ruling if it is impracticable to comply immediately th member will have reasonable period of time to do so the period will be 1 that proposed by the member and approved by the dsb 2 absent approval the period mutually agreed by the disputing parties within 45 days after the date of adoption of the report or reports or 3 failing agreement the period determined by binding arbitration arbitration is to be completed within 90 days after the reports are adopted to aid in determining compliance period the dsu gives the arbitrator nonbinding gu ideline of 15 months from the date of adoption the period of time from the date the panel is established to the date the compliance period is determined is not to exceed 15 months unless the disputing parties agree otherwise if the panel or the appellate body has extended its time the additional period is to be added to these overall deadlines in such case the total time is not to exceed 18 months unless the disputing parties agree that exceptional circumstances warra nt an extensionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31860crs5 6 the dsu does not make clear how it is to be determined whether losing member has complied with wto rulings so that compensation and authorization to impose countermeasures may be requested before th end of the stated 30day period as noted above article 215 provides for panels to make this determination if disagreement arises as to whether member has complied but othe r than stating that the panels work should be completed within 90 days the dsu does not clearly integrate the compliance process into an overall wto dispute proceeding this ambiguity has given rise to the problem of sequencing which refers to the timing of compliance panel proceedings and requests to impose countermeasures the issue which firs t arose in the implementation phase of the useu banana dispute has been taken up in wto discussions and negotiations of revisions to the dsu absent clarifica tions in the dsu however sequencing problems have generally been resolved on an ad hoc basis through bilateral agreements between disputing parties parties ordinarily agree th at compliance panel is to complete its work before the prevailing party will pursue pproval of its authorization request see generally rhodes the article 25122 problem clarifi cation through bilateral agreements 3 j intl econ l 553 2002 7 these statistics and information regarding the cu rrent status of the cases discussed here are continuedcompliance panels art 215 where there is disagreement as to whether member has complied in case panel may be convened to resolve the dispute the compliance panel has 90 days to issue its report which may then be appealed compensation and suspension of concessions art 22 in the event the defending party fails to comply with the wto recommendations and rulings within the compliance period the party must upon request enter into negotiations with the prevailing party on compensation agreement within 20 days after the expiration of this period if negotiations fail the prevailing party may request authorization from the dsb to retaliate if requested the dsb is to grant the authorization within 30 days after the compliance period expires unless it d ecides by consensus not to do so6 t h defending member may request arbitration on the level of retaliation or whether the prevailing member has followed dsu rule s in formulating proposal for cross retaliation the arbitration is to be completed within 60 days after the compliance period expires once retaliatory measure is imposed it may remain in effect only until the offending measure is removed or the disputing parties otherwise resolve the dispute overview of us eu disputes in the wto from 1995 through the end of 2002 the united states and the eu filed 51 complaints against each other under the dispute settlement understanding the cases are almost equally divi ded 26 have been filed by the united states against the eu or one of its member st ates and

number of cases each year while the number of cases brought annually by the united states reached peak in 1998 and has fallen to one case in each of 2000 2001 and 2002 the eu caseload against the

banana import regimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31860crs7 seven complaints filed by the united states were settled either through consultations or before panel had begun its work since settlement of case must be mutually agreed by the disputing parties the united states apparently achieved satisfactory solution in these situations tw of these cases dealt with customs duties on rice and grain

states were taken th rough the full panel process two were won by the united stat beef hormones and bananas three of the cases were lost on appeal each of these dealing with customs classification of computer equipment the eu eventually complied in the successful challenge to the eus banana import regime though two and onehalf year s had passed from the end of the original compliance deadline january 1 1999 before settlement was r eached maintaining that the eu had not complied by this deadline the united states requested authorization to impose sanctions on eu products under article 22 of the dsu in april 1999 the wto authorized the united states to suspend 1914 million in trade concessions an arbitrated am ount reflecting the level of tr ade injury suffered by the united states the

ecuador and the institution of new eu measures the eu eventually complied the united states suspended the increased duties july 1 2001 the case also focused attention on the dsu itself with the eu challenging us domestic procedures and countermeasures under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 as violative of dsu requirements in contrast the eu chose to accept retaliation in the beef hormone

and the eti act export subsidy do not involve routine commercial disputes ove r trade or customs regulations but rather tax policy and internal nationa l regulation particul arly of social and health matters these kinds of disputes involving what are normally considered domestic policy issues appear to be the most difficult to resolve and may raise broader questions such as whether the wto is the proper forum fo r resolving these kinds of disputes beef hormone dispute the beef hormone dispute dates to 1989 when the eu instituted ban on the sale distribution and importati on of hormonetreated beef15 in challenging the ban under the new dsu in 1996 the united states argued that it violated the uruguay round agreement on the application of san itary and phytosanitary measures sps agreement while the provisions of the sps agreement recognize the right of wto members to adopt measures to protect human animal or plant life or health they also require that thes measures be founded on scie ntific evidence and applied only to the extent to achieve public health goals the united states argued that the eu ban was instituted without sufficient scie ntific evidence and that it constituted

human health the eu also claimed that judgment about the level of protection was value judgment that only it could make occurrences of mad cow disease in several eu countries and the outbreak of

noncompliant with world trade obligations wto arbitrator in an award circulated in august 2002 determined that the eu could impose 100 punitive tariffs on 404 billion of us exports to europe on may 7 2003 the eu formally requested and received authorization from the wto to impose the retaliatory measures18 eu trade commissioner lamy stated the same day that he was encouraged by us efforts to ensure repeal of the statute during the current fiscal year and that the european commission will review the situation in the autumn and if there is sign that compliance is on the way at that time it would then start the legislative procedure for the adoption of countermeasures by 1 january 200419 although the fsc was enacted in 1984 the eu did not challenge the provision until 1997 many on the us side maintain the eu challenge was motivated by desire to create negotiating leverage on trade issues not by complaints from european companies that they were being disadvantaged by the subsidy perhaps the eu thought that winning case that i nvolved very large amount of trade could forestall us challenges against variety of eu practices as well as help settle other trade disputes us

considerations the credibility of the wto depends on prompt effective and fair dispute settlement mechanism noncompliance by either the us or eu of wto ruling arguably thwarts this objective to deal with the problem of noncompliance both washington and brussels may have to give greater attention to number of concerns and policy considerations including choice of cases initiated limitations of panel decisions the role of mediation and conc iliation and the adoption of remedies that are trade liberalizing both the us and eu have brought complaints to the wto that may have been motivated more by desire to score points with domestic political interests or to bolster negotiating leverage on other trade disputes than to redress serious trade problems some cases have been initiated even when it is probable that the defendant would be unable to implement losing panel decision due to overwhelming domestic political opposition greater sensitivity on the part of policy make rs on the selection of cases to initiate in the future could prevent the wto dispute process from being used and arguably weakened in this manner in the area of some of the most bitter useu disagreements the wto may be asked to rule on very complex issues that touch sensitive domestic social and environmental concerns directly if the applicable wto agreements are vague or ambiguous it is legitimate to question whether wto panels should be in the business of clarifying rules where scant useu substantive consensus exists moreover bush administration trade offici als have expressed concerns that some panel rulings legislate new obligations that were not agreed to in multilateral negotiations under these circumstances some type of politically agreed upon compromise may be viewed as preferable to quasijudicial wto ruling pending efforts to clarify the rules in subsequent multilateral negotiations assuming that some disputes with highly charged political content are not well suited for the panel and appella body process greater effo rts could be made to get the contending parties to settle their differences through bilateral negotiations through mediation or by agreeing to arbitration from an outside ie nonwto party21 while the dsu does afford opport unities for mediati on and conciliation some observers argue that these provisions can be greatly strengthened and made mandatory in highly divisive cases similarly washington and brussels could try to strengthen the role of the early warnin g system that was established in 1999 ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31860crs14 22 congressional concern over the ineffectua l nature of retaliation in the useu beef hormone case as well as in the nowsettled us challenge to the eus banana import regime led to enactment in 2000 of the socalle d carousel retaliation st atute which directs the united states trade representative periodically to revise the lists of imports subject to trade retaliation in case brought under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 unless the ustr determines that implementation of wto obligations is imminent or the ustr and the section 301 petitioner agree that revision is unnecessary both the beef hormone and banana cases were initially brought as section 301 actions and were each in the monitoring phase of the ustrs investigation as require d under 306 of the act when the statute was passed the ustr began implementation of the carous provision shortly after it was enacted but to date has not revised the retaliation lis t in the beef hormone case the eu quickly challenged the carousel provision in the wto arguing among other things that it requires unilateral suspension of or thr eats to suspend wto concessions or obligations other than those whose suspension has been authorized by the dsb the case remains in consultations with the issue having been raised in the ong oing review of the dsu begun under uruguay round mandate see generally crs report rs20715 trade retaliation the carousel approach by lenore sek 23 barfield claude p 130means of identifying and preventing future disputes stemming from legislative and regulatory proposals which threaten to create problems for the other side the fact that the eu elected to accept retaliation rather than comply with the wto beef hormone ruling raises othe r concerns about wto remedies while accepting retaliatory measures may be an option for managing dispute with domestic implementation difficulties the remedy trade sanc tions fundamentally conflicts with the goal of trade libera lization moreover tr ade sanctions raise political tensions and impose economic cost s not only on foreign producers but also on domestic importers consumers and firm s dependent on those imports subject to punitive tariffs retaliation often hardens the resolve of the offending party to maintain its wtoillegal policy or law than to change it thus when retaliation is accepted for an extended period the utility of the remedy as means of exerting pressure on the losing party to comply fully may diminish22 some critics of retaliation have suggested making compensation the only wto remedy for noncompliance compensation in turn could be imp lemented through monetary fine on the offending country or the offending country could agree to reduce its own trade barriers by an am ount equivalent to its trade barrier23 wto members are currently negotiating possible revisions to the wto dispute settlement understanding in the doha development r ound facing deadline of may 2003 the united states has recently proposed revisions that would give disputing parties greater control over th process with additional avenues for settlement it is unclear at this point how ccessful the dispute settlement negotiations will be and whet her any revisions that are adopted will serve to defuse the types of useu disputes that have stalled at the compliance phase moreover regardless of revisions to the dsu rulings that require statutory changes may as rule prove more difficult to implement than those involving the exercise of authorities already granted as long as the dsu allows members to resort to the fullhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31860crs15 wto dispute process for disputes of thei r choosing members will have the option of following this route when they believe that pursuing wto case best fulfills

decisions as to which cases members will initiate in the future
