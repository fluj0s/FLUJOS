adverse labor market effects linked to the entry of foreign workers when it passed the contract labor law of 1885 known as the foran act in 1864 congress had legalized contract labor but over the next two decades concerns arose that employers in some industries were recruiting foreign workers to work for lower wages or to work as strike breakers2 the foran act made it unlawful to import aliens for the performance of labor or servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21520crs2 3 23 stat 332 4 the mccarranwalters act pl 414 82nd congress passed over veto by president harry truman truman publicly opposed

with ensuring compliance with the employment eligibility continuedof any kind in the united states3 that bar on employmentbased immigration lasted until 1952 when congress enacted the immigration and nationality act ina sweeping law also known as the mccarranwalters act th at brought together many disparate immigration and citizenship statutes and made significant revisions in the existing laws4 not only did the immigration and na tionality act of 1952 end the bar on employmentbased immigration it allocated 50 of the visas to aliens who would perform needed services because of their high educati on technical training specialized experience or exceptional ability5 prior to the admission of these employmentbased immigrants however the 1952 act required the secretary of labor to certify to the attorney general and the secretary of state that there were not sufficient us workers able willing and qualifiedto perform this work and that the employment of such aliens would not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed us workers6 this provision in the 1952 act estab lished the policy of labor certification prior to the enactment of the immigrati on act of 1990 which amended the ina employmentbased immigration totaled 54000 annually and was ev enly split between those who were members of the professions or of exceptional ability and those who were skilled or unskilled workers with occupations in which us workers were in short supply evolving role of partment of labor in 1903 congress transferred the various existing immigration functions from the department of treasury to the thendepar tment of commerce and labor when the department of labor dol was established in 1913 the bu reau of immigration and the bureau of naturalization were both transferred to the new dol these immigration and naturalization functions remained in dol until 1940 when they were moved to the department of justice largel for national security reasons in 2003 these functions were transferred to the department of homeland security within the department of labor the former bureau of employment security first administered labor certification following actment of the policy in 1952 after the abolishment of employment security in 1969 the manpower administration handled labor certification in 1975 the manpower ad ministration became the employment and

protection act and the family and medical leave act 8 certain second preference immigr ants who are deemed to be in the national interest are exempt from labor certification 9 212a5a of inacurrent law on employme ntbased immigration the 1990 amendments to ina raised the level of employmentbased immigration from 54000 lpr visas to over 143000 lpr visas annually and expanded two categories into five preference categories although there were legislativ proposals in the mid 1990s to alter employmentbased immigration th preference categories remain intact c first preference priority workers who are persons of extraordinary ability in the arts sciences education business or athletics outstanding professors and researchers and certain multinational executives and managers c second preference members of the professions holding advanced degrees or persons of exceptional ability c third preference skilled workers with at least 2 years training professionals with baccalaureate degrees and other workers ie unskilled workers with occupations in which us workers are in short supply c fourth preference special immigrants largely consisting of religious workers certain former employees of the us government and undoc umented juveniles who become wards of the court and c fifth preference investors who invest at least 1 million or less money in rural areas or areas of high unemploymen t to create at least 10 new jobs only employmentbased immigrants applying through the second and third preferences must obtain labor certification8 more specifically the employer who seeks to hire prospective immigrant worker petitions with the bureau of citizenship and immigration services in the department of homeland security and the eta in dol on behalf of the alien the pr ospective lpr must demonstrate that he or she meets the qualifications for the particular job as well as the ina preference category if the dol determines that labor shortage exists in the occupation for which the petition is filed labor certification will be issued if there is not labor shortage in the given occupation the employer must submit evidence of extensive recruitment efforts in order to obtain certification several elements are key to the approval of the lca foremost are findings that there are not available us workers or if there are available workers the workers are not qualified qually important are findings that th hiring of foreign workers would not have an adverse affect on us workers which often hinges on findings of what the prevailing wage is for the particular occupation and what constitutes similarly employed workers9 occupations for which the secretary of labor has already determined that shortage exists and in which foreign hiring will not adversely affect us workers

the foreign labor certification process both from the perspective of employers and employees nativ born as well as foreign born employers usually label it as onerous nd unresponsive to their need to

workers maintain that they are caught up in the long wait for visas to become lprs leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by the employer who is petitioning for them during the mid1990s there was
