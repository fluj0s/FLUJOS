the 20year period from 1986 to 2005 health care accounted for 54 of consumer spending on average accordin g to data from the consumer expenditure survey ces health care accounted for 57 of consumer spending in 2005 slightly higher than the 20year average but lower than the 2004 share of 59 in the ces consumer spending for h ealth care includes spending for health insurance and spending for other health car medical services medical supplies and drugs in 2005 health insurance accounted for 29 of consumer spending other health care accounted for 28 of spending consumers spent less on health care than on housing or transportation or food both in 2005 and in every year since 1986 in 2005 housing accounted for 327 of consumer spending transportation 180 and food 120 average spending in these categories exceeded spending on health care in part because some consumers spend little or nothing on health care and health insurance those who spend relatively little on health may do so because they are healthy because they have generous employersponsored or government health benefits or because they are uninsured and lack access to care health care accounts for higher share of spending on average for lower income people in 2005 health care account ed for 76 of spending by consumers in the lowest income quintile compared with 44 of spending by those in the highest income quintile housing and food also account for higher share of spending for lowerincome people in 2005 housing accounted for 394 of spending by those in the lowest income quintile compared with 310 for those in the highest quintile the spending shar for food were 159 and 111 for the lowest and highest income quintiles respectively as people age they spend more on h ealth care in 2005 health care accounted for 25 of spending by consumers ounger than 25 comp ared with 156 of spending by those 75 or older hea lth care is different from other spending categories in its consistent pattern of increasing

bureau of labor statistics bls report 998 consumer expenditures in 2005 february 2007 at continuedspending by consumers on health care and health insurance data brief americans report being worried about hea lth care costs based on survey in june 2007 75 described themse lves as very or somewhat worried about having to pay more for their health care or health insurance and 63 said they were worried about being able to afford needed health care services the level of worry about health care costs mirrored concern about ri sing prices generally and it surpassed concern about the cost of housing 44 repor ted worry about being able to pay their rent or mortgage only 11 of responde nts reported that they were not at all worried about the cost of health insuran ce or care compared with 34 who were not worried about paying for housing1 how much do americans spend on health care as shown below consumers spend less on health care on average than they do on housing transportation or food lower spending is pa rtly function of averages some consumers may pay many thousands of dollars for health care and health insurance while others pay little or nothing at all and partly because employers and government spend lot on health care on behalf of consumers2 health care accounts for greater share of spending for lowincome and older consumers on average but spending also varies within income and age groups for some consumers health care and health in surance may be unaffordable for others worry about health care may reflect concern about two things rising costs generally and the risk of personally facing very high costs about the data information in this report is based on data from the consumer expenditure survey ces this department of labor survey consists of two components quarterly interview survey and weekly diary survey that together provide information on the spending habits inco and other characteristics of american consumers3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34295crs2 3 continued httpwwwblsgovcexcsxann05pdf 4 in this report the term consumers is usually shorthand for consumer unitsthe quarterly interview survey collects information on spending that respondents can reasonably recall for period of three months or longer including relatively large expenses and regular purchases property and automobile purchases are examples of relatively large expenses rent and utility payments are examples of regular purchases the diary survey collects information on frequently purchased items that respondents may not recall over time f ood and housekeeping supplies are examples for this component respondents keep diary of expenses for two consecutive oneweek periods the survey is designed to provide representative

or 3 two or more people who live together and share responsibility for at least two out of thr ee major types of expenses including food housing and other expenses in this re port spending shares and amounts are for consumer units unless otherwise indicated like any survey the consumer expenditure survey has strengths and weaknesses an important strength is its use of personal interviews and written diaries to collect extensive information on consumer spending potential weaknesses include sampling bias does the sample provide representative information for the us population and population subgroups response bias do respondents report spending accurately and classification bias are data properly classified in spending categories and subcategories for this report data from various consumer spending categories and subcategories were combined in th broad categories described in the appendix in the ces the health care category includes four subcategories health insurance medical

alcohol and tobacco products and all other goods and services accounted for 206 of consumer spending on average over the 1986 2005 period but i thought people spent lot more on health care if health care is basic need like housin g or food why is average spending for health care less than spending for other necessities one reason is that data on average spending include information for variety of people some people spend thousands of dollars on health care each ear while others spend little or nothing another reason is that employers and gove rnment spend lot on health care on behalf of consumers data on average spending mask differen ces between people with varied health care needs and preferences one person may be healthy and use care rarely while another has multiple chronic conditions that require costly ongoing treatment even people with similar health status may have different preferences for health care one person may seek treatment for every minor ailment while another avoids using services except in extreme circumstances access to care also may differ because of individual characteristics such as income or community characteristics such as the supply of health care providers health care accounts for relatively small share of consumer spending in part because many people get health benefits from their employer the government or both in 2006 597 of the

including federal state and local payments for medi care medicaid and other programs8 consumer spending by income health care accounted for 57 of consum er spending in 2005 but the average share of spending was higher for peopl with lower income as shown in table 2 for people in the lowest income quintile health care accounted for 76 of spending in 2005 for those in the secondlowest quintile the share was 81 the pattern was similar for spending on health insurance the average share of spending by all consumers for insurance was 29 compar ed with 41 for people in the bottom two income quintiles the 41 share fo r those in the two lowest quintiles was almost double the share of spending for in surance by those in the highest income group 21 although the share of spending on health care is generally higher for lower income people it is not highest for those in the lowestincome quintile instead it is highest for those in the secondlowest qui ntile this result can be explained in part by medicaid coverage and othe r public benefits for people with very low income as in table 1 the shares of spending in table 2 are averages within income groups health care and health insurance may account for lower or higher share of spending for individuals and their families higherincome consumers spend more m oney on health care than lowerincome consumers even though health care accounts for smaller share of their spending in 2005 consumers in the highest income quintile spent 3962 on health care 27 times as much as consumers in the lowest quintile who spent 1448 see table 2 because the average number of people per consumer unit is higher for consumers with higher income the 27 ratio oversta tes the real difference in spending adjusting for the number of people per consumer unit in 2005 consumers in the highest income quintile spent 1238 per pe rson on health care 15 times as much as consumers in the lowest quintile who spent 852 spending amounts were similar in the middle

health care spending and the aging of the population by jennifer jensona smaller share of spending in higher income groups in contrast spending on personal insurance and pensions accounts fo r larger share of spending in higher income groups source crs analysis based on data from the 2005 consumer expenditure survey see table 2 consumer spending by age spending on health care increases with age as shown in table 3 in 2005 health care accounted for 156 of spending for people aged 75 years and older on average compared with 25 of spending for those under age 259 p r t f t h difference can be explained by changes in health status and the increase in chronic illness that comes with advancing age10 and part is function of higher spending on health insurance by older people in 2005 health insurance accounted for 84 of consumer spending in the 75andolder age group compared with 14 of spending in the under25 populati on although the 65andolder population has nearuniversal coverage under medicare th is group nonetheless spends more on health insurance than younger people spending on medi care supplemental medigap coverage is itself major expense for many seniors and because such coverage eliminates most or all medicare cost sharing it also encour ages policyholders to use more health care0510152025303540 health care housing transportation food insurance pensions spending by

table 3 age of reference person average annual expenditures and characteristics consumer expenditure survey 2005 at http wwwblsgovceshomehtm notes the reference person is the first person named by the respondent when asked to start with the name of the person or one of the persons who owns or rents the home components may not sumto totals because of rounding see the appendix for more information on spending categories unless otherwise indicated spending amounts and shares are for consumer units in 2005 the average number of persons in consumer unit was 25 looking at spe nding amounts instead of shares does not change the central finding that health care spending increases with age in 2005 consumer units with reference person in the 75andolder ag group spent an average of 4210 on health care six times as much as the 704 in spe nding by those with reference person in the under25 age group adjusting for th number of people per consumer unit reveals an even larger age effect in 2005 health care spending averaged 2807 per person for consumers in the 75andolde r age group compared with 335 for those under 25 amounts that differ by factor of 84httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34295crs9 the pattern is the same for subcategories of health spending average spending for both health insurance and other healthcar increases with age data for spending by consumer units and data adjusted for the number of people per consumer unit both show everincreasing spending with age with two exceptions first looking at 2005 data average sp ending for health insurance was 2352 for consumer units with reference person in the 6574 age group compared with slightly lower 2260 for those with reference person who was 75 or older however after adjusting for the number of people per consumer unit average spending on health insurance increases with every successive age group from 180 per person in the under25 age group to 1238 per person in the 6574 age group and 1507 per person for those aged 75 and older second when looking at data for consum er units it appears that spending on medical services medical supplies and drugs items in the other health care subcategory was the same in 2005 for c onsumers in the 5564 premedicare and 6574 medicareeligible age groups before adjusting for the number of people per consumer unit spending on items in th other health care subcategory was 1825 and 1824 for the two age groups after adjusting for the number of people consumer spending on other health car was 869 per person in the premedicare group and almost 100 more 964 per person in the medicareeligible group an interesting difference given the latter groups eligibility for medicare benefits differences by age in spending for hea lth care and other goods and services are not themselves surprising as consumer needs and preferences vary with age as shown in figure 3 spending on health care is unique in that it accounts for larger share of spending for each successive ag group on average older consumers devote larger share of spending to health care than do middleage consumers who in turn spend more than younger consumer s the pattern is different for other spending categories source crs

interpreting data on consumer spending consumers spend less on health care on average than on housing transportation or food they also sp end less on health insurance than on entertainment or apparel and services see table 1 does relatively lower spending imply that consumers value health care ss than housing or health insurance less than entertainment its not cl ear from the data presented here the consumer expenditure survey provi des information on what people spend their money on but it does not explain why people make the spending choices they do the data also do not tell the whole st ory about the cost of health care for consumers like spending for other goods and servi ces spending for health care and health insurance reflects consumer preferences and decisions but it also reflects variety of factors that may be partly or fully beyond consumers control including whether person is healthy or sick and whether he or she has access to employmentbased or government health benefits low spending for hea lth care could be desirable if it reflects consumers good health or undesira ble if it reflects lack of access to care high spending also may be desirable or undesirable depending on whether the spending reflects an affordable choice or an unaffordable burden spending on health insurance may be particularly difficult to interpret low spending could indicate consumers in ability to afford coverage or access to generous employmentbased or public bene fits in addition direct spending on health insurance does not capture the total cost of coverage for consumers because employers provide health benefits for n early 60 of the population and government provides benefits for 27 of the population consumers also pay for health coverage indirectly through fore gone wages and taxeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34295crs11 appendix items included in spending categories in this report spending categoryincludes these consumer expenditure survey categories and
