in the economics of aging domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398the structure of social security individual account contributions and investments choices and implications summary policymakers have debated creating system of individual accounts ias as part of social security for many years however throughout this debate very little attention has been paid to the practical issues of program design and implementation issues that could have significant impact on the cost of the program the level of participation by workers the fees levied on accounts and ultimately the assets available at retirement this report describes policymakers administrative and structural choices regarding the collection and investment of assets in system of individual accounts the choices are many it would need to be determined who w ould be eligible to participate in ias how individuals would enroll how participants would make their contributions and how much would be co llected from them workers would need to be educated about enrollment in the new program the investment choices they face and the implications for their final benefits it must also be established how records would be kept what services w ould be provided to account holders and how errors would be corrected other choices surround how asse ts would be invested and whether there would be any restrictions on fees in each of these areas this report briefly summarizes the options available within system of ias the potential implications of particular policy choices and when appropriate current social security and pension policy the consequences of inadequate system design have become clear in other countries that have adopted ias in au stralia public campaig n had to be designed to locate the owners of 3 million lost accounts in great britain unscrupulous financial advisers pe rsuaded thousands of investors to leave state pension funds to their disadvantage in widely reported misselling scandal to provide insights this report also gives examples of probl ems that other countri have faced when implementing ias system of ias could involve millions of americans billions of dollars and could have broad impact on the american economy if workers contributed 2 of their current taxable earnings the accounts could grow to as much as 10 of gdp in 10 years and to 25 of gdp in 20 year s contribution rate of 5 could accumulate more equities in ias in 11 year s than are currently held by all mutual funds combined thus the stakes are high and there is compelling need for thorough planning and administration this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398contents eligibility 4 w u l d w r k r s f l l g s b l i g i b l t p r t i c i p t 4 would

individual account contributions and investments choices and implications much of the debate surrounding the crea tion of individual accounts ias as part of social security has focused on the fis cal implications of funding accounts and the risks and rewards of investing in equities1 rarely debated however are the structural and administrative choices surroundi ng the design of ias arguably these choices would have more significant impact on the number of people who choose to participate in system of ias and the benefits that seniors receive during retirement than on the fiscal and budget ary issues that fill the newspapers this report focuses on policymakers administrative and structural choices regarding the collection and investment of ia assets the choices are many it would need to be determined who would be eligible to partic ipate in ias how individuals would enroll how participants would make their contributions and how much would be collected from them workers would need to be educated about enrollment in the new program the investment choices they face and the implications for their final benefits it must also be established how records woul d be kept once contributions are collected what services would be provided to acc ount holders and how assets would be invested in each of these areas this report briefly summarizes the options available within system of ias the potential implications of particular policy choices and when appropria current social secu rity and pension policy although there are clearly interactions between the collection and investment of assets and the payout of accounts including early w ithdrawals this report does not address the choices polic ymakers have regarding how ia benefits should be paid or how ias might interact with current social security benefits2 the one exception is in describing how couples could shar accounts for completeness discussion of the option to share account withdrawals at retirement is included in

proposals see crs report rl33544 social security reform current issues and legislation by dawn nuschlerone recurring choice is whether the admin istrative functions should be managed by the government or private entities for example policymakers would need to establish who would be responsible for pr oviding participants with information on how to enroll who would be responsible for maintaining account records and who would be responsible for investing account assets in each of these choices the government could assume th responsibilities or these tasks could be contracted out to single or diverse set of priv ate entities although policymakers may have ideological preferences for one management system or another this report will highlight the practical implications of each choice the administrative choices described in this report are relevant regardless of whether the ias are designed to be in addition to social security often referred to as addon accounts or to divert payroll tax from social security often referred to as carveout accounts depending on the ty pe of account policymakers might choose some choices would be more straightforwar d for example in carveout system of ias it would be straightforward to use the current payroll tax system to collect contributions administrative and structural design is critical to wellfunctioning system of ias the consequences of inadequate sy stem design have become clear in other countries in australia public campaign had to be designed to locate the owners of 3 million lost accounts in great britain unscr upulous financial advisers persuaded thousands of invest ors to leave state pension funds to their disadvantage in widely reported misselling scandal these international experiences can provide valuable lessons for american po licymakers thus this report includes examples of the choices and difficu lties other countries have faced while implementing their own systems of ias if ia legislation were to move th rough congress the structural and administrative choices surrounding the coll ection and investment of account assets would need to be addressed these issues would affect the cost of the program the fees levied on accounts and ultimately the assets availa ble at retirement there have been numerous proposals to include ias as part of social security3 to varying degrees these legislative proposals have addr essed the choices raised in this report however many questions remain unanswe red although many of these decisions may seem mundane effective system can be designed without addressing themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs4 4 the employee retirement income security act erisa pl 93406 allows employers to exclude from their retirement plans worker s who are younger than 21 years old who work fewer than 1000 hours per year or who have worked for less than one year 5 for complete list of workers who do not participate in social security see crs report 9428 social security and medicare taxes and premiums fact sheet by dawn nuschler 6 policymakers also may consider whether ia contributions for noncovered workers would count toward current offsets ie the windf all elimination provision and the government pension offset to their social security benef its for description of these offsets see crs report 9835 social security the windfall elimination provision wep and crs report rl32453 social security the government pension offset gpo both by laura haltzeleligibility would workers of all ages be eligible to participate under current law employers are allowed to exclude some workers from employersponsored retirement plans ba sed on their age or work status4 policymakers need to decide whether workers who are at the end or at the very beginning of their careers would be eligib to participate in ias workers near retirement age may not have time to collect significant account balances very young workers may not have the fi nancial sophistication to ma ke decisions about whether to participate and how to invest their funds alternatively legislators may wish to follow the model of social security which receives contributions ie payroll taxes from all workers in jobs that are covered by social security would individuals who work in jobs that are not currently covered by social security be eligible to participate currently 96 of all workers are cove red by social security however approximately 28 of state nd local government workers as well as some federal employees ie those covered under the civil service retirement system are exempt from paying taxes into social security5 these workers are covered only by their public retirement pension program unl ess they worked at some point during their careers in jobs that were covered by social security allowing workers who are not participating in social security to participate in ias w ould provide consistent coverage of workers who move betw een covered and unc overed employment however this policy may require additiona l contributions for those workers who do not currently pay social security payroll taxes6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs5 7 another option is to initially have system in which some individuals are required to participate but participation is voluntary for another group while some other individuals are prohibited from joining this type of syst em existed in poland when the country started private account system in 1999 at that time all citizens younger than 30 were required to participate poles age 30 to 50 could choose to join the system and those older than 50 were prohibited from participating oecd pensions at glance public policies across oecd countries 2005 p 153 8 american academy of actuaries issue brie f social security reform voluntary or mandatory individual accounts sept ember 2002 at http wwwactuary orgpdf socialsecurityaccounts_sept02pdfparticipation and enrollment would participation in the program be voluntary or mandatory once it has been determined which workers would be eligible to participate in ias it would have to be decided whet her those workers would be required to participate or whether they coul d choose whether or not to join7 voluntary program would allow individuals to c hoose to participate based on their own calculations or impressions of the costs and benefits of an ia the number of individuals who chose to participate in voluntary program would likely depend on the extent of public education the ease of enrollment individuals perceptions of risk and whether or not there are any financial advantages to participating on the other hand mandatory program which w ould require all elig ible individuals to participate may help reduce administrative expenses by spreading fixed costs across larger number of participants howeve r mandatory program would not allow americans to make independent personal choices about whether it was in their financial interest to participate if participation is voluntary could contributors move in and out of the program over time if individuals are allowed to move in and out of the program during their working years they would accrue lower account balances because they would not consistently make contributions in ddition allowing changes without penalties could encourage risky behavior by participants who invest their accounts in highrisk investments and opt out if their investments do poorly8 allowing single decision point would also help to reduce administrative costs reduce the ability of participants to try to time the market and may help simplify benefit payments if there are interactions between the acc ounts and social security how would participants enroll in ias the mechanism by which workers enroll in ias would have an important impact on participation choices for enrolling pa rticipants include registering through employers registering through the income tax system or applyi ng directly through the mail by phone via the internet or at social security br anch office eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs6 9 social security administration annual st atistical supplement 2005 available online at httpwwwssagovpolicydocsstatcomp ssupplement20054bhtml table4b1 the congressional research service crs estimate is adjusted to include workers not covered by social security 10 an estimated 18 million households or 12 of all tax units do not file an annual tax return often because they do not owe taxes or are ineligible for any tax credits ninety seven percent of nonfilers have income below 10000 per year nasi uncharted waters p 41 11 the internal revenue service irs has issued several rulings in recent years to clarify that employers are permitted to enroll employees in 401k and 403b plans automatically through payroll deduction provided that the employee is notified in advance and has the option to drop out of the plan for more details see crs report rs21954 automatic enrollment in section 401k plans by patrick purcell 12 studies indicate that automatic enrollment in 401ks boosts the participation rate from national average of about 75 of eligible employees to between 85 to 95 see william gale j mark iwry and peter r orzag the automatic 401k simple way to strengthen retirement savings the retirement security project 20051 at httpwwwbrookingseduvi ewspapers20050228_401kpdfoption has benefits and drawbacks enrollment through employers would capture the current working population but would requi re additional paperwork for employers and could lead to confusion on the part of individuals who hold multiple jobs simultaneously or who change jobs and are inconsistent in their enrollment elections employerbased enrollment must also include provisions for the 16 million americans who are selfemployed9 enrollment on income tax forms would reduce the burden on employers but would not ddress the 18 million households that do not file income tax forms10 enrollment through other mechanisms would require contacting and processing the enrollment s of roughly 163 million current workers and continued outreach and enrollment of new entrants to the workforce another enrollment option is to assume that every worker wishes to participate but allow those who do not the option of dropping out workers would need to be notified in advance of their automatic rollment and given ad equate opportunity to opt out11 recent research on 401k plans s shown the rate of participation increases substantially when workers are automatically enrolled12 however even with the ability to opt out automatic enro llment is likely to induce many individuals to participate regardless of whether ias would actually be fina ncially advantageous participation incentives would there be any tax incentives to encourage participation the current tax code provides variet of tax preferences for the deposits earnings and withdrawals of various retir ement savings programs policymakers may wish to consider similar preferences for ias in general the tax treatment of ias would have an important impact on prog ram cost individual participation accounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs7 13 tax credits can be nonrefundable or refunda ble nonrefundable tax credits reduce the amount of tax owed but would not provide any benefits for those lowincome participants without tax liability in contrast refundable tax credits either reduce the am ount of tax owed or provide cash back to participants whose credit exceeds their tax liability such credits would have the largest impact on lowin come participants many of whom do not pay income tax 14 for example 300 deduction would reduce the taxes of married couple in the 25 marginal tax bracket by 75 and by 30 if th couple were in the 10 bracket 300 tax credit would reduce the taxes by 300 regardless of the participants tax bracket 15 for example taxpaying married couple with 6000 in deductible contributions saves 1500 in tax if they are in the 25 marginal tax bracket but only 600 if they are in the 10 bracketbalances and ultimate ly benefits the importance of these incentives would vary across the population depending on how they are designed one key choice would be whether the incentives are offered as tax credits or tax deductions tax credits reduce the amount of income tax an individual must pay13 tax credit is more valuable than ta x deduction of an equal amount because the credit results in reduction in tax owed rather than reduction in taxable income14 tax deductions which lower taxable income would provide larger incentives for highincome participants than for those with lower taxable income15 what tax advantages are provided to other forms of retirement savings the current tax code contains variety of tax preferences for the deposits earnings and withdrawals of retirement savings progra ms such as social security iras roth iras and employersponsored pensions employers and employees each c ontribute 62 of covered wages up to ceiling for social security oldage survivors disability insurance although the tax treat ment of contributions differs employees must pay income taxes on their own contributions but not on their employers contributions selfemployed workers pay the full 124 on 9235 of net selfemployment earnings but they receive special income tax credits social security benefits are not taxed for lowincome beneficiarie s but highincome beneficiaries are taxed on 50 to 85 of their be nefits depending on their total income traditional iras and employerbased retirement plans eg 401kplans allow participants to duct contributions from their income for tax purposes and defer taxes on all earnings until funds are withdrawn at which point they are taxed as ordinary income roth iras and roth 401ks allow taxpayers to make contributions from their aftertax ear nings or savings but all account accumulations and withdrawals are taxexempt employers also receive tax incentives for private pensions employer contributions to pension plans are treated as tax deductible business expenses by the irshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs8 16 the characteristics of low earners would ve to be carefully defined when targeting financial matches workers may have low earnings either because they have low wages or because they work for short periods of time workers with low wages may work multiple jobs and their total earnings may not be low over an individuals lifetime he or she could experience periods of both low earnings and high earnings for example college student who works at summer jobs may fall below set threshold but then rise above it when she graduates and take full time job it is also important to recognize that low earners may not have low incomes low earners may receive in come from other sources such as assets or from other family members 17 in the thrift savings program tsp federa l agencies contribute an amount equal to 1 of the base pay for each employee covered by the federal employees retirement system fers whether or not the employee chooses to contribute

programs can be found in crs report rl32233 cash and noncash benefits for persons with limited income eligibility rules recipient and expenditure data fy2002fy2004 by the knowledge services group 19 resource limits vary by program and often by state for example food stamp rules count some defined contribution retirement savings plan s such as iras and keoghs as an asset but exclude others such as 401k plans and federal employees thrift savings plans for comprehensive discussion of how retirement accounts are treated in means tested programs see zoë neuberger robert greenstein and eileen p sweeney protecting lowincome families retirement savings how retirement accounts are treated in meanstested continuedwould the government provide other targeted incentiv to participate to encourage participation in ias policymakers could provide financial incentives to all participants or to certain groups such as low earners16 m n employers including the federal governme nt match their workers contributions to defined contribution pensi on programs such as 401k plans up to set threshold17 matching participants contributions could provi financial incentive to all individuals to partic ipate but would likely provide larger transfer to high earners than low earners alternatively policymakers could design system of progressive matching that would provide larger transfers to low earners mimicking the structure of the social security program in which low earners receive relatively higher replacement rate than high earners finally match could be provided only to participants who earn below given threshold would ias affect participants eligibility for needsbased programs some needsbased be nefit programs such as supplemental security income ssi food stamps medicaid state childre ns health insurance program schip take into consideration both an indivi duals income and av ailable resources to determine eligibility18 assets accumulated in defined contribution retirement plans such as 401ks iras the federal thrift savings program are considered resources in some of these programs19 these assets must generally be withdrawn regardlesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs9 19 continued

are excluded from the resource tests in these programs withdrawals from defi ned contribution pension plans whether taken while working or retired and income from defined benef it pension plans are counted toward the income limits of needsbased programs policymakers could decide whether assets in an ia would be considered when calculating an individuals eligibility for needsbased programs both before and after retirement age before retirement age if ia assets are accessible before retirement age many lowincome participants may be forced to liquidate their ias to qualify for needsbased programs unless the accounts were explicitly excluded from resource calculations on the other hand if assets are c onsidered inaccessible or if ia accumulations were excluded from resource calculations eligibility for needstested benefits would not be affected however in some programs this would create an in equity across retirement savings vehicles with savings in ias havi ng preferential treatment to savings in defined contribution retirement plans after retirement ias could affect both income and resource eligibility first account withdraw als including annuity payments would likely be considered towards programs income limits second unless they are specifi cally excluded postretirement account assets would likely be c onsidered toward needsbased programs resource limits forcing lowincome retirees to exhaust their ias to qualify for assistance however if such an exclusion were to be applied only to ias it could result in inequitable treatment of individuals

contribute to ias would have an important effect on the cost and size of an ia system budgetary pressures could compel policymakers to consider limiting the amount participants may contribute to their ias regardless of whether funds come from current payroll taxes or from other sources in system of carveout account s in which share of payroll taxes is diverted from the social security trust f unds the higher the contribution limit the larger the social security shortfall depending on the tax treatment of account contributions there could also be sign ificant budgetary implications of accounts funded outside the current payroll tax system in general the amount that participants contribute to their ias would directly affect the funds available at retirement the congressi onal research service crs estimates that an averagewage worker who contributed 1 of his or her salary over 40year career would have an ia bala nce of 34429 at retirement whereas 5 contribution would yield 17892420 would there be limits on total contributions contribution limits can be established to limit the cost of the programs and depending on the structure the level of be nefits for some individuals contribution limits could be set as share of earnings which would allow higherearning participants to make re latively larger contributions and accrue higher account balances than lowearning participants alternatively ceiling could be set as limit to the amount of earnings used to assess contributions these ceilings are commonly found in other countries as way to limit the amount that highearning individuals contribute to their pension system21 these contribution limits would primarily affect the relative contributions of higherearning participants who would not be able to contribute the same share of earnings as lowearning participants finally contribution limits could be set dollar amount as is done for 401k plans and iras alternatively policymaker s could choose not to limit contributions they could even try to encourage additional retirement savings by allowing ia participants tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs11 22 employee benefits research institute ebri the impact of workers earnings profiles on individual account accumulations ebri notes vol 21 10 october 2000 at httpwwwebriorgpdfnotespdf1000notespdfmake contributions over and above any standard contribution rate once the administrative structure is established participants may view making additional contributions to ias as lowcost way to increase their savings for retirement this may be particularly true for individua ls who do not have access to employer sponsored retirement accounts however depending on the tax treatment and design of accounts allowing unlimited contributions could weaken curre nt employerbased retirement savings plans and may not incr ease net savings because individuals may simply substitute one form of retirement savings for anothe r especially if ias receive tax preferences or other incentives what are the contribution limits in current retirement savings programs many current retirement savings programs including social security have limits on the amount that indi viduals contribute in 2006 the maximum taxable earnings subject to the 53 tax anindividual pays for the oldage rvivors portion of social security is 94200 so the maximum contribution is 499260 for an employee or 998520 for both the employer and employee contribution for an ira both traditional and roth in 2006 the maximumcontribution is 4000 per year fo r those younger than 50 and 5000 for those 50 and older in taxdeferred retirement savings such as the thrift savingsprogram and 401k plans indivi dual contributions are limited to 15000 in 2006 participants age 50 or older can make additional catchup deferrals of up to 5000 the combined employer and employee contribution is limited to 44000 could nonworkers contribute another important policy choice would be whether to allow nonworkers to contribute to an ia as is done in some ot her countries in italy nonworking people including children are allowed to partic ipate in an ia allowing nonworkers to contribute would help ensure that account ba lances meet some standard of adequacy at retirement whether it is to provide family caregiving to attend school or due to job loss or disability time out of the work force especially at young age would significantly reduce participant s account accumulation for example when an averageearning female is out of the workforce and not contributing to an ia for five years she would accumulate 1618 less than if she had not taken any time out22 generally the younger person is while out of the workforce the smaller the account balance would be at retirement as the participant would lose both contributions and compounded interest on t hose contributions the ability to pay into accounts for nonworking individuals ither by the individuals their spouses or other approved partie s such as parents would help ensure that participants whohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs12 23 about 14 million individuals receive social secu rity benefits based at least in part on current

contributions from nonworkers may be administratively burdensome as nonworkers would not be able to use existing wage reporting systems would couples share accounts in simple ia system assets would be collected from an individual and used to fund his or her own retirement this contrasts with social security which provides benefits to the worker as well as the workers current and former spouses based on workers past earnings23 if policymakers choose to mimic this feature and allow married couples to share account s or share in the benefits from those accounts system that transfers assets with in couples would need to be established however there is at least one characteristic of social security that is impossible to mimic in ias without additi onal federal contributions24 any transfer of assets between husbands and wives would reduce th payout for the primary account holder this contrasts with social security in wh ich workers benefits are not reduced if current spouse or even th ree exspouses also receive be nefits based on his or her earnings transfers of assets between husbands nd wives in system of ias could be done several ways contribu tions could be split at the time of deposit accounts could be split at the time of divorce or individuals could be required to purchase joint and survivor annuities at retirement whichever policy is chosen to share assets it would need to contain provisions for divorce as there is high probability that by the time participant reaches retirement age he or she would have been divorced at some point in his or her life25 split account deposits accounts could be split at the time of deposit so that contributions and investment earnings accumulated during marriage are split evenly each spouse would retain any contributions and investment earnings accumulated while single or from previous marriages there are some advantages and disadvantages to this approach one advantage of contribution splitting is thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs13 26 consistent national reporting system to track marriages and divorces currently exists irs records for taxpayers may not be an accurate record of marital

former spouses earnings participants may also prefer this opti on some oneearner couples may wish to divide contributions to allow stayat home spouse to accumulate ia assets some twoearner couples may wish to split contri butions between two accounts as it would allow couples with different salaries to accrue similar acc ount balances splitting contributions also may have disadvantag depending on how account fees are structured twoearner couples may wish to consolidate their accounts into one account to reduce the impact of flatdollar fee or to take advantage of lower fees with higher account

on contribution sharing26 split accounts at divorce another way to transf er assets between couples would be to split contributions and interest earned during marriage at the time of divorce

million women age 62 or over receive social security benefits based either in part or in whole on the work record of an ex spouse27 to receive spousal benefits in social security divorcees former marriage must have lasted at least 10 years if ias are legally considered property then state family laws could be used to determine distributions between couples during marriage divorce andor when an account holder dies however this would lead to inequities across states and conf usion for couples who moved across state lines during their marriage28 in addition many people who get divorced are

split accounts at retirement finally couples could share account distributions at retirement either directly or by purchasing joint and survivor life annuities account balances could be divided between married couples when either spouse retires as with contribution splittin g at the time of deposit administrative issues surrounding the tracking of marriages over lifetime would be an obstacle in ensuring that assets are properly credited to former spouses another way to share ias at retirement would be to require the purchase of joint and survivor life annuities life annuity is an insurance product that promises payment for as long as the annuitant lives married participants could be required to purchase jointlife annuities for themselves and their current r former spouses however this would lower the payments participant receives fro m his or her own ia jointlife annuities provide significantly lower payments than single annuities and are sensitive to the ages of both

income tax on their share of the payroll tax but not on the employers share ia contributions could also be collected through the income tax system unlike with the payroll tax the income tax form has

marital status and the existence of pendent children system of ias that incorporates links among family members provides participation incentives such as matching contributions based on earnings or calculates rates of withdrawal based upon total retirement income may requi re this detailed information about participants an additional mechanism for collecting contributions would also need to be implemented for workers who choose not to file income tax returns because their incomes are below the applicable filing thresholds these workers could be required to file forms with an irs serv ice

projected risk and return could be used to lect ia investment options would participants have access to lifecycle funds financial advisers nearly universally recommend inve stors follow strategy of holding mixed portfolio of stocks and bonds and rebalancing the portfolios allocations over time as asset prices change and also reallocating between assets as an individual ages to reduce the level of risk as the person nears retirement however in practice few investors rebalance their portfolios therefore in addition to funds of pure stocks and bonds polic ymakers could decide to require that participants are offered funds that combin stocks and bonds in ways to reduce risk while allowing participants exposure to higher returns98 to address this behavior financial product that automatically reallocates investment funds is becoming more popular offering in private pensions these so called lifecycle funds are balanced portfolios with varying risk and reward characteristics there are two types of lif ecycle funds targetedmaturity and static allocation in the first targetedmaturity funds the proportion of stock in portfolio falls over time to provide level of risk appropriate to the participants age targetedmaturity lifecycle fund however can expose younger investors to more risk than they might prefer or expose older i nvestors to less risk and lower returns than they need to adequately provide retirement income an alternative investment structure is the staticallocation lifecycle fund which is consiste ntly rebalanced to maintain fixed ratio of stocks and bonds over career based on the participants preference for risk however unless participants reallocate their investments as they age staticallocation lifecycle funds may ex pose participants to more risk than is appropriate lifecycle funds have become increasin gly popular among defined contribution pension plan sponsor s and participants99 five months after they began more than 220000 out

or percentage of the funds nnual yield these fees can be charged on contributions at the time of deposit periodically on assets during the life of the account such as quarterly or annually or at the time of withdrawal under system of proportional fees private fund manage rs would have financial incentives to discriminate against small account holders because providers would receive more revenue from highincome partic ipants or individuals with large accounts as the costs of account management are generally unr elated to the size of an individuals account fund managers may prefer to charge flatdollar fees with flatdollar fee structure all accounts are charged the same amount and private fund managers would not have the same financial incentives to treat small and large investors differently however these fees act like re gressive tax that consumes larger share of small accounts than larger accounts addon fees or loads such as those char ged to mutual fund investors could also have an important impact on participants flexibility and choice for example back end load fees which provide commission at the time of sale could be set to discourage participants from switching be tween private fund managers although uk workers are allowed to move betw een account managers annually it was reported in 1999 that many managers set penalties for moving that reduced the average pension by 27104 private fund managers could also impose transaction fees which could discourage participants from switching investments or rebalancing their portfolios or encourage fund manage rs to actively manage or churn accounts to increase revenuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs41 how high are the administrative fees estimated to be in ias the administrative costs of system of ias would depend on many of the choices raised in this report specifically admi nistrative costs would vary depending on the size and structure of the accounts on whet her the accounts are administered centrally or through decentralized system of priv ate fund managers on the level of services and education provided to account holders and on the degree of choice participants have among investment options the amount individual participants would pay would also depend on the amount of government s ubsidy if any and the structure of the fees recognizing these uncertainties and that cost s would be higher in the early years of plan implementation several government agencies have attempted to quantify the administrative costs of system of ias th ere is large range of estimates in 2001 report by the social security administra tion analysts estimated that centralized program of ias would require start up costs from 12 billion to 23 billion and ongoing costs of between 095 and 4 of ia assets which would decline over time in their analysis of specific ia proposal cbo estimated that the total administrative costs would be roughly 27 billion over the first 10 years an amount that includes 15 billion in startup costs and ongoing annual charges of between 7 and 17 per account depending on the investment opti ons government accountability office study estimated that fees could range be tween 01 and 30 of assets per year depending on the structure of the system to put these estimates in context the federal thrift savings plan currently charges administrative fees of less than 01 of account assets or roughly 25 per year per participant however this charge does not include the costs to federal agencies of collecting contributions and educating their workers about participation and investment options in the private market one study of fees estimated that the dollar weighted average annual fee in 2003 on retail equity mutual funds was 125 of account balances whereas the fees char

country earn less than 5000 per year105 under an ia plan with contribution rate of 2 each of these workers would annually contribute less than 100 if fees ar structured as sh are of contributions or account assets private f und managers may find that it is not cost effective to manage such small accounts alternatively if fees are set at flat rate for all participants the fees could consume large share of small account assets in setting up system of ias policymaker s may choose to set restrictions on the level or structure of administrative fees currently private pension funds do not have explicit restrictions on fees other th an broad prudence or reasonableness standards however many countries with ias have set limits on the structure of charges and some have established ceilings for assetbased charges106 while many countries have been successful at reducin g costs they have largely done so by restricting individual choice and compe tition among pension fund administrators107 limiting fees would likely reduce marketing education and the range of choice and services provided to account holders unless these activities are subsidized by the federal government108 whether or not limits are set on the level or structure of fees consistent reporting and di sclosure standards should be established to allow participants to easily compare and understand fees and their impact on account balanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33398crs43 109 another way to subsidize the account fees w ould be to adjust the offset or reduction in social security benefits by the administra tive costs that are charged to the individuals accounts in effect the administrative costs ar then paid by the social security trust funds would the government provide subsidy to cover the startup costs or ad ministrative fees policymakers may choose to finance st artup costs or administrative costs through general revenue either for all accounts during the start of the system or for some ia participants such as thos with small accounts or low earnings109 this would effectively increase the rate of retu rn on assets in those accounts however it would reduce incentives for investors to s eek lowcost providers this policy may also raise concerns about equity because nonparticipants would be forced to pay some of the costs of ias conclusion system of individual accounts within social security could involve millions of americans billions of dollars and could have broad impact on the american economy thus if ias were to be adopted the stakes are high to design well functioning system to administer the coll ection and investment of account assets each choice also involves cost alt hough competition may help to drive down costs in general the more decentralized the system the higher the administrative costs costs would also be higher for op tions that provide participants with more services such as account management options multiple investment choices and personalized financial advice even small costs can have significant impact on the retirement income of participants over 40 year period 1 administrative fee can reduce final account balances by 22 program design is important some c ountries have faced major problems with retirement accounts due to in adequate planning and in sufficient regulation most recently we have seen in this country th importance of adequate planning in the difficulties some beneficiaries have reported during the implementation of the new medicare part d prescription drug benefit one lesson to be learned from these experiences is that major policy changes require insight and foresight more research is needed on the implica tions of ia program design although this report highlights the broad implications of basic ia collection and investment options more thorough analysis is needed especially in regard to the interaction among options seemingly unimportant details may have large impacts and policymakers should be made aware of the implications when considering ia proposals
