the integration of auditing lecture given on 22 october 1963 thank you all right whats the date audience twentysecond twentytwo oct ad 13 saint hill special briefing course i havent got anything to lecture about actually you know everything there is to know and the only difficulty is just doing it small difficulty but he who maketh difficulty with auditing hath service facsimilesconfucius say youryour difficulties in auditing are all made theyre all manufactured difficulties and the sooner you learn that why the happier youll be by the time youve run tape through and listened to yourself and youll see how many difficulties have been made in the session youll be appalled itd be very nice if those tapes could be of real live sessions or tape dozen of your sessions and then listen back to one chosen at random you see because in that session you wouldnt be so careful but in this universe difficulty has to be manufactured always lets take the case of an organization organization isnt doing well somehow or another got lot of willing staff and people and so forth and that organization isnt doing well well somebody is manufacturing the not doing well living beings are theta beings and they actually have to work pretty hard to be entheta beings the natural bentthe natural bent is simply to be theta being and carry on one has to work hard to be otherwise thats quite interesting now maybe that labor is all unconscious and one is not conscious of the labor which is being done maybe its being done at level that one doesnt recognize it but nevertheless it is individually doneentheta now lets take the actuality of the thing there would be mass in the bank if it were not being created in the given instant that it has the effect on the individual lets look at the harsh looklets take the harsh look at all this the cold scientific pitiless inspection of what is actually going on and that is that thetan creates his own bank it isnt that he has created his own bank he is creating his own bankthat is the difference dont you see any bank matter how far it is in the past is being created at this instant by thetan there is such thing as continued creation all creation must be done at the moment it is perceived now there can be such thing as unaware creation or utterly unconscious creationutterly completely unconscious creation and that is in actual fact the source of the reactive mind one is creating without knowing he is creating now the reason he is creating is contained in the things he is creating now thats very tricky thats very tricky the reason he is obsessively creating is contained in the things he is obsessively creating in other words he creates for instance an item saying creativeness and this item then forces him to create but he is unconsciously creating the item and he has not confronted the fact that he is creating it and therefore it is gone now the difficulty of this creativeness is in view of the fact that he can create so much automatically he cannot differentiate what he is creating so he doesnt really know what he is creating and what he isnt creating and so therefore he cannot asis the central things he is creating do you follow my line see he could know he was creating but what is causing him to create what is he creating that is causing him to create that question he cannot answer because it requires tremendous confront and differentiation now the easiest thing that an individual can do is create if you see some artist laboring over canvas and the sweat pouring off of his brow youre perfectly entitled to go tsk tsk tsk if you ask him very carefully why he is sweating over this creation to this degree he would probably be able to analyze it to some tiny distance see hed be able to analyze it slightly he would realizehe would realize that he in actual fact had put an arbitrary barrier against his creation saying that the canvas must be created in fortnight which is very short time indeed to create the amount of canvas he is creating you see this must be all completed within fortnight well that of course makes it difficult for him to perform the creation because he has time barrier now if you ask him further about the thing he would have doubt as to whether or not it was going to be accepted at the academy or by the client so he has this barrier and he could spot that yes im very anxious im very nervous i dont know whether this thing is going to be bought or not which ties in with the fact that i dont know whether or not im going to be able to buy my coffee and cakes two weeks from now i dont know you see and therefore im anxious about this particular line and youd say well could that affect the difficulty youre having creating and he would agree with you at once and you probably would have asised it to that degree and so forth hed realize that he had economic duress as well as the time factor first mentioned mixed up in the simple action of creating this piece of canvas now you go little bit further talk about his materials and tools and youll find out that he is working with synco company paint because it was handed over to him as gift by one of his fellow artists who may or may not be friend and it does not work well see now he feels he must use up this paint even though he could probably obtain other paintpaint isnt all that expensive he feels he must use up this paint because he has it theres another barrier to his creativeness you see so even at conscious level you could sort out with this artist why the sweat was running off of his brow as he stood there gnawing the end off his paint brush also musician you could sort this thing out you could get the number of factors which he had put in his own road in order to prevent himself from playing music now that action followed out in its final form becomes r4 you audit out all the gpms and risand what are you doing youre auditing out actually the barriers which person has put in his own road in order to prevent imagined oppositions from having an effect upon him in other words game of shadows now that it is game of shadows tends then to make us poohpooh the idea that anybody could ever be in trouble lets go at it now and thats the pitiless look ive just given you of course the fellow couldnt possibly hes causing all of his trouble hes the one who is causing all the difficulties and so therefore the hell with him you see that could be the adjudication but you neednt add that last you seewell he is causing all of his troubles that is the pitiless factual look at the situation anything thats wrong with him he is creating at this very moment anything thats wrong with an organization is being created now in the organization yeah they can say well but three years ago we had fire and weve never been able to recover from the fire and and yapyapyapyap and that so fixates them that they never look at the fact that the registrar in the organization never comes to workbecause theyve got it all explained they dont have to do anything because they had fire three years ago and they havent recovered from it dont you see youll find out that theyve got explanations for all of their difficulty but those explanations when swept aside would demonstrate and disclose that the individual was creating all of his difficulty here and now and the organization was creating all of its difficulty here and now there isnt any real point in sayingwell in the past we so on and so on and so onorganizationally because they arent actually stuck in gpm you just start looking around the bits and pieces in the organization and you find outwell they never have anybody come into the organization because they keep the front door locked i mean there were some fiftysome reasons in johannesburg why nobody could get into the test section pe course they were enumeratedover fifty ways of preventing people from ever getting onto the pe course they included parking the bicycles across the pathway so that nobody could walk up to the door of the test room now this is all very well dont you see this is all very well to say well the reason why johannesburg was in difficulty was because years ago see there was soandso and soandso and that all affected the soandso and then they had some creditor trouble and that got soandso and that all added up to so well that has nothing to do with the price of fish at all and thats because you arent actually dealing with the mass of gpm so on the third dynamic it becomes more obvious than on the first dynamic now you look at this poor blokenow lets take the sympathetic look at it lets take the sympathetic look lets take this poor bloke and hes standing on street corner and he doesnt know whether to walk up the street or down the street or get job or buy cup of coffee or go home or so forthtrouble and difficulty is just too great and he is overwhumped all right now we go up to this fellowand this is what makes the human mind an interesting studywe go up to this fellow and we say well why dont you go home well im ascared to go home why dont you buy cup of coffee well im afraid to spend my last sixpence because soandso and soandso and why dont you walk up the street well i cant walk up that way because i might run into cop and why dont you walk down the street well i cant walk down that way because its full of mud puddles that type of analysis with regard to this one individual im afraid would not wind you up with happy man why because the basic building block of all organizations is the individual and you can get all the boys over on the moscow party line talking about the masses and talking about the people and you can get the us bleating about the people all the time and so forthbut thats only because theres nothing there to bleat about you see there is people it looks like people dont you see somebody moves in with this theory into some latin american country that is in terrible condition financially economically and so forththat its people have never been educated nobodys ever paid any attention to the individualsand they just say well all weve got to do is move in here with communism or with democracy you see all weve got to do is move in democracy and well at once have great prosperous country aw focri where are they going to start building man where are they going to start building wheres that one guy theyre going to start building with see well these people have not had education these people have not had the benefits of any tools or help for centuries spaniards had them running up and down carrying bags full of dirt they could pan out in the streams for more gold for spain they never did very much for them hideoushideous past political background has been so enturbulated and enturbulent that any time anybody set up government why the indoor sport was to shoot it down and so on schoolsnothing until they look at this fact to take one individual in the country and give him few benefits and straighten him out and then another individual in the country and few benefits and straighten him out and another individual in the country and few benefits and straighten him out and few more and straighten them out and few more and straighten them out and few more and straighten them outthey will then have country which they can put democracy or communism intoand if they did their job well with the individual nobody would be that silly these birds straightened out might invent political philosophy that was workable none of these old corny things that have been kicking around latelyactually theres been real political developments since the benevolent monarchy the only thing rowthe only thingthe only thing that is against benevolent monar you know you can get communist to agree socialist people in democracy you can get everybody that you ever thought of anarchiststhey will all agree that the best form of government is benevolent monarchy they all will agree but it has one faultone faultand that is you can never guarantee its succession so you cant have it because it might go wrong in the future oh i know that sounds very rightist but unfortunately its based on the actual discussion with socialists laborites anarchists royalists and everything else see and i found out there was only one meeting ground on which they could all agree theres the ideal form of governmentthe benevolent monarchy but they all said you cannot guarantee its succession it might cease to be benevolent monarchy at any moment so therefore we cant have it and that is the method by which they prevent it they all agree that there are holes in democracies and communisms and that sort of thing which are all present time holes which put everybody in misery dont you see well thats great but we cant have those you see weve got to have all those holes and everybodys got to be in misery because they might be in misery now look at this as political thinking im not even beating the drum for benevolent monarchy i thinki think benevolent monarchies are rather corny myself i think there is substitute for benevolent people but where your individual is concerned or where group is concerned or where anything is concerned you come down to this basic thing called an individuala being he is the only live breathing thing there i dont care how many administrative lines or how many stable data we park or how many ris we set up around and call it an organization when it comes right down to itthe building block is guy and thats the onlyonly living thing there and incidentally that is the only living thing that will ever be there and if you havent got this individual in any kind of condition at all youre going to wind up with nothing look you could read book about perfect marriage you could read book about perfect marriage you could straighten it all out on the basis of perfect marriage you could organize it all you could organize the mans work the womans work and everything else you could absolutely have this taped completelydown to the last erg you see child planningeverything else youve got this perfect marriage perfect textbook that thick you know i mean everybodyso on but you havent got woman and you havent got man well wheres the perfect marriage or youve got girl with service facsimile i hate menyou got man with service facsimile i hate women now this one individual then this one individual this idea of the individualwhen you multiply him and get another individual and another individual and another individual and another individualyou still have just that many individuals thats all but you can get an aggregate result of aberration this i think is called culture now in any given organization there is however enough theta to make the thing whiz unless everybody is being activereactively or knowinglyto make it not whiz now in actual fact the only livingness present is the livingness that is present i hate to have to say one of theseone of these weird aa thingsbut the only livingness present is the livingness present now the livingness that is present is reduced by the amount of livingness invested in notlivingness in other words arbitrary factors livingness is invested in the maintenance of an arbitrary factor and the degree that the arbitrary factor is invested in monitors the apparency of the livingness that is present you follow this now youve got pint bucket and that is the amount of theta presentin spite of the fact that it doesnt have anythingyou got pint bucket all right now thats the amount of livingness present lets say thats all theta see now weve got bunch of mud pies see got bunch of mud pies sitting around and theyre not mud pies yettheyre just dry dirt now the degree that we enliven this dry dirtwithout banishing the dry dirtis the degree that we will subtract water from this pint bucket and pour it in the pan that comes around it do you see that so pretty soon we apparently have water present we have only mud in actual fact theres just that much water still present you havent lost any because lets forget about the evaporation the water is still presentbut what happened to the water it is all invested in the making of mud now in auditing the only action youre undertaking actually is filtering back the mud pies and recovering the water into the pint bucket get the idea now its actually simpler to do it in auditing than it would be in the physical universe because all youve got to do is asis the mud pie and say mud pie and everybody recognizes that its mud pie and instantly the mud pieishness of it vanishes and the water goes back into the bucket quite magically you might say thats recovery of attention units you might say its recovery of theta its simply the negative quantity recovered because the thing is there all the time the recovery is only apparent it is simply not invested in mud pies now why cant you audit pc who has screaming present time problem why cant you audit him successfully well there is too much attention invested in the mud pies of the present time problem in other words this is such an investment that it has taken all the water in the pint bucket and poured it into all the mud theres water left in the pint bucket at all it isnt even damp dont you see its temporary condition now the present time problem goes away and you now see an apparency of some water in the bucket now youve got something that you can invest some pcs are in such horrible condition that there is water in the pint bucket at all and the auditor therefore cannot invest it because it isnt there to investits all mud do you see what i mean so the auditors action is to find some water to get back into the pint bucket and then invest it in an orderly fashion to disappear the mud pies this is programming crudely stated but nevertheless graphically true you get some pc and he cant go into session well why cant he go into session well the buckets empty well whats the matter well his attention is on so many factors in his immediate environment his attention is so hideously spread and sprayed around that he cannot in any way concentrate any attention on anything else and this is comparable to theres water in the bucket the auditor cant say splash splash over in that direction for moment because theres nothing there to splash dont you see so theres apparently pc present theres nothing but mud when this condition is too multiple when this condition is too chronic when there is never any theta present when there is only mud and the mud is very badly caked they teach them psychology and psychiatry those are the sciences of making mud into more mud now youre trying to do something different when youre trying to audit than just handle mud but your attention could be so thoroughly muddified that you dont recognize your action is to try to recover attention out of the bank now when there is attentionno water in the bucketyou have condition called overrestimulation you dont get any tone arm action tone arm action is the flow of theta to mud or mud to theta and if youve got attention spare attention on the part of the pc to invest in anythingwell therefore the pc is totally tied up in the various concerns that his attention is already invested in therefore you dont have anything left to concentrate on the stable data aberrated stable data you must pick up in order to release some flow do you follow this theres got to be some pc there there cant be totally mud well let give you the extreme action somebodys lying there unconscious you actually cant audit them until you have run some cchtype process and caused them to come to and get into communication with you see now theres the extreme condition of mud mud mud mud you see the extreme condition is unconsciousness all right we take somebody who has fifteen present time problems and hes in foxhole hes being shot at this particular moment he is running out of ammunition he has food left and he has just detected flanking attack in progress to the right of him he sees mortar shells are beginning to bracket him in and you say would you like session well whats going to be the response thats how some pcs feel thats how some pcs feel they feel other way they just eeaahh i dont dare take my attention off all this mud because everything will go to hell if i do there is comm point in other words that you could achieve with which to operate from so at this moment the only thing you can do is find out what the mind is doing and parallel it and youll be able to take some theta back from the mud what is the guy doing what is the mind doing well you have to parallel it there is substitute for that now in routine 4 pc can get so muddified so restimulated so overrestimulated have so many present time problems and have so much keyedin that they dont want to be audited they will kick back against auditing they dont want to be audited that may be the first expression actually what they mean is they dont want to be audited on routine 4 lets say youve got some fellow whos easily and calmly finding items one right after the other pocketapocketapocketapocketa finding items and all of sudden he comes to session he has tremendous present time problem and he just doesnt seem to want to be audited one of two conditions can be wrong there the present time problem can be so overwhelming you cant get his attention on the bank and the other thing that can be wrong is that you have restimulated something or something has gone wrong in the processing which you have not yet detected in other words youve bypassed some charge which has caused mud or restimulation one of those two things is occurring now its interesting that person who has quasipresent time problemthat isnt yet you know totally absorbingbut just on the perimeter of his consciousness rather rather heavy present time problem but not complete catastrophe you understand that the session just before they got this problem you found ten ris in doing routine 4 pocketapocketapocketapocketayou found ten ris then they got this problem you eased the problem up but in that next session you only found four ris not because they were spending timenot because they were spending time you understand dwelling on the problem they were working all rightthe problem keeps occurring to them however but theyre working all right theyre listing all right theyretheyre behaving all right you cannot really detect any vast difference in the behavior of this pc except one you cant get things to fire easily you get the item on the list but you cant get fire see what i mean you have to work it over you list little bit longer you go back and you get to the item again and you call the item and you get the suppress off of the thing you list little longer and the pc says that is the item you cant make the item fire you understand and you finally manage to jockey it around one way or the other and finally you get your fire and your blowdown see its struggle struggle struggle struggle thats because youre running this pc in the presence of attention invested in too many ptpshe is too distracted from the session he is unable to progress easily well now thats what happens to your tone arm motion in lower levels the pcs attention is so absorbed in things you are not addressing that there is attention available to the auditor to put on and asis aberrated stable data so you dont get tone arm action elementary now oddly enough in doing i ii and iii levels of scientology you actually can have condition where the pc runs into level iv where neither the auditor nor the processed or anything else is situated to handle level iv awful catastrophe stares us in the face because there is actually more potential overrestimulation and present time problem on the pcs track than there is in his present time when you look at gpms and their ris there is more potential restimulation on the track than there is in present time thats very interesting in other words he can be more restimulated by reason of keyedin gpms and ris than by simply getting knocked off or something like that in present time you can lock his tone arm upcarack by keying in gpm now this is tremendous liability for scientology levels i ii and iii it is answered by auditing goals with in this lifetime prepchecks pc has put down goal of some kind or another you could audit that goal on prepcheck basis on in this lifetime basis and get rid of the level iv potentiality probably but its messy to work with i wont kid you and you never become more convinced of how messy this is than when youre doing level iv and youve already found the present time goal and youre going back down the track in an orderly fashion all the hard work is done see and the pc goes to the bottom of the second gpm where the goal as an ri is sitting there you see and you stop the sessionat that point because this is just the end of the sessionand you pick this up maybe week later and that pcs tone arm is locked up at 55 and you fool around and you sweat and you monkey and you scratch your head and you have hard time all over the placepcs tone arm is at 55 they left the session at 30 and the tone arm is at 55 well obviously something happened during the week to key them in well it didthere were lot of things happened during the week so you put in your since mid ruds to get your new intensive going so forth youre all set and you put in your since mid rudsand the tone arm doesnt budge and you talk about the things that have happened during the week and nothing happensnothing needles sticky tone arm highyou feel you couldnt move the thing with sledgehammer it looks that stiff and youll say something happened in between now after youve got it all solved youll find out what happened but you go on with your r4 and list for the next goal thats all you had to do and immediately you get bbtzzzzzzzzdown comes the ta and everything starts to run that next goal to be listed for immediately below the third gpm which you were going to go into you see that next goal was enough to keep that thing parked and then you say to the pc did you think about this new list during the week oh yes i told joe that it was possibly blank or blank its held up by wrong goal it was only one of those that simple remark was adequate to park that tone arm theres been fire flood pestilence and disaster happening all week long and yet the whole rudiments went out by saying joe you know i think my next goal is either to spit or to be spat at to spit was wrong goal it was to be spat at that was enough to key it in get the idea ah but you guys are walking around all the time guessing at what your goals might be then when youve got pc running on the track all straightened out you can lock up the tone arm at 55 just by their guessing at somebody what the goal was and there went the tone arm and amount of monkey business and figure and figure and service facsimiles or anything else that you would have done would have moved that tone arm one hair thats something to think about isnt it that shows you the wideopen hole and liabilities of scientology levels i ii and iii those liabilities are all contained in level iv therefore somebody certainly at levels ii and iii should know the liabilities of level iv and should be able to do an arc break assessment of list 4 arc break assessmentwhats simpler youll find goal has been restimulatedan actual goal has been restimulated or an ri has been restimulated something of this particular sort indicate it to the pc and down will come the tone arm then identify which one it was and handle it and up will go the tone armbecause you cant handle it with anything really short of r4 if you didnt know the exact name of the goal you couldnt prepcheck itbut you can at least kick these things out with arc breaktype assessments or case analysis sheets but nothing is going to happen with the case unless those things are patted on the head and rolledoverrover see we got to have this thing out of the road or were not going to get any tone arm action now i see lot of your ears going up at this particular instance saying aha thats probably whats wrong with my pc why i cant get tone arm action well theres possibility that that is the case greater possibility is you havent actually bled the technology itself for total tone arm action yet see thats the greater possibility now pc out on the street here rawmeat pc isnt going around worrying about his goals youre not going to run into this trouble so youre going to get lots of ta action but you take an educated scientologist and hes going to say i wonder what my goal is there was somebody worked on last october and i justso on and we were guessing about it and itsso forth and im just absolutely certain that i have the goal to spit certain of it certain of it i react to it all the time and that sort of thing comes into sessiontone arm 55 how did it get there now heres another oddity present time problems usually occur on the goals channel in fact they almost always occur on the goals channel the present time problem of an accidental accident and that sort of thing might occur off the goals channel but most present time problems are straight on the goals channel and its one or another of the pcs goals now the pc fondly expects that he is influenced by one ri or two risor that his entire character makeup is wound up in the substance of one goal oh noi beg your pardon he will cognite cognite cognite all about his present lifetimehis present lifetime are being influenced by as many as twenty or thirty gpms and literally hundreds and hundreds of ris see hes being influencedhes being influenced all the time so this oddity exists that you actually could see your pc with an enormous problem youre doing since mid ruds prepcheck and you see that you get little tone arm actionyou get some little tone arm action on the subject of women little bit tone arm action on the subject of women otherwise this thing is stuck up like mad but when you hit womenin doing the prepcheck see doing the prepcheck since mid rudshe touches on this subject two or three times and every time he touches on it in one or another buttons get little tiny bit of tone arm action hell feel pretty good when you finish up and you probably should leave it alone but the truth of the matter is if you now addressed women on the subject the gain that he just experienced is liable to vanish why because present time problem ordinarily occurs by reason of keyin of an ri or gpm what is the genus of the present time problem the momentary present time problems we can usually handle but how about these chronic chronic chronic present time problems well certainly those absolutely are the result of the keyin of gpm its keyedin gpm person has ptp ptp ptp ptp ptp you know oh my yes i got ptpptp regarding drafts or something you know or regarding automobile or regarding something of the sorti dont care what it isit just seems to constantly come up you take list 4 or case analysis type sheetthereno case analysis type sheet has been published at this moment but should have been published some time since they simply ask if goals are backwards or one is beyond the other or the actual goals or implant gpms or gpm or an actual gpm its stuff of this character it just takes total analysis have we skipped any gpms you see and all that sort of thing case analysis just takes up every possible condition that these very easily mathematicalled very easily blockedaround gpms you see if you just laid out twenty bricks in row youve got the pattern of the pcs bank i mean its very esoteric just lay out twenty bricks in row label each one goal theyre all in string youve got the picturethats it now the fifteenth brick let us say has to do particularly with money he gets ptphes liable to take the fifteenth brick and bring it up into present time its now out of sequence makes him feel like hell gives him coldmesses him up now your situation thenthis is the source of this type of psychosomatic illness im now giving you better source for psychosomatic illness than you have ever hadthe fifteenth brick see this psychosomatic illness to an educated pc will respond to list 4 analysis or case analysis of gpms you dont know what the goal is see you dont know what the goals are you dont ever find the name of the goal but its on this basis has gpm been keyed in calang you see all right has gpm concerningis that concerning colds or something like that calang you say to the pc youve had gpm keyed in concerning colds thats the end of that coldproviding you dont go completely knucklehead and ask the pc whats the name of the gpmeeuuuhhhhh dont dont start fooling around with the thing because youre going to give him real good cold see it must be the fifteenth gpm out of lineit couldnt be the present time gpm out of line because it couldnt be out of line without being put back into the pastand life doesnt put gpms into the pastlife puts gpms into the present in other words you could probably handle psychosomatic illness if you had an educated pc with list 4 or ease analysis form tone arm action you say well if this case tone arm action isnt present it is quite obvious and nobody can make it go and the auditor is really doing good job of auditingthen it is quite obvious that r4 has gotten in your road got it pc with chronically low ta cant get any tone arm action out of himno matter what you dono matter how smooth the auditing is you jump to the conclusion eventually that r4 has gotten in the road the way to get it out of the road is just to analyze the blue blazes out of it you can spend session or two analyzing case take goals that have been found and you can date the top of them and the bottom of themyou can do all sorts of wild things you can date the top and bottom of gpm dont ever try to just date gpmthis is asinine this is like trying totrying to well gpm you seea gpm exists inacross large span of timeand its like trying to get an average date and the top of the gpm and the bottom of the gpm where the goal as an ri is you see are two different dates and are frankly trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of years apart they are long way apart so you say what is the order of magnitude of this you seeorder of magnitude of what see best thing to do of course is get the order of the magnitude of the top of the gpm get the order of magnitude of the top of the gpm if you really want to fit one back on the track snickwhy get the order of magnitude of the bottom of the gpm and then the order of magnitude of the top of the gpm date both of them and itll move in like ear being parked on ramp its got span gpm has so it doesnt have finite date take somebody with lumbosis all righteducated pc of course this lumbosis being caused by aby gpm an actual goal an implant goal nogpm see whats it caused by lets go over this thing see evenis it caused by an engram is it caused by this caused by that anything that could have caused this lumbosis you seegiving very very very high priority to ris and gpms thats most likelythis thing of chronic lumbosis it must have been an actual goal watch that meter get it to clank you dont know the name of the gpm just tell the pc that thats whats been keyed in things might change all over the place things might go whirclickyou might not have to do any dating at all little further discovery on the thing and little bit of itsa on the part of the pc and the pc finally tells you yeah well there was goal discovered on something and ive had lumbosis ever since and what was the goal well the goal was to catch catfishdiscovered on all right very good very good very good now is that an actual gpm is that an implant gpm is that nogpm is that an actual goal is that an ri is that lock on an ri is that associated with the helatrobus implants implant gpm see where is it helatrobus implants helatrobus implants and run it down little bit more and little bit more and little bit more get the order of magnitude on the meter bzzzbangno lumbosis get the idea this opens up whole field this is very very elementary field its far far far more complicated in your head than it is in actual operation number of gpms the pcs got is formits actually just finite numberi wouldnt state how many because they probably differ and vary from pc to pc lets say we take thirty bricks we string them out in line first brick is time zero the last brick is present time theyre all strung out in line every top of the brick has date the bottom of every brick has date you take one of those bricks and saw it up with little brick saw or chipping hammer or something of the sort and it falls into forty sectionssomething like that those are ris and you can fit them all back together again and youd have your brick again see twenty of them are oppterms twenty of them are terminals elementary as this nothing much to this type of thing i mean its very mechanical strewn up and down the line of these twenty bricks is some tarspots of tar theres little puddle of tar there and theres spot of tar on that brick and theres spot of tar downthose are implant gpms great value except they get somebodys pinafore dirty and then youve got engrams and sitting out alongside of the bricks is bunch of free track in which nothing much happened rather minor activities of one kind or another but its contained with engrams which are enough for any pc to confront this is the stuff you find in r3r seethats strung up and down the track now spotted in amongst the bricks like flour or well lets make it better than thatlittle bits of dough spotted up and down the bricks here and there but thousands and thousands and thousands of them are actual goals value at arexcept to make you make mistakes aberrative value zero these are actual goals pc said i want lollipop that was an actual goal see well that stuck somewhere on this track and because gpms are composed of goals why of course these actual goals tend to stick on them as locks thats the composite of bank what can get wrong with this well bunch of engrams can go into restimulation and bunch of implant gpms can get in restimulation and throw some tar up into present time one of these big massy oh catastrophe one of these bricks can come adrift and go floating on up to present timeor two of these bricks can get crossed up so that one brick is after the other brick and both of them are kind of jarred out of line see the brick that should be brick sixteen now appears to be brick fifteen and the brick that is supposed to be brick fifteen is now appearing as brick sixteen thats enough to give anybody cold or lumbosis see that is miserable and you get two of these gpms crossed up one appearing to be later than the otherbut actually being earlier than the later juxtapositioned gpmstyaow creak spinal meningitis here we come see i mean its wild stuff now even couple of ris pulled up out of line and sometimes you can get an rinow this isthis gets very very difficult you get the fifth gpm pulled out of linethats already pulled out of line and then for some cockeyed reason the fifteenth ri in it is so much like the twentieth brick gpm that it comes all the way up the line pulling half of its gpm with it and moves in on the twentieth gpm and when you try to do anything with the twentieth gpm you run into this fifteenth ri maybe its called physical indispositions or something like this you see and that is pinned to the goal to be sick well actually these things are pretty neatits pretty neat you think of the bank as chaos man you shouldnt think of bank as chaos bank is pretty neat but its stripped around and stretched around lets say bricks five to eight have been brought up and inserted between bricks nineteen and twenty they wont be in line your pc wont feel good thatll be misery somehow or another now you busily busily busily start listing and instead of getting the present time gpm you get brick five and then by some horror or another you get that what opposes brick five is brick nineteen see theres some reason theyre out of line because the goals sound alike or something and the pc just goes zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz youve got brick number fivemy god the power and horsepower in brick number five compared to brick number thirty you see is enormous theres real beefy brick so youve got that up there and its pinned up onto brick nineteen and you start from brick nineteen on forward and you cant seem to get any plaaaaaaace lists dont pan out nothing happens and you cant get any fiftypast the last rr and nothing rrs on the list and the pc is going mad and youve got arc breaks going and so forth and you finally get bright and start checking back over all the stuff you found and you all of sudden find that brick five was gotten instead of brick eighteen see and there are two other gpms hanging out here and theyre all pulled out of line well the second you find this all out and straighten it all out it all goes back on the trackclang bang you see and brick five to eight they go back on the track and theyre on the track at five to eight and then you get nineteen and you take off from eighteen where you should have started off from in the first place and you dont get brick five which was out of position but now get brick nineteen and the pc smooths right out and you move by goal oppose right on up into pt you start thinking of the mind as vehicle of thought and you are already licked in handling it it is not an instrument of thought its made out of bricks tar see things its full of things pc as his itsa maker gets little freer and so forth he gets able to look at these things and so forth he can spot themhe can spot them he can tell you its brick numberoneim sure its brick number nine i can see hole back here in the lineup and brickyou knowgpm that gpm is up here and it shouldnt be up here and theres something all twisted up and you the auditor knowing best keep saying oh well really and so on but it fits and mybut yeah but i see hole back here and ii know thatthatthat gpm shouldnt be back there it should be up here and we havent got the gpm that should be here i dont see anything here and where were supposed to have gpm i dont have anything but theres one missing back there and the one thats missing back there is the think1 think the one youre trying to put in up here and you well you know best so you dont do anything and the pc starts going ggguuuuhrrrrrrccraaawwwkbing see in other words he can actually start spotting these things and they dothey look like great big rough black bricks probably the reason the helatrobus implant people covered up the planets with black energyand they did they made quite campaign of itwas to stimulate everybody on the subject of gpms that was part of the restimulation black energy and you show thetan lot of massive black energy and he gets kind of gggueahhcreak because it looks like his own gpms dont you see so thats enough to key him in and hes liable to feel rather weird now do these bricks ever go back together again and go back into place of their own natural bent you have to roll up your sleeves and find out where theyre out of line and put them back in place well thats normally done in r4 running but supposing all this happens while youre running rilevel i processes well actually it shouldnt happen because level i processes are normally being run on rawmeat pc and they wouldnt know from nothing about it anyway supposing it happens at levelwell if it happens at level i if you could imagine it happening at level 1 thats just tough thats how its solved is thats tough itd take level ii capable auditor to do anything whatsoever about it or run any kind of an assessment or any type of action that would do anything about this dont you see so you just neglect these factors at level i because it would be dangerous for you to do anything else but neglect them you dont get level 1 auditor in other words trying to straighten out gpms he gonna make more hash man he gonna make more hash than he gonna make straighten out see so thats just something that you should sayin level i if you run into that kind of trouble with level i auditor well skip it or turn the pc over to somebody else all right now your next levels however should be somewhat educated in arc break assessments and if they arent theyre going to run into the pc whose tone arm action is not occurring for the excellent reason that he has gpms ris something or other keyed in and therefore is locked up on the track now the way to do it is not to start to run r4 on the guy dont let class ii auditor or class iii auditor start running r4 on the guy because the only thing you can do to ruin somebodys case would be to ruin his r4 got that now you get his present time gpm and find it all backwards and upside down and mix it up and get it so it couldnt read and then go down the line and miss the two intervening gpms and take all the charge out of the next gpmhow the devil is anybody going to make this straight again its going to be pretty horrible so you better find it and get it done right but there is something within the limits of r2 and r3 that you can do you can do these prepchecks on this lifetime on goals which have come up the pc has announced certain goals or appears to have certain goals or theyve been found on himyou can do prepcheck on that goal and in this lifetime and get considerable relief and you can do arc break assessments or case analysis of level iv type or naturehowever you get over the bridge of communication with the pc that is the difficulty there and do this type of analysis on the case and pat these things back into place find out whats wrong now theres level at which this cant happen nothing will straighten it out its case that has been run on r4 by an inexpert auditor and abandoned now you can only go so far in patching up this caseonly so far you can find the gpms that are out of line and whether or not they were actually trying to run goals on implant gpms when they were trying to run patterns on actual goals when they were actually implant gpms you can get these confusions out of the road and do quite bit for the caseyou can do quite bit for the case you can get gpm that has been pulled out of line and missed and so forth but an incomplete goals list is an incomplete goals list and there is way around itexcept to complete it so ease that has been very thoroughly loused up and i do mean thoroughly loused upby level 0 auditor running level iv processesgpms pulled out of line all torn up messed up one way or the other halfbanks run one way or the other skipped and abandonedall of these various other things occurring there is only one remedyone real remedy because it takes this much knowhow and that is to get class iv auditor to audit the pc and straighten the pc out and finish the goals lists and finish the ease up thats about the only thing you could do about it you can make the case somewhat comfortable you understand you can kick gpms that are out as bypassed charge and you can do these things but if that case has been run great deal inexpertly on r4 its going to take class iv auditor working like the mischief wishing to god nobody had ever put his paws on the case to straighten the case out got it this is dynamitetype action but actually at levels ii and iiia gpm kicked out of line somebody fooled with goal little bit real r4 ever run on the case somebody found goal on the ease or something like thatjust analyze the goal pat it back into the place and the case will be as right as rain see see you find out they found goal but it was an actual goal or it was wrongly worded gpm or wrongly worded actual gpm see or something like this you dont even have to find the right wordings for it just kick it out of line straighten it up its quite remarkable what you can do with just giving prepcheck to wrong goal found on pc too by the way you knownot even in this lifetime in other words some bird had at r3somebody enthusiastically found couple of goals on him well great day lets find out and dig up what these goals were and lets analyze these goals by just your standard analysis form you see is it this and is it that and is it something or other and is it something or other and all of suddenclang clang clangits an actual goal but it isnt gpm well thats sure the end of that charge indicated to the pc and hes away see so there are various things which youre up against in auditing at the lower levels and it would not be friendly of to omit to mention them now that isnt the reason you dont happen to be getting tone arm action you arent getting tone arm action on the pc for an entirely different reason you of course got the itsa line cut and you got the pc whatsiting while you itsai know why youre not getting tone arm action so dont include now the reason youre not getting tone arm action with what ive just said because ill just ignore it thats joke the truththe truth of the matteri dont think theres case in this room that hasnt had gpms pushed about and so forth one way or the other and who couldnt stand case analysis on this level of action which would then restore tone arm action considerably to the ease see but you see from an instruction viewpoint i have to hold the point that theres nothing wrong with caseits just you see otherwise youll never find out that an expert auditor can simply sit down and get ta action but then you must know sufficiently well that you can get ta action you must have enough confidence in it you see to know what is wrong with case or that there is something wrong with case if youre not getting ta action on it you follow this logic you see if the reason you were getting ta action or the reason you were getting ta action on the case is because you always had the pcs itsa line cutevery time he starts to look at the bank you drop the meter or something like this then youd never discover any of these other softer nuances because you just get ta action which would compare to ta action on case dont you see neverthelessill be serious nowyou should take up any case that has ever been run on any goals or any goal ever found on the case and so forth in effort to get ta action and find out what in the name of common sense ismakes with the bank see what is it all about what is it all about your list 4 is actually good enough for starter but you need one of these case analysis sheets to really get going theyve had this goal found on them to film while rum is burning see or something like that you suspect that the wording of this gpm might not be all that is desired you see and so forth well it takes little bit of fancy is this an incorrectly worded goal you know and is this an incorrectly worded actual gpm there are various nuances here of analysis which dont appear on your l4 but you could figure them out just by fooling around with bricks for while i meani mean fooling around with bricks for while just line up some bricks and number them one two three four five six seven eight every alternate brick is going to be the dichotomy of every single brick you see i mean every other brick is the opposite to every other brick see so each ones going to be dichotomy first brick is to be white to be black you see to be clean and the next one is not to have tattletale gray you got the idea see theyre harmonizing as you go up the line and the ris in those things follow the pattern of the old gpm to scream you actually could go out here and line up twenty bricks and say all right those are gpms and lay some sticks along the line and say those things arethose are implant areas theres four or five of these things later on the track you see little groups and theres some implant areas so theyll be implant gpms dont you see and you scatter some pebbles around and say those arethose are actual goals and this is the time track and the time period of this thirtieth brick or twentieth brick or however many youve got made inlaid out there its time span is this and recognize your time span is going to get longer as you go earlier per brick for the top and the bottom of the brick and of course the ones that heador the end that heads away from present time thats the goal as the ri end the name of the gpm is on that end furthest from present time and at the top of it which is the end of the gpm closer to present time the pc is deadly opposed to the substance of the goal and is himself something entirely opposite from the goal and you look at this and start playing with it and its familiarity breeds familiarity and you eventually will know what in the name of common sense youre doing with this thing because right nowright now you might be auditing somebody and you say well theres all kinds of these things and they have service facsimile poked here and thats little quill pen or something thats stuck in here they jabbed people with and theres this and theres that and you get befogged by the fact that theres so many pictures you cant see the woods for the trees because bank just has billions and billions and trillions of billions of pictures and theres just so many pictures in the bank you never see whats in it dont you see banks very entrancing but the overall look at the bank shows you the important things in the bank and the things really contained those things which you have to audit in actual fact are just these thirty bricks the other stuff is window dressing and its taken us all these years to get through the trees to find the trees theres lots there to audityou can find all kinds of things to audit and so long as you dont disturb these gpms you probably wont get into much trouble and the processes you have on routine 1your level i ii and iii those levels in actual fact are not apt to restimulate too much in the way of gpms but if you notice that it gets perilously closer to it the higher the level so that at level iiiat level iii when you start auditing service facsimiles youre actually disturbing ris and all of sudden the guy comes up with rocket reading goal well it depends lot on what you do with that rocket reading goal as to whether or not you upset the gpm pattern because it may not be the present time gpm at all it may be the fifth gpm trillions god help us years ago pulled completely out of line and youre now going to prepcheck this thing you see uuuuuhhdynamite those are the objects which you are handling they handle like macaroni or spaghetti or bricks or any other physical commoditythey got lot of names inside of them and they look certain way and they act certain way and theyre done certain way and so forth and if youre releasing them you get tone arm action if youre leaving it all the same or making it worse youre not getting tone arm action i mean youve got your perfect test do you get tone arm action see theres lot oflot of material here well ive spent lot of time trying to sum it up so that you couldinto its bits and pieces and parts and that sort of thingso you could take look at it and know what youre stumbling over and all that sort of thing there are bound to be some people some students at first some auditors who will say oh god youi dont see all that in the bank i know what bank is consisted of bank is consisted of this medallion somebody whos had freudian analysis great deal well its actually considered with this circle and this arrow and thats really what it is all about and so forth theyre just stuck on the track looking at single picture you startyou have to start shaking loose from this to see the rest of the junkthe mechanics of it well how is building built well with great deal more simplicity particularly if the building was childs building made out of play toys bricks or something like that thats the way the mind is built it is actually more seriously built than bunch ofa bunch of bricks lined upits about that each brick breaking down into component parts which are terminals and oppterms and which lie in adjacent patterns you know the patterns are top bang pair next pair next pair next pair next pair terminalopptermall very neat youre an idiot to build them that way but thats the way you build them and these things go on back to the beginning of track and so forth now why are these things continued in creation all the time well you just underestimate your ability or the pcs ability to create multiply how much can pc create and how much can he keep created simultaneously its fantastic your ability is absolutely fantastic everybodys ability is completely underestimated you can create so well that youd even stop yourself with your own creations its terrific and you can create so well and so complexly and so unawarely that you then cant find yourselffind your own way back out of your own mirror maze now there is slightest doubt about the fact that when person is sick theyre sick and when persons crazy theyre crazy and when theyre suffering theyre suffering because lookthe last godhelpus number of years nobody has even guessed any part or corner of the puzzle called the human mind and during that period of time great many guys have suffered and gone through lot of agony that they didnt want to go through we have the other factor does person want to be this way can person by his own bootstraps get out of it its rat race and mirror maze and so forth that was very simple when you finally had its final anatomy but right up to the moment when you did you could only get lost in your own creations and the actual fact in this universe there is nothing to get lost in but your own creations but where one finds pc who is in trouble the trouble is with the thirty bricks with the free track going alongside of the thirty bricks with the implant tar scattered over the bricks with the bits and pieces of dough all over the place that mark the actual goals and all this is lumped up into the form of matter energy space and time included in the nevernever land called his mind which actually has space some time some thetan will make tremendous effort to line these things up all by himself hell be exteriorized betweenlives area sort of thing hes avoided it hell be trying madly to line these things up sitting someplace thinking it overlooking at themwondering what the hell these pieces of energy are tryingto get them off of him trying to get them off of his face trying you know like cat trying to wash its paws you know and not be able to make headway on it at all and great canyon huge canyon cleft in the mountains and so on utterly filled with these gpms you know hes looking at them hes terrified outside he can of course see the walls he can also see the gpms you see his perception is greater fill up half the grand canyon full of thefull of these confounded gpms trying to trying towell what the hell are they whichwhich way do i go what is it nobody there emeter its all subitsa he cant make it he cant make it been tried even when you knew that close because you couldnt get the exact combination to asis that then asised it and undid it because it was all in perfect balance and there were too many possible combinations to sort them out even if you knew their anatomy youd raise hell trying to put them together if you at this moment knowing everything you know were to be on top of mount ararat trying to take your bank to pieces so that you wouldnt be around the bend with it or something like thisfree and clear body to be affected all the time in the world to do it withyou wouldnt have chance that is my condensed opinion on the matter yeah youd come back and pick up body but you need body to hold an emeter without the emeter you cant do blasted thing for it meter isnt just something that helps now ive tried to work out other systems which passed the emeterwhich bypassed the emeter which did things listing systems of listing far enough and finally only come up with the one goal you see listing system of one character or another and ive gotten exactly nowhere exactly nowhere over long period of time and many times tried to throw out the emeter and many times tried to shortcircuit it and wonder why we had to have an auditor and wonder this and wonder that obviously an auditor is necessary because thetan restimulated by his own bank cannot perceive his own bank but an auditor not restimulated by that bank he is auditing can perceive through the meter that bank and therefore can audit it so he can get out of the woods well the road out of the woods is well mapped there it is ive given you talk about it and graphic representation of what it consists of you say well there are thousands of tricks of the trade which i dont yet know well thats your barrier there arent thousands of the tricks of the trade that you dont know there is nothing there that with meter with model session with the anatomy of this thing and with the rules of r4n2 with modicum of good sense and good heart you couldnt make the grade with pc totally feasible itll take you perhaps if youre just starting in auditing this stuff itll take you for while to realize that there arent more barriers than there are youll have to fumble your way through it and find your own feet and get yourself into situation where youre not holding your breath and your worry isnt getting you in the road and up the line someplace in relatively few months if youre just starting in on it you will all of sudden be asking yourself the question why did i find this so difficult why did i find this so difficult and you know why i know youll be asking that is because i went through that exact same situation i could not at the present moment possibly imagine r4m2 as being difficult process theres just nothing to it it is the easiest auditing i ever did in my life its breeze matter how busy i am doing it pc starts arc breaking you must have gone past the item pc cant get something to read well there must be something wrong here lets go back and find out what the most extreme conditions which cause balkthe most extreme conditions of auditing and so forthand even those are dead easy the most extreme conditions that you will run into in pc i have run into and theyre dead easy so what youve got to learn is what ive had to learn is that there are practically reasons why you cant do it and once you can do that all youve got to do is take this thread apart from the pt gpm with its top items straight on back down the track pocketapocketapocketapocketa gpm by gpm by gpm by gpm each one taken carefully apart item by item by item with mistakes as you go mistakes are perfectly obvious when you make them take them all the way back down the track youre not going to get back to time zero before youve got an ot man youre not going to even vaguely do it starting in its absolute hell on the pc all the way up along the line goal oppose goal oppose goal oppose goal opposeoh wow hes got goals in restimulation and youve skipped goals and goals get pulled out of line and oohhh and then he lists things and then all of sudden you finally find the goal on the list but its an implant gpm and you go on and the lists are incomplete and you cant find out why youre incompleting lists and you find horribly six goals ago you found an implant gpm which at that time read as an actual gpm because the case was too overburdened to read right so you throw away everything that you have found and the pc goes into decline because you have thrown away his gpms so you come back and you realize that that is what you did and you find where they do belong on the time track move them into position go back and take the sixth list all the way back finish that thing and then keep on going to present time with it and finally you will get thereif youre alive and the pc is still alive this is necessary to successful auditing that is the most hellish part of it but once youre in pt without any mistake and once youve got the top ri without any mistake from then on you have to be complete mutt to make mistake you know you have to havebe auditing with both feet hanging from the ridgepole you know and the emeterthe emeter completely out of batteries and the pc long gone its real wild see thats making ots youve got this whole band and span of auditing up to that point of skill and capabilitylevels i ii and iii you also of course have old types and styles of auditing they arestill exist and theyre still valid but as you go all the way up along the line on this auditing remember that it is always the same bank that you are auditing dont get tricked into the fact because you have different name or different level that you have different bank in front of youit is always the same bank matter what level it is audited with or what pc youre auditing that is an interesting thing to keep in mind because you start getting too enthusiastic at level iii you should realize that you are auditing bank and that you are pulling ris around in that bank in order to get tone arm action and frankly the only level that really fills with horror is level iii frightening because i know whats going on and once you become very proficient as class iv auditor level iii will fill you with fits too apparently you can get away with level iii only so long as you close your eyes as to what you are actually doing youre moving gpms and ris aroundthats what youre doing at level iii and dont kid yourself otherwise that you can get away with it is tremendous attestation to pcs endurance and your auditing but there is the integration of auditing and the only other thing i would tell you on it is you can do it you can do it the only reason you couldnt do it is because you conceive it to be more complicated than it is you can do it for instance iveive been auditing quite bit of modern r4 now and i find this very satisfying auditing worries at all about tone arm action man i get as much tone arm action as i find ris and keep chuggetychuggetychugging and going on down the bank see i get as much tone arm action as i audit rapid r4 and let the pc itsa and not rush the pc and let the pc be pc and not get the pc out of session what do you suppose is wrong what do you think is wrong oh you think its wrong youyouwell im having trouble here i dont know what the trouble is so forth and the pc starts whats he doing whatsit whatsit whatsit of course i dont get tone arm action and in actual fact i can get as much tone arm action out of session as i can drive myself to run its that how much tone arm action if i could audit just little bit faster not rushing the pc any faster but if i could audit just little bit faster why i could probably get seventy divisions per two and half hours see im having hard time ive hit ceiling its about fifty sixty divisions see and i dont know how to increase it and i might start writing in shorthand or something like that that might increase it you see now im in sort of contest of that particular line but this is auditing this is the auditing youre going toward this is the auditing you should be able to do and this is the auditing you can do and anybody thats standing around telling you how difficult it is to do this auditing of course is just filling the air full of entheta because the truth of the matter is its very simple to do this auditing its the simplest auditing there is probably level i is more complex than level iv because at level i you havent got anything to do well there it is i wish you luck with it thank you
