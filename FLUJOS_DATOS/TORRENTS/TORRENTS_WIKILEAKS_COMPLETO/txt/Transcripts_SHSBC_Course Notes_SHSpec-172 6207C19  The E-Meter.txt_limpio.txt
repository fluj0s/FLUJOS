6207c19 shspec172 the emeter the emeter was devised as an aid to help an auditor observe pc it certainly beats fingers on pulses the first mathison meter wasnt built as modified wheatstone bridge until emeters were developed people thought such galvanometers were reading sweat not thought because the earlier galvanometers were so insensitive engineers and electronics men in scientology have not always recognized the possibility of meter that directly reads electric thoughtimpulses not the physical results of these thoughtimpulses homemade emeters built by people who do know something about psychogalvanometers often have builtin lag which is meant to protect the movement the needle is damped down so reads are late you read sweat etc hence instant reads the first mathison meter wouldnt read on large percentage of people so lrh got mathison to expand it by the end of 1952 we had pretty good meter the very first meter had tiny electrodes little metal bars and didnt give mental reads lrh and jim elliot got the idea of using soup cans which did result in being able to get reads the emeter can detect whether pc is auditable it is coincidence that it just happens that when you can read pc on meter that pc is in good shape when persons needle is in constant agitated rockslam eg with real manicdepressive or schitzophrenic psychotic metered process works on them anyway cchs are all you can use fortunately they are available if you can read the meter on him he can be audited on think process eg prepchecking the meter ran us into complete culdesac we had had knowledge of the whole track before but the meter made it clear how many engrams there were this made dianetics look wrong as long as you audited only this lifetime you could make someone look very good but it was obviously impossible to run out every engram on the whole track because the number is infinite lrh in the past had refused to let pcs be subjected to experimental processes because they might get their heads blown off sometimes he used himself as guinea pig for that reason the board of the first dianetic foundation started to resign when lrh started looking at whole track they discovered at that point that hubbard could get mad his attitude was that one was going to say what could or could not be researched they decided that he must not be clear at that time which was the time of early research with the emeter and history of man 1952 lrh and msh went down to the library and started looking up words they came up with scio and ology this seemed to express what we wanted moving out of the field of the mind into the field of knowing the mind is only vessel of knowledge so new approach was required exteriorization started coming up lrh and msh went to phoenix one night evans farber showed up and wouldnt go away lrh finally asked him what he wanted and found that he had discovered the process try not to be three feet back of your head as an exteriorization process that was practically the end of the emeter because you cant read thetan who is out of his head lrh tried to develop thetameter the trouble was that it detected the auditor as well as the thetan who was the pc because it didnt require one to be exterior to read on it it was very simple electronically it used magic eye type detector in about 1955 or 1956 emeters went out of use they revived after the clearing acc probably in 5802c07 19acc15 help how to get started and 5802c13 19acc19 other processes the help button other tape titles from this acc may be more relevant but i dont have them in the us when lrh assessed people with the meter don breeding joe wallace pinkham and others were working on meters and one of them designed transistorized emeter in 1957 it was found to be very useful in clearing people it was used with fiveway help bracket to clear fifteen or twenty out of seventy people as long as lrh did the assessment we know now that the people who went clear were those who had beingness goal and chose the terminal of that beingness goal to run on the fiveway help they made first dynamic keyedout clear that is you could clear anyone with help whose terminal was also his goal the trick of assessment was to find the rock which would sometimes coincide with the wording of goal this got meters back in when it became clear that you wouldnt clear anyone without meter this was horrible because lrh had never been able to teach an auditor to use one not that he had tried very hard the step six phenomenon that was run into not long afterwards was the result of running someone on button that wasnt on his goal line not from creativeness beefing up the bank per if his goal was run out or desensitized you could then run any creative process with bad effect otherwise the button of alteration of creativeness can get activated which is the bankcreator see pp 285287 above when bank starts to go solid thats fun the difficulties of auditors finding correct rock loomed enormously we now had two factors that were missing 1 we needed technology that would unwind any accidental out of this package of clearing so there would be unknown data 2 we needed to get to the point where an auditor could interpret the data we did find the first british meters were copies of american meters fowler and allen built them at first with idea of what they were building one day lrh sat allen down and ran responsibility process on him on whatever he was looking at put him on the meter located his dead warcompanion that he felt he had overts on and found that he was looking at window surrounded by blackness he ran responsibility for this scene and got more and more room in the picture suddenly he got the whole sequence with full kinesthesia all sensations and more stuck picture lrh explained bits and pieces about the emeter to fowler and allen they went on to build the mark ii iii and eventually the mark iv with an improved circuit they also worked on an ot meter the job of the meter is still what it always was to detect what the pc has in the reactive bank it is incidental that the meter detects ruds problems or what the pc is thinking or doing or whatever what we need most is to know what he has in the bank so that the bank can be assessed the emeter has been designed and must be designed to detect the pcs prime postulate otherwise you wont clear anyone if meter wont detect prime postulate in an individual it is useless even if it could be used to get ruds in good meter must be very sensitive yet not pick up everything that the pc is doing physically but this has not been the main liability of meters the liability has always been auditor reading now that this has been singled out as the weakest point in auditing it can get fixed also more is known now about meter reads and auditor ability all the auditor is missing on is certainty on whether the needle read or is clean trouble with knowing when it read is solved by not looking until you say the last syllable and by drilling on when the needle is or isnt reading so all auditors must learn to read an emeter or they simply cannot audit you have to be able to detect the thing in the mind that is keeping the pc from being clear you ve got to learn to read meters good safe auditor can read meter an unsafe one cannot
