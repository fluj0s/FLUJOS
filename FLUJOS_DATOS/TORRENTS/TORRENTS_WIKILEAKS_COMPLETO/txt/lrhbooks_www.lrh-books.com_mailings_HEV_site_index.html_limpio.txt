associated with him socially it would be of some benefit to know by looking at him and talking to him for couple of minutes what this individual had in store for you in his friendship with you 10

castilian spanish latam swedish history of this series in the last chapter of dianetics the modern science of mental health l ron hubbard spoke of the broad application of dianetics to the third dynamic with the ultimate aim of world without war where humankind could aspire to higher goals by the fall of 1950 and with hundreds of dianetics groups and organizations expanding into very aberrated planet the need for such technology was acute thus ron began codification of the fundamental laws of group dianetics as he explained at the time dianetics has kept on advancing not only in the line of individual processing but all the other dynamics you should realize that each dynamic is full subject and two or three months ago i woke up to the fact that we have not thoroughly examined yet the third dynamic whole science lay in the third dynamica whole science thereafter research into both the first and third dynamics progressed in tandem with each study illuminating the other the discovery that life energy existed as separate and distinct from the physical universe further illuminated the true nature of group as life entity in itselfquite distinct from mest moreover just as with an individual group was attempting to conquer the physical universe and with each failure came consequent enturbulation and drop in tone these findings were summarized in series of watershed essays detailing how to create and maintain hightoned group included among these an essay on management and an essay on authoritarianism but given group survival is dependent on both group and individual tone level ron provided something more it followed from the fact that just as an auditor must be able to evaluate the case state of preclear group must be able to evaluate the state of its members and so predict future behavior thus in early 1951 at his home in palm springs california ron began mapping out the complete manifestations of human emotion character and reaction at every level of survival this work culminated in the landmark hubbard chart of human evaluation and its comprehensive text science of survival with this technology at hand ron next scheduled special course in human evaluation which commenced on the 13th of august 1951 at the wichita foundation in addition to foundation students and in evidence of the sweeping demand for this technology many wichita civic leaders and industrialists were also present whereupon he revealed all he had discovered encompassing human behavior on both the first and third dynamics the nature of life force and its role in the physical universe the interaction of the eight dynamics the vital importance of group arc and the application of the tone scale and the hubbard chart of human evaluation across every dynamic whats this series about how do you know who to trust who to hire or promote who to watch out for how can you infallibly spot persons tone level heres data covered nowhere else that enables you to penetrate the social veneer and perceive the real person you have in front of you in fact youll know how to gain in minutes the equivalent of years of experience with the person the answers are in these ten lectures beginning with the fundamental understandings behind human evaluationthe role of life energy in the physical universe the dynamics and the senior laws of arc here too are the complete manifestations of human emotion character and behavior at every level of survival as laid out on the hubbard chart of human evaluation and ron details the application of human evaluation in the most practical of terms how do you spot persons tone level by observing their communication their attitudes their reaction to motion the state of their possessions and much more and heres how to gain agreement and cooperation from someone in anger covert hostility apathy or any other tone this is technology for your usepowerful principles to create sanity across the dynamics the lectures there are 10 lectures in this series on cd they come with complete and fully verified transcripts and an extensive glossary this series also comes with guide booklet containing the hubbard chart of human evaluation key issues on group dianeticsan essay on management and an essay on authoritarianismand glossary encompassing both lectures and issues synopsis of the lectures 1 the purpose of human evaluation human behavior is something human beings have been rather curious about in the last few thousand years any time you meet human being and become associated with him socially it would be of some benefit to know by looking at him and talking to him for couple of minutes what this individual had in store for you in his friendship with you lrh in any business how do you know who to trust who to rely on who to hire or promote lrh reads message to garcia by his uncle elbert hubbard illustrating the difficulty executives have in finding reliable employees who despite any and all barriers can follow through with initiative and achieve an objective why attempting to run an organization as testing crucible for new staff is expensive and wasteful and how the subject of human evaluation as developed in dianetics enables one to establish few years experience with person in just few moments how to know who to trust who is lying who will repay loan and who wont 2 the dynamics of existence life as an energy is very definitely operating behind this this tone scale is representation of the fact that life form has as good chance of surviving as it has been able to better the suppressors in its environment in other words its got to have been better in overcoming its environment than the environment was in overcoming it lrh what is life doing how is it surviving what is the penalty for not surviving lrh reveals the basics of life energy in the physical universe and exactly what the hubbard chart of human evaluation measures what the dynamics are and how these interrelate and add up to the total survival of an individual and the principle of survival in abundance how tone level is established by how well an individual deals with the suppressors on his dynamics 3 conquest of the physical universe if you consider that all life forms are interdependently active and engaged upon the same mission and that all of these forms are acting in mutual support of the same mission you begin to understand the human organism and why man acts as he does lrh ron reveals the most basic factors that determine persons level on the tone scale all linked to the basic nature of being and the mission to conquer the physical universe why does persons drive get blunted and what happens to ones dreams and goals over time here is why people tend to go down tone with age revealing the exact point at which an individual stops living and starts to dieand how one brings an individual back to life 4 personality the stages of reaction to the physical universe can be labeled with precision the amount of painphysical pain that has been sufferedthe amount of repulsion the environment has done for the individual the amount of rejection brings about evidently an energy constant lrh what is the difference between the brain and the mind how does the mind record perceive and compute what is the role of pain and pleasure ron reveals what happens when the amount of pain overbalances the amount of pleasure and how the environment becomes dangerous to the individual youll also discover the nature of life force endowment and if it varies from individual to individual 5 self analysis i want you to pay very close attention to the lecture tonightvery close attention i am going to give you talk on how you talk about the tone scale to people who dont know anything about dianetics lrh ron introduces the book self analysis with stories of what happened to the transcription typist and the linotype operator when they were working on the book and began running the processes revealing the best way to introduce dianetics to new personby telling them about the tone scaleron then proceeds to give model tone scale lecture describing what it is how it was discovered and how an individual handles truth at each level 6 the tone scale now there is behavior pattern for each one of these moods and we say that an individual gets fixed at position on this scale he does his pattern behavior will be at one of these levels if he more or less gets fixed on one of these scales lrh ron lays out the levels of the tone scale how they were derived and the manifestations and behavior at each level of the scale here is the tech of getting agreement and cooperation from someone in anger grief apathy or any tone ron describes the technology of matching tone in detail here is why you cant deal with people at one tone level and shows how salesman for instance would have to have sales talk for each different tone level how to spot tone by observing persons car possessions work space machineryand even their desk drawer 7 motion and emotion the control of self the control of the motions of self the control of the motions of things particularly dangerous things in the environment the control of the motions of things which are prosurvival in the environmentall these things add up to sanity person is then able to predict his survival lrh ron shows how the basis of matter energy space and time is motion and how motion relates to emotion with many examples he illustrates how an individual reacts to motion in his environment at each tone level and even demonstrates how person would deal with broken piece of machinery at different tones 8 motion and emotion continued this is important to know how an individual gets stuck on the various levels of the tone scale how come he gets stuck what fixes him well his motion has been impeded too often lrh ron describes the bodys motor controls nervous system and glandular system how these interact with persons emotions how the interruption of beings selfdeterminism drives the person down scale how person gives and receives orders at different levels of the scale and how to talk to people at different levels so they actually hear you 9 motion and the tone scale notice an individual when he tries to move piece of mest first he gets conservative about it and then he gets antagonistic and then hell get angry if it doesnt move and then hell get scared of the darn thing lrh ron describes the motor switchboards of the brain what they are and what they do what happens to an individuals motor controls and perceptions to the point where the environment is handling him why failure to carry out motion on the environment will drive being down tone and the exact dividing line between life and death 10 the arc triangle you can find out lot about people by just listening instead of talking for few minutes lrh ron describes affinity reality and communication as the components of theta or life force how you can increase affinity with person without saying word how to increase agreement and communication within group and thus increase their tone what happens with communication at different levels of the tone scale and how to improve it how to spot tone from the persons physical appearancesuch as the condition of their skin and their weight order your set by clicking here phone 800 7221733 2004 bridge publications
