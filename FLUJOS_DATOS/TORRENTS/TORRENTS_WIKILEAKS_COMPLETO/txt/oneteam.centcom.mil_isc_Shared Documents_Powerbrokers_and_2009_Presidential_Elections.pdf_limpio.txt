powerbro kers and the 2009 pr esidential elections u pmesii1 reach back team point paper unclassified sections only u key points u karzai is the early favourite however the emergence of unified opposition combined with low pashtun support could negatively impact his campaig n u powerbrokers may be more important in the post election environment than in the pre election environment background u the purpose of this report is to gauge the potential role of powerbrokers in the upcoming afghan presidential election the two key questions answered are what kind of role will powerbrokers play in the elections and when will they play that role to do this we must bear in mind two things where political power resides in afghanistan and the nature of powerbrokers politica l power is spread out among tribal authorities large landowners religious leadership educated elites current giroa officials military forces legal and illegal and powerbrokers all of these sources even when combined represent small fraction of the overall afghan population they do not include the vast majority of rural afghans who in economic terms subsist on various forms of agriculture the majority of afghans see informal political functions occur at the clan village and tribe level f ormal bureaucratic governance is entirely absent from the daily lives of rural afghans who comprise most of the total population the physical makeup of afghanistan combined with the absence of formal politics in large swaths of territory creates an auth ority vacuum filled by regional and local powerbrokers powerbrokers utilize geography ethnicity military and financial resources and foreign support to gain keep and use their influence that influence is used to further powerbrokers personal objectives but also to provide assistance to powerbroker supporters the dual nature of powerbroker influence makes them unique part of afghan politics u discussion u key powerbrokers such as dostum sayyaf atta hekmatyar and ismail khan have influence over distinct geographic areas in afghanistan they hold sway over their respective areas and occasionally fight each other in limited turf wars thus far powerbrokers have not displayed national ambition they have been content to stay in their re gions however if competition for power and wealth become national struggles powerbrokers may not be content to remain regional players one issue that could surface during the presidential elections capable of changing regional dynamics into national d ynamics is perceived or actual pashtun dominance of giroa powerbrokers 1 political military economic social information and infrastructure can use pashtun dominance of giroa to stir up and harness fear among their own ethnic blocks building resentment towards perceived pashtun domination could be an incentive for afgha nistans ethnic minorities to cooperate cooperation among the ethnic minorities of afghanistan could lead to more unified opposition u the biggest electoral threat to second term for karzai is the emergence of unified opposition combining the votes of uzbeks hazaras tajiks and turkmen could challenge karzais ability to win the election outright the combination of unified opposition and low voter turnout among pashtuns would be the worst of all electoral worlds from karzais perspective it is unlikely non pashtun could garner the necessary 50 of the popular vote needed to win the presidential election out right but run off would be blow to karzais credibility in afghanistan forcing run off could be seen as secondary object ive or consolation prize for the opposition weakened president karzai would be more susceptible to opposition political maneuvering after the election in tight race powerbrokers could play an important post election role if the validity of the result s comes into question u conclusion u logistical support for the election is critical if the election is postponed for logistical reasons karzai will likely come under increasing pressure from the opposition his supporters as well as the intern ational community delayed presidential election will have ripple effect on the parliamentary elections scheduled for 2010 powerbrokers may offer to help get votes for president karzai and other candidates at the same time thus extracting multiple p ayments and setting themselves up to receive favours matter who wins it is against powerbroker interest to stay out of the election completely as such course would bring them lesser profit alliances made between powerbrokers towards an election objective are not likely to stay intact after the election in the post election atmosphere there could be rush by powerbrokers to cash in their favours leading to increased tensions and instability across the country powerbrokers pre election activit would be maximized by working behind the scenes whereas after the elections they may openly move to the forefront the period right after the election is critical this is afghanistans first peaceful transition of power in long time and it is the pla ce powerbroker influence will count the most
