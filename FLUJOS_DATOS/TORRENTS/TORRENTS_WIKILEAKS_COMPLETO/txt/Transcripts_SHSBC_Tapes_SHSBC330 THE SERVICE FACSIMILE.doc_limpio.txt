the service facsimile lecture given on 29 august 1963 thank you well lets pick it up where we left it what is the date audience august 29th august 29 ad 13 okay today i want to talk to you about service facsimiles and this has great deal to do with overrestimulation the tone arm the itsa line all of this is very neat package and if you absorbed all of its various angles and all of its ramifications boy will you be able to audit wow now weve covered everything actually weve covered the itsa line and weve covered charge and restimulation and weve covered all these various factors and the last challenging statement i left you with was something on this orderwas if you couldnt make free needle clear in twentyfivehour intensive using prepchecks then you must be dealing with rightnesswrongness computation must be dealing with that computation see one of the data on this is the fact that if prepcheck turns on mass youve got it your pc is sitting right on service fac on that prepcheck subject now when we say service fac we are dealing with old advanced procedures and axioms and actually we are adding to the definition an understanding of something we have had for long time so there isnt any good sitting back and yawning and say well i know all about service facsimiles because ill let you in on something i knew they existed but i myself did not know all about them there was more to be known about service facsimile its what the individual uses according to the early definitions to explain his condition thats according to the early definition what he uses to explain his condition or get his way in the world and so forth there was ramifications to uses that was why it was called service facsimile because it was of service to him now lets extend this little bit and understand exactly what this thing is because with that definition which you have just been given it did not promptly surrender you notice nothing in that definition gives you an open sesame tohow to attack this thing how can you do anything with it yes we know this is true but that is the end of it so this guy has service facsimile of bent head you see all right what does he do with it what does he do with this well he makeshe explains how he is not getting along in life and explains all of his failures with it and so forth and we know this about this bent head but you notice that doesnt resolve any bent head now new factor swings in on top of this and we also had the ow mechanism and that might have ticked some corner of the service facsimile but they dont seem to be too closely associated but in actual fact the service facsimile manifestation is blood brother to ow blood brother because its how you make people guilty now better understandinga better understanding of thismany pieces of which weve already had and im sure thought about opens the door wide open to cracking case so it took just this little bit more understanding and that is just this definition of service facsimile it is that condition which the individual uses to make himself right and others wrong and the second we have defined service facsimile as any condition or state which an individual uses to make himself right and others wrong the second that we have done that we open the door to resolution of eases its terribly terribly true the only thing which blocks the door from opening all the way is the fact that the line has been boobytrapped in gpms with rightness and wrongness gpms theres to be right theres the rightwrong dichotomies in gpms theresthese things are to be found on the track and by using rightness and wrongness we are liable to get the individual into them particularly if we do not use time factor but the use of time factor obviates much of that an individual has not had gpm in this lifetime so we say in this lifetime how have you been right or how has doing something or other made you right anybody got fly swatter we say in this lifetime how has eating canned heat made you right and how has it made others wrong in this lifetime dont you see and youve kept the guy from going scintillatingly backtrack now in actual fact youre dealing with sufficient power here in sufficient magnitude that you can whip somebody on the backtrack and restimulate more than you can pick up in long day of sundays if you run it with complete wild abandon just like you let an itsa line wander around on the backtrack youre filling up the restimulation chambertheso fast that there arent enough petcocks on it and the seams go creeeak and the pc looks like hes going to explode in other words you can kick up charge with this all you have to do is get the pc into the gpm of rightness and wrongness and then not run the gpm and zzzuh actually the gpm has only partially aberrated this thing in other words its not the reason for it the gpm of rightness and wrongness goal to be wrong or the goal to be right or something like that actually are not the reason for this situation were dealing now with an upperscale rationale now the remaining parts of this rationale will be of great interest to you theres survival now once in awhile you run into the goal survive you run into this once in while theres one aboutthe fifth galaxy over here they start their darwinian implant and so forth with to persist and you wonder wheres the rest of the gpm well the trick is there isnt any and it isnthasnt even got an opposite side it simply sits there as one lonely item at the beginning of the implant to persist theresnot very often on the track do you find this idea but its mostly couched in the lines of persist or something like that and frankly at this moment i do not kof single gpm that contains the word surviveat this moment im prepared to be wrong and find one but i dont know of one which is quite interesting as you look at it there on dianeticsyou had expected dianetics to be mostly dramatization and things off the whole track and that sort of thing the funny part of it is it rather miraculously escapes these at all angles and to survive apparently does of course im at any moment prepared to find one but apparently this concept was not motivated by some bank mechanism survive youll find except for to persist or something like that youll find is relatively free highway you can use survive in processing rather easily now it is the top scale of all of this by the way live and i4 alive and other things like that man thatdheh hah hahhahhahhahthe implanters never missed those you know thats the trouble with you people you are alive you know oh we got to do something about that sound like the american medical association you know an operation day keeps the doctor wealthy you might not feel good but we can buy better cadillacs you know that kind of approach i dontdidnt mean to make snide remark we should actually bow our heads andin moment of silent prayer over the poor ama do you realize that the major insurance companies now have all of their money on the fact that the ama will cease to exist as powerful entity within five years why because theyre going to be socialized socialized medicine is the chip on which the big insurance company has put its money in the united states and of course that finishes the ama the ama is only there to keep the doctor wealthy and the moment the doctor is expropriated the way these foreign governments are always taking over your assets you know well the doctor gets expropriated within five years our strategy on this is very sound all we have to do is hold the fort keep ourselves in good shape keep our technical alive keep the gun cocked and within five years theres opposition it will have been taken out by another of our worst enemies i think its marvelous all weve got to do is hang on hang on politely and sweetly and so forth over in the corner of the ring not getting in the road of too many blows and theres two fighters out there in the ring right now cutting each others eyes open and bloodying each others noses and so forth because democracy is going to bring medicine to the people democratic governments have insisted that this is their rightto bring medicine to the people were not quite sure why but theyre going to bring medicine to the people thats democracy and on the other side of the fence the medical doctor has decided that he is not going to be part of the government and he lost that fight in britain here number of years ago and actually you go up and you kick the british medical association and push it and turn it over look at its face pry open its eyelids turn it back over on its face againits dead its dead all right but somebody forgot to bury it and the only overt action its taken against scientology as far as i know is an occasional letter to somebody who asked them about scientology or something like that and he says were bunch of quacks that hang out in brighton i think thats their public line on this and thats very interesting because we dont use quicksilver you say what has that got to do with it thats the meaning of the word quack it is one who cures with quicksilver you used to see them around the county fairs of england all the time with bichloride mercury and they cured things with mercury and very often poisoned people and so on and had bad time in general and from quick came the word quack and that is what quack is it is one who uses quicksilver and you probably could win suit against the ama right this minute by saying proving conclusively that we do not use quicksilver they tried to broaden the definition of this old english term and of course it is still itself and has other genus all right so much for that the point were making here is that we have wide open road all along the line here for clearing and with clearing goes healing the line is opening up to such degree that i would suspect that the hpahca of tomorrow practiced great deal of healing in the past as we realize we have not really wanted anybody to go in for healing ive told you many times it is nonsense to go in for healing and im sure youve heard the world of healing howeverit was not something that we couldnt do something about we were actually being polite and courteous and so forth and didnt try to invade that particular sphere and we didnt get paid for it and they kept saying why are you healing people and we didnt heal people and theyd say you dogs youre healing people and so forth and one court in virginia they proved conclusively that scientology was healing science because it cured things and actually brought people into court to show that they had been cured of something by scientology which proved it was healing science and gave someand i dont even think though they had the nerve to call the auditor in and sentence him i think he remains unsentenced to this day it was just too much nonsense you see in other words they can go clear around the line that proves were healing subject you see wild business look the length and breadth of the land i dont think they could have found anybody whod been healed by anything on medicine but they were proving our cases for us i think its marvelous but anyway that restriction will be over you today could heal in england and as far as australia is concerned australia is very closely associated with the united states with regard to its attitude toward medicine and the australian medical pattern is patterned directly after the ama but there is great deal of pressure on in australia to socialize medicine in australia and i think that the next orders to australia will be put all possible pressure behind socialization of medicine by the government because it apparently totally paralyzes medical activities its the greatest way to have medicine that anybody ever invented socialized medicine is good for you you just get abecause there isnt any healing involved with it doctors are supposed to have certain number of patients and if they get large number of patients then they draw certain fees and they cant draw any more fees than that and thats the end of that and then they dont have to see the patients in order to draw any fee so they dont have to work so who cares youll find however theyre quite eager beaverish and do try to drum up practice out beyond their socialized practice here in medicine and youll find out this istheyre quite active in this particular sphere now these boysthese boys have tough line and with their existing technology wont make it because theres always the plumbing trade the broken leg has to be put back together again the bits and pieces that get strewn over the highway have to be reassembled theres always the carpentry side of healing its sort of an artisan activity somebodys gets fractured skull and that sort of thing and the bits of bone are around and so onwell theres always they used to use barbers to do it and so on and well the barber sign today just shows we bleed people why dont you startle some barber someday when you go in and say all right bleed because the barber pole twisting around is trickle of blood running into basin and thats why that barber pole is striped that way phlebotomy was done by barbers now the medical doctor is straight up against it because the moment he comes out of the plumbing trade he runs square in to the mechanics of the mind he believes that structure monitors function he believes this hes hung with this one if you ever want to argue with doctor and get him going in circles start proving to him that function monitors structure or thought monitors structure if guy doesnt want to walk he isnt going to you can do lot but somehow or other hell always manage to fall down and not walk matter what you do matter what you do medically now you can go into the plumbing trade all you want to and still nothing happens you see these guys are up against this all the time and when they get away from setting the broken bone and patching up the face and putting new piece of skin on mrs gotbucks nose and re forming the ears and physical features of criminal b and when they get off these various points of purely mechanical handling of matter theyre lost nobody on this planet knew anything about it till we came along they had ideas psychology merely had the idea that it didnt do any good to cure anybody not only would nobody ever change but it didnt do any good to try to cure anybody because if you cured them of anything they would get something else and the psychologist has already commented upon that and so has more or less abandoned cure the medical doctor is infuriated by the use of the word cure so is the psychologist so is the psychiatrist they do not want to have anything to do with this word cure in fact there are twentyfive diseases in the state of californiaim sure there are more than twentyfive diseases in the state of californiabut there are twentyfive diseases out there which it is illegal to try to cure if you say that you are trying to cure them or say that anything could cure them you could be promptly arrested and slapped in the clink this is how convinced they are that cure is impossible however twentytwo and half percent of all the cases which come in front of you you shouldnt be proud of twentytwo and half percent of your pcs should cause you vast feeling of pride if they suddenly grow wings and get well because thats the expected percentage if you fed them flourandwater pills if you patted them on the back if you tapped them on the shoulder lightly and said your name is skunk it wouldnt matter they would get well of whatever they have this is this suggestion group theres over twentytwo and half percent or twentytwo and half percent of the people of this planet are apparently in constant hypnotic state so almost anytime you tell them theyre well theyre susceptible to becoming well that doesnt keep them from getting sick tomorrow thats something that you should realize if healing profession does not get more than twentytwo and half percent it is not doing anything and if it gets less than twentytwo and half percent cure it is impeding it your expected figure then is twentytwo and half percent if you do perfectly dreadful job and sock them on the head and depress their morale and kick them around and all of this sort of thing why you will get less than your twentytwo and half percent if you do something for them you will get more than twentytwo and half percent that figure is going to stay there anyhow if youre healer youll get that many people getting well which is quite interesting to you i dont know what our figure is up to i am unutterably cocky about this kind of thing i myself have healed so many things accidentally and otherwise and on purpose and not for pay that it was quite obvious that weird things would happen if scientologist was ever turned loose in the healing professions healing something is relatively easy with scientology but the only thing which cuts your percentage back nowthere are two things is you cant get in communication with the personalready dead or somethingin coma or already dead and you cant get in communication with him at all see you understand that would cut you back and the other one is the service fac thats the other one thatll get in your road now if we allow now in our technology for the fact that as far as present lifetime techniques are concerned it takes relatively short period of time to train an auditor into them and dont worry about making an auditor who can make an otlets just keep him along in that other level he doesnt have to be super super super expert to do prepcheck on this lifetime let assure you you consider that amongst your more banal tossaway tools you see and if you turn somebody loose with an understanding of the service facsimile an understanding of repetitive process an understanding of the itsa line limited him to this lifetime let him rely on the tone arm of the meter there hed be hed be practically sweeping the boards as far as illness is concerned now its all right to say somebody has bad back because they have facsimile got an incident or an engram all right now thats all right but thats too short look at the situation in the first place the facsimile has to have been restimulated for the person to have had bad back just the possession of facsimile that can deliver bad backif that guaranteed that you would have bad backand this is of course the one thing that the healer of the past has never been able to sort out this guyone guy has an experience of some kind or another and gets well another guy has the same experience and he doesnt get well and therefore its all random see now the truth of the matter is that having an experience which is liable to give you bad back is not guarantee that you will have bad back thats guarantee at all another factor has to enter in something has to restimulate that experience something has to bring it into being kick it in and actually to give you real bad back hold it in you have to have continuing restimulation of this thing to have real bad back and that comes under the heading of restimulation so not only do you have to have the incidentsee unrestimulated this incident is going to be nothingyou also have to have restimulation of the incident in order to bring about bad back and that restimulation to keep the back bad for long period of time has to be constantly restimulated constantly for instance part of the incident thats being restimulated is girl with green eyes and the guy marries girl with green eyes hes had it bad back all right you get the mechanism by which psychosomatic illness can occur now add to that mental aberration oh there isnt one of you that doesnt have beautifully polished wonderfully grooved in perfectly administered by the best medicali beg your pardonby the best implanting agencies some goal like to be insane well why arent you all crazy i ran by one the other day im afraid i wasnt even interested in it it didnt go into restimulation wasnt anything there it just didnt appeal to somehow or another wasnt anything i was afraid of and it wasnt anything i was going to attack and it wasnt anything this way and it wasnt anything that way it was likely to remain quiet for long time dont you see well the combination of circumstances and so forth didnt include that particular one into the lineupwell it justit isnt even the accident of restimulation its what the individual feels might become restimulated what he himself opposes what he becomes afraid of when it is restimulated because to all this mechanical activity which viewpoint we have gratuitously inherited from the aesculapians from all of the ancient schools of healing just that its just going to be mechanical fact see theyre so used to dealing with the broken leg that they say you hit leg it breaks when you set it it heals see they love life to be in that mechanical action to that we have actually added the individual now this is something new and strange this is something that is unheard of now the medico says well some people want to get well and some people dont want to get well and sort of dismisses it he hopes if he ever enters into that field at all did you ever stop and think that the experiential pattern of being might itself make up an aberration regardless of the incident now we see were above the level of scientology two three this guy has lived all of his life in the vicinity of very cold winds storms situations cold all of his life cold he eventually gets certain amount of knowingness on the subject of cold he eventually learns how to take care of himself on the subject of cold so one fine night you throw him out into the middle of the fortybelow cold snow storm well one of two things will happen he either has somehow or another maintained his confidence in his ability to handle himself with regard to cold or that confidence has vanished with regard to it and he is afraid of being cold so at the point we throw him out he either freezes to death or lives see even though weve had lifetime of pavlovian slavering excuse conditioningeven though he has had lifetime of this conditioning lifetime of conditioned reflexes of familiarization and so forth we cant count at the final end of this line whether or not he has learned to be afraid of what he is conditioned on or has become confident because of what he is conditioned on these factors have lot to do with the individual how he looks at something you can take the same engram identically the same engram in in b and c you may get something on the order of will be terrified of it and fight it and try to get away from it and want nothing to do with it whatsoever b wont even look at it just skips it and c says oh phooph and thats the end of it now what makes the difference between these three reactions what makes that difference and we curve right on back to the service facsimile how many ways off hand could you use facsimile to be right and make others wrong how many ways now this guy who is terrified of this facsimile obviously lying in back of this thing youre liable to get lots of ways to be right by having this facsimile and make others wrong by having this facsimile this guy b who doesnt have any reaction to it at all and just skips it doesnt have any use for it at all either to make himself right or to make others wrong and this guy c who just goes phooph has got another method of making others wrong by being competent with regard to this type of facsimile see the ramifications of it theres only one of these three then that has vested interest whatsoever in the rightness and wrongness of the situation so that is always present in any bank in any pc any place it is always present that you have the rightnesswrongness possibility every person is slightly liable to thisgreater or lesser degrees in one field or another field everyone is liable to this of the using certain kinds of injuries using certain kinds of actions using certain kinds of disabilities using certain kinds of inabilities to make himself right and make others wrong so this is not selected thing which simply goes home to one two or three people now to the healerto the healer this represents very heavy barrier because guy who is using ulcers to make himself right and make somebody else wrong is not going to get well from the ulcers man you can feed him full of barium meal you can cut off his cigarettes you can prescribe all kinds of things you can put various type of amino acids in his diet you can beef him up with types of refortification of his blood sugar or sovwaa you know and the guy will still go on having ulcers sometimes if youre really good and he isnt watching you get to him see you get to him sometimes even though he does have rightness wrongness possibility so the occasional random cure among the rightness wrongness things tends to set it aside as being the reason why you see he just wasnt looking you know he kept taking the amino acids and kept taking the amino acids and by god one morning he woke and he didnt have ulcers i bet it worried him sick did too very shortly after he has nightsweats why well youve taken away from him youve taken away from him his rightnesswrongness service facsimile its the most constant use so whats he got to do now hes got to get another one now i told you something the other day that wasnt quite accidentally i gave you joke and you might have taken it as something that was something else i said the guy who was picking bugs off of himself i was telling you not to worry about getting them on you that was the joke in actual fact if you were to sit there and pick bugs off yourself youd establish communication line with the guy thats perfectly valid and will furnish you enough cures of such characters as to establish you considerable reputation this birds sitting thereyou sit there and you go all of sudden the guyll look at you and hell stop doing it hes somehow or another communicated it to somebody he may take it as an itsa line he also might take it as mockery he might also take it as an insult he might take it lot of other ways but enough times you will have gotten through to him that you could at least talk to him so its quite valid to mimic in that particular line that has very low level of application in the field of psychotherapy now its interesting its interesting but certain number of those cases will stop picking bugs off themselves and promptly look for snakes in inkwells so you look for snakes in inkwells and theyll stop looking for snakes in inkwells dont you see and start looking for police in wastepaper baskets and this goes ad nauseam now the second you would not have established the first communication line and the person would have done something else you must recognize then that the person has vested rightnesswrongness interest in picking bugs off themselves insanity or craziness or distraction is service facsimile aberrated behavior is service facsimile well now that blocks the line to more hopes of curing things than you could count because you cant ever apparently if you didnt know about service facsimile you could never get hundred percent series on any technique lets take hundred patients and youre going to cure up and up along the line and all of sudden you have there thirty or forty of these characters standing there looking at you jutjawed not cured your first response to this sort of thing would be well that technique did not work the wrong answer might be to find another technique of course its also possible the technique didnt work see theres always your random factors was it because the technique wasnt working or was it because those thirty or forty people had service facsimiles now if the technique is good good enough for gods sakes to work on sixty or seventy of those people look at how far that is above that twentytwo and half look how far that is this is how you evaluate techniques and processes by the way you should have some knowledge of that look my god you cured sixty or seventy out of that hundred what were you entitled to you were entitled to 225 i dont know what you would do with halfcured bloke but there you are your statistics then are well in excess of the required 225 percent so actually recognizing that you wouldshould look elsewhere you should look around elsewhere to find what happened to this thirty or forty what happened to them how come and what you would find if you investigated it very carefully is being the way they were made them right and being the way they were or that type of wereness made another or others wrong that computation sits there surrounding that service facsimile now this is apt to keep lot of research workers running on mad treadmill trying to find something that gets the hundred percent and paying attention whatsoever to the fact there might be something different let give you the difference of research the medico sets up serieshe sets up usually series of two series of one thats right you read their papers when they have conferences youd be amazed the biggest series theyll show it is incontrovertibly proven that nitroglycerin is the very very best thing to fix up bunions on three consecutive cases with bunions chosen at random over period of eight years putting nitroglycerin capsules between the toes and do you know this is good enough to cause parke and davis and lilly and the big drug companies and all these blokes of one kind or another to immediately turn out eighteen billion pills sold at vast figure at vast profit particularly to the ama which apparently owns the major stock in the drug companies and the fda of course which somehow or another always seems to come out tops when they pass drug and it was series of three quite interesting this is very careless research on which modern medicine is built very careless series of one series of two series of three theyll pass whole operation on the basis that three people survived it thats not good enough thats not good enough research statistics because of what well i dont know maybe they wereyou havent outlawed the twentytwo and half percent dont you see whatd you have whatd you have three volunteers well how do you know these three volunteers werent part of the twentytwo and half percent and would have gotten well whether youd done anything with them or not how do you know that so it requires long enough series to get around that factor and when youre demonstrating whether techniques work or not its series that has to be longer thanso you can isolate the twentytwo and half percent because the more people you use the less likely it is that they are members of the twentytwo and half percent dont you see you got to outlaw that accidental fact and weve very definitely outlawed it over period of years weve outlawed it and gone upstairsi dont know how many cases have responded along in this particular line but it wasnt important to us because we had way to test whether or not the case was or wasnt and the way this problem got its back broken might interest you the tone arm the tone arm turned out to be very reliable measure of case progress the tone arms measure of case progress consistent and continual to get effort to get results here there and elsewhere on cases meant that you had to get tone arm action on those cases and it was very carefully watched what was getting tone arm action on these eases and the negative result was the first one that turned up the negative result if you dont get tone arm action on case restimulation is the only thing that occurs from auditing thats horrifying figure you see restimulation destimulation or discharge those are the three things that are possible under auditing and if theres destimulation of course theres tone arm action if theres discharge theres tone arm action so when you get tone arm action you have restimulation thats all youve got left because something is going to occur in auditing why because the auditor is busy the pc is busy theyre trying to do something thats the negative look thats the negative look at this situation tone arm action youre going to get restimulation you audit without tone arm action and youll worsen the pc about three sessions hes had it three sessions without tone arm action and he will become one of the saddest characters you wanted to see for long time the margin is only about three sessions at the end of the third session he feels horrible dont ask how he feels at the end of the eighth because it would be proportionately greater because theres more and more restimulation occurring here it is overrestimulation which brings about the acute amount of discomfort that the pc ordinarily claims about if pc is being upset about auditing in any way if the pcs life is not running smoothly if the pcs ability to handle things is bad off and so forth that all slots in to the one slot of overrestimulation that covers the lot you dont have to worry about whether or not hes got gpms in restimulation or engrams you dont have to worry about whether or not hes got arc breaks in restimulation with the auditor we dont have to worry about anything except that we know overrestimulation has and is occurring which means more has been restimulated by life and auditing than is being discharged in the auditing session all right that was the first thing learned and thats very very important datum its idiotically simple this datum anybody can get ahold of that one thats easy what about the additional data what happens with medium tone arm action which is to say something that would add up to well something that would add up to fifteen to twenty divisions of tone arm action at session ends of down tone arm quantitative see supposing you took every single little twitch of the tone arm that occurred in the session every twitch down of course its got to come back up too but lets just take every twitch down that it makes during the whole session and lets carefully mark those down in fractions of divisionno matter how tiny they are dont you see lets mark every one down at the end of the session lets add all those up good tone arm action or excellent tone arm action would be up around thirty somewhere upstairs like that around thirty acceptable tone arm action will be around fifteen to twenty and below that point more restimulation is occurring than discharge oooh thats lot more tone arm action than you thought wasnt it ugh horrible my god what are you doing to your pc hey i better watch that stop worrying about it youd be surprised how rapidly fifteen to twenty divisions of action stack up even when your pc is only getting little quarter of division blowdowns and if you want to really know just pull that mathematical trick on the pc the figures actually ive given you are just approximate the estimation of how much is good excellent and so forth thats just approximation well know more about this when we measure more pcs but that gives you how much tone arm action there was in the session it isnt really how much per twenty minutesthat gives you small amount but actually if you wanted to know how much there should be in the twenty minutes you should add up all of the momentsmovements down during the twenty minutes and get that final figure and little blowdowns of 2 little 2 blowdowns well 2 2 2 2 2 well look we got division youd be surprised how fast these things add up but there is point where an apparency of tone arm motion exists when in actual fact only restimulation is occurring and thatsyou work on the guy and you work on the guy and its stuck see oh boy its really there its right there 475 you see and you work on him and you work on him and you work on him and you work on him and you work on him and you assess and you assess and you assess and you talk to him and you work on him and you work on him and finally he finds the little lock and you get your tone arm blowdown hah finally i got all of that tone arm blowdown well in actual fact it was 175 divisions and it starts going back upstairs again and it goes back upstairs again and it goes back upstairs again and you work on him and you work on him and you work on him and down toward the end of the session somewhere down toward the end of the session you get this tremendous blowdown from 45 to 375 well thats 175 plus 75 and thats the total shift of the tone arm for session oh oh oh oh oh oh oh how does thathow does that agree see with this other figure i just gave you well it doesnt at all its dangerous amount in other words its just sitting there of course the one im talking about motionless tone arm that just sits at 50 at 50 at 50 at 50 at 50 for three sessions your pc is darn near going to blow his brains out man but you see this was apparentyou did get couple of motions of the tone arm during the session so you say oh well yes there was tone arm tone arm motion in the session there wasnt tone arm motion in the session not enough to worry about see it was just 175 plus 75 and that was the totality of the whole session look you restimulated more than that just making him look at his bank you restimulated more than that thats for sure youresure enough youre going to find at the next session he doesnt sit at 475 but sits at 50 its gone up 25 more heavily charged now were going to have lessless ease of getting those blowdowns when we get this blowdown its 2 heh and we get two 2 blowdowns in two and half hours of auditing hmmmm now next time he comes into session weve got it at 525its sitting next time he comes into session and we audit him that whole session and we dont get any blowdowns at all and tone arm doesnt move at all now if you went on another session after this that needles going to start sticking and if you carried on couple of more sessions after this this thing is going to go through 70 backwards and youre going to have lowtonearm stuck needle ease now if you carried on with this nonsense any further youd have dead thetan tight stuck needle pc at clear read going place all this was very important data very very very important data if that kind of thing can happen to the pc wed certainly better know all there is to know about tone arm action and behavior well one of the things of course that i went into and found outi didnt so much go into this mary sue got the idea that she wouldkept somebody adding up all the little blowdowns all the little blowdowns all the little blowdowns any kind of motion and so forth and i think she wound up with what thirty female voice thirtyseven thats up and down thirtyseven up and down which made an aggregate of something on the order of about eighteen and half down and that tone arm during the whole session never moved more than about 25 divisions but it did it so frequently you see it did it so often and actively and thats what made the difference so it is the total amount of blowdown during the entirety of the session all added together that gives you what you call tone arm action now im going to get little pedometer one of these days if i possibly can every time you move the tone arm down it cranks little speedometer up at the top of the meter now i dont know who the devil will ever make this or when itll ever come out but that is thethats the ne plus ultra see and you mark down on your report that the pc got that many tone arm divisions only in that way would we know with great accuracy what is tone arm motion see and then we could carry it out and finish off the whole thing as thing and we could give it to the decimal and wed say this exact figure when you dont get as much as that watch it see and if you get more than that why fair if you get more than that thats good and this is an adequate discharge to permit us to run whole track and then wed set the auditor up that hes got to clock offhes got to clock off pretty regularly with routine processes hes got to clock off enough ta action to permit him to run the whole track and then of course somebodys going to free the needle and get none by prepchecking and then of course never be able to go whole track because he hasnt got enough tone arm actionyaya im sorry thats aim getting cynical youre making cynical you realize that now thatsyou got to have certain amount of tone arm action in order to say that discharge is taking place and that youre discharging or destimulating more than you are restimulating this gets very important because it goes into this fact now why does the tone arm go up and stick why is it just the pressure of overrestimulation hmmm thats it all right in the presence of tone arm action why whyif you have tone arm actionwhy do you get restimulation well that gets bit stickier because youre overwhelming the pcs power of choice and therefore youre throwing up mass restimulation is throwing up mass on this pc youre trying to get discharge and the pc isnt going to let it discharge and thats what it amounts to now if youre running something that isnt restimulating the backtrack heavily isnt restimulating new stuff heavily isnt stepping all over the inert bank and throwing it into view and your auditing thereforethe type of auditing would be present life or prepcheck or 2h or something like thatis causing an increase in the height of that tone arm without consequent discharge you therefore must be overthrowing the pcs power of choice and to prove this he gets more and more arc breaky as this occurs well somewhere in that thin nevernever land of border between just pure chargetheres more significance to it at all its the pc is simply overrestimulated the tone arm sticks see thats an easy one some place between that and then auditing him and not getting any further tone arm action we move over from the simple fact of overrestimulation over into this new field service facsimile and we move there at that point where when were prepchecking the pcyou wont always notice this but its the thirddimensional pole that stuck out of the twodimensional plane that indicated this whole thing to and permitted it to be wrapped up theres the mathematicians story about the twodimensional worm two dimensional worm of course he lives on twodimensional plane one day walking along on this plane and he bumps into something and he says that shouldnt be and looks kind of upset his reality shattered because how can you bump into something if theres only two dimensions you cant bump into anything if theres only two dimensions because that requires third dimension another worm comes along long time later hes maybe heard from this first worm there might be something over there and he goes along and he runs into this thing clank and he says whats that and he gradually is able to lift his eyes for moment off his twodimensional plane and he sees this pole up above him and he says hey theres pole and he starts up the pole and when he gets up the pole he doesnt know what the hell to do thats where we get our up the pole thats where it came from somebody went up the pole hes up there and he doesnt know howthe devil it is and he doesnt know where he is he sure feels pretty wild and ecstatic sometimes hes discovered something he doesnt know what has nothing to do with his reality and youll see this occasionally now this is mathematiciansan old time mathematicians effort to get somebody to understand the fourth dimension so he puts it into the second dimension you see and then adds the third dimension and then it gets into everybodys reality the actual fact is anything that has not been discovered operates sort of in that fashion you find something that shouldnt be there and the thing that shouldnt be there is that when you are doing prepcheck on somebody who is stuck or sticky tone arm case the prepcheck will turn on mass or when youre doing prepcheck on anybody and it turns on mass you are looking at something that is perfectly idiotic how can prepcheck turn on mass it cant youre asking somebody how doeshas anything been suppressed anything hes been careful of anything hes failed to reveal anything been invalidated anything been suggested mistake been made anything been protested anything hes anxious about anything been decided and you mean to tell his coming up with answers to this situation which are good clearcut answers are going to turn on mass how could it possibly turn on mass its not possible and thats the basic diagnosis of service facsimile your prepcheck buttons would easily get rid of it but some other mechanism moves in back of it and asserts it the pc is being right as long as he has it and is going to make somebody else wrong and the main person who is being made wrong right there in the session unfortunately is you and so there turns on the mass pc is perfectly innocent of this thing lets saylets take husband you see and were prepchecking him and we accidentally start prepchecking him on his marriage and we begin to notice there is something very peculiar starts occurring here with the tone arm wed notice it with the tone arm the tone arm seems to get less action doesnt seem to be much action in this sphere theres little action but theres not much and then all of sudden we notice hes looking sort of crushed or strained or something you say whats happening well something seems to be pulling in on something seems to be frightening well what happens there iswhatwhat am i asking about that makes well every time you mention my wife ah what have we got here look any mass for thetan is an assertion thats wrong man if thetans wearing mass why somethings weird going on right away now anyhow although you have to go to some lengths to do something about it the fact that it turns on during the prepcheck shows you rather quickly the fact that he aint going to let go of that man youre confronted with this odd phenomena you got block of ice and hose of hot water now you know and i know that if you turn hot water hose on block of ice the block of ice is going to melt and that is going to be the end of that block of ice right well youre confronted with this thing when mass turns on in prepcheck you take hot water hose and you take block of ice and the longer you play the hot water hose on the block of ice the more ice youve got cant be thats how you definethere must be interference with peoples livingness on this particular planet because in actual fact if people just lived long enough if they just lived long enough they would the restimulation of life is not really adequate to keeping the whole bank restimulated life isnt that dramatic just ordinary living it isnt that dramatic read all the detective stories you want to about the only people that get kicked around in lifethere are few there are few activities in life which actually manage to furnish themselves enough restimulation which on top of the interference with the thetan on this planet before hes set here and all that type of implantation and all that sort of stuff in addition to that is almost enough to keep it going newspaper reporter hes the leading contender every time theres trouble every time there is upset every time there is anything the newspaper reporter is there and where do we normally find him we find him at case level 7 hes only interested in his own opinions he writes his story before he leaves the office and comes down to you to see if theres anything he can furnishyou can furnish him that will confirm his opinion which he got before he arrived and so forth and you find this young man hes ordinarily all shook up all the time man hes in terrible condition and you look him over some time its very interesting they only talk to you if you treat them like case level 7 you salt your speech down with your opinion of this thing is obviously and then tell them what their opinion is and they just sit there theyreof course theyre in hypnotic trance to their own opinion so anything you say must be their opinion see aw you shouldnt do things like this to people dont cheer boys the poor devils are dying that sort of an attitude it fits in this theres several other professions theres that of doctor whos always being pulled around restimulated and whose suicide rate is higher than any other the various activities of this kind almost furnish enough restimulation if you start the person out with that much restimulation but in actual fact almost any other field the bank just would go to sleep if that was all there was itd just go to sleep give it couple of hundred years particularly or three hundred years itd be damping out and things would be going inert with such rapidity that the guy would get lot better of course this is all potential to be kicked in at any moment so therefore hes in danger to that degree but what do we have what are we looking at here when were looking at this mass increase were looking at an impossibility you mean auditing is going to make the guy worse you mean mild auditing is going to make the guy worse see what weve asked him in essence now is there anything youve decided about your wife well we know that that will deintensify mass dont you see naturally because it pulls out little fixed attention points and having pulled those things out the confusion and randomity surrounding them tends to ease away see ah so we pull out some of these little fixed points and hes got more mass well thats because what youre doing and what he is doing are in two different spheres of agreement he aint about to get rid of his attitude and opinions about his wife and you are trying to get rid of it and the disagreement in the session is enough to turn on that mass his attentionhis intention is to hold onto it for billyos sake and your intention is to get rid of it so you and the pc are in completely divergent agreement with regard to this whole situation hes sitting down there not to resolve his marriage and you start addressing his marriage he isnt going to resolve his marriage hes not sitting there to resolve his marriage hes sitting there to make his wife wrong thats his only purpose he has other purpose and dont think for moment that he does have matter what he says hes just trying to make somebody wrong now it follows that any thetan that has been hit hard and consistently and continuously has had loses continuously and who has tried to get back at and attack continuously any zone or sphere will be unable to put in the itsa line on what is attacking him he cant say what it is and thats actually all there is to this whole mechanism im talking to you about cant put in the itsa line he cant say whether its bad he cant say whether its good he cant recognize it or something like that maybe it was emanating too much he doesnt feel he has the power to look back along that communication line or be at cause over that communication line in any way now thetan to be sane at all and to have any reality at all has got to be atsome degree at cause now when he goes down scale his final method of staying at causethis is present all the way down scale but remember its only when it becomes final method that it becomes horrible is to be right and for the other person to be wrong and this goes on down the line to point where he simply has toto make them wronghe simply has to hold the concept that they are wrong and to be right he simply has to realize that he is right and the final effort of being right and wrong on the thing is just to have the idea or concept that one is right and the concept that the other person is wrong and he is still being cause his target is thousand lightyears away and has been dead for trillennia dont you see he wouldnt even know when it disappeared thats one of the laughable points of it is he wouldnt even know if hed ever succeeded because he cant observe it it isnt there to observe so this particular mechanism hangs out in life as sort of side panel to it all because it can never asis he never knows when they disappear he never knows when they go away you could take some old lady and haunt her house for days and days and weeks and months and so forth and then not haunt her house and shes liable to go on for years being sure the house is being haunted you understand youyou get how this mechanism comes in well its because she never saw anything that was haunting the house and she couldnt have gotten back at it in the first place so there is method of inspection of cessation how do you inspect the end of everything how does it end how do we know it ends do you know there are japanese soldiers left out in the pacific who still think that world war ii is in progress im absolutely sure of it because they were finding them years after world war ii up in caves and so forth on south pacific islands and they just knew what would happen to them if they were ever captured and that sort of thing and the war had been over for ages and there they were up in the woods they were haunted by nonexistent thing in other words why were they well because they didnt have the communication line to ascertain cessation they couldnt ascertain that it had ended so if they couldnt find out if it had ended the right survival action is to assume that it is continuing so one answers the problem of survival best in that particular category theres many guy who has been missing the top of his head many guy top of his head went missing because he assumed that the enemy over in the next gully had pulled out so he looks and there went the top of his head you see now life can teach you this lessonrather consistently and continually so eventually you develop little more cautious frame of mind with regard to these things you eventually come up with this solution to those problems that if you cannot ascertain if anything is ended you then assume it is continuing and out of this you get this wrongness rightness thing going on for trillennia in the first place the guy went back intothrough force and overts and other thingshe went back into only being able to be right about this thing he couldnt do anything about it you know if you want to really start cacophony ask somebody in one of these modern socialistic countries how they have been right about the government youre liable to get automaticities but you say these people dont ever think about the government i know they dont ever think about the government they dont do anything to the government they dont have anything to do with the government theyre supposed to vote once in while but less and less votes are being cast per capita thats the final thing they could be about the government is right thats the final thing they could be about the government look at the fantastic things they would have to do in order to have the government be wrong look look at them man theyre legion and theyd all be aberrated why since the government today represents fantastic force fantastic quantities of force are represented in the powers of government so much so that the leading heads of government today tell you that population can revolt ustop gun in the us not very long ago was holding forth at great rate on the subject i think it was lodge henry cabot lodge and he was holding forth at great rate on how modern population could revolt in the face of the weapons which were available today in the hands of the government what is he talking about hes talking about raw force isnt he the more that force goes upstairs and the moreand less and less able that populace is to ever reach back in any way at the government or to be cause over that government you see the less so forth why the more they have to go into aberrated rightness and wrongnesses with regard to the government until they finally get down to some of the wildest things you ever heard of and youll find people walking down the street and they spit on the street and thats their one channel of action against the government because its against the law how could they be right about the government they could spit its irrational see itlistened to in that line it becomes totally incomprehensible to the auditor how this could any way shape or form add up to logical answer of rightness and wrongness and that is why it is aberrated and that is why it turns on mass and that is why prepcheck wont do anything with it because its totally irrational now how do you establish this well actually you could establish it with the preliminary step of r3r you could establish what theyre being right about what theyre being wrong about you could take your original listing steps of r2r212 dont do r212 on pcs by the way its dangerous but you could take the original listing steps of r2 you can think of innumerable ways to establish this sort of thing you can say what have you been trying to solve in processing this is another totally illogical approach what have you been trying to resolve in your ease in processing mr smith very good oh youve been trying to resolve the fact that you have ringing in your ears thank you very much mr smith now lets see how many hours of processing have you had ringing in the ears well lets see i had twentyfive hour intensive in washington i had fifty hours in london then there was private field auditor who gave hundred and seventyfive hours and that didnt do any good either heh heh that didnt do any good and then we had numerous other processing and there was lot of group processing and that sort of thing and i tried some subub too and that didnt do any good either and so forth and ive been under doctors care for some time now with this ear ringing and so forth and just nothing does it any good he has given you the whole song bell book and candle so help hes told you that the ringing in his ears is or is associated with service facsimile what is the rationale it is service facsimile because it didnt surrender to processing didnt surrender to mild processing so it must be service facsimile i mean theyou will be lead astray in two directions assuming that everything is service facsimile and trying to run everything on rightness and wrongness and the other way is just assume that nothing is because it is all so reasonable well hes got it all explained actually the first auditor he had over in washington was mean to him and the next half dozen auditors he had they didnt understand him that was obvious and we didnt have the technology at that particular time you see you can be logical about this whole thing you can go on and on and on you can realize all of this you can figure it all out but all i ask you to do is just look head on at that one fact has the guy been processed on it unsuccessfully or is it something he wanted to resolve in processing and never seemed to be able to resolve and that is your total diagnosis of service facsimile from an auditing point of view now you can diagnose it in numerous other ways you can use the medicos for diagnosis you say what have the medicos treated you for bud uhh kidneyskidney trouble nehoho didnt make any better they operated and then they put in two new kidneys and then we have couple inflatable life tubes now back there and so forth you can use this dont you see now you have to vary the wording of it so that it makes sense likewhat is it his health sometimes it takes broader word than kidneys you see being sick being unable and so forth one of the ways of doing this wouldwhat would be method of making others wrong and he will sometimes give you on list of what would be method of making others wrong he will sometimes give you the exact thing that he is making others wrong about and you turn the process around and find out how he is being right with it which is the missing side of it dont you see now im not pretending thatto give you at this particular moment complete diagnostic system by which you could always determine the service facsimile this includes other things such as the hidden standard and other things of that character im not trying to give you such system at this moment im simply pointing out to you the basic mechanics which underlie this thing the ow sequence falls hand in glove with this because of course as i will tell you in another lecture makeguilty is something weve known about for very long time and which plays its role in this but your right wrong characteristics and factors involved on it are very useful and very usable these are survival mechanisms whether they realize it or not and if you can just look at them as survival mechanisms and not expect them to be sensible survival mechanisms why you can crack almost any case if you go around insisting that every survival mechanism be sensible or workable then youre not going to crack lot of eases and youre going to find that theres some weird ones sitting around and they sit around on these buttons of rightness and wrongness fortunately there are only these buttons that would really aberrate human being then there would be survival domination rightness and wrongness and if those buttons were not contaminated in any way why life would be dream for an auditor but he of course has got to runsome broken field running in here against the backtrack implants that contain the words right and 44 wrong and hes got some other things to worry abouthe could use time to get around these things hes got other mechanisms to use to get around these things but its still liability processing very directly on the thing so at the moment i would reserve rightness and wrongness for the extreme ease that doesnt immediately surrender and go down toward fast tone arm action and good tone arm action on prepcheck and destimulate rapidly then i would get very interested in what part of their case or maintaining themselves in an aberrated condition is service facsimile and resolve that and get back to standard processing were not trying to ride hobby horse here whereby all processing becomes the service facsimile you see that oftentoo often happens what we are doing is simply giving you weapon whereby if case gets difficult on you and youre doing all of the usual things for the case and so forth and yet the tone arm does not come down and level out then you had better go into an examination of this case from the viewpoint of service facsimile and you will find out and the case will agree that there are several reasons why he must not get well and when you crack through that of course your technology goes through it like hot butter and you get the remaining thirty or forty percent that you were looking for okay thank you very much
