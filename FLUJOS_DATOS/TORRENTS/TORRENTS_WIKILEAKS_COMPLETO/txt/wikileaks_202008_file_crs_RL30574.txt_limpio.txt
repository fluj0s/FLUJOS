defense outsourcing omb circular a76 policy and options for congress proceedings of crs seminar summary on april 13 2000 the congressional research service sponsored policy seminar for members of congress and staff entitled defense outsourcing omb circular a76 and options for congress this report summarizes that seminar the office of management and budget omb circular a76 has long been viewed by some as management reform tool to facilitate government outsourcing the policy of transferring to the private sector functions performed by government employees dates back to the eisenhower administration in 1966 the effort was codified through omb circular a76 executive branch agencies like the department of defense dod have relied on the circulars guidelines and procedures for determining whether commercial activities should be performed by the private sector or by government sources since the end of the cold war dod has substantially reduced its force structure however defense operations and support costs have not diminished proportionately to the size of the force as result dod has sought to reduce spending to achieve greater savings to finance weapons and military equipment modernization without additional base realignment and closures brac dod seeks savings through greater reliance on managed competitions through application of omb circular a76 this seminar focused on dods efforts to encourage greater use of the circular as mechanism for increased competition in the marketplace the seminar panel comprised senior dod official the president and chief executive officer of defense trade association and defense policy analyst from the largest national labor organization serving federal employees in preparation for the seminar each panelist was asked to address three questions regarding circular policy 1 does the use of omb circular a76 in contracting dod activities save money are there performance metrics in place to determine what the savings really are 2 is omb circular a76 the only viable option to reduce costs 3 how will outsourcing affect us national security and the us militarys war fighting capability in their presentations and discussions every member of the panel agreed that the clinton administration has sought to revise omb circular a76 as way to reduce government costs and increase the governments efficiency panelists praised certain aspects of omb circular a76 because of its organization and level of detail however there was spirited debate between panelists and seminar attendees on the inherent problems with the circular how to fix them and other options to reduce costs the panel viewed omb circular a76 policy and process as flawed and described the process as onerous and adversarial panelists spoke forcefully about the urgent need to change the way that the government conducts its business in many respects the seminar presentations and ensuing discussions extended beyond omb circular a76 they encompassed the future direction of competitive outsourcing within dod contents introduction 1 basic themes 2 does use of omb circular a76 in dod contracting activities save money are there

management omb circular a76 has been viewed by some as management reform tool to facilitate government outsourcing and privatization the policy of transferring to the private sector functions performed by government employees dates back to the eisenhower administration the policy was developed over time in order provide solid framework for omb circular a76 omb circular a76 was codified in 1966 revised in 1983 and 1999 executive branch agencies like the department of defense dod have relied on the circulars guidance and procedures for determining whether commercial activities should be performed by the private business sector or by government sources since the end of the cold war dod has substantially reduced its force structure however defense operations and support costs have not diminished proportionately to the size of the force as result dod must further reduce spending to achieve greater savings to finance weapons and military equipment modernization without additional base realignment and closures brac dod sought savings through greater reliance on managed competitions through omb circular a76 omb circular a76 provides an analytical framework on which the government bases its decision on who is best to perform the work the circular outlines very formal intricate and often lengthy process for conducting managed competitions to facilitate the outsourcing of federal government activities considered commercial or not inherently governmental dod has encouraged greater use of omb circular 76 as mechanism for increased competition for federal contracts and has placed considerable emphasis on competitive sourcing programs 1 us executive office of the president office of management and budget performance of commercial activities circular a76 washington

questions addressed at the seminar 1 does use of omb circular a76 in contracting dod activities save money are there performance metrics in place to determine what the savings really are 2 is omb circular a76 the only viable option to reduce costs 3 how will outsourcing affect us national security and the us militarys warfighting capability basic themes every member of the panel agreed that the clinton administration has sought to revise omb circular a76 as way to reduce government costs and increase efficiency in their presentations and discussions panelists praised certain aspects of omb circular a76 because of its organization and level of detail an omb policy memorandum accompanied by supplemental handbook outlines the process for the government as well as the private sector this level of detail helps all parties to understand and follow the rules crs3 one on the panel recommended completely abandoning use of the circular there was spirited debate however between panelists and seminar participants on the inherent problems with the circular how to fix them and other options to reduce costs the panel viewed omb circular a76 policy and process as flawed and described the process as onerous and adversarial the panelists three retired military officers spoke forcefully about the urgent need to change the way that the government conducts its business in many respects the seminar presentations and ensuing discussions extended beyond omb circular a76 they encompassed the future direction of competitive outsourcing within dod does use of omb circular a76 in dod contracting activities save money are there performance metrics in place to determine what the savings really are panelists expressed strong disagreement over whether the use of omb circular a76 in dod contracting activities saves money every panelist expressed the opinion that dod did not know and could not prove whether the policy saved money some panelists cited published government audits of recent outsourcing competitions citing costs savings achieved through use of omb circular a76 although one panelist simply stated and i would agree that its really hard to figure out what those savings are another panelist reported that since 1988 dod has failed to release any information on the impact of downsizing on displaced federal workers he firmly believed that any savings realized were achieved by undercutting the wages and benefits of federal employees citing recent general accounting office study to support his premise the panelist stated that dod did not consider the longterm costs of downsizing the workforce to include the administrative costs of personnel separations including payment of lump sum leave balances and retirement benefits when calculating the savings gained from managed competitions further the panelist stated that in his opinion most federal government work performed by contractors is never subjected to the omb circular a76 process and that most federal government contracts are awarded without benefit of publicprivate competitions all panelists agreed that appropriate performance metrics or standards of measurement were in place to measure savings they agreed that dod did not have tracking mechanism in place to determine how much money is saved over the total life cycle of defense procurement contract all expressed the view that the government was generally illequipped to perform accurate costaccounting procedures and did not fully know the actual defense procurement contract costs one panelist opined that such contract costs could increase for variety of reasons he stated that the costs rise in some cases because dod has not accurately defined what work needs to be performed or that dod later revises the contracts stated mission or purpose another panelist offered that the omb circular a76 process is cost comparison study and the policy only compares contract costs not what would necessarily represent the longterm best value to the federal government still another panelist believed that the federal activities inventory reform fair crs4 act2 does require federal agencies to conduct an inventory of work performed by federal employees but did not require that contractors conduct similar inventory of work even though in his opinion approximately twothirds of the functions of the federal government are estimated to be contracted out omb circular a76 requires that cost comparison studies proposals made by the government or the private sector for federal contracts include 12 acrossthe board overhead rate3 panelists disagreed over the use of 12 rate some panelists believed that the rate was too low and that the low overhead rate gives the government an automatic advantage in formulating lower bids the administrative and overhead rate varies by industry for example the information technology industry uses 40 overhead rate as standard rate one panelist expressed the opinion that flat 12 rate on overhead is little bit suspect we ought to have little bit more refinement and be able to bear down and find out what those actual costs are have good solid competition and then good accounting both for the government if they win competition or for the private sector if they win competition that the figure of 12 administrativeoverhead costs was an arbitrary number another panelist in response explained that the 12 rate was compromise rate that it was the result of longfought negotiation between the government and the private sector he offered this assessment the problem is when you try to figure out what the right number is immediately you reengage with everybody because its being skewed to the benefit of whoever it is that thinks theyre being disadvantaged and so what would happen is were going around in circles we do need to figure out how to do that there should be an honest broker that could sit there and figure out what the exact right amount was panelists were in agreement that the omb circular a76 process costs too much and takes too long to complete one recent costcomparison study conducted by the us army revealed that most single function competitions take about two years to complete while multifunction competitions take about four years to complete this length of time was viewed as unacceptable and not in line with current private sector business practices one panelist asserted that the decision cycle time length of time it takes to make business decision needed to be reduced and that the decision making process needed acceleration he made the comparison between the decision process in the private sector to that within dod 2 the federal activities inventory reform act of 1998 fair public law 105270 requires each federal agency to submit annually by june 30 to the office of management and budget an inventory of all commercial activities performed by inhouse federal employees for further discussion of the fair act see crs report rs20440 fair act inventory of commercial activities performed inhouse federal personnel agencies by barbara l schwemle 3 for discussion of overhead rates see part ii preparing the inhouse and contract cost estimates omb circular a76 revised supplemental handbook crs5 ive been talking to people out in silicon valley and they talk about moving at internet speed and they made the comparison about decision processes in dod in particular and they said by the time dod makes decision we have come up with an idea developed the idea formed company gone public sold the company and are working on the next idea and dod still has not made decision i think we have to find ways to try to accelerate the process bit if at all possible is omb circular a76 the only viable option to reduce costs within omb circular a76 regulations dod may authorize cost comparison waivers waiving the need to conduct competition and direct conversions to or from the inhouse government entity to private sector contract4 panelists were in agreement that the standard omb circular a76 process was not the only option available to dod they proposed options considered viable within as well as outside the boundaries of current policy within current policy government functions that involve 10 or fewer fulltime equivalents fte5 may be converted without cost comparison study if the contracting officer determines that potential contract proposals would provide required levels of service quality at fair and reasonable prices functions that involve 11 or more ftes may be converted without cost comparison study if fair and reasonable prices can be obtained through competitive award and all directly affected federal employees serving on permanent appointments are reassigned to other comparable federal positions for which they are qualified second option offered by panelist would be to raise the threshold of the number of positions required for competition currently set at 11 by nearly tenfold so that about 80 of the anticipated outsourcing studies would be exempt from circular requirements he suggested that by raising the threshold dod would conduct larger cost comparison studies and could benefit from economies of scale not achieved with the smaller studies he offered this assessment you might compete whole bases or regions the defense science board i believe in 1996 recommended that each service identify two bases and enter into pilot program and see how it works but we need catalyst to get this going and pilot program may very well be that third option would be to award contracts based on the best value to the government not just based on initial purchase price and establish performance 4 us executive office of the president office of management and budget performance of commercial activities part i section agency cost comparison waivers circular a76 washington aug 4 1983 rev june 14 1999 5 the term fte represents statistical computation including all time worked and is used for budgetary and staffing projections the computation bears minimal relation to the number of actual personnel because it includes hours worked on fulltime parttime and intermittent schedules it also includes hours worked by all personnel regardless of their length of service for further discussion please refer to crs issue brief 10024 federal civilian employees and the fy2000 budget by sharon gressle crs6 incentives andor penalties to the contract winner the panelist suggested that again dod could authorize the use of pilot or demonstration projects on smaller level to provide testing ground for the best value concept outside of omb circular a76 some panelists raised newer initiative first introduced by the us navy called strategic sourcing strategic sourcing is considered to be more broadbased alternative to omb circular a76 the navy sought to review all of its functions not just those commercial in nature to develop plan to streamline the entire organization the navy reportedly the first federal group to begin development on strategic sourcing guide and strategic sourcing managerial support center has stated that it could reorganize its workforce and workflow so that the projected 64000 commercial jobs targeted for managed competitions could be eliminated inhouse avoiding managed competition and still produce the projected savings one panelist supported the idea and offered the following comment instead of sitting there and trying to argue about which positions were commercial and then trying to figure out how to package them into competitions we should be looking at what we do what the functions are not just limiting it to basically the third of the civilian workforce that was stamped as commercial but looking at our whole workforce military and civilian what functions they do and whats the best way to provide that function however among other panelists strategic sourcing was viewed as less welldefined than omb circular a76 needing more finetuning and clarification how will outsourcing affect us national security and the us militarys warfighting capability panelists were asked to consider this question based on their practical and operational knowledge as well as their past careers as activeduty military officers some with military conflict experience one panelist expressed the opinion that outsourcing adversely affected us national security because it disrupted and demoralized the federal civilian workforce given his observation that 72 of the defense workforce right now is at least 41 years old he challenged federal managers to reshape and rejuvenate the federal civilian workforce by ensuring that federal employees are motivated stable competent and competitively paid stating that the national defense was indeed threatened by throwing public employees out on the street he argued that the real question is how do we recruit train and retain the federal workforce needed for the nations security in the 21st century in his opinion the current debate over outsourcing is distraction away from more important debate over weapon system acquisition he felt that policymakers should focus on how do we prepare and equip the armed forces in very new different and challenging postcold war mission another panelist offered that during his military combat experience contractors were an integral part of combat support activities on the battlefield he urged that dod spend the time now to revise competitive outsourcing strategies rather than wait until the united states is engaged in major conflict in his opinion the use of crs7 private sector contractors had positive effect on national security and enhanced the militarys warfighting capability one panelist viewed the introduction of hr 3766 the truth responsibility and accountability in contracting act trac as constructive way of addressing perceived inequities in the governments outsourcing and privatization policy the bill was introduced on february 29 2000 by representative albert wynn and referred to the house government reform committee trac would impose temporary suspension on new contracting activities until some corrective action is taken and require federal agencies to monitor contract costs and savings from outsourcing initiatives the bill would prevent agencies from outsourcing without benefit of publicprivate competitions and allow agencies to hire additional federal employees in some circumstances it would require federal agencies to develop centralized contracting reporting system and study
