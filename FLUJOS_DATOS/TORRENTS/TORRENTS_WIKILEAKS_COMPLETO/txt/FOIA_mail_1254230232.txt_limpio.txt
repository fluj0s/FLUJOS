from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk michael mann mannmeteopsuedugavin schmidt gschmidtgissnasagov subject re attacks against keith date tue sep 29 091712 2009 mike gavin as tim has said keith is making good recovery and hopes to be back in soon gradually during october and hopefully full time from november i talked to him by phone yesterday and sent him and tom melvin the threads on ca as youre fully aware trying to figure out what mcintyre has done is going to be difficult it would be so much easier if they followed normal procedure and wrote up comment and submitted it to journal i looked through the threads yesterday trying to make sense of what hes done my suspicion is that hes brought in other tree ring series from more distant sites some of which may not even be larch there are two chronologies that have been used one called the polar urals and one called yamal pu is schweingruber site with density as well as ring width the pu reconstruction is therefore not chronology but regression based reconstruction from both mxd and trw yamal is just ring width series with lots of subfossil material so much older from an area some distance at least 500km north of pu it was developed by hantemirov and shiyatov and was poorly standardized corridor method i also dont think mcintyre understands the rcs method even though he claims to have program the ends and the age structure of the samples are crucial in all this but i think he just throws series in i totally agree that these attacks for want of better word are getting worse comments on the thread are snide in the extreme with many saying they see need to submit the results to journal they have proved keith has manipulated the data so job done hadnt thought of senate debates id put this down to the build up to copenhagen which is sort of the same 1httpwattsupwiththatcom20090924alookatthethompsonetalpaperhitechwiggle matchingandremovalofnaturalvariables is complete reworking of dave thompsons paper which is in press in j climate online looked at this but they have made some wrong assumptions but someone has put lot of work into it 2httpwattsupwiththatcom20090924ooopsdutchmeteorologicalinstitutecaughtinwea therstationsitingfailuremovedstationandtoldnobody this one is complete red herring nothing wrong with bilt measurements this is what it is about according to someone at knmi the issue you refer to is causing lot of noise in the netherlands even mps asking questions to the minister it seems this is not at all about the observational series nothing strange is going on but more related to the law on knmi and the division of tasks between commercial providers and knmi to be discussed by parliament soon cheers phil at 0846 29092009 tim osborn wrote hi mike and gavin thanks for your emails re mcintyre yamal and keith ill pass on your best wishes for his recovery when i next speak to keith hes been off almost 4 months now and wont be back for at least another month barring couple of lectures that hes keen to do in october as part of gradual return hopefully hell be properly back in november regarding yamal im afraid i know very little about the whole thing other than that i am 100 confident that the tree ring data was handpicked to get the desired result is complete crap having ones integrity questioned like this must make your blood boil as im sure you know with both of you having been the target of numerous such attacks though it would be nice to shield keith from this during his recovery i think keith will already have heard about this because he had recently been asked to look at ca in relation to the kaufman threads keith was coauthor on that and darrell had asked keith to help with response to the criticisms apart from keith i think tom melvin here is the only person who could shed light on the mcintyre criticisms of yamal but he can be rather loose cannon and shouldnt be directly contacted about this also he wasnt involved in the yamal chronology being discussed though he has been involved in regional reconstruction that weve recently been working towards that uses these and more data perhaps phil and i should talk with tom and also see if keith is already considering response off to lecture for couple of hours now cheers tim dr timothy j osborn academic fellow
