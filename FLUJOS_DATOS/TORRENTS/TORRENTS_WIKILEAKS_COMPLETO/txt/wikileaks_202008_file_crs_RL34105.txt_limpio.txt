solomonfears and gene falk specialists in social legislation domestic social policy division the financial impact of child support on tanf families simulation for selected states summary the child support enforcement cse program was enacted in 1975 as federalstatelocal partnership to help strengthen families by securing financial support from noncustodial parents families receiving cash welfare from the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant must assign turn over rights to child support received from noncustodial parents to the state to reimburse it and the federal government for their welfare costs states decide whether to pay any of the child support collected for tanf families to the family the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 provides incentives for states to allow more of the child support collected on behalf of tanf families to go to the family without reduction in welfare benefits under dra beginning in october 2008 the federal government will share in the cost of passing through up to 100 per month for family with one child and up to 200 per month for family of two or more children of collected child support to tanf families this report illustrates the potential impact of the dra policy on families and governments in six states ca il md ok and wv chosen because of their diversity in both tanf and predra child support passthrough policies it shows the direct effects of what if the states fully adopted the dra policy the dra policies can increase the incomes of tanf cash welfare family consisting of mother and two children by up to 200 per month this can be substantial supplement to tanf cash benefits actual income increases depend on how much child support is paid by the noncustodial parent predra state policies the amount of other income including earnings of the family and tanf benefit rules the dra has its greatest impact on families with income other than child support it mainly affects families who receive tanf it does not directly affect families with incomes too high to receive tanf in some states family of three with minimum wage earner the new fully phasedin federal minimum wage of 725 per hour pl 11028 at 20 hours per week is ineligible for tanf in most states family with fulltime minimum wage earner is ineligible for tanf the increased passthrough and disregard of child support for tanf families also has its costs disregarding additional child support when determining tanf financial eligibility can make additional families eligible for tanf the cost of increasing family income through dras enhanced passthrough and disregard is often borne by reductions in child support collections kept by the state and federal governments however sometimes the cost could be borne through increased tanf spending the dra rules reduce the cost of the passthrough and disregard more for poorer states than for higherincome states this report provides limited discussion of dras effect on former tanf families the report addresses only the direct effects of adopting the dra child support passthrough and disregard adoption of dra child support policies might have other indirect

introduction on average child support constitutes 17 of family income for households who receive it among poor households that receive it child support constitutes about 30 of family income1 during the last several years the importance of child support payments as an income source for singleparent families has garnered national attention the 7th annual report on the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program indicates that 23 of adult tanf recipients have jobs2 although this is good news relative to earlier years welfare studies have found that many of these recipients and exrecipients end up with lowwage jobs thus child support is critical factor in helping lowincome families become self supporting in 2003 the average yearly child support payment received by custodial parents with payments was 4647 for mothers about 20 more than the average amount received by fathers 3906 these full or partial payments represented 17 of the custodial mothers total yearly income and 8 of the custodial fathers in 2003 child support represented 19 of the income of the 33 million custodial parents who received all of the child support that they were owed3 however most child support received on behalf of families receiving tanf cash welfare is kept by the federal government and the states rather than paid to families this is because tanf families must assign turn over legal rights to child support paid by noncustodial parents on their behalf to the state to reimburse governments for welfare costs 1 urban institute child support offers some

on behalf of tanf families to go to the family and most if not all of the child support collected on behalf of former tanf families to go to the family this is referred to as child support passthrough see page 7 adoption of this family first policy is intended to help former tanf families stay selfsufficient and to encourage cooperation with child support enforcement efforts by custodial and noncustodial parents by allowing the family to keep more or all of the child support paid on its behalf under dra effective october 1 2008 if state passes through child support payment and disregards it as countable income the federal government will waive its share of the child support collections up to 100 per month for one child or up to 200 per month for two or more children see page 12 this is referred to as disregard this report illustrates what if scenarios if six states california illinois maine maryland oklahoma and west virginia were to adopt the dra child support passthrough and disregard policies for tanf families the states were selected because of their diversity of both current child support passthrough and disregard policies and tanf benefit amounts it is not known whether any of these states are currently contemplating adopting the dra rules the analysis shows the financial impact4 on mother with two children in specified earnings categories under current child support distribution rules and under the dra rules it also provides an analysis of the change in the distribution of child support among the state federal government and the family under current rules

states appendix b discusses and presents detailed tables showing the impact of predra and dra policy on the distribution of child support collections among families the state and the federal government in each of the six states appendix c provides background information on the dra provisions that affect former tanf families 4 this report only examines earnings child support income and tanf cash benefits it does not discuss how higher amounts of child support distributed to family might result in benefit reductions in other programs such as food stamps for an analysis of the effect of more generous child support passthrough and disregard policy on various programs and income streams see the urban institute benefits and costs of increased child support distribution to current and former welfare recipients final report by laura wheaton and elaine sorensen with victoria russell and jeff versteeg october 16 2005 available at httpaspehhsgovhsp05csdisttanfindexhtm crs3 key findings this report examines the financial impact of adoption of the deficit reduction act dra provisions related to the child support passthrough and disregard policy on tanf families state governments particularly california illinois maine maryland oklahoma and west virginia and the federal government the major findings are described below the dra provides an incentive for states to have passthrough and disregard policy by requiring the federal government to share in the cost by foregoing the federal share of the child support collected from the noncustodial parent on behalf of tanf family the dra requires the federal government to share in the cost of passing through and disregarding up to 200 per month for tanf family with two or more children if state that currently has pass through and disregard policy continues with its existing disregard amounts the state would financially benefit from the dra provisions for the state would longer have to fund the policy at its own expense if state opts for the full 200 passthrough and disregard in most cases there would be cost to the state the cost would depend on whether the state had predra passthrough and disregard policy the amount of the disregard whether the family becomes eligible for tanf because of the passthrough and disregard the custodial parents earnings and other income tanf benefit rules regarding treatment of income and the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which determines the federal and state share of child support collections the dra provisions would reduce the cost of the passthrough and disregard policy more for poorer states than for higherincome states poorer states must currently send back to the federal government greater share of child support collections than higher income states for example west virginia sends back 7282 of its child support collections to the federal government whereas maryland sends back 5000 of its collections under the dra passthrough and disregard policy the poorer state west virginia would not have to send back the federal governments share 7282 of child support collections instead the federal government would be required to forego its share of child support collections the cost of passthrough and disregard policy generally would be higher for the federal government than for the states however in the case in which family becomes eligible for tanf payments because of the dra child support passthrough and disregard given the assumptions of this report state governments would incur higher costs than the federal government this report considers tanf expenditures to be state expenditures in most cases individual families would benefit from the dra provisions the dra passthrough and disregard provisions could crs4 increase the income of tanf parent with two children by as much as 200 per month family ineligible for tanf because its counted earnings are higher than its states income eligibility threshold would see increase in income from implementing the dra passthrough and disregard provisions under the policies in effect in january 2007 and under the new fully phasedin minimum wage of 725 per hour families in many states are ineligible for tanf even at 20 hours of work per week among the six states closely examined in this report only in california would mother of two working 40 hours per week at 725 per hour be eligible for tanf based on january 2007 rules the interests of the child support enforcement cse program and cse families are not always compatible the interests of family are usually entirely financial it is in the best interest of family to get the highest amount of income available to it thus the higher the child support passthrough and disregard amount the more family would potentially benefit however from cse program perspective the more dollars that the program has to invest in cse activities eg parent location paternity establishment support order establishment collection of child support payments the better the program can serve its entire clientele thus for many states the ability to retain child support collections outweighs the value of passthrough and disregard policy particularly since the pass through and disregard does not benefit persons who never received cash tanf benefits such persons represented 39 of the cse caseload in fy2006 background the cse program title ivd of the social security act was enacted in 1975 as federalstatelocal partnership to help strengthen families by securing financial support from noncustodial parents it also was enacted to lower the government costs of providing cash welfare to families with absent parents by collecting child support from noncustodial parents that could help keep families off welfare or by using those collections to reimburse states and the federal government for the cost of making welfare payments all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds in addition native american tribes can operate cse programs with federal funding5 all families with children who live apart from one of their parents are eligible for cse services families receiving tanf benefits title iva of the social security act title ive foster care payments or medicaid title xix coverage 5 for more information see crs report rs22380 child support enforcement program basics by carmen solomonfears crs5 automatically qualify for cse services free of charge6 other families must apply for cse services and states must charge an application fee that cannot exceed 25 the application fee may be paid by the state the noncustodial parent or the custodial parent7 child support collected through the cse system on behalf of families who never received cash welfare goes to the family usually through the state disbursement unit however most collections on behalf of families currently receiving cash welfare from tanf are used to reimburse state and federal governments for tanf payments made to the family the fact that cash welfare families directly receive only small fraction of child support paid to them has been an ongoing policy concern as the program has increasingly emphasized its role in adding to the income of families with children and deemphasized its welfare costrecovery role reinforcing this shift in emphasis has been the large declines in the cash welfare rolls themselves cash welfare payments fell from 25 billion in fy1995 to about 10 billion in fy2005 meaning that there are far fewer costs to recoup the number of families receiving cash welfare fell during this period from about 5 million to 2 million thus the rules affecting those currently on the rolls reach fewer families and affect fewer dollars than they did in the mid1990s the decline in the cash welfare caseload is also reflected in the changing composition of the cse caseload the component of the caseload that is comprised of tanf families is shrinking in fy2006 only 15 of the cse caseload was comprised of tanf families compared to 21 in fy1999 and 38 in fy1996 even though overall child support collections increased by 51 over the sevenyear period fy1999fy2006 child support collections made on behalf of tanf families decreased by 33 thus the policy shift from using the cse program to recover welfare costs to using it as mechanism to consistently and reliably get child support income to families is not surprising in fy2006 only 4 of cse collections 985 million was made on behalf of tanf families about 14 of that amount went to the families pursuant to state child support pass through provisions and the rest was divided between the state and federal governments to reimburse them for tanf benefits paid to the families in fy2006 91 of cse collections 218 billion went to the families on the cse rolls the comparable figure in fy1999 was 85 135 billion and the comparable figure in fy1996 was 80 96 billion 6 federal law requires that families who receive tanf benefits andor medicaid benefits must assign their rights to child support payments to the state in order to receive the respective program benefits the title ive foster care program requires the assignment of child support rights in appropriate cases 7 pl 109171 effective october 1 2006 requires families that have never been on tanf to pay 25 annual user fee when child support enforcement efforts on their behalf are successful ie at least 500 annually is collected on their behalf according to section 4546bii of the social security act the annual 25 fee may be 1 retained by the state from child support collected on behalf of the custodial parent but not from the first 500 collected in given federal fiscal year or 2 paid by the custodial parent who is applying for cse services or 3 recovered ie collected from the noncustodial parent or 4 paid by the state out of state funds crs6 in fy2006 the largest group of families who were participating in the cse program were families who had left the tanf rolls ie former tanf families 46 families who had never been on tanf represented 39 of the cse caseload and families who were currently receiving tanf benefits comprised 15 of the cse caseload thus although the majority of the cse caseload is composed of non tanf families 85 most of them at some point in their lives received tanfafdc8 61 this is consistent with the expanded mission of the cse program the expectation is that as child support becomes more consistent and stable income sourcesupport these former tanf families will never have to return to the tanf rolls and families that had not resorted to the tanf program will never have to do so rules that apply to families receiving tanf cash welfare tanf cash welfare is available to families that meet test of financial need with the test determined by the states familys income including child support must be below specified income threshold determined by the state to qualify for tanf cash welfare if child support collections exceed the tanf benefit the family may lose tanf eligibility as its countable income would be too high to qualify for tanf and instead it would receive the child support tanf cash welfare family is required to cooperate with the cse system tanf recipients must help in establishing the paternity of the familys children further recipients must turn over rights to any child support paid on behalf of the children while the family is on welfare to the state the state then decides whether to pay any received child support to the family the rules governing division of child support collected on behalf of families comprise 1 assignment 2 distribution 3 passthrough and 4 disregard rules special rules also apply in certain states called gap states based on their historical treatment of child support in determining cash welfare benefits note that some different rules apply for payment of support that is currently due compared with pastdue support arrearages the current child support pass through and disregard rules are only applicable to tanf families and only pertain to current child support payments if tanf family receives child support payments that are considered arrearages those arrearage payments are kept by the state and federal government this report focuses on collections of current support however one purpose of the dra is to increase the economic independence of former tanf families by giving states the option of providing such families with all of the child support collected on their behalf appendix c briefly discusses dra provisions that affect former tanf families assignment as noted above when family applies for tanf cash welfare the custodial parent must assign that is legally turn over the right to the state for child support collected on her or his behalf while the family receives tanf 8 the aid to families with dependent children afdc program was tanfs predecessor program replaced by tanf in 1996 by pl 104193 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 crs7 benefits the state retains support collections up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits which have been paid to the family if child support collections are less than the tanf benefit the collections remain legally with the state and are then subject to the distribution passthrough and disregard rules discussed below distribution as already discussed when the cse program was first enacted in 1975 one of its primary goals was to recover the costs of providing cash welfare to families with children to accomplish this costrecovery goal child support collected on behalf of families receiving cash welfare was used to offset benefit costs and was shared between the federal and state governments the sharing arrangement was based on how the federal government and states shared the cost of paying cash welfare benefits under the pre1996 program of aid to families with dependent children afdc under old afdc law the rate at which states were reimbursed by the federal government for the costs of cash welfare was the medicaid matching rate which is now usually referred to as the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which varies inversely with state per capita income ie poor states have higher federal matching rate wealthy states have lower federal matching rate consequently the share of child support collections to be distributed to the federal government and states also was based on the medicaid matching rate the afdc program required that the first 50 in child support collected had to be distributed to the family passedthrough see below and remaining collections be split between the federal and state governments according the medicaid matching rate if state had 50 matching rate the federal government was reimbursed 50 for each 100 in remaining child support collections if state had 70 federal matching rate the federal government was reimbursed 70 for each 100 in remaining collections in the first example the state kept 50 and in the second example the state kept 30 thus states with larger fmap kept smaller portion of the child support collections the match ranged from minimum of 50 to statutory maximum of 839 although afdc was replaced by the tanf block grant under the welfare reform law of 1996 the same matching rate procedure for cse collections is still used however the mandatory 50 passthrough was eliminated except for families in states that allow child support to fill the gap between the cash welfare benefit and need discussed below the full amount of current child support collected on behalf of cash welfare families is divided between the federal and state governments based on the medicaid matching rate the federal government thus is still reimbursed for its share of tanf welfare costs even though tanf is block grant program rather than an openended entitlement program passthrough though states are required to pay to the federal government the federal share of child support collections they have full discretion over the state share of collections made on behalf of welfare families they decide whether to keep the collections or passthrough child support to families if state does not passthrough any child support collections and the child support collected is 9 for an explanation of the medicaid matching rate see crs report rl32950 medicaid the federal medical assistance percentage fmap by april grady crs8 insufficient to lift the familys income above the states tanf eligibility limit the family receives its full tanf grant ie not reduced by the child support payment passing through child support means that family receives an identifiable amount ie separate check separate from the welfare benefit based upon child support collected from the noncustodial parent whether the welfare benefit is then reduced by the amount of the child support passed through depends on the states disregard policy discussed below disregard states decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family in determining tanf eligibility and benefits if state does pass through some child support but does not disregard it when determining tanf eligibility and benefits the familys tanf grant is reduced by 1 for each 1 in child support collections though the family receives some of the child support collected on its behalf its total income is not increased disregard of child support income means that family can keep certain amount of child support without reduction in its tanf benefits or potentially losing tanf eligibility therefore 50 disregard of child support means that up to 50 of child support collections does not affect familys tanf eligibility or benefits 200 disregard of child support means that up to 200 of child support does not affect familys tanf eligibility or benefits fillthegap states before the cse program was enacted child support was paid directly to the custodial parent when child support was paid to family receiving afdc the child support was counted as income in determining the familys afdc eligibility and the amount of afdc benefits paid to the family in most states it resulted in corresponding dollarfordollar decrease in the afdc benefit paid to the family however some states used afdc benefit calculation methods that did not result in full dollar reduction for each dollar received as income these states paid less money than their full need standard10 and some permitted afdc recipients to use their own income to make up all or some of the difference between the afdc payment and the standard of need this additional income retained by the family increased the total amount of disposable income available to the family in month however after enactment of the cse program in 1975 all child support payments had to be paid to the cse agency in states that had allowed families to keep part of their child support payments to fill the gap between the states need and maximum payment standards without corresponding reduction in afdc benefits families had less disposable income after the enactment of the cse program than before11 10 in these states the afdc need standard which was the amount the state deemed needed for family of certain size to subsist in that state was larger than the states afdc maximum benefit amount which was the maximum amount of money that the state paid family of given size in monthly afdc benefits 11 federal register vol 51 158 department of health and human services office of family assistance aid to families with dependent children and child support continued crs9 concerns were raised that the new law would cause decrease in the total income afdc and child support income of afdc families in states referred to as fillthegap states in essence before the cse program was implemented in some states afdc families were permitted to fill all or part of the gap between the states need standard and maximum benefit with child support paymentsincome by bypassing the family and requiring that child support payments be paid to the state the family longer had access to this extra income and the fillthegap procedure was nullified12 pl 9488 enacted august 9 1975 addressed these concerns by requiring that monthly supplemental payments often referred to as gap payments be made to afdc recipients who would receive less disposable income because of the new rules than they would have received prior to july 1975 when the new child support rules took effect section 402a28 of the social security act13 the gap payment provision only applied to states that had fillthegap policy in july 1975 and also in the month of the benefit calculation in july 1975 13 jurisdictions paid less than their full need standards and allowed custodial parents to use any nonwelfare income to fill all or part of the gap between the states maximum benefitpayment and the states standard of need14 the five states of delaware georgia maine south carolina and tennessee had fillthegap policy in july 1975 and currently still have fillthegap policy15 the gap payment is paid for with cash welfare ie tanf funds according to the provisions of section 457d of the social security act which references section 402a28 of the social security act these states still have the option of not applying federal child support distribution rules section 457 of the social security act to these gap payments 11 continued enforcement program computing supplemental payment in states required to do so by section 402a28 of the social security act august 15 1986 12 in other words before the cse program afdc families could receive both the maximum afdc payment and whatever child support payments they were able to obtain income that exceeded the afdc maximum benefit was subject to the regular 100 benefit reduction rate after enactment of pl 93647 families were able to receive child support bonus ie up to 20 per month in addition to the maximum afdc benefit available to them but they longer had access to the child support income which they previously were able to use to fillthegap between the maximum afdc benefit payment and the states need standard this meant that some families were made worse off by the new cse program 13 although the cse program was enacted by pl 93647 on january 4 1975 most of the provisions of the program did not go into effect until july 1 1975 14 the number and names of these jurisdictions are based on unpublished information from the former us department of health education and welfare 15 the remaining eight jurisdictions that had fillthegap policies in july 1975 but that longer have such policies are alabama alaska arizona indiana missouri new mexico wyoming and puerto rico crs10 predra state passthrough and disregard policies under predra policies and through september 30 2008 state that chooses to operate passthrough policy bears the

spending maintenance of effort or moe requirement beyond the requirement that tanf cash welfare be restricted to families with children who meet test of financial need there are federal rules governing tanf eligibility and benefit amounts financial need is wholly determined by the states states determine the income amounts below which income must fall to make family eligible for tanf they also determine what types of income are counted and whether any income is disregarded or subtracted from total income when determining tanf eligibility or benefits different states have devised different rules for how child support is treated when determining familys financial need and benefits table 1 shows the child support passthrough and disregard policies in the tanf program as of april 2007 the second column of the table indicates the amount of child support income that states say they count in determining whether family is eligible for the tanf program the states had three answers none of the child support received by the custodial parent in the tanf family was counted in determining the familys tanf eligibility all of the familys child support income was counted or all of the child support income was counted except for up to 50 per month if after passing this first test the family is eligible for tanf the state then applies its rules regarding passing through child support income to the family the third column of the table shows the states passthrough policy in terms of how much if any of the child support received by the family from the noncustodial parent is given to the family by the state the fourth column of the table indicates how much if any of the passthrough amount is disregarded by the state in determining the family tanf cash payment 16 national

child support income d the state pays an amount equal to up to 50 per month of child support collected on behalf of the tanf family this amount is considered an addition to the tanf cash benefit rather than passthrough of child support income the state pays an amount equal to 25 per month if at least 25 in child support is collected on behalf of the tanf family this amount is considered an addition to the tanf cash benefit rather than passthrough of child support income source the data in this table are based on information from the states obtained in congressional research service survey together with survey information from the urban institute and 2007 survey conducted by the center on law and social policy table 1 shows that the most common policy among the states is pass through or disregard of child support collected on behalf of tanf family that is all child support is retained to reimburse the federal government and the states for the cash welfare payment however some states allow some amount of child support collected on tanf familys behalf to be passed through to the family without negatively impacting the familys tanf payment ie with concurrent disregard of the passthrough amount other states have child support passthrough policies but do not disregard the income when determining tanf eligibility or payment amounts thus while the state may send all or portion of current child support collections to tanf families the state simultaneously reduces the familys tanf grant by the amount passed through as of april 2007 27 states have pass through or disregard policy 12 states pass through and disregard up to 50 per month 7 states pass through gap payment or supplement 3 of these states also passthrough an additional 50 and disregard the entire amount of the monthly gap paymentsupplement plus the 50 if passedthrough 2 states pass through and disregard an added amount to the tanf cash benefit but the amount is not considered child support passthrough 1 state crs13 passes through all child support payments to custodial parents but does not disregard any of that income 1 state passes through up to 50 monthly but does not disregard that income and 1 state passes through and disregards all child support collected on the familys behalf dra passthrough and disregard provisions among other things the deficit reduction act dra of 2005 pl 109171 enacted february 8 2006 seeks to provide stable source of income for all single parent families with noncustodial parent it simplifies cse assignment and distribution rules and strengthens the familyfirst policies started in the 1996 welfare reform law17 the dra provides incentives to states in the form of federal cost sharing to direct more of the child support on behalf of tanf cash welfare families to the families themselves often referred to as family first policy as opposed to using such collections to reimburse state and federal treasuries for welfare benefits paid to families or to finance their child support programs pl 109171 will allow states to pay up to 100 per month or 200 per month for family with two or more children in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family to the family and will not require the state to pay the federal government the federal share of those collections in order for the federal government to forgo its share of these child support collections the state is required to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining tanf cash welfare eligibility and benefits18 the next two sections illustrate the effects of the dra changes in child support passthrough and disregard policies on both family budgets and federal and state budgets the impact is fairly complex depending on number of factors including the states current tanf policies regarding eligibility rules benefit amounts and current child support passthrough and disregard rules and familys circumstances such as earned income and the amount of child support paid by the noncustodial parent the impact of dra policy is examined in six states california illinois maine maryland oklahoma and west virginia for mother with two children for this hypothetical family the current tanf and child support policies were simulated using varying assumptions of child support receipt and earnings of family members19 17 see crs report rs22377 child support provisions in the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 by carmen solomonfears 18 the congressional budget office cbo estimated that this provision would cost the federal government 140 million over the fiveyear period fy20062010 this provision takes effect on october 1 2008 and thus the cost would apply only to two of these fiscal years fy2009 and fy2010 19 the simulations were conducted using computer program developed by the congressional research service crs known as systtim for this report the program continued crs14 the states were chosen based on their child support passthrough and disregard policy and their maximum tanf cash benefit amounts california and illinois both passthrough and disregard up to 50 monthly in child support payments california is relatively high tanf benefit state and illinois is relatively low tanf benefit state maryland relatively high benefit state and oklahoma relatively low benefit state do not have child support passthrough and disregard policy west virginia and maine were chosen because they have special rules for treating families with child support maine is gap payment described above state west virginia does not provide child support passthrough and disregard but gives 25 incentive payment added to the tanf grant for those families with some any amount child support collected on their behalf the next section examines the impact of the dra provisions on family income it is followed by section on how the dra provisions could affect government budgets through tanf the federal share of child support collections and the states share of child support collections impact of dra provisions on family income the dra policies aim to increase the incomes of tanf cash welfare families this is particular policy concern since in all states the maximum tanf cash welfare benefit is only fraction of povertylevel income californias maximum benefit for family of three in january 2007 was 723 the highest maximum benefit of the six states closely examined in this report but benefit that represents only about half of the 2007 federal poverty guideline for family of three allowing family to keep 200 per month in child support increases family income by 14 of the poverty threshold the increase in family income that would result from state implementing dras full passthrough and disregard provisions depends on number of factors 19 continued simulates the impact of program rules on families and governments for hypothetical families the hypothetical family used in this report is family with one adult and two children the average welfare family the program allows the simulations of total income tanf benefits and federal and state child support shares for this family when both child support payments of the noncustodial parent and earnings of the custodial parent are varied the simulations are best used to illustrate how policy changes affect specific types of families however the simulations are specific to the assumed characteristics of the hypothetical family and might not reflect the predominate or distributional effects of policy change on the population as whole crs15 for families eligible and receiving tanf welfare before dra rules are implemented the family can see an increase in income for family composed of parent with two children the maximum increase in income would be 200 the increase in income would be less if the noncustodial parent paid less than 200 in child support and less in states that already paid some of the collected child support to tanf cash welfare family implementing the dra passthrough and disregard rules can make some families newly eligible for tanf cash welfare families with child support income greater than the tanf benefit are ineligible for tanf they receive the collected child support instead however some such families might be made eligible for tanf if up to 200 in child support were disregarded when determining eligibility for tanf if the family actually receives tanf many eligible families do not its income would increase by some amount family ineligible for tanf because its counted earnings are higher than its states income eligibility threshold would see increase in income from implementing dras passthrough and disregard under the policies in effect in january 2007 and under the new fully phasedin minimum wage of 725 per hour families in many states are ineligible for tanf even at 20 hours of work per week among the six states closely examined in this report only in california would mother of two working 40 hours per week at 725 per hour be eligible for tanf based on january 2007 rules the next four tables illustrate the effects of implementing the new dra pass through and disregard rules on family incomes table 2 presents the combined tanf and child support income mother of two would receive under states current passthrough and disregard policies compared with the amount she would receive if the state implemented the maximum allowed under dra the table shows the combined income for family with zero earnings with child support paid by the noncustodial parent ranging from 0 per month20 to 500 per month shown in 100 increments the tables top panel shows the combined income under predra policies the middle panel shows combined income under dra policies and the bottom panel displays the difference in combined tanf and child support income generally table 2 shows that dra policies would increase this familys combined monthly income by as much as 200 in the two states that currently do not passthrough and disregard child support for tanf welfare families maryland and oklahoma and by up to 150 in states that currently passthrough and disregard the first 50 in child support california and illinois the simulation assumes that west virginia would end its 25 child support incentive payment and instead adopt dras maximum child support passthrough and disregard policies this would result in maximum increase in combined child support and tanf welfare income of as much as 175 for this family in west virginia the maximum increase in maine is 150 20 the zero per month amount is represented in the table as the tanf grant only column crs16 it has passthrough and disregard of 50 but is also gap state that results in an increase in the income of the hypothetical family by as much as 135 per month the simulation assumes that maine would continue to provide this gap payment the amounts discussed above are the maximum increase in combined tanf payments and child support income resulting from the adoption of dra policies the increase would be less if the noncustodial parent paid less than 200 per month in child support it also would be less in some cases in maine because up to 185 in child support is already paid to the family it also would be less than 200 for some cases in other states those families who would be newly eligible for tanf because of the greater disregard of child support when determining tanf eligibility the mechanics of the increase in income for such newlyeligible tanf families is discussed when describing table 3 table 2 monthly

congressional research service using the systtim case simulation model includes both the 50 child support passthrough and disregard and the 135 gap payment b includes both the 200 child support passthrough and disregard and the 135 gap payment crs17 table 3 provides more detail on the impact of dra policies on the combined child support and tanf income of hypothetical mother with zero earnings and two children the table separately shows tanf and child support income under both predra and dra policies assuming that the noncustodial parent makes child support payment of 300 per month on behalf of the family21 it also shows the income as percent of the fy2007 federal poverty guidelines dra policies would increase income for this family by the maximum 200 per month in maryland and by 150 in california and illinois in fy2007 200 per month represents 14 of the federal poverty threshold and 150 represents almost 11 of the poverty threshold thus the additional child support passedthrough and disregarded would significantly supplement the familys income the largest tanf benefit in the table is californias 723 per month representing about half the poverty level combined income for the hypothetical family in california as shown in table 3 would rise to 923 per month or 65 of the poverty threshold under dra policies other states pay lower benefits and thus income from tanf represents smaller percentage of the poverty threshold so that child support plays an even greater role in lifting family income relative to the poverty level the hypothetical family of three in west virginia would net that states maximum increase of 175 passthrough and disregard of 200 offset by elimination of the 25 child support incentive payment the increase in income in maine is only 115 the 200 disregard plus the gap payment would result in all 300 in child support going to the family in maine compared with 185 in child support going to the family under its predra 50 passthrough and disregard plus the gap payment in oklahoma the increase in total income from adopting 200 passthrough and disregard would be 192 per month for the hypothetical family of three with earnings this example illustrates how the interaction of the child support disregard and tanf eligibility thresholds can result in reduced impact under predra policies the hypothetical family of three with 300 in child support income per month would be ineligible for tanf cash welfare the 300 in child support is higher than the maximum tanf grant of 292 per month in oklahoma thus under predra rules the family would receive 300 in child support but tanf benefit however if oklahoma adopted 200 child support passthrough and disregard the family would become eligible for tanf cash welfare its countable child support income would be 100 300 minus the 200 disregarded so the family would receive the 292 tanf cash grant plus 200 in child support the state and federal 21 this roughly corresponds to the average monthly amount of child support received by custodial parents who received child support in 2003 the united states census bureau periodically collects national survey information on child support by interviewing random sample of singleparent families the census bureau is able to generate an array of data that is useful in assessing the performance of noncustodial parents in paying their child support the survey population includes all persons who have their own children under age 21 living with them while the other parent lives outside the household census bureau data indicated that among custodial parents with income below the poverty level who received child support the average amount of child support received in 2003 latest available data was 3713 see us bureau of the census custodial mothers and fathers and their child support 2003 by timothy s grail current population reports p60230 july 2006 crs18 government would keep the other 100 in child support the net gain to the family would be 192 292 tanf cash grant minus the 100 in child support kept by the state the oklahoma example also illustrates how an increased child support pass through and disregard expands eligibility for cash welfare that is the hypothetical family of three with child support of 300 is ineligible for tanf if child support is disregarded but becomes eligible if 200 of child support is disregarded the increased disregard permits families to receive child support without losing eligibility for tanf cash table 3 monthly tanf and child support income of mother with earnings and two

child support passthrough and disregard could increase the income of some tanf welfare families but at cost to both federal and state governments under predra law the cost of passingthrough and disregarding child support collected for welfare families is borne by states they finance child support paid to welfare families from the state share of child support collections and through tanf22 the dra provides financial incentive to states to passthrough and disregard more child support collected on behalf of tanf cash welfare families by reducing its cost to the state and shifting some of these costs to the federal government however the way costs are shifted is fairly complex for many families the cost to the state would be lowered by shifting it to the federal government which would see reduced federal share of child support collections flowing to the federal treasury for other families however the costs of switching to the dra policies would actually be borne by the state through increasing tanf cash welfare expenditures this would occur in cases when disregarding additional child support makes families newly eligible for tanf and they actually receive the tanf cash for which they become eligible table 6 shows how the cost of increasing family income under dra provisions through the child support passthrough and disregard would be borne by the federal government and the states for family whose noncustodial parent pays 300 per month in child support for many hypothetical families shown on the table greater share of the cost would be borne by the federal government through reduced federal share of child support collections however there are examples in the table that show how the states via the tanf program sometimes bear the cost23 in oklahoma family with zero 22 tanf is financed by combination of federal grants to states and state funds under maintenance of effort moe requirement child support money collected on behalf of tanf families that is passed through to the families and disregarded by the state in determining tanf eligibility may be counted by the state toward meeting its moe requirement for this analysis any costs of child support passthrough or disregard financed via tanf is considered to be borne by the state federal tanf grants to the state are generally fixed and do not change based on how much state pays in cash welfare or its child support passthrough and disregard policies the moe amount for state is also fixed in order to finance child support passthrough and disregard through tanf the state must forgo using tanf or moe funds for other purposes 23 in other words the cost of the dra passthrough and disregard policies could come from increased tanf expenditures examples shown in the previous section of this report show that some families ineligible for tanf without the passthrough and disregard would become eligible for tanf cash welfare because of the passthrough and disregard if they actually receive tanf cash welfare many eligible families do not in fact takeup receipt of tanf cash welfare the cost of the change to dra policies could be borne by tanf continued crs22 earnings is ineligible for tanf if the noncustodial parent pays 300 per month in child support under dra policies the family would be eligible for tanf since 200 of that child support would be passedthrough and disregarded the family would receive 292 tanf benefit cost to the state from tanf under pre dra policies the state would retain child support since the family is ineligible for tanf under dra policies the state retains 100

continued in 2003 an estimated 457 of tanf cash welfareeligible families actually received benefits the examples in this section assume that if family becomes eligible for tanf through the passthrough and disregard policy they in fact receive tanf crs23 the costsharing arrangements for the states vary depending on their fmap poorer states must send back to the federal government greater share of child support collections than higher income states for example west virginia sends back 7282 of its child support collections maryland sends back 5000 of its collections under predra policies poorer state has relatively small share of child support collections to pass through to cash welfare families for example if noncustodial parent pays 300 in child support collections west virginia only retains 82 200 passthrough cannot be paid for through west virginias share of child support collections under dra policies the federal government generally would bear greater share of the higher passthrough and disregard in poorer states compared to better off states for west virginia the federal government would pick up ie forego 7282 of the 200 passthrough under dra policies 146 for family with earnings on the other hand for maryland the federal government would pick up 5000 or 100 of the 200 passthrough for family with zero earnings however the relationship between state income and costsharing of the dra passthrough and disregard is different when tanf picks up the cost the higher the tanf benefit the higher the cost to the state of adopting the dra passthrough and disregard also the lower the states percapita income the higher the fmap and the lower the state share is to offset higher welfare costs that might result from the dra passthrough and disregard policy table 6 illustrates the complexity of how the states and federal government would share the cost of the dra passthrough and disregard with regard to the custodial parent with earnings for the first four states shown the increased pass through and disregard would be paid for by reduction in the federal share of child support collections reduction in the state share of child support collections or reduction in both the federal and state shares of child support collections however in oklahoma the implementation of dra passthrough and disregard policy would result in the hypothetical family with earnings and child support income of 300 per month gaining 192 in extra income each month through the tanf program before dra the family kept the entire 300 of child support and was ineligible for tanf pursuant to dra the family would keep 200 per month in child support income and become eligible for 292 in tanf payments for total monthly income of 492 this additional income to the family would be paid for by the state with tanf dollars in this report tanf benefit expenditures are considered state cost the other 100 in child support from the noncustodial parent would be divided between the federal government and the state in accordance with the states fmap thus the federal governments share of the child support collection would be 68 and the states share would be 32 one way of interpreting this information would be to say that dra would result in the state paying 292 in added tanf expenditures which could be partially offset with the states share of child support collections for total state cost 260 given that tanf is considered state cost in this analysis the federal government would not incur any cost instead it would keep its 68 share of the child support collection crs24 another anomaly occurs in west virginia in west virginia the table shows the state saving 25 in tanf expenditures because the analysis assumes that west virginia would eliminate its 25 incentive payment which currently is added to the tanf benefit payment if the noncustodial parent pays any amount of child support once the dra passthrough and disregard policy takes effect at halftime minimum wage earnings24 mother with two children in california and maine would both receive 150 per month in additional income after implementation of dra passthrough and disregard provisions the federal share of child support collections would be higher in maine than in california partly because maine has higher fmap 6327 versus 5000 and partly because maine has 135 gap payment in illinois and maryland the 200 passthrough and disregard policy together with the states earnings disregard rules would enable mother with two children to remain on the tanf rolls at halftime earnings which means that the state via the tanf program would pay the cost of providing the families with the additional monthly income see table 6 it is also noteworthy that maine is the only state in which family working at the halftime minimum wage level benefits more than the family with earnings this is more consistent with public policy that seeks to encourage both work among welfare recipients and their cooperation in attaining child support although this situation reflects effective use of cse resources it is also result of maines fillthegap policy as mentioned earlier maine is one of only five states that have fillthegap policy at fulltime state minimum wage earnings 750 per hour mother with two children in california would receive 86 per month in additional income after implementation of dra passthrough and disregard policy in california the 200 passthrough and disregard policy together with the states earnings disregard rules would enable mother with two children to remain on the tanf rolls at fulltime earnings which means that the state via the tanf program would pay the cost of providing the family with the additional monthly income again one interpretation of this information is that dra would result in the state paying 186 in added tanf expenditures which could be partially offset with the states share of child support collections for total state cost of 136 given that tanf is considered state cost in this analysis the federal government would not incur any cost and it would keep its 50 share of the child support collectionsee table 6 with respect to the cse program it is noteworthy that the interests and perspective of an individual family and the interests and perspective of the state cse program are not always in sync the interests of family are usually entirely financial it is in the best interest of family to get the highest amount of income available to it thus the higher the child support passthrough and disregard amount the more family will potentially benefit however from cse program perspective the more dollars that the program has to invest in cse activities eg parent location paternity establishment support order establishment collection of child support payments the better the program can serve its entire clientele thus 24 the halftime minimum wage earnings rate is 750 per hour in california state minimum wage rate and 725 per hour in maine new fully phasedin federal minimum wage rate crs25 for many states the ability to retain child support collections outweighs the value of passthrough and disregard policy particularly since the passthrough and disregard would not benefit persons who never received cash tanf benefits such persons represented 39 of the cse caseload in fy2006 potential behavioral implications of dra child support passthrough and disregard rules the simulations described in the previous section of this report show the direct impacts that dra policies would have on family income and government budgets if they were adopted by states they do not capture what would happen if the dra policies evoke changes in behavior however particularly in the willingness of noncustodial parents to pay the child support they owe the costs of implementing dra policies in the form of reduced child support collections retained by the federal and state governments and higher tanf benefits could potentially be offset by greater child support collections and quicker exits from tanf since its inception the rationale for the child support passthrough and disregard policy has been that it would encourage custodial parents to cooperate with the cse program and further that it would encourage noncustodial parents to comply with their child support orders if they know that some of the payment would increase the amount of financial support for their children several ethnographicfocus group studies indicate that once they start paying child support noncustodial parents want to see that their money actually helps their children explanations that welfare benefits are in effect child support paid by taxpayers have not satisfied them25 moreover child support analysts contend that the noncustodial parents compliance with his or her child support order may also lead to the noncustodial parent becoming more involved in his or her childs life eg providing emotional support parental guidance etc on the other hand during the late 1980s and early 1990s the general perception regarding the passthrough and disregard policy was that it was administratively burdensome and that it failed to improve custodial parent cooperation or noncustodial parent compliance these negative perceptions were thought to outweigh the financial benefits to the family and in part led to the elimination of the mandatory 50 passthrough and disregard policy in 1996 it was also recognized that eliminating the passthrough and disregard allowed states to recover larger portion of cash welfare payments26 25 manpower demonstration research corporation parents fair share demonstration caring and paying what fathers and mothers say about child support by frank f furstenberg jr kay sherwood and

february 9 2000 p 37 crs26 there is some evidence that governments retention of child support payments affects noncustodial parents attitudes toward child support in study of program to provide services to lowincome noncustodial parents who were behind on their child support parents fair share noncustodial parents were asked whether certain situations constituted good reasons for not paying child support almost onethird of the parents said that the child support money goes to welfare or the state not the children was good reason not to pay child support however this situation ranked below others that respondents more frequently said provided good reasons not to pay support for example that the noncustodial parent is unemployed the child support order is too high and there are disagreements over how the money is spent27 the effectiveness of various child support passthrough and disregard policies was examined as part of welfare reform experiments conducted in the 1990s these studies however focused on custodial parents receipt of child support income rather than the noncustodial parents payment of child support number of these evaluations for example the evaluation of connecticuts job first program reported increased receipt of child support income28 this could result from the direct effects of the passthrough and disregard policies as illustrated in this report higher reported child support income could also result from other welfare reform features that could have shortened welfare spells and reduced the amount of child support assigned to and retained by governments the wisconsin child support demonstration evaluation based on an experimental design provides the most direct evidence of whether larger child support passthrough and disregards change parental behavior under the wisconsin program all child support was passedthrough and disregarded as long as the custodial parent remained eligible for cash assistance had income below 115 of poverty the full passthrough and disregard was compared with 50 child support passthrough and disregard the evaluation found that the full passthrough and disregard was associated with increases in paternity establishment it also found that for some groups in some years the full passthrough and disregard increased noncustodial parents payment of child support29 however that last effect was not observed over the longerterm ie six years of observations for groups studied in the evaluation 27 see bloom dan and kay sherwood matching opportunities to obligations lessons for child support reform from the

review at httpaspehhsgovhspcs tanfint03reporthtm crs27 2002 national nonexperimental study found that the child support disregard had small but positive and statistically significant effect on paternity establishment and the proportion of cases with collections30 however 2005 study found little or significant impact of the child support passthrough and disregard on the percentage of tanf cases with child support collections31 conclusion in 2003 the average amount of child support owed by noncustodial parents to custodial parents with incomes below the poverty level who had legal child support order was 3713 per year or about 300 per month32 but not all of the parents who had custody of their children while the other parent lived elsewhere had child support orders if paternity for child has not been established or child support obligation has not been legally established the custodial parent is not entitled to child support payments some research suggests that child support passthrough and disregard policy can help increase the number of paternities and child support orders established by increasing the willingness of custodial parents to cooperate with the child support enforcement cse agencies and by increasing the willingness of noncustodial parents to comply with their child support obligations there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with child support passthrough and disregard policy some of the advantages include the following an increase in income available to families who receive temporary assistance for needy families tanf cash benefit payments as illustrated in this report child support can be significant contribution to family income for the families that receive tanf payments when combined with earnings child support may lift some families out of poverty preparation for life without the regularity of monthly public assistance grant because the child support passthrough and disregard are applied only when the noncustodial parent pays current monthly child support payments the family may experience some of the upsanddowns of irregular or partial child support payments 30 institute for research on poverty university of

and thereby be better able to adjust to these real life situations when they leave the cash welfare program recognition by the custodial parent that the noncustodial parent is contributing to the financial support of his or her children this may help many families reduce conflict over child support obligations passthrough of child support makes the connection between the noncustodial parents resources and the needs of the child more direct this may also increase child support payment and paternity establishment improvement in parentchild relationships some research has shown that parents who pay child support tend to be more involved in the lives of their children and to participate in decisions that affect them greater interaction with both parents has been found to foster more positive outcomes for the child states can claim maintenance of effort moe credit for child support that is passed through to families receiving tanf cash assistance and disregarded in determining their eligibility and the amount of their benefit this helps states meet their moe requirements in their tanf programs administrative simplification passthrough and disregard policy could increase the transparency of the cse system by making it easier for customers child support personnel and public officials to understand the cse program33 some of the disadvantages of child support passthrough and disregard policy include the following the revenue state would forego ie state share of child support collections made on behalf of tanf families that otherwise could be used to fund cse activities the costs of making changes to the states automated system to reflect passthrough and disregard policy there is some disagreement over the potential size of these costs the revenue the federal government would forego by having to share with the states the costs of passthrough and disregard policies the federal government would thereby receive reduced federal share of child support collections in the federal treasury 33 policy studies inc exploring options child support arrears forgiveness and passthrough of payments to custodial families by james hennessey and jane venohr february 9 2000 p 44 crs29 additionally some would say that child support disregard policies raise equity concerns they contend that passthrough and disregard policies can result in different treatment of families with the same basic financial position in determining tanf eligibility and benefits for example consider family with 200 in unearned income one with 200 in child support of which all is disregarded and another receiving social security survivor benefits of 200 none of which is disregarded the family with disregarded child support would receive higher total income as it could keep the 200 of child support without reduction in tanf benefits while the full 200 in social security survivor benefits would in most states reduce tanf benefits dollar for dollar others contend that such concerns are not justified because child support is income that generally is earned by the noncustodial parent and that such income should be treated differently than income from public benefits it also is argued that the premise of the passthrough and disregard policy promoting cooperation by custodial parents may not be as important today as it was in the past although cash welfare families have always been required to cooperate in establishing paternity or obtaining support payments in order to receive afdctanf the 1996 welfare reform law instituted hefty penalty for noncooperation if it is determined that custodial parent is not cooperating and the individual does not qualify for any good cause or other exception then the state must reduce the familys tanf benefit by at least 25 and may remove the family from the tanf program also some analysts say that the increasing colocation of cse offices with welfare offices together with outreach efforts directed at educating families on the benefits of paternity and child support order establishment enhance cooperation policies thus these analysts argue that the state longer has to forego its share of child support collections to garner cooperation of custodial parents in cse program functions other analysts point out that passthrough and disregard policy may be more important as tool for encouraging cooperation from the noncustodial parent which could lead to lower enforcement costs the analysis in this report of six selected states found that implementation of deficit reduction act dra passthrough and disregard policy would financially benefit all 3person families in which the mother had earnings for those with earnings mothers in relatively high tanf benefit states would be more likely to experience an increase in monthly income than mothers in low tanf benefit states moreover the analysis indicates that mother with two children and earnings would benefit more in state that currently does not have child support pass through and disregard policy but that adopts such policy under the new dra rules many of the states currently without passthrough and disregard policy are high fmap states which means that the money that they give back to the federal government as the federal share of child support payments is higher than in other states pursuant to dra the federal government would waive its share of child support collections thus many analysts and family advocates argue that it may be to the states advantage to pass these dollars to the tanf families instead of to the federal government it has been suggested that states that currently have child support passthrough and disregard policy could increase the amount of the passthrough and disregard to 200 per month and use what would have been paid out of state funds as the federal crs30 share of child support collections34 to help fund the higher disregard amount or to provide funding for more cse activities35 under federal law the federal government is required to give states cse incentive payment to reward the performance of effective state cse programs36 federal law stipulates that the cse incentive payment to states in the aggregate cannot exceed 471 million in fy2007 the incentive payment to an individual state is based on five performance measures related to the establishment of paternity and child support orders collection of current and pastdue child support payments and the costeffectiveness of the states program and its relative ranking compared to the other states it has been suggested that for all states adoption of the new dra pass through and disregard policy would be way to increase cse funding via higher incentive payments according to some advocacy groups adopting generous passthrough and disregard policy also could increase the amount of federal child support performance incentive payments state receives these incentive payments are based on performance measures such as states paternity establishment and child support collection rates if as research has found these rates improve as result of expanded passthrough and disregard policies the state could see its incentive funding increase37 it also has been suggested that when all dra rules are fully implemented cse federal funding will be significantly reduced some point out that the matching of incentive payments will end on september 30 200738 and if state gives its share of child support collections to the tanf family that source of funding ie state share 34 if predra state with 50 fmap passed through and disregarded 100 per month in child support collections to tanf families it meant that the state did not retain its share of the 100 ie 50 and sent the federal government the federal share of the child support collection ie 50 if the state adopts the dra child support passthrough and disregard of 200 per month the state could give the family the entire 200 without expending additional state dollars the state would forego its 100 and the federal government would forego its 100 35 center for law and social policy and policy studies inc more child support dollars to kids using new state flexibility

federal reimbursement of cse incentive payments will result in significant reduction in cse financing under previous law the federal match resulted in near tripling of state cse fundingexpenditures for example in fy2005 actual incentive payments to states amounted to 446 million the federal match at the 66 rate on the incentive payments amounted to almost twice that figure 865 million which translated into state spending of 1311 billion on cse activities crs31 of child support collections for the cse program will also end they remark that while tanf families may be adversely affected by state not having child support passthrough and disregard policy better funded cse program is more likely to benefit the majority 85 of the cse caseload which consists of former tanf families and families who have never been on tanf39 if some of the literature and research is true child support passthrough and disregard policy could potentially result in more child support payments such child support payments could reduce government spending by providing families with incomes sufficient to make them ineligible for programs such as tanf food stamps and medicaid this concept is called welfare cost avoidance when noncustodial parents meet their financial obligations to their children the us taxpayer is relieved of that responsibility many child support advocates contend that the financial impact of welfare cost avoidance should not be ignored in discussions of the costs and benefits of cse endeavors the cse fy2005fy2009 strategic plan proclaims that child support is longer primarily welfare reimbursement revenueproducing device for the federal and state governments it is familyfirst program intended to ensure families self sufficiency by making child support more reliable source of income40 it appears that states implementation of child support passthrough and disregard policy may aid in that endeavor according to 2005 report recent policy proposals that provide for more generous passthrough and disregard policy and extend family first distribution rules to child support collections made through the ftro federal income tax refund offset program would increase family income and selfsufficiency and reduce poverty although government costs would increase41 most state cse programs are currently in the position or most likely will be in the near future of having to compete with all other state interests in obtaining funds from the general state treasury or county treasuries thus regardless of the advantages of adopting child support passthrough and disregard policy many states may be facing situation in which cse resources are very limited and thereby will be unable to pay the costs associated with adopting passthrough and disregard policy 39 in

each of the six states the situation of mother with two children42 and earnings parttime minimum wage earnings and fulltime minimum wage earnings is examined with regard to the minimum wage this analysis uses the higher of 725 per hour the new fully phasedin federal minimum wage or the state minimum wage43 monthly earnings are calculated by multiplying the hourly wage rate by 8 hours per day multiplied by five days per week and multiplied by factor of 433 for purposes of tanf eligibility and benefit computations the 433 factor is not used in maryland which is required by its tanf manual to use factor of 400 to determine the monthly amount or in west virginia which is required by its tanf manual to use factor of 430 to determine the monthly amount the analysis in this appendix compares the total monthly income of the mother with two children under the states current policy regarding treatment of earnings and child support passthrough and disregard with dra policy the analysis assumes that the state would opt to passthrough and disregard up to 200 per month of child support payments with the federal government sharing in the cost also the analysis only examines child support payments between 0 and 500 per month the tables show this range in 100 dollar increments 42 the analysis assumes that there are two children in the familyhousehold pursuant to pl 109171 person with two or more children would get the maximum federally matched passthrough and disregard amount of 200 per month 43 as of february 22 2007 31 states including the district of columbia and

the new passthrough and disregard policy authorized under dra whether or not california will do so in reality is not known at this time there have been initiatives in california to eliminate the existing 50 child support passthrough and disregard policy opponents of the current policy contend that it diverts county resources from basic cse activities44 zero earnings in california mother with two children and earnings is eligible for the maximum tanf benefit of 723 per month until the child support paid by the noncustodial parent exceeds the monthly tanf maximum if the noncustodial parent pays at least 50 per month in child support the family receives 50 child support passthrough and disregard payment thereby total income to the family amounts to 773 per month see table a1 if the noncustodial parent pays child support in the amount of 773 or more per month the family stops receiving tanf benefits and instead receives only the child support paid by the noncustodial parent this analysis only examines the impact of child support payments of up to 500 per month assuming that california adopts the new federally matched passthrough and disregard policy pursuant to the deficit

counted ie is disregarded in maine family can use earnings or child support income to fill the gap between what the state says family of certain size needs to subsist in the state the states tanf standard of need and the maximum tanf payment for family of the given size maines standard of need for 3person family is 670 per month and the payment maximum for 3person family is 535 thus the gap is 135 670535 this means that up to 135 per month in earnings or child support income is disregarded in determining the familys tanf benefit in addition to the 50 passthrough and disregard zero earnings in maine mother with two children and earnings is eligible for the maximum tanf benefit of 535 per month until the countable child support paid by the noncustodial parent exceeds the monthly tanf maximum if the noncustodial parent pays at least 50 per month in child support the family receives 50 child support passthrough and disregard payment if the noncustodial parent pays 200 in child support the family is able to take full advantage of the disregard and gap payment provision in that 185 would go to the family without affecting the familys tanf benefit ie 50 from the passthrough and disregard and 135 from the fillthegap policy thereby total income to the family amounts to 720 per month 535 from tanf 50 from the passthrough and disregard and 135 from gap payment see table a3

at the federal minimum wage would be eligible for tanf cash benefit payment of 410 per month until the noncustodial parent paid 610 per month or more in child support at that point the family would longer receive tanf cash benefit payment if the noncustodial parent paid at least 200 but less than 610 per month in child support total monthly income to such family would amount to 1238 410 from

systtim case simulation model note the west virginia state tanf manual stipulates that gross earnings be multiplied by number of hours worked and then multiplied by factor of 43 instead of 433 to determine monthly gross earnings for purposes of consistency in the tables we used factor of 433 to derive gross monthly earnings for west virginia but for the benefit calculations the factor of 43 was used pursuant to west virginia policy crs50 appendix b impact of dra policy on federal and state share of child support collections analysis of selected states to determine the distribution of child support collections among families the state and the federal government states must adhere to state and federal child support assignment and distribution rules and calculate the federal and state share of child support collections based on the states federal medical assistance percentage fmap this appendix discusses the impact of deficit reduction act dra policy on the distribution of child support collections among families the state and the federal government based on family income status in six states california illinois maine maryland oklahoma and west virginia the impact of dra policy is based on the assumption that each of the states would opt to passthrough and disregard up to 200 per month of child support payments made by noncustodial parents with the federal government sharing in the cost in each of the six states the situation of mother with two children and earnings with parttime minimum wage earnings and with fulltime minimum wage earnings is examined also the analysis only examines child support payments between 0 and 500 per month the tables show this range in 100 dollar increments assignment and distribution rules for tanf families child support collections are either distributed to families or retained by the state and federal governments as reimbursement for welfare costs current child support payments63 collected on behalf of nonwelfare families go to the family via the state disbursement unit current child support payments collected on behalf of temporary assistance for needy families tanf families are split between the federal and state governments and at state option some all or none of the states share of the child support collections can be paid to tanf families under pl 104193 the 1996 welfare reform law the rules governing how child support collections are distributed changed substantially pursuant to pl 109171 effective october 1 2008 at state option the child support distribution rules will change again since the child support enforcement cse programs inception the rules determining who actually gets the child support arrearage payments have been complex it is helpful to think of the rules in two categories first there are rules in both federal and state law that stipulate who has legal claim on the payments owed by the noncustodial parent these are called assignment rules second there are rules that determine the order in which child support collections are paid in accordance with the assignment rules these are called distribution rules the order of payment 63 current child support refers to the amount of child support that is required to be paid to the custodial parent for the month in which it is collected crs51 of the child support collection is very important because in many cases child support obligations are never fully paid current tanf recipients as condition of tanf eligibility when family applies for tanf the custodial parent must assign to the state the right to collect both current child support payments and pastdue child support obligations that accrue while the family is on the tanf rolls these are called permanently assigned arrearages the assignment requirement for tanf applicants also includes arrearage payments that accumulated before the family enrolled in tanf these are called preassistance arrearages while the family receives tanf benefits the state is permitted to retain any current support and any assigned arrearages it collects up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits that have been paid to the family64 pl 104193 repealed the 50 required passthrough and gave states the choice to decide how much if any of the state share some all none of child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families to send the family states also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family pl 104193 required states to pay the federal government the federal governments share of child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families pl 109171 stipulates that the assignment covers child support that accrues only during the period that the family receives tanf thus child support owed before family enrolls in tanf and after the family leaves tanf belongs to the family and child support owed during the time the family is on tanf belongs to the state and federal governments this provision takes effect on october 1 2009 or october 1 2008 at state option for families who receive tanf cash benefit payments pl 109171 requires the federal government to waive its share of the child support collections passed through to tanf families by the state and disregarded by the state up to an amount equal to 100 per month in the case of family with one child and up to 200 per month in the case of family with two or more children this provision takes effect on october 1 2008 federal medical assistance percentage fmap key component in determining the federal and state share of child support collected on behalf of tanf families is the federal medical assistance percentage or fmap under old afdc law the rate at which states reimbursed the federal government for child support payments collected on behalf of cash welfare recipients was the federal matching rate ie the federal medical assistance percentage or fmap or medicaid matching rate for the afdc program the fmap offered federal matching dollars for all afdc benefits payments matter how high they were in the aggregate or per recipient the federal share was determined by applying 64 in other words states only have the rights to preassistance arrearages while the family is on tanf once the family longer receives tanf benefits the rights to preassistance arrearages revert back to the family crs52 the fmap to the total amount spent by state for afdc benefits under the fmap the federal funding share of afdc payments was higher for states with low per capita incomes and lower for states with high per capita incomes in other words the fmap varied inversely with state per capita income ie poor states have high federal matching rate wealthy states have lower federal matching rate in state that had 50 matching rate the federal government was reimbursed 50 for each 100 collected in child support on behalf of an afdc family while in state that had 70 federal matching rate the federal government was reimbursed 70 for each 100 collected in the first example the state kept 50 and in the second example the state kept 30 thus states with larger federal medical assistance matching rate kept smaller portion of the child support collections the match ranged from minimum of 50 to statutory maximum of 83 although afdc was replaced by the tanf block grant under the welfare reform law of 1996 the same matching rate procedure is still used the fmap currently is used to determine the amount federal medical of federal matching for the medicaid program tanf assistance percentage contingency funds the federal share of cse

tanf families although this report focuses on current tanf families and current child support payments one of the goals of the 1996 welfare reform law with regard to cse distribution provisions was to create distribution priority that favored families once they leave the tanf rolls once family leaves the tanf rolls72 arrearages ie pastdue child support that is owed to the family become important under predra rules the custodial parent that applies for tanf must assign to the state the right to collect both current child support payments and pastdue child support obligations which accrue while the family is on the tanf rolls these are called permanentlyassigned arrearages the child support assignment for tanf families also includes arrearage payments that accumulated before the family enrolled in tanf these are called preassistance arrearages these preassistance arrearages are temporarily assigned to the state while the family receives tanf assistance after the family is longer on the tanf program it regains its claim on preassistance arrearages the dra stipulates that the child support assignment only covers child support that accrues while the family receives tanf benefits this means that any child support arrearages that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits would longer have to be assigned to the state even temporarily the dra also gives states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf ie both current support and all child support arrearages including assigned arrearages that accrued while the family was on tanf pl 109171 allows states to simplify the cse distribution process by eliminating the special treatment of child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program73 this option allows states to pay child support collected through the federal income tax refund offset procedure to former tanf families before repaying the state its share of child support collections if state adopts the option to eliminate the special federal tax offset collection rules the federal government will waive its share of child support arrearages collected via that method unlike the limits ie up to 100 per month 72 under federal law the state cse agencies continue to collect child support on behalf of families that leave the tanf rolls these former tanf families do not have to reapply for cse services nor do they have to pay an application fee for cse services section 454a25 of the social security act 73 predra rules required that if child support arrearage payment was collected by the federal income tax refund offset program it had to be paid to the state rather than to the family child support arrearages collected through any other method were to be paid to the family first under the federal income tax refund offset program the internal revenue service operating on request from the state cse agency through the secretary of hhs intercepts income tax refunds of noncustodial parents who owe pastdue child support payments amounting to at least 150 in the case of tanf family amounting to at least 500 in the case of nonwelfare family and deducts the amount of certified child support arrearages from the income tax refund amount the money is then sent to the state crs71 for one child and up to 200 per month for two or more children imposed on support passed through to current tanf families the full federal share of federal tax offset collections will be waived if the money is paid to former tanf families according to one report nearly all of the arrearage payments collected on behalf of former tanf families was via the federal income tax refund offset program74 in 2005 56 1148 billion of the child support retained by the state for state and federal reimbursement 2040 billion was collected on behalf of former tanf families in 2005 15 billion in child support payment was collected via the federal income tax refund offset program the result of the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 distribution provisions is that states are required to pay higher fraction of child support collections on arrearages to families that have left welfare by making these payments to families first before the state and the federal government if adopted by the states the result of the deficit reduction act pl 109171 will be to fully implement family first policy for former tanf families under which most if not all child support received on their behalf will go to the families first before the state and the federal government this additional income is expected to reduce dependence on welfare by both promoting exit from tanf and preventing entry and reentry to tanf custodial parents welcome this provision that requires the federal government to share with the states the costs of paying child support arrearages to former tanf families if the state chooses to implement that option custodial parents have been frustrated because they have always viewed child support arrearages as belonging to them they argue that they had to rely on family and friends for financial assistance during periods when the noncustodial parent failed to pay child support that occurred before they went on welfare they contend that they and not the state are entitled to any prewelfare arrearages that are collected on their behalf75 much of the complexity of the distribution rules stemmed from their gradual implementation and federalstate receipt of child support arrearage payments collected through the federal income tax refund offset program thus some of the complexity of the rules ended when the rules were completely implemented on october 1 2000 many observers contend that if states choose to implement the family first approach authorized by pl 109171 the distribution of child support will be much easier to explain understand and carry out 74 center for law and social policy and the center on budget and

arrearage payments generally were divided between the state and federal governments to reimburse them for afdc if any money remained it was given to the family in contrast under pl 104193 payments to families that leave tanf are more generous under pl 104 193 child support arrearages are to be paid to the family first unless they are collected from the federal income tax refund in which case reimbursing the federal and state governments is to be given first priority for collections made on or since october 1 2000 if custodial parent assigns her or his child support rights to the state on or after october 1 2000 the parent has to assign all support rights that accrue while the family is receiving tanf benefits in addition the tanf applicant must temporarily assign to the state all rights to support that accrued to the family before it began receiving tanf benefits this temporary assignment lasts until the family stops receiving tanf benefits this means that since october 1 2000 states have been required to distribute to former tanf families the following child support collections first before the state and the federal government are reimbursed 1 all current child support 2 any child support arrearages that accrue after the family leaves tanf these arrearages are called neverassigned arrearages plus 3 any arrearages that accrued before the family began receiving tanf benefits these are called temporarily assigned arrearages as mentioned above these rules do not apply to child support collections obtained by intercepting federal income tax refunds if child support arrearages are collected via the federal income tax refund offset program the 1996 law stipulates that the state and federal government are to retain such collections moreover if after satisfying the distribution rules specified above there are still child support funds left over ie available then states may retain them to satisfy arrearages they are owed states are allowed to distribute any child support monies still available at this point in the process to the custodial parent however regardless of how states choose to distribute the money they must pay the federal government its share finally any remaining funds are distributed to the family for collections made on or after october 1 2009 or october 1 2008 at state option pl 109171 simplifies child support distribution rules by giving states the option of providing families that have left tanf the full amount of the child support collected on their behalf ie current child support payments non assigned child support arrearages and child support arrearages collected via the federal income tax refund offset program with regard to former tanf families pl 109171 stipulates that the state must pay all current child support payments to the family if the child support collection exceeds the amount of current support the state must first pay to the family any nonassigned child support arrearages it there is still some money left the state has the option to retain the states share of the money or pay it to the family if the state decides to pay it to the family the state does not have to pay the federal government the federal share of the leftover collection if any of the child support collection still remains available the state is required to pay it to the family crs73 under pl 109171 the state and federal government would be entitled to child support arrearages that accrued while the family was on the tanf program these arrearages are assigned to the state as condition of tanf eligibility as noted above the state has the option to retain such collected arrearages or to pay them to the former tanf family the federal government is required to share with the states the costs of paying child support arrearages to the family first this provision takes effect on october 1 2009 or october 1 2008 at state option76 76 cbo estimated that this provision would cost the federal government 283
