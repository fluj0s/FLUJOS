authorized by the immigration and nationality act ina as amended by the refugee act of 19801 the 1980 act had two basic purposes 1 to provide uniform procedure for refugee admissions and 2 to authorize federal assistance to resettle refugees and promote their selfsufficiency the intent of the legislation was to end an ad hoc approach to refugee admissions and resettlement that had characterized us refugee policy since world war ii under the ina refugee is person who is outside his or her country and who is unable or unwilling to return because of persecution or wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion 2 in special circumstances refugee also may be person who is within his or her country

generally it arranges for an overseas processing entity ope to conduct prescreening interviews of prospective refugees and prepare cases for submission to uscis which handles refugee adjudications overseas refugee processing is conducted through system of three priorities for admission these priorities are separate and distinct from whether such persons qualify for refugee status priority assignment however does reflect an asse ssment of the urgency with which such persons need to be resettled priority 1 covers compelling protection cases and refugees for whom durable solution exists who are referred to the us refugee program by unhcr us embassy or designated non governmental organization ngo such persons may be in danger of attack or of being returned to the country they fled all nationalities are eligible for this priority priority 2 covers groups of special humanitarian concern to the united states it includes specific groups that may be defined by their nationalities clans ethnicities or other characteristics some of these groups such as cuban dissidents and certain former soviet nationals lautenberg amendment cases discussed below are processed in their country of origin other priority 2 groups are processed outside their country of origin these include iranian religious minorities specter amendment cases discussed below processed in austria and turkey and burmese in refugee camps in thailand unlike priority 1 cases individuals falling under priority 2 are able to access the us refugee program without unhcr embassy or ngo referral priority 3 covers family reunification cases since fy2004 it has comprised cases of spouses unmarried children under age 21 and parents of persons who were admitted to the united states as refugees or granted asylum priority 3 refugee applications are based upon affidavits of relationship aors individuals falling under priority 3 like those falling under priority 2 are able to access the us refugee program without unhcr embassy or ngo referral the number of nationalities eligible for priority 3 processing has varied in recent years during the late 1990s the state department found that rge number of priority 3 applications were received from persons who did not qualify for refugee status and that there was significant amount of fraud associated with these applications to address these problems the us government reduced the number of nationalities eligible for such refugee slots for fy2003 four nationalities were eligible for priority 3 processing for fy2004 the priority 3 program was revised on pilot basis to simultaneously broaden access to the program and continue to address concerns about fraud the number of eligible na tionalities was increased to nine while the types of qualifying relationships were restricted as noted above eligibility for priority 3 currently requires qualifying relationship with an individual who was admitted to the united states as refugee or granted asylum prior to fy2004 this processing priority was available to those with qualifying relationships with much wider range of legal us residents without regard to how these residents gained admission to the united states in another change beginning in fy2004 children had to be under age 21 to be eligible for priority 3 in the past this processing priority had also been available to older unmarried sons and daughters these changes to the priority 3 qualifying relationships have remained in place since fy2004 for fy2008 priority 3 processing is available to nationals of 17 countries 12

qualifies for refugee status and is otherwise admissible to the united states in the past the majority of refugee adjudications were conducted by uscis officers on temporary duty from domestic asylum offices today these adjudications are handled by uscis officers in the refugee corps g3g141g150g146g156g156g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561g152g143g561g20g142g143g158g144g142g142g156g561 in order to be admitted to the united states prospective refugee must be admissible under immigration law the ina sets forth various grounds of inadmissibility which include health related grounds securityrelated grounds public charge ie indigence and lack of proper documentation some inadmissibility grounds public charge lack of proper documentation are not applicable to refugees others can be waived for humanitarian purposes to assure family unity or when it is otherwise in the public interest 13 of particular relevance to the admission of refugees are certain healthrelated and securityrelated grounds of inadmissibility the ina healthrelated grounds of inadmissibility include infection with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv prior to june 1999 hivinfected refugees could qualify for waiver by showing the following 1 the danger they posed to the public health was minimal 2 the possibility that they would spread the disease was minimal and 3 they would not create additional costs for government agencies at any level unless they had the consent of the relevant agencies on june 16 1999 the former immigration and naturalization service ins revised this policy easing the waiver requirements for hiv infected refugees under the new policy hiv positive refugees are longer required to show th at they would not create additional costs for governmentfunded programs the rationale for the change was that there are federallyfunded programs and services available to such refugees eg refugee medical assistance medicaid and other services supported through the ryan white care act and that this eligibility serves as the us governments consent to incur costs for hivpositive refugees the new regulations still require that such refugees have counseling and agree to take precautions to prevent the spread of hiv since 1990 the securityrelated grounds of inadmissibility in the ina have expressly included terrorismrelated grounds over the years the terrorismrelated grounds have been amended to lower the threshold for how substantial apparent and immediate an aliens support for terrorist activity or organization may be for the alien to be rendered inadmissible14 among the current terrorismrelated grounds an alien is inadmissible for engaging in terrorist activity if he or she gives any material support such as safe hous transportation communications or funds to terrorist organization or any of its members or to person engaged in terrorist activity the secretary of state or the secretary of dhs after consultation with the other and the attorney general may exercise discretionary waiver authority over certain terrorismrelated grounds of continued somalia sudan and uzbekistan 13 certain grounds of inadmissibility including most securityrelated grounds cannot be waived 14 see crs report rl32564 immigration terrorist grounds for exclusion and removal of aliens by michael john garcia and ruth ellen wasem

secretary of state and the secretary of dhs have exercised this waiver authority with respect to certain categories of individuals the fy2008 consultation document characte rized the impact of the use of this waiver authority in fy2007 as follows with the secretary of state and secretary of ho meland security exercising their separate authorities to render the material support inad missibility provision inapplicable over 2500 refugees who would have been forced otherwise to remain in refugee camps or survive under similar precarious circumstances have been approved to enter the united states 15 the consolidated appropriations act 2008 enacted in december 200716 specifies groups that for purposes of the ina terrorismrelated grounds of inadmissibility are not to be considered terrorist organizations on the basis of past acts thus prospective refugee who provided support to one of these groups would not be subject to the material support inadmissibility provision on the basis of those actions more broadly the consolidated appropriations act expands the discretionary authority of the secretary of state and the secretary of dhs to grant waivers of the terrorismrelated grounds of inadmissibility generally g21g153g142g140g146g138g149g561g20g142g143g158g144g142g142g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561

status under the special provision are only required to prove that they are members of protected category with credible but not necessarily individual fear of persecution by contrast the ina requires

resettlement or for admission as an immediate relative immigrant the april 1995 date restriction did not apply to children who were previously denied refugee resettlement because their documents did
