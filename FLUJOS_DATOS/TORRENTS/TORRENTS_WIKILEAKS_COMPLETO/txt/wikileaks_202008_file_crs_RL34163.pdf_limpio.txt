capital punishment legislation in the 110th congress introduction most capital punishment cases are st ate cases1 there are several federal crimes however for which the death penalty is sentencing option2 legislation to amend federal capital punishment law introduced in the 110th congress included proposals to amend the constitution to remove impediments to imposition of the death penalty to abolish the federal death penalty to increase the number of federal capital offenses and to adjust the procedur under which capital cases are tried and sentencing determinations ar made none were enacted this is an overview of some of those proposals constitutional amendments the united states constitution does not mention capital puni shment or death penalty in so many words it does how ever prohibit imposition of cruel and unusual punishments as well as the deprivati on of life without due process of law3 the supreme court recently held that th eighth amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause made applicab to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment precludes imposition of the death penalty for rape of child under twelve years of age when the vic tim was neither killed nor intended to be killed4 two constitutional amendments were ffered at least in partial response hjres 96 representative chabot would simply have amended the constitution to state that the penalty of death for the forcible rape of ch ild who has not attained the age of 12 years does not constitute cr uel and unusual punishme nt hjres

amendment impediment to capital punishment as sentencing option in child rape cases the broun proposal was apparen tly designed to remove any eighth amendment impediment to capital punishment as sentencing option in any case at some point due process concerns may have containe d the sweep of the proposals had they been accepted hjres 80 representative mccollum in contrast woul d have

any district in which the offense began continued or waspreviously ascertained by law27 from the beginning28 congress has provided in language that now appears in 18 usc 3235 that where possible capital cases should be tried in the c ounty in wh ich they occur29 it has also long specifically provided that murder and manslaughter cases shall be tried where the death inflicting injury occurs regardless of where the victim dies30 as 18 usc 3236 now states31 furthermore for some time32 it has provided in the words of 18 usc 3237 that multidistrict crimes may be tried where they are be gun

prosecuted in any district in which those activities occurred proposed 18 usc 3235 35 the manslaughter features of 3236 presumably continue in place since they are not capital cases and thus by

included act committed by cabrales in missouri nor did the government charge that cabrales transported the money from missouri to florida the counts at issue do not charge cabr ales with conspiracy they do not link her to or assert her responsibility for acts done by others in the counts at issue the government indicted cabrales for transactions which began continued and were completed only in florida 38 524 us at 8 10the proposal was apparently intended to repeal both the county trial in capital cases feature of section 3235 and by indir ection the murder portion of the murder manslaughter trial feature of section 323635 it seemed to replicate the continuing offense language of section 3237 with one significant addition it would have permitted trial where commer cerelated conduct occurred the scope of the proposed amendment would likely have depended in part on the application of constitutional constraints the proposed amendment must operate within cons titutional venue and vicinage limitations that is that the trial of all crimes shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed and that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed36 the supreme court in united states v cabrales held that in light of these provisions the crime of mone laundering committed in flor ida could not be tried in missouri where the laundered funds had been criminally generated absent other circumstances37 shortly thereafter the court held in united states v rodriguez moreno that the crime of using firearm during and in relation to the crime of kidnaping could be tried in new jersey into which the victim had been carried notwithstanding the fact that the firearm was acquired and used in maryland after the victim had been moved there from new jersey cabrales is not as restrictive as it might seem at first nor is rodriguezmoreno as permissive cabrales undered the missouri drug money in florida but there was evidence that she was member of the missouri drug trafficking conspiracy or that she had transported the money fr om missouri to florida the court acknowledged that she might have been tr ied in missouri had either been the case38 rodriguezmoreno and his confederates kidnapped drug trafficking associate and transported him over the course of time from texas to new jersey and then to maryland rodriguezmoreno acquired the fi rearm with which he threatened the kidnap victim in maryland but was tried in

using and carrying of gun and the commission of kidnaping39 crime with distinct conduct elements may be tried wherever any of those elements occurred kidnaping is continuous offens that in this case began in texas and continued through new jersey to maryland venue over the kidnaping conduct element of the section 924c1 was pr oper in texas new jersey or maryland consequently venue over th violation of section 924 c1 was proper in either texas new jersey or maryland40 the court was quick to distinguish cabrales from rodriguezmoreno the existence of criminally generated proceeds in cabrales was circumstance element of the offense but the proscribed conduct defendants money laundering activity occurred after the fact of the offense begun and completed by others in rodriguez moreno given the during and in relation to language the underlying crime of violence is critical part of the 924c1 offense41 subsequent lower federal appellate courts have read cabrales and rodriguezmoreno to require that crime be tried where at least one of its elements occurs42 it is not clear how the proposed venue amendment would have fared in light of cabrales and rodriguezmoreno it stated that the trial for any offense punishable by death shall be held in th district where the offense was committed or in any district in which the offense bega n continued or was completed b if the offense or related conduc t under subsection invol ves activities which affect interstate or foreign commerce or the im portation of an object or person into the united states such offense may be prosecuted in any district in which those activities occurred43 the amendment would appeared to have permitted trial of an offense in district in which related conduct ffecting interstate or foreign

itself and each of its elements were committed entirely in another district the cabrales money generating drug trafficking in missouri would seem to qualify as conduct relate d to the laundering in florida for purposes of the proposal and yet in cabrales that was not enough nor would the proposal always appear to meet rodriguezmoreno s conduct element standard there was nothing in the proposal that would have required that the related conduct affecting interstate commerce be an element of the offense to be tried in fact the alternative wording if the offense or rela ted conduct involves activ ities which affect interstate commerce seemed to contemplate situations in which affecting commerce was not an element conduct or otherwise of the offense such applications might have appeared to reviewing court to do more than the constitution permits specific offenses in the case of proposed venue provisions for new or existing federal capital offenses one common proposal would have built upon the scheme approved in rodriguezmoreno the statute before the court there 18 usc 924c1 outlaws the use of fir earm during and in re lation to crime of violence or serious drug offense severa l bills eg hr 880 representative forbes hr 3150 representative ke ller hr 3156 representative lamar smith and s 1860 senator cornyn w ould have created new federal crime one that would have prohibited the commission of crime of violence during and in relation to drug trafficking offense proposed 21 usc 865 they would have permitted prosecution for such an offense in 1 the judicial district in which the murder or other crime of viol ence occurred or 2 any judicial district in which the drug trafficking crime may be pr osecuted proposed 21 usc 865b this analogy to rodriguezmoreno seems likely to have worked the new crime like section 924c in rodriguezmoreno would have two elements crime of violence and simultaneous rela ted drug trafficking offense rodriguezmoreno involved continuing offense many dr ug trafficking offenses are likely to be considered continuing ffenses for venue purposes44 but some may not be it should not matter rodriguezmoreno insists only that the crime may be tried where one of its conduct elements crime of violen ce or drug trafficking crime occur the several of the same bills eg hr 880 representative forbes hr 3150 representative keller hr 3156 rep resentative

reactions 76 hearing at 12 griffey statement 77 hearing at 3940 the procedures proposed fall well short of atkins constitutional minimum and would thus contravene the ei ght amendment the language of proposed 18 usc 3593b4 is not definition at all but rather listing of many of the characteristics of people with mental retardation that the atkins court regarded as justifying categorical bar against the infliction of death upon such defendants in effect this provision would require the jury to redete rmine anew in each case whether the supreme court was correct in atkins when it found that these characteristics of mental retardation justified categorical exemption note that the provision requires the jury to find all of the listed characteristics and that all these ch aracteristics have manifested themselves continuously since some point prior to age 18 in order to exempt defendant on grounds of mental retardation thus defendant with an iq of 70 or below who established for example that he had diminished capacity to understand and process information abstract from mistakes and learn from experience engage in logical reasoning and controlthe evidence72 sixth they would have

proposals in the 109th congress as means of introduc ing consistency into federal practice in the area76 there may be objections however the definition of mental retardation might be thought too narrow to embrace ll those constitutionally protected77 resolutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34163crs17 impulses but who did not establish that he also had diminished capacity to understand others reactions would have failed to estab lish mental retardation and could therefore be executed it can readily be seen that this appr oach fails to protect the entire class of persons with mental retardation and enactment woul d therefore place the federal government in violation of the eighth amendment rule of atkins indeed the whole point of the supreme courts decision in atkins was that each of the acts of moral culpability was too difficult to determine reliable on casebycase basis and the severity of the disability suffered by all persons with mental retardation whose intelle ctual functioning places them by definition in the bottom 23 percent of the population ju stifies categorical banbruck statement 78 id at 41 the procedures to be employed ar also undesirable rather than pretrial judicial determination as occurs with co mpetency to stand trial for example see 18 usc 4241 the bills would wastefully require defendant with mental retardation to go through the entire elaborate structure of capita l trialwith special jury selection procedures bifurcated jury sentencing speci counsel provisions and so fo rth only to establish at the end of the process that he suffered all along from lifelong disability that rendered moot the entire deathpenalty aspect of the proceedi ngs and that could have been determined at the start because mental retardation unlike mental illness is an essentially fixed condition that must have existed prior to age 18 and that does not resolve or dissipate over time it is obviously more efficient and more logical to termine this issue before trial rather than at the end of the proceedings almost all stat statutes implementing mental retardation bars in death penalty proceedings adopt this approach delaying the jurys mental retardation verdict until after the presentation of aggravation evidence is also unfair because it ensures that the jury will not address the relatively st raightforward issues of whether the defendant meets the clinical definition of mental re tardation until it has been overwhelmed with inflammatory information about the defendant s prior record and bad character and with emotionally powerful victim impact evidence just as it has long been thought unfair to present sentencing evidence including eviden ce of prior offenses and bad character to jury before the defendants guilt or innocent has been determined so too is it unfair to delay determination of whether the defendant has th immutable disability of mental retardation until all of the evidence that might make th jury

or withhold deat h to the unfettered discretion of the jury in every case eventually the supreme court may take up the question of whether given capital punishment statute has beco so allinclusive that it fails the basic requirement of furman and gregg that the sentencers discretion be legislatively narrowed and guidedbruck statementto the jury in any event in the case of aggravating circumstances however expressly adding new crimes to the murder plus factor status is significant because the existence of specifically designated ggravating factor is sine qua non for imposition of the penalty the mere presence of catchall aggravating factor is insufficient second the list of deathqualif ying specifically designated aggravating factors is now so close to allencompassing that some special justification may be in order before the list is expanded88 obstruction of justice the creation of new obstruction of justice aggravating factor was common proposal hr 851 representative gohmert hr 1914 representative carter hr 3156 representative lamar smith s 1860 senator cornyn89 the proposal rests on the pre mise that killing witnesses and other participants in the judicial process str ikes at the heart of the system of justice itself90 critics suggest that its breadth threatens to push the federal system to point where it has made all murders capital where the exceptions to the narrowing use of aggravating factors have eliminated any narrowing impact91 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34163crs21 92 18 usc 924j 93 hearing at 18 as currently worded the fa ctor is susceptible to two interpretations which could undermine the clear and consiste nt application of the factor under one interpretation prior conviction for an offe nse involving firearm could constitute an aggravating factor for all capital offenses except those involving firearms an illogical interpretation considering that defendants prior firearm conviction may be relevant when the same defendants later use of firearm has resulted in death the other interpretation would only prohibit basing the aggravating fa ctor on the immediatel yprior section 924j conviction for which the defendant faces the death penalty this second interpretation seems to be the more faithful reading of the statute nevertheless third interpretation possible an earlier firearms conviction unde r any law other than section 924c may be considered as an aggravating factor but s ection 924c conviction may not be used as an aggravating factor regardless whether the conviction is the occasion of the current sentencing proceeding or occurred sometime previously 94 proposed 18 usc 3592c2for any offense other than an offense for which sentence of death is sought on the basis of section 924c the defendant has previously in prior adjudication been convicted of federal or state offense punishable by term of imprisonment of more than 1 year involving the use or attempted or threatened use of firearm as defined in section 921 against another person 95 hearing at 356 the reason congress acted the 924c exclusion in the firearms aggravator 18 usc 3592c2 was to avoid making every firearm killing automatically deatheligible this would otherwise have occurred because the firearms violation that serves as the predicate for the 924j conviction would do doubleduty as prior conviction of prior qualifying firearms offense by removing this exemption now congress would seemingly be making every federal firearms killing deatheligible whether or not it would be otherwise warranted in ot her words there would be requirement that the defendant have any genuinely prior record and without requiring evidence of any otherprevious firearm conviction section 3592c2 now recognizes as statutory aggravating factor the fact that for any offense other than an offense for which sentence of death is sought on the basis of section 924c the defendant has previously been convicted of federal or state offense punishable by term of imprisonment of more than 1 year involving the use or attempted or threatened use of firearm as defined in section 921 against another person emphasis added section 924c provides add itional penalties when defe ndant uses or possesses firearm during and in relation to the co mmission of federal crime of violence or drug trafficking violation is capital offense when in the course of the crime the firearm is used to commit murder92 the italicized portion of section 3593c2 is open to interpretation93 and several proposals would have dropped the language hr 851 representative gohmert hr 3156 representative lamar smith s 1860 senator cornyn one of the bills hr 851 representative gohmert would have amended section 3592c2 further to make it clear that the new provision did not cover the conviction that had resulted in the capital sentencing hearing at issue but only prior adjudications re sulting in firearms conviction94 one critic has argued that in view of the breadth of section 924c the amendment would make an aggravating f actor out of the possession of firearm during any federal crime of violence or dr ug trafficking that ended in murder95httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34163crs22 aggravating factor such as substantial pla nning and premeditation risk to additional persons multiple victims cruelty or torture etc the enactment of 18 usc 924j in 1994 represented potentially enormous expansion in federal jurisdiction over homicide offenses which from the founding of the nation have been primarily matter for state law enforcement the 924c exclusion at least re presented an effort to keep this huge change under some sort of commonsense check by suring that every 924j offense would not automatically become punishable by death in the unfettered discretion of the jury removing this restraint is unwise unnecessary because any truly aggravated 924j killing is already deatheligible under existing law and open to constitutional challenge as impermissibly allinclusive under the two minal supreme court cases governing capital punishment law furman v georgia and gregg v georgia bruck statement 96 cf united states v walker 901

us 803 2005both the fifth circuit and tenth circuit have limited the application of the pecuniary gain aggrav ating factor to situations where the murder itself was committed as consideration for or in the expectation of anything of pecuniary value united states v bernard 299 f3d 467 483 5th cir 2002quoting united states v chanthadara 230 f3d 1237 1263 10th cir 2000 the defendants in bernard carjacked vehicle and robbed the owners drove the vehicle for several hours with the couple in the truck and then murdered the couple the fift h circuit concluded that the motivation for the murders was not pecuniar gain but was instead to prevent the couple from reporting the crime to the police chanthadara argued that 3592c8 was inapplicable because all of the valuable propert in the restaurant had been stolen by the defendant and his accomplices prior to the killing the tenth circuit agreed unlike bernard the evidence in the instant case was suffici ent for the jury to conclude that barnette killed allen in the expectation of the receipt of something of pecuniary value namely allens vehicle united states v roman 371 fs upp2d 36 46 dpr 2005under these facts finding of pecuni ary gain would not involve an extension of existing law jury could properly infer that the murder was committed for the express reason to effect the robbery rather than being incident to or as an afterthought to the robbery 98 hearing at 189 as now interpreted by th courts the pecuniarygain aggravating factor applies when the murder as viewed by the defendant is necessary to initially secure the security gain but does not apply when committe d to maintain possession of stolen gainpecuniary gain section 3592c8 is what might be taken for murderfor hire aggravating factor the defendant committed the offense as consideration for the receipt or in expectation of the receipt of anything of pecuniary value casual reading might suggest that the factor covers murder for hire when the murder is paid either before or after the murder instea d the courts have conc luded that the phrase as consideration for covers the forhire murders and the phrase in expectation of the receipt covers murders from which there is more general anticipated gain96 yet the factor only applies when the murder was motivated by monetary gain it isnot enough that the gain was incidental to or consequence of the murder 97 the justice department has suggested that as now worded the factor is susceptible to uneven application since it does not include instances where the murder is committed to preserve defendants illgotten treasure98 there werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34163crs23 thus for example courts have held the factor to be applicable when carjacking victim is killed at dark intersection before the vehicle is taken but not applicable if the carjacking occurs in public setting and the victim is taken few miles away before he is killed griffey statement 99 proposed 18 usc 3592c17in determinin

hearing at 43 the evident purpose of this provision would be to allow the government to seek jury instruction using this verbiage however instructing capital sentencing jury to avoid any influence of sympathy when choosing between life and death runs grave risk of violating the constitutional requirement of lockett v ohio 438 us 586 1978 and eddings v oklahoma 455 us 104 1982 that the sentencer consider all relevant mitigating evidence before imposing death as punishment i realize that in california v brown 479 us 538 1987 the supreme cour t narrowly upheld rather different instruction not to be swayed by mere sentim ent conjecture sympathy or sympathy however the language proposed here is much more sweeping it is simply impossible to reconcile prohibition of any influence of sympathy with the constitutional directive to consider the kinds of mitigating evidence including horrific childhood abuse or severe mental and physical disabilities which tend to elicit sympathy by their very nature there is reason to push the constitutional envelope in order to help the government persuade jurors to stifle their own sympathetic responses to those compassionate or mitigating factors
