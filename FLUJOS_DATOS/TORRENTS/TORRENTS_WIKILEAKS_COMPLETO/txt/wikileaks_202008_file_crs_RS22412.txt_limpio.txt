obtained under 215 order title i establishes judicial review process for recipients of 215 orders to challenge them the fisa court judge may modify or set aside the 215 order if it does not comply with the statute or is otherwise unlawful however if the judge does not modify or rescind the 215 order then the judge must immediately affirm the order and direct the recipient to comply with it the additional amendments act grants the recipient of 215 order the express right to petition fisa judge to modify or quash the nondisclosure requirement that accompanies such an order such right was not
