military force modern trend in terrorism appears to be toward loosely organized self financed internationa l networks of terrorists increas ingly radical islamist groups or groups using religion as pretext pose serious threat to us interests and to friendly regimes of concern as well is the growing political participation of extremist islamist parties in foreign nations also noteworthy is the apparent growth of crossnational links among different terrorist organizations which may involve combinations of military training funding technology transfer or political advice looming over the entire issue of international terrorism is the specter of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd iran seen as the most active state sponsor of terrorism has been secretly conductin g and now openly seeks uranium enrichment and north korea has both admitted to having clandestine program for uranium enrichment and cla imed to have nuclear weapons indications have also surfaced that qaeda has attempted to acquire chemical biological radiological and nuclear weapons us policy toward international terrorism contains significant military component reflected in us operations in afghanistan deployment of us forces elsewhere for specific missions and according to the administration and its supporters the war in iraq issues of inte rest to the 110th congress include whether the administration is providing sufficient information about the longterm goals and costs of its diverse strategy and whether military force is an optimally effective anti terrorism instrument when compared w ith other methods such as intelligence enhanced law enforcement nd proactive public diplomacy increasingly wide range of wellf unded charitable and publicity activities of radical islamist groups has d to broadened acceptance of extremist views in target populations to the extent that nations fa il to effectively addr ess this cold war of ideology growing proportion of the worlds moslem youth may grow up embracing extremist views that could ultimately lead to increased terrorism as terrorism is global phenomenon ma jor challenge facing policymakers is how to maximize international c ooperation and support without unduly compromising important us national security interests and options other significant policy challenges include 1 how to minimize the economic and civil liberties costs of an enhancedtightened security environment and 2 how to combat incitement to terrorism especially in inst ances where such activ ity is state sponsored or countenanced this repor t will be

the war on terrorism the administrations response to th september 11 2001 events was swift wideranging and decisive after adminis tration officials attributed responsibility for the attack to osama bin laden and the qaeda organization there was an announced policy shift from deterrence to pr eemption generally referred to as the bush doctrine1 given the potentially catastr ophic consequences of terrorist attacks employing weapons of mass destruction wmd administration decisionmakers felt that the united states could not afford to sit back wait for attacks to occur and then respond the nation was mobilized combating terro rism and crippling qaeda became top national priorities preemptive use of military force against foreign terrorist groups and infrastructure gained increas ing acceptance in administration policy circles fullscale campaign was launche d using all elements of national and international power to go after qaed and its affiliates nd support structures the campaign involved rallying the inte rnational community especially law enforcement and intelligence components to shut down qaeda cells and financial networks us military operation wa s initiated in early october 2001 against the taliban regime which had harbored qaeda since 1996 and against qaeda strongholds in afghanistan total of 136 countries offered range of military assistance to the united states includi ng overflight and landing rights and accommodations for us forces as result the taliban was removed from power all known qaeda training sites were destroyed and number of taliban and qaeda leaders were killed or detained since then according to president bush in his address to the nation on may 1 2003 nearly half of the known qaeda leadership has been captured or killed notwithstanding top qaeda leaders ama bin laden and ayman zawahiri as well as the taliban leader mullah mohammed omar apparently remain at large and resurgence of taliban warlords and militia is reportedly occurring in

report are provided by the national counter terrorism center nctc19 the analysis addresses trends in terrorism and the evolving nature of the terrorist threat and presents information on antiterror c ooperation by nations worldwide the report and underlying data portray threat from radical jihadists which is becoming more widespread diffuse possibly more deadly and increasingly homegrown often with lack of appare nt formal operational connection with qaeda ideological leaders although perhaps inspired by them or assisted through training related to the issue of homegrown terrorism is growing concern that limited terrorist sanctuaries may already be found within the cities of democratic societieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33600crs6 20 smallscale decentralized operatives or groups 21

preceding years the report cites iran as the most active state supporter of terrorism and states that its islamic revolutionary guard corps and ministry of intelligence and security were directly involved in the planning and execution of terrorist acts that included providing lebanese hezbollah and palestinian terrorist groups with extensive funding training and weapons the revolutionary guar d it is asserted was increasingly involved in supplying lethal assistance to iraqi milita nt groups with the effect of destabilizing iraq also addressed was irans continued developmen t of nuclear program and that iran is also continuedthree trends in terrorism are identified in the department of state report first is the emergence of socalled micro actors20 spurred in part by us and allied successes in isolating and killing much of qaedas leadership the result is an qaeda perceived as having more s ubdued operational role but assuming more of an ideological motivational and pr opaganda role second is trend toward sophistication ie terrorists exploitin g the global interchange of information finance and ideas to their benefit ofte n through the internet third is growing overlap between terrorist activity and international crime which may expose the terrorists to broad range of law enforcement activities also cited in the report is an overall increase in suicide bombings and strong connection between the ongoing unrest in iraq and the broader terro rism conflict the report suggests that terror incidents in ir aq accounted for almost third of all terror incidents in 2005 and more than half of terror related d eaths worldwide that year data released by the nctc concomitan tly with the depar tment of states 2006 terror report indicate that in 2005 roughl 40000 individuals were wounded or killed in terrorist incidents as compared to 9300 the previous year and 4271 in 2003 terrorrelated deaths in 2005 numbered 14602 as compared to 1907 deaths in 2004 and 625 in 2003 the report placed the number of total reported rrorist attacks in 2005 at 11111 as compared to 3168 in 2004 and 208 in 2003 foiled attacks are not included in the data reported some would argue however that nctc data concerning iraq casualties which are largely the product of sectaria n violence rampant criminal activity and home grown insurgency grossly distort the global terrorism picture and perhaps should not be attributed to terrorist activ ity looking at the data outside of iraq according to the nctc the total number of incidents with ten or more deaths remained at approximately the 20032004 vel 70 per year this suggests that excluding iraq the number of higher casualty terror attacks remains relatively stable aside from iran and perhaps to some degree syria the report suggests that but for few notable exceptions active stat sponsorship of terror is declining21 it continues to list iran as the most active stat sponsor of terrorism 22 in general

report does not specifically address growing concerns among some experts that iran might use surrogate organizations with broad networks eg hezbo llah as delivery vehicles for dirty bombs for the

report tends to mute criticism of nations of strategic importance to the united states such as pakistan and saudi arabia that arguably could do much more to curb terror echoing language of previous years versions of the report the 2006 edition states that libya and sudan continued to take significan t steps to cooperate in the global war on terror and shortly after the reports release libya was removed from the us list of state sponsor s of international terrorism23 as in previous years syria is cited for providing political and mate rial support presumably weapons to both hezbollah and pales tinian terrorist groups which so enjoy sanctuary in syria cuba and north korea are primarily cited for lack of antiterror cooperation and past involvement in terrorist incidents thereby possibly suggesting trend of their less active support for terrorism than in pr evious decades however many perceive north koreas nuclear program with its potential for future sales of wmd to terrorists as extremely worrisome although not included on the state depa rtments list of state sponsors of terrorism lebanon is cited in the report for its recognition of several terrorist organizations including hezbollah also the report stresses that because the government of lebanon does not exercise ffective control over areas in the south and in palestinian refugee camps terrorists can operate relative freely in such areas this loss of governmental contro l is representative of broader phenomenon that countries with weak c ounterterrorism resources and infrastructure are more and more subject to becoming sanctuaries for terrorism active suppo rter of terrorismpassive or less active supporter of terrorism iran syria cuba north korea sudan source congressional research service based on data

raphael perla core premise of the state depar tments 2006 report is recognition that because the qaeda network is increasingly assuming the characteristics of an ideological movement it will not be decisively defeated in the near future however some indicate elimination of bin laden and zawahiri would go long way in that direction as in any longterm campaig n international coope ration and capacity building programs such as the state departments antiterrorism assistance program ata are seen as having central role in combating terrorism most terrorist acts do not take place in the united states nor do most terrorrelated arrests and prosecutions likewise much if not most intelligence gathering on terrorist groups today is not done by the united states the report also presents countering terrorism on the economic front as an important component of ccessful strategy however some independent analysts suggest that efforts to curb terrorist finances have reached point of d iminishing returns as terrorist groups are often sel fsupporting and that the amount of terrorist funds governments seize is insignificant subsequent to the release of the state departments report the administration declassified and released excerpts from an april 2006 national intelligence estimate titled trends in global terrorism imp lications for the united state s declassified key judgments of the report we re generally consistent with findings in the state departments march 2006 country reports on terrorism 2005 and concomitant nctc data which cited decentralization of qaeda and expressed concern over the potential for spillove r of battlefield skills t echnology and ordnance from iraq24 of concern to many observers is the overall growth in numbers and political influence of radical islamist political par ties throughout the world some of which reportedly serve or might serve as fr onts for terrorist activity even if the parties are not actively serving as fronts some are concerned that the actions and agendas of such groups coul d facilitate creation of po litical climate in their home countries which views terrorism as po litically acceptable tac tic and which might make their home countries appear as attr active locations for active terro rist groups to establish secure bases others view political participation as sign that these groups may be adopting channels other than violence to secure their base examples include gr oups in i ndonesia pakistan malaysia and in the middle east notably hamas and hezbollah any ri in the power and influence of such

unrelated to support for international terrorism generally us antiterrorism polic from the late 1970s to the mid1990s focused on deterring and punishing state sponsors as opposed to terrorist groups

face conflictin g goals and courses of acti on 1 providing security from terrorist acts that is limiting the freedom of individual terrorists terrorist groups and support networks to operate unimpeded in relatively unregulated environment versus 2 maintaining i ndividual freedoms democracy and human rights efforts to combat terrorism are complicated by global trend towards deregulation open borders nd expanded commerce in democracies such as the united states the constitutional limits within which policy must operate are viewed by some to conflict directly with desi re to secure the lives of citizens more effectively against terrorist activity majority however strongly holds that compromise of constitutional rights is acceptable another challenge for policymakers is the need to identify the perpetrators of particular terrorist acts as well as t hose who train fund or otherwise support or sponsor them as the international comm unity increasingly demonstrates its ability to unite and apply sanctions against rogue states states will become less likely to overtly s upport terrori st groups or engage in statesponsored terrorism the possibility of covert provisioning of w eapons financing and logistical support remains open and det ecting such transfers would require significantly increased deployment of us intelligence and law forcement assets in countries and zones where terrorists operate particularly challenging is identification of those dual use items which might creatively be adapted for militarytype applications and therefore should be subject to us export restrictions32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33600crs11 33 see also crs report rl32759 qaeda statements and evolving ideology by christopher m blanchardtoday the us policy focus is on terrori st organizations such as qaeda and affiliated networks and state supporters33 but in the future the recent phenomenon of new types of terrorists appears likely to continue individuals who are not affiliated with any established terrorist organization and who are apparently not agents of any state sponsor the terrorist ramzi ah med yousef who is believed to have masterminded the 1993 world trade center bombing apparently did not belong to any larger established and previously id entified group althoug h he may have had some ties to qaeda operatives als should organizational infrastructure of groups such as qaeda continue to be disrupted the threat of individual or boutique terrorism or that of spontane ous terrorist activity such as the bombing of bookstores in the united states after ay atollah khomeinis death edict against british author salman rushdie may well increase thus one profile for the terrorist of the 21st century may be that of private individuals not affiliated with any established group but drawing on other similarlyminded individuals for support as the central focus of us international counterterrorism policy is currently on st ate sponsors and terrorist groups some adjustments in policies and approaches may wa rrant consideration another problem surfacing in the wake of number of incidents associated with islamist fundamentalist groups is how to condemn and combat such terrorist activity as well as the extreme and violent ideo logy of specific radical groups without appearing to be antiislamic in general also the desire to punish state for supporting international terro rism may conflict with ot her foreign policy objectives involving that nation which might require more positive engagement us policy tools to combat international terrorism diplomacyconstructive engagement use of diplomacy to help create global antiterror coalition is central component of the bush administration response to september 11 events for example diplomacy was key factor leading to the composition of the usled coalition against the taliban notwithstanding some suggest that the administration fartoolong undervalued diplomacy and that its ability to conduct effective diplomacy has been weakened by its nonmultilateral positions on host of international issues moreover diplomacy may not always be effective against determined

and organizations known to be affiliated with bin ladens network giving the secretary of the tr easury broad powers to impose sanctions on banks around the world that provide these tities access to the inte rnational financial system and providing for designation of additional entities as terrorist organizations by late october 2002 according to the u s treasury department the freeze list had expanded to include designated terro rist groups supporters and financiers of terror in addition on september 28 2001 the security council adopted resolution 1373 which requires all states to limit the ability of terrorists and terrorist organizations to operate internationally by freezing their assets and denying them safe haven the security council also set up counter terrorism committee to oversee implementation of resolution 1373 security council resolution 1390 of january 16 2002 obligated member st ates to freeze funds of individuals groups undertakings and entities associated with the taliban and qaeda as of september 11 2003 in the range of 200 million in terrorist funds had been frozen worldwide as result of these initiatives acco rding to us and u n financial data41 the effects of these economic measures are uncertain because much of the flow of terrorist funds reportedly takes place outside formal ba nking channels in elusive hawala chains of money brokers moreover much if not most of the assets were frozen relatively early on with very little being frozen subsequently raising the issue of whether such countermeasur have peaked and lost their sting furthermore

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33600crs16 economic inducements economic inducements can arguably play powerful role in the levels of anti terror cooperation when nation states are the recipients of such inducements moreover counterterrorism policy can include efforts to change economic and social conditions that provide breeding ground for terrorists some have suggested that most terrorists worldwide are unemplo yed or underemployed with virtually nonexistent prospects for economic advan cement some analysts believe that targeted assistance programs to reduce poverty and increase education which might also include supporting secular educational alternatives to the madrasas islamic religious schools can bring stability to weak countries make difference in lifestyles and attitudes and can diminish the appeal of extremist groups further rationale some say is to project more positive image of the united states in terrorismprone lands critics though argue that severe economic conditions are not the sole or even the main motivational factors driving the emergence of terrorism stressing that resentment against particul ar country or political orde r and religious fanaticism also are important motivations osama bi n ladens large personal fortune and his farflung business empire would seem to contradict economic deprivation as explanation of his involvement in terrorism similarly all of the 15 saudi arabian hijackers implicated in the september 11 attacks were from middleclass families or wellconnected ones the basque father land and liberty organization eta in spain is relatively wellheeled terrorist organization ambient economic conditions partly explain certain kinds of terrori st behavior in specific situations but political ideological and religious fact ors may often be paramount covert action intelligence gathering infiltration of terrorist groups and military operations involve variety of clandestin or covert activities much of this activity is of passive monitoring nature aimed at determining the intentions capabilities and vulnerabilities of terrorist organizations an active form of covert activity occurs during events such as hostage crisis or hijacking when foreign country may quietly request advice equipm ent technical or tactical support with public credit given to the providing country covert ac tion may also seek to create or exploit vulnerabilities of terrorist organizations for example by spreading disinformation about leaders encouraging defections promoting divisions between factions or exploiting conflicts between organizations some nations have peri odically resorted to unc onventional methods beyond their territory for the express purpose of neutralizing individual terrorists andor thwarting preplanned attacks examples of such methods might run the gamut from intercepting or sabotaging the delivery of funding or wea pons to terrorist group to destroying terrorists embryonic wm d production

cooperation in such areas as law enforcement customs control and intelligence activities is an essential pillar of the bush administrations antiterrorism policy for example the stationing of fbi agents overseas in some 50 countries facilitates i nvestigations of terrorist cr imes and augments the flow of intelligence about terrorist group structur and membership similarly dea currently maintains offices in 62 countries staffed by some 750 di rect hire personnel and 260 contract personnel an important law enforcement tool in combating international terrorism is extradition of terrorist suspects however international extradition traditionally has been subject to several limitations includi ng the refusal of some countries to extradite for political or extraterritorial offenses or to extradite their own nationals also the us application of the death penalty for certain crimes can impede extradition from countries that have abolis hed the death penalty in terrorismrelated cases this reportedly led us authorities to increasingly use the controversial practice of extrajudicial tran sfer referred to as renditi on whereby country will hand over terrorist suspect to us authorities without going through formal extradition procedures should they be available48 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33600crs18 49 note that it might be argued that this prac tice

united states has been negotiating and concluding tr eaties with fewer limitations in part as means of facilita ting the transfer of wanted terrorists because much terrorism involves politi cally

combating terrorism in the long term by strengthening the ideological component in the war on terror inherent here is widespread recognition that the united states will need to increasingly engage in th realm of ideas public diplomacy in conjunction with other efforts to protect and defend the homeland and efforts to attack terrorists and reduce their capabilities in september 2006 an updated version of the national strategy for combating terrorism was released the 2006 strategy document gives adde d weight to earlier efforts aimed towards placing enhanced longterm policy emphasis on the war of ideas ie confronting the radical ideology that justifies the use of violence against innocents in the name of religion62 seen as core to the success of the strategy in the long run is the advancement of effective democracies which is seen as central to minimizing conditions which fuel rrorist support and recruitment two assumptions would appear to underlie the reasoning upon which the countering ideological support component of the strategy is based 1 that it is indeed realistically possible for the united states to advance effective democracies in regions where political compromise and respect for minority rights may not be established cultural political or religious norms and 2 that terrorist causes are less likely to win recruits in democratic societies andor that individual terrorists and terrorist organizations will be less likely to recruit operate andor base in societies where protection of individual liberties is strong both assumptions are subject to

international community some terrorist acts likely will succeed since the timing location and nature of all future terrorist attacks are impossible to predict much is to be said for programs which promote development of robust response capabilities in the area of disastercrisis consequence management including traini ng of first responders due to the enormous cost of antiterror effo rts and the

that some suggest that the issue of developing alternative sources of energy may warrant fresh examination within the st rategic context of the global war on terror arguably united states dependence on fossil fuels as an energy source severely limits the nations ability to disengage or distance itself from oilrich regimes in the middle east number of which arguably have dismal human rights records and are plagued by endemic corruption on the other hand most acknowle dge that weaning the nation from its current dependence on oil even if costeffective alternative sources of energy were to be discovered andor developed would prove to be lengthy and technologically challenging process as current industrial nations infrast ructure is closely tied to fossil fuel and petrochemical technologies public diplomacy the issue of further reforming or enha ncing programs that engage in public diplomacy may warrant consideration as well75 the ideological nature of much of modernday terrorism implies that the battle for hearts and minds is not just cliché but is an ongoing struggle which the u s arguably is not currently winning76 on the other hand some argue that to the gree united states public diplomacy efforts may be ineffective cause s hould not be attributed to th governments organizational structure nor its strategy or policy imple mentation rather they suggest that the cause for any such shortcomings is likely that what the us government says does not match what it does that us foreign policy is undermining efforts at us public diplomacy they cite the fact that the united states is strongly committed to promoting democracy and human rights yet supports regimes in pakistan saudi arabia and egypt where arguably government respect for such values could be dramatically improved77 moreover some suggest that while us public diplomacy resources are consolidating they are not expanding the former us information agency with its overseas element the us information rvice has been subsumed into the us department of state thereby losing so independence of action although some would argue gaining policy consistency the shortlived strategic information initiative public diplomacy project unched by the department of defense foundered due in part to dverse public opinion concerning its mission and to lack of active support from the other agencies with which it competed the wellfunded charitable activities nd publicity efforts of terrorist or extremist groups appear to have led to broadened accepta nce of extremist views in target populations

cold war of ideology growing proportion of the worlds moslem youth may grow up embracing extremist views which could ultimately lead to increased terrorism for decades the us may have had little need for public diplomacy to promote its positive image of freedom and democracy the term propaganda was used derisively to describe pub licity efforts by countries hostile to the united states however the worlds demographics economics and political alliances are evolving extremist views are being disseminated to the youth of countries with high birth rates some of the count ries facilitating dissemination of these views and those receiving them control vast financial resources derived from oil revenues that could be used to influence public opinion on large scale for good or evil the resources currently allocated for us public diplomacy pale in comparison the american publics reaction to an information outreach public diplomacy or propaganda response to counter or refu hostile ideological efforts may depend upon how us initiatives are presented or packaged for instance radio free europe and radio marti were generally accepted while the strategic information initiative sii was not whether correct or not perception widely perceived was that dod has little credibility in winning hearts and minds moreover the strategic information initiative was viewed by critics as disinformation activity rather than traditional public diplomacy to counter informationbased activities by radical islamist groups congress and the bush administration have created us governmentsponsored arabic language middle east television network metn or alhurra arabic for the free one to broaden us public diplomacy effort s in the middle east supporters of this initiative have asserted that there is receptive audience for us television which could counterbalance negativ perceptions of us policy that are commonly found in the arab media according to the 911 commission report in 2004 the government has begun some promising initiatives in television and radio broadcasting to the arab world iran and afghanistan notw ithstanding more data are required to evaluate the effectiveness of such programming effort s to date for fy2006 the administration has requested 79 million figure that in corporates operations for the alhurra satellite television ne twork and the us

radical groups as is often the case with organized crime which has increasingly turned to legitimacy while retaining sinister underpinnings terrori sm has long since become process or pipeline and its eradication is goal wh ich may not be achievable for many years if ever thus us antiterror policy increasingly embraces longterm strategy to engage the process of terrorism on many fronts to slow its

whether and to what degree the us department of state currently has the charter the knowledge the infrastructure the funding or the personnel to effectively fight the cold war of ideology at appropriate levels of effort for example some have called for revivi ng the united states information agency usia or creation of an entity whic h would only do public diplomacy without strings attached as might be the case with the department of state or the defense department from purely standpoint of existing funding however the department of defense or the cia may be better equipped for such mission which goes beyond traditional diplomacy but on the other hand to the extent that public diplomacy is associated with or linked to defense or intelligence agencies it would be perceived as

orourke though the definition of terrorism may appear essentially political issue it can carry significant legal implicationsappendix defining terrorism81 there is universally accepted definiti on of international terrorism one definition widely used in us government ci rcles and incorporated into law defines international terrorism as terrorism involving the c itizens or property of more than one country terrorism is broadly defined as politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational gr oups or clandestine agents for example kidnaping of us birdwatche rs or bombing of usowned oil pipelines by leftist guerrillas in colombia would qualify as international terrorism terrorist group is defined as group which practices or which has significant subgroups which practice terrorism 22 usc 2656f one shortfall of this traditional finition is its focus on groups and its exclusion of individual lone wolf terrorist activity philosophically but not organizationally aligned with any group which has recently risen in frequency and visibility82 to these standard definitions whic h refer to violence in traditional form must be added cyberterrorism analysts warn that terrorist acts will now include more sophisticated fo rms of destruction and exto rtion such as disabling national computer infrastruct ure or penetrating vital co mmercial computer systems83 also the october 12 2000 bombing of the uss cole us military vessel raised issues of whether the standard definition w ould categorize this attack as terrorist as the cole would not under conventional definitions be considered non combatant84 current definitions of terrorism mostly share one common element politically motivated behavior although religious mo tivation is increasingly being recognized as an important motivating factor as hi ghprofile activities of such groups as qaeda underscore the significan ce of radical religious ideologies in driving terrorist violence or at least providing pretext to illustrate osama bin laden issued ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33600crs32 85 http wwwictorg ilarticlesfatwahhtm 86 httpuntreatyunorgenglishterrorismaspfatwah edict in 1998 proclaiming in effect that all those who be lieve in allah and his prophet muhammad must kill amer icans wherever they find them85 moreover the growth of international and transnational criminal organizations plus the growing range and scale of such operations have resulte d in potential for widespread criminal violence with fina ncial profit as the driving motivation notwithstanding current definitions of rrorism do not include using violence for financial profit even in cases where mass casualties might result with entire populations terrorized complicating matters is that internationally nations and organizations historically have been unable to agree on definition of terrorism since one persons terrorist is often another pe rsons freedom fighter to circumvent this political constraint countries have taken the approach of acting laws or negotiating conventions which criminaliz specific acts such as ki dnaping detonating bombs or hijacking airplanes the 1999 internati onal convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism comes close to consensus definition by making it crime to collect or provide funds with th intent of killing or injuring civ ilians where the purpose is to intimidate population or coerce government86
