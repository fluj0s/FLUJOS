prevailing wage standards william g whittaker specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division summary through the past century many states have adopted and sometimes repealed protective statutes which inter alia have required contractors doing work for state to observe basic labor standards notably payment of not less than the locally prevailing wage varying from one statute and jurisdiction to another these laws are intended to stabilize both the earnings of workers and the general structure of industry in 1931 the federal government followed in the same path adopting the davis bacon act which affects federal contract construction in much the same way the little davisbacon acts affect contract construction undertaken for the states this report introduces the state prevailing wage laws and provides an inventory of states in which to varying degrees they are in effect it will be updated annually development of prevailing wage standards responding both to the perception of irregularities within public contracting and of abuse of workers engaged in public work many states have adopted statutes that are intended to help stabilize the industry protect workers and bring order to the public contracting process these state statutes provided foundation from which the authors of the federal davisbacon act would draw in some respects they continue to provide laboratory in which prevailing wage policies are tested the pros and cons of such labor standards requirements are they still needed are they inflationary can they be fairly enforced etc continue to be debated both at the state and federal levels the development of state prevailing wage acts observed university of wisconsin economist david johnson can be divided into two periods pre and postdavisbacon in 1891 kansas adopted the first state statute designed to preserve prevailing labor standards in state contract work other states followed suit and before 1931 six states congressional research service the library of congress crs2 had adopted legislation dealing with states with prevailing wage laws prior to 1931 this issue they tended to focus included kansas 1891 new york 1897 upon hours of work per diem wages idaho 1911 arizona 1912 new jersey and to larger degree than later 1913 and massachusetts 1914 enactments upon the fair treatment of workers for laws passed after 1931 however there appears to have been greater emphasis upon the stabilization of industry and of the community an outgrowth of the depression1 the architects of the davisbacon act 1931 pointed to internal industry problems to itinerant contractors from beyond the area of construction often dubbed flybynight firms such contractors it was charged carried with them crew of lowwage non resident labor that worked under adverse conditions and in that manner competed unfairly with local companies and retarded the economic recovery in targeted locality2 federal contracting policy of that period required that public contracts be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder with responsible narrowly defined3 after 1931 johnson concludes state prevailing wage laws had their origins in the depression and were designed to protect labor standards from cost cutting pressures attendant upon competitive bidding they were far more than just laborprotective measures however4 state prevailing wage statutes differ from each other and for the most part from the federal davisbacon act some of the early laws have been repealed or have been found unconstitutional some have been replaced in modified form coverage varies widely from broad generic concept of public works to narrow application to segment of public work for example to highways or to school facilities dollar volume thresholds for coverage also differ from statetostate some state acts apply to general contractors others to subcontractors as well not all craft and skill classifications are treated in precisely the same manner concepts locality or prevailing wage for example differ among the statutes as to their enforcement and recordkeeping requirements where state prevailing wage laws are in place they operate alongside the federal davisbacon 1 on the early prevailing wage statutes see david b johnson prevailing wage legislation in the states monthly labor review aug 1961 p 840 hereafter cited as johnson prevailing wage legislation while state statutes shared certain similarities they were also widely diverse both in detail and thrust 2 see crs report 94408 the davisbacon act institutional evolution and public policy by william g whittaker though early versions of the davisbacon legislation had been introduced in the late 1920s the 1931 measure was presented as an emergency antidepression bill and was strongly backed by the hoover administration 3 during the 1920s and 1930s industry had become concerned about unfair competition from firms it regarded as irresponsible and unable to make good on contract commitments some firms it was alleged would bid low and once awarded federal contract would shop for sub contractors who in the depressed state of the general economy were willing to accept work and to provide workers at progressively lower rates see for example g f schlesinger responsibility as prerequisite the constructor aug 1928 pp 2425 5561 horst accomplishments in cooperation elimination of irresponsibility marks progress of the industry the constructor nov 1929 pp 2830 56 and st john cooperation eliminating irresponsibility the constructor apr 1930 pp 3536 4 johnson prevailing wage legislation pp 840 and 842 crs3 act to the extent that coverage state and federal may overlap the higher standard normally prevails5 impacts of state prevailing wage laws as with the federal davisbacon act the little davisbacon acts have been focus of controversy6 critics argue among other things that they are burdensome for employers costly to enforce inflate the cost of construction and are basically unnecessary with the fair labor standards minimum wage act of 1938 in place defenders of the acts contend that they serve to stabilize the construction industry protect workers and the industry from cutthroat employers promote skills transfer through apprenticeship training and have increasingly opened new fields to minority and women workers defenders would argue that the prevailing wage requirements help to assure higher quality of public work given the often lowbid mandate in public contracting but critics argue that private sector construction is every bit as good as public construction even though the prevailing wage statutes do not apply to the private sector the debate is circular with counter arguments for each assertion pro and armand thieblot marylandbased management specialist and longtime critic of prevailing wage statutes argues that the absence of such statutes has little effect on unionization in the industry or on individuals wages he notes that in the private construction market where prevailing wage laws are not an issue union contractors not only are able to participate but remain the major force in such sectors of construction as large office buildings and major industrial construction he concedes however that wage differential between union and open shop firms has undoubtedly cut into their the union firms market share he affirms however that states without prevailing wage law still manage to retain adequate construction work forces thieblot concludes all state prevailing wage laws subject contractors to risks and to the possibility of civil or criminal prosecution for carrying out their businesses in ways which are perfectly acceptable to all other purchasers of construction except governments and government agencies all of them tend to make buildings and projects more expensive and give governments less value for their construction dollar than private person would receive all of them tend to use the contracting mechanism as hidden conduit for income transfers from taxpayers to construction workers 5 in general see little davisbacon acts state of the states washington center to protect

preliminary evaluation of its impact on the state construction industry labor studies journal fall 1990 pp 1731 crs4 thieblot who has appeared before committees of the congress in opposition to the davis bacon act counsels that by interfering with the free market prevailing wage laws insure that wage inflation in the construction industry will outpace that in other fields7 others argue fervently in support of such legislation peter philips and team from the university of utah have investigated the implications of repealing the little davis bacon acts and have come to conclusions different from those of professor thieblot whether prevailing wage laws are wise public policy can be disputed but the original purpose of such legislation was not to find the cheapest possible labor but rather to sustain local standards to prevent the government from hiring labor at belowstandard rates repeal they found using utah as case study resulted in lowered construction wages but also in loss of tax revenues and increasing project cost overruns these they explain are part of the hidden cost of the repeal of prevailing wage laws in utah cost overruns resulted from an overheated bidding process in which contractors shaved their bids in an urgent effort to obtain government contracts after the repeal winning bids on state jobs came in lower than ever before having underbid jobs contractors and subcontractors would arrange change orders to get the jobs done or simply walk away from badly underbid jobs and leave the state to pick up the pieces8 such irresponsible practices had been an industry concern in the late 1920s and seem to have contributed to enactment of davisbacon9 in addition the utah team pointed to such issues as lessskilled labor force because of reduced training opportunities in the absence of davisbacon or little davisbacon requirements with subsequent skills and manpower shortages they refer as well to slowed economic gains by minority workers and to increased workrelated injury rates the construction industry is turbulent they state and characterized by perennial boombust cycle with fleeting relationships they conclude the construction labor market has traditionally been tempered by prevailing wage legislation and labor unions absent these institutions it is unclear how or whether the market will regularly and carefully train workers or assure safety and health on the job site or provide training opportunities for minority workers or offer the incomes needed to make construction an attractive career these hidden costs loss of human capital and career jobs in this industry they observe do not appear as an entry in the ledgers of any single contractor but if not part of projects direct cost they argue they are costs nonetheless10
