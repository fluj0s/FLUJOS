the camp to sell gold he would have been made aware of it through the normal chain of command 86 the d company officer was further informed th at number of witnesses reported seeing member state 1 troops greeting ik01 and his group like countrymen when they arrived at mongbwalu airfield in response t he d company officer stated that the member state 1 army was very friendly and hospitabl and this could explain the observations made by the witnesses at the airfield 87 idoios also informed the d company officer t hat it has been alleged that on 1 december 2005 an aircraft carrying ik01 and numb er of other persons arrived in mongbwalu and were greeted as old friends by memb ers of the member state 1 military in addition it had also been alleged that the grou p was driven from the

of the flight and repeated that it was impossible for the group to have been transported to or from the irfield in military vehicles in 20 response to the fact that the flight had not been r ecorded in the civil flight register the d company officer stated that in some cases the deta ils of the flights were recorded on pieces of paper and then entered in the civil flight regis ter when the troops who met the aircraft returned to the camp according to him it was pos sible that they had simply neglected to enter the details in the register 88 the d company officer was asked to detail the circumstances under which it would be permissible to carry civilians in milita ry vehicles he stated that from time to time they might be asked to convey civilians in vehicles but this had to be at the direction of brigade headquarters he did not have the authority to authorize the transport of nonun personnel in military vehicles vi findings 89 idoios interviewed several persons during the course of this investigation witnesses reported seeing ik01 and his group in mon gbwalu on numerous dates between september and december 2005 idoios reviewed hote l records and flight manifests to establish the dates that ik01 visited mongbwalu d espite the wide range of dates proffered by witnesses idoios could only establish the pres ence of the group in mongbwalu from 12 to 17 november 2005 and on 1 december 2005 90 idoios found that ik01 his ik02 ik03 gold specialist and fardc officer 1 arrived in mongbwalu on an airline 1 fli ght on 12 november 2005 ik01 informed idoios that he did not have the authoriza tions required to purchase gold until february 2006 and the purpose of the november 2005 visit was to examine extraction methods and assess the viability of establishing gold business in the region despite ik01s denials it was common knowledge amongst the residents of mongbwalu that the group was in town to purchase gold three witnesse s confirmed to idoios they had conversations with members of the ik01 group who s aid they were in town to purchase as much gold as possible idoios concludes that give n the evidence set forth in this report ik01 and his group were in mongbwalu between 12 and 17 november 2005 and purchased quantity of unwrought gold from unknown persons 91 the relationship between the member state 1 pea cekeepers and the ik01 group was an important focus of the idoios investigation there is significant evidence to suggest there was familiarity between the two gro ups that belied the versions provided by ik01 and the d company officer the pilot of the airline 1 flight described the encounter between the men at mongbwalu airfield as resembling meeting between countrymen other witnesses reported seeing the group driven th rough town in vehicles or in convoy of vehicles w05 described the ik01 grou p being escorted by member state 1 military and going into local gold shop where the peacekeepers appeared to provide security some witnesses including personnel em ployed at the member state 1 battalion camp attested to ik01 being at the camp on regular basis during this period consuming meals in the officers mess and socializi ng with member state 1 military personnel 21 92 the apparent familiarity between member state 1 military forces and the ik01 group was corroborated by w09 person intimately involved in the 1 december 2005 flight to mongbwalu w09 advised the investigators the two groups greeted each other as if they were old friends and that member state 1 troop s conveyed them from the airfield in vehicles idoios regard w09 as credible witn ess and accepts his evidence that ik01 was in possession of significant amount of united states currency when the aircraft landed in mongbwalu given these observations by several witnesses and the false denials of the d company officer idoios concludes that member state 1 peacekeepers must have provided security and logistical support to the ik0 1 group during their november 2005 visit to mongbwalu 93 idoios also established that the details of th is flight were not entered in the civil aircraft register maintained by the men of d comp any one might consider this omission as an administrative oversight but give n the circumstances in particular the support and security provided by some member state 1 battalion personnel to the ik01 group idoios considers it more likely that it was deliberate coverup of this groups arrival in mongbwalu whose mission was to purchase gold 94 the background of ik01 was also an issue explor ed by idoios information held by congolese intelligence officials suggested that ik01 was suspected of illegally trafficking diamonds and gold in eastern drc whil st the probative value of this information is questionable ik01 admitted that he had been involved in failed bid to export nine kilograms of congolese gold through rwa nda to the united arab emirates in april 2006 ik01 also admitted that he bribed nu mber of congolese government officials to obtain apparently legitimate export documentatio n to avoid us25000 government charges these admissions prove ik01s status as n illicit trafficker of unwrought gold 95 idoios is satisfied that members of the fardc assisted the ik01 group at various stages during their trips to mongbwalu th is was confirmed by several witnesses who reported seeing members of the fardc in their c ompany in bunia mongbwalu and goma this assistance included traveling in vehicl with the ik01 group during their november 2005 visit to mongbwalu and intervening on their behalf when they were detained at bunia airport on 1 december 2005 desp ite his denials idoios considers it reasonable to accept that fardc officer 1 traveled with the group into mongbwalu on 12 november 2005 idoios was able to confirm that far dc officer 1 is on the personal staff of fardc senior officer 1 one witness infor med investigators that an officer of the fardc accompanied them on the flight from bunia an d on arrival in goma they were met by fardc officer 3 idoios established that fardc officer 3 was also member of fardc senior officer 1s personal staff 96 the relationship between the ik01 group and the fardc becomes relevant when examining the circumstances surrounding the authori zation of the mop forms for ik01 and ik02 ik01 informed investigators that after becom ing stranded in mongbwalu he contacted fardc senior officer 2 and asked for assi stance fardc officer 2 corroborated this account when he advised idoios t hat he prepared and signed the mops at the direction of fardc senior officer 2 for hi s part fardc senior officer 2 22 explained he was asked by fardc senior officer 1 to provide assistance to ik01 but denied providing such assistance idoios adduced sufficient evidence that senior members of the fardc provided considerable support to ik01 and his group during their forays into mongbwalu this support included arran ging the issue of the mop forms for the 17 november 2005 flight from mongbwalu to bunia i doios found evidence to suggest the existence of an inappropriate relations hip between the fardc and members of the member state 1 military 97 the d company officer admitted speaking to ik 01 at mongbwalu airfield on 17 november 2005 but denied any other contact but on witness reported seeing the d company officer and ik01 conversing at the camp and dining together at the officers mess the d company officer stated to the idoios that it was impossible for ik01 to have slept at the camp consumed meals in the officers mess or ridden in military vehicles without his knowledge idoios considers that even if the d company officer had direct involvement with ik01 his position as compa ny commander placed an obligation on him to remain informed of activities of his subordi nates in the circumstances of this case it is difficult to rule out that the d company offic er would not have been aware of the assistance his troops had provided to ik01 and his group 98 in the absence of corroborative evidence idoios c ould not substantiate the allegation that member state 1 peacekeepers deploye d to mongbwalu had supplied weapons or ammunition to officer 1 and officer 2 of the armed group 1 vii conclusions 99 idoios established that member state 1 peaceke epers deployed to mongbwalu provided transport meals and security for the ik01 group during their visits to mongbwalu in november and december 2005 during these visits ik01 purchased significant quantities of unwrought gold without the appropriat government authorizations ik01 also received support from senior members of the fardc this support included arranging for the issuance of fraudulent mop forms which allowed ik01 and ik03 to travel on 17 november 2005 on flight from mongbwalu to bunia 100 in providing support and security member stat 1 peacekeepers indirectly contributed to the illegal exploitation of congoles natural resources 101 idoios established that the d company offic er violated rule 1 of the ten rules code of personal conduct for blue helmets i n that member state 1 peacekeepers under his command and control misused their author ity by providing logistical support and security to private business interests engaged in t he illegal trafficking of unwrought gold in eastern drc 102 idoios established that the d company offic er violated rule 2 of the ten rules code of personal conduct for blue helmets in that member state 1 peacekeepers under his command and control failed to respect the laws of the drc in aiding and abetting private business interests engaged in the illegal t rafficking of unwrought gold in eastern 23 drc contrary to article 302 of law 0072002 of july 11 2002 relating to the mining code viii recommendations 103 in view of the preceding findings idoios mak the following recommendations recommendation 1 it is recommended that the department of peacekeep ing operations refer this case to the permanent mission of member
