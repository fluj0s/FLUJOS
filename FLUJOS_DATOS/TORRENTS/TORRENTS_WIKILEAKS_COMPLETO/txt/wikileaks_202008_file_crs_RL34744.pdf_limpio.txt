appointments with the advice and consent of the senate pas positions it also specifies for the 109th congress january 2005december 2006 all nominations to fulltime positions on 33 regulatory and other

the president and the senate share the power to appoint the principal officers of the united states1 the constitution article ii section 2 clause 2 empowers the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint the principal offi cers of the united states2 three distinct stages mark the appointment process selection clearan ce and nomination by the president consideration by the senate nd appointment by the president selection clearance and nomination in this stage the white house selects and clears nominee before sending the formal nomination to the senate there are number of steps in this stage of the process for most senateconfirmed positions first with the assistance of and preliminary vetting by the white house office of presidential personnel the pres ident selects candidate for the position interested parties includi ng members of congress of ten have input during this process most boards and commissions are required by statute

the lection of lower federal court judges by denis steven rutkusbalance among their members ie more than simple majority may be from the same political party so the president normally negotiates over nominations with leaders of the opposition party in congress these negotiations involve questions not only of patronage but of polic especially when the board or commission is involved in areas that at the time may be particularly sensitive this often results in packaging process in which the president submits several nominations together for positions in particular agency and the senate then confirms them as group sometimes however only one or two nomina tions are submitted when three or four positions may be available when this occurs nomination may remain before the senate for many months until one or two additional nominations are submitted generally all are then quickly confirmed during the clearance process the candidate prepares and submits several forms the public financial di sclosure report standard form sf 278 the questionnaire for national security po sitions sf 86 and the white house personal data statement ques tionnaire the office of th counsel to the president oversees the clearance process which often includes background investigations conducted by the federal bureau of investigation fbi th internal revenue service irs the office of governme nt ethics oge and an ethics official for the agency to which the candidate is to be appoi nted if conflicts are found during the background check oge and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflicts once the office of the counsel to the president has cleared the candidate the nomination is ready to be submitted to the senate the selection and clearance stage is ofte n the longest part of the appointment process there can be lengthy delays pa rticularly if many candidates are being processed as they are at the beginning of an administration or if conflicts need to be resolved candidates for higherlevel positions are often accorded priority in this process in an effort to reduce the elapsed time between new presidents inauguration and the appointment of his or her national security team provisions added in 2004 to the presidential transiti on act of 1963 encourage presidentselect to submit for security clearance potential nominees to highlevel national security positions as soon as possi ble after the election3 for positions located within state eg us attorneys us marshals and us district judges the president by custom normally nominates an individual recommended by the senator or senators if they are from the same party as the president from that state4 if neither senator is from the presidents party he usually defers to the recommendations of party leaders from the state occasionally the president solicits recommendations from nators of the opposition party because of their positions in the senate before maki ng nomination to federal

may serve only in an advisory capacity if circumstances permit and conditions are met the president may give the nominee recess appointment to the position see below recess appoi ntments may have pol itical consequences however particularly if senators perceive that an appointment is an effort to circumvent their constitutional role some senateconfirmed positions such as many of those in the executive departments may also be temporarily filled under the fe deral vacancies reform act of 19985 positions on most boards and co mmissions however are not covered by this act6 senate consideration in the confirmation or s econd stage the senate alone determines whether or not to confirm nomination7 the way the senate acts on nomination depends largely on the impor tance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy implications generally the senate shows particular interest in the nominees views and how they are likely to affect public policy8 two other factors may also affect the scrutiny with which nominees personal and professional qualities are examined whether or not the presidents party controls the senate and the degree to which the president becomes involved in supporting the nomination the senate confirmation process is centered at the committee level on the day the president submits nomination to the senate the senates executive clerk refers it to the appropriate committee or committees when making referral the executive clerk is guided by senate rule xxv which establishes the subject matters under the purview of each committee and di rects that all proposed legislation messages petitions memorials and other matters relating primarily to those subjects be referred to that committee the executive clerk is also guided by precedents set by prior referrals and by st anding orders and unanimous consent uc agreements pertaining to referral of nominations9 most nominations are sent to single committee occasionally the senate has agreed by unanimous consent by standing order or by statute to refer one or more nominations to more than one committee httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34744crs4 10 for more

stages as part of investigatory work committees may draw on information provided by the white house as well as information collected by the committees hearings provide public forum to discuss nomination and any issues related to the program or agency for which the nominee would be responsible even if confirmation is thought to be virtual cer tainty hearings may provide senators and the nominee with an opportunity to go on the record with particular views or commitments senators may use hearings to explore nominees qualifications articulate policy perspective or raise related oversight issues some committees hold hearings on nearly all nominations that are referred to them others hold hearings for only some the committee may discontinue acting on nomination at any point upon referral after investigation or after hearing if the committee votes to report the nomination back to the full senate it has three options it may report the nomination to the senate favorably report it unfavorably or re port it without recommendation if the committee elects not to report mination the senate may under certain circumstances discharge the committee from further consideration of the nomination in order to bring it to the floor10 although the senate confirms most nominations some nominations are not confirmed rarely however does the fu ll senate reject nomination most nominations that are not confirmed fail in committee either by committee vote or by committee inaction rejections in committee ccur for variety of reasons including opposition to the nomination inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination or factors that ma have nothing to do with th merits of the nomination if nomination is not acted upon by the senate by the end of congress it is returned to the president pending nominations also may be returned automatically to the president at the beginning of rece ss of 30 days or longer but the senate rule providing for this return is often waived11 appointment in the final stage the confirmed nominee is given commission signed by the president with the seal of the united states affixed thereto and is sworn into office the president may sign the commission at any time after confirmation once the appointee is given the commission and sworn in he or she has full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the officehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34744crs5 12 art ii 2 cl 3 13 for further information see crs report rs21308 recess appointments frequently asked questions by henry b hogue 14 pl 109115 div sec 809 119

and other collegial boards and commissions during each recess presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment pow er to circumvent the confirmation process in response congress has placed restrictions on the presidents authority to make r ecess appointment under 5 usc 5503a if the position to which the president makes recess appointment falls v acant while the senate is in session the r ecess appointee may not be pa id from the treasury until he or she is confirmed by the senate the salary prohibiti on does not apply 1 if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session 2 if nomination for the office other than the nomination of someone given rece ss appointment during the preceding recess was pending when the senate recessed or 3 if nomination was rejected within 30 days before the nd of the session and nother individual was given the recess appointment recess ppointment falling under any one of these three exceptions must be followed by nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next sessi on of the senate for this reason when recess appointment is made the president generally submits new nomination for the appointee even when an ear lier nomination is still pending13 in addition although recess appointees whose nominati ons to full term are subsequently rejected by the senate may continue to serve until the end of their recess appointment provision of the annual fina ncial services and general government appropriations act prohibits payments from appropriated funds to an appointee after such rejection14 characterization of regulatory and other collegial bodies federal executive branch boards and co mmissions share among other things the following characteristics 1 they are independent

power to remove them is restricted in this context fixed terms of ffice have set beginni ng and end dates irrespective of whether the posts are filled or when appointments are made in other contexts in contrast the full term begins to run when an appointee takes office and it expires after the incumbent has held the post for the requisite period of time the end dates of the fixed terms of boards members are staggered so that the terms do not expire all at once the use of rms with fixed beginning and end dates is intended to minimize the occurrence of simultaneous board member departures and thereby increase leadership continuity new commission or board member may be nominated and confirmed for position from which someone has resigned or died with an unexpired term or for position with new term that is already underway ccasionally where the unexpired term has been for very s hort period the president has submitted two nominations of the same person simultaneously the first to complete the unexpired term and the second to comple regular term of office on some commissions the chair is subject to senate confirmation and must be appointed from among the incumbent commissioners if the president wishes to appoint as chair someone who is t on the commission two nominations are submitted simultaneously for the nominee one for member and the other for chair as independent entities with staggered membership executive branch boards and commissions have more political independence from the president than do executive departments nonetheless the president can sometimes exercise significant influence over the composition of the membership when he designates the chair or has the opportunity to fill numbe r of vacancies at once for example president george w bush had the opportun ity to shape the securities and exchange commission during the first two years of his presidency because of existing vacancies resignations and the death of member likewise during the same time period president bush was able to submit nominations for all of the positions on the national labor relations board because of existing vacancies expiring recess appointments and resigna

two other notable characteristics apply to appointments to some of the boards and commissions first for 25 of the regu latory and other collegial boards and commissions the law limits the number of
