from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to tom crowley tcrowleydukeedukeith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject mwp figure date thu 21 jul 2005 160758 0100 cc jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno xflowed hi tom in keiths email below when he says we use series that total to tomgabi composite he doesnt mean that our mock up of the figure uses these series but that if the series shown in your draft figure are the same as those used in the hegerlcrowley recon that is currently submitted twice validated climate record then we will go with your figure it is fine then to include the composite series and the instrumental data and temperature scale our previous concerns about these latter points were that it might be seen as another new nh temperature reconstruction but if in fact the composite and its expression as temperature are not new nh t recon but are in fact identical to the published submitted at least hegerlcrowley nh t recon which is already included in the main intercomparison figure then theres problem does your figure equate to the new hegerlcrowley nh t recon if so we should go with your mwp figure though the clas want to draw it in the same style as the others and also cut the time period down to few centuries spanning the mwp keith suggests beginning in 800 or 850 would it be possible therefore to send the data series you used for your figure but beginning in 800850 so i can plot the figure in the required form cheers tim at 1453 20072005 tom crowley wrote keith if you can find more i see problem it seems that lot of the data you used was via cook and colleagues i was unable to locate full length record from quebec in that time series but maybe you are relying on something else if so can i have it other suggestions provide more general label to sites eg mangazeyek spyamal could be listed as polar urals taimyr central siberia china shoudl be relabeled as east asia as it does include some information from japan and the tibetan plateau l thompson and we dont want to get into some political by calling tibet chinese thats all i can think of for present good sailing tom keith briffa wrote hi all think this is resolved now virtually we use series that total to tomgabi composite and we can cite this as an example of the scatter of regional records in typical reconstruction this avoids very difficult issue of what is the best way to aggregate certain data sets we are simply illustrating the point with one published by then data set the issue of the composite is then not an issue either because it is not new unpublished composite that we were concerned about though i still believe it is distraction to put the composite in it would be best to use data from 800 or 850 at least and go to 1500 and presumably normalise over the whole period of data shown ok even though you guys all wish to go with the reduced period ie not up the present but my own instinct is that this might later come back to haunt us but will take your lead i agree the look of the figure should match the others so if tom will send the data sets his regional curves tim will plot and send back asap for scrutiny thanks tom and thanks for your help with this further comments on latest version of 65 last 2000 years still welcome though will be incorporating few changes in response to david and fortunat input and sh bit from ricardo and ed still to go in and regional section to be revised after input from peck et cheers keith at 2142 19072005 jonathan overpeck wrote hi keith and tim just got off the phone with eystein and hopefully he will sleep ok knowing that we have plan for the mwp fig and tom please ask questions if we dont cover all the key points but heres what we think 1 the mwp fig should span the mwp only and should emphasize variation in regional amplitude we agree that we must be clear that this fig is not reconstruction that is it is best to use time series representing regions assuming that the regional series do represent region ok with one or more input series we want to avoid regional bias if we can this is what got us into all the mwp misunderstanding in the first place perhaps eg nice mwp in europeatlantic region must be global 2 if you guys could agree on the series and the interval thatd be great we agree it would be good to start before 1000 and end before the renaissance 15th century if you want more feedback on these issues were happy to provide but it seems logical that you pick series and intervals so that each series covers the entire interval selected 3 dont use the chesapeak record it is likely biased by salinity 4 wed like keith and tim to draft the final figure so that it matches the look and style of the other two figs they have made hope this is doable tom does keith have all the data thanks for sending if not 5 we agree that tom should not be ca given that he was officially one of the zod reviewers of course this doesnt represent real conflict but we need to avoid even the appearance of conflict we greatly appreciate all the feedback that tom is providing is this plan ok w you tom we think youre cool with it but just want to check one more time that it is please let us know if there are any more questions keith feel free to try and get eystein on his cell doing your work hours if you want quick feedback or we can do this by email hes not in very email friendly place right now but the fishing appears to be ok again thanks to you both for all the discussion and thought that has gone into this figure best peck jonathan t overpeck director
