shsbc 60 seminar question and answer period what is knowable to the pc lecture given on 20 september 1961 well your day today is what day are you in audience 20th youre in the 20th well hello im glad to see youre in the 20th now those that have been in engrams in either session today this is the 20th of september so come up to present time come on come up to present time come on present time 20th september 1961 okay did anybody come up to present time all right well its your turn to tell what you dont know and ask questions about what you want to know dont ask questions so somebody else can find out that is common trick in academies students are always asking questions in order that the others can be informed im not interested in that im interested in the direct communication okay anything yes male voice we know in security checking were not using forget or notknow equally were not saying in this life therefore if pc has certain amount of notisness on his case and we ask question get reaction on it but the pc doesnt know what it is and it probably is past life what are we to do pull it if it reacts he can know about it youve asked whether or not when were doing security check and not using notknow version and not using in this lifetime we get knock on the emeter what are we to do about it thats very good question let us take up immediately the datum that most applies to this which is why do you get reaction on an emeter at all all right that is very simple thing that which is in the ken of reaction is in the knowledge of the pc that which will react is knowable thats the first and foremost rule of an emeters reaction it doesnt mean that it is known at the moment the question is asked but it means that it is knowable because an emeter can only react on those things which are instantly and immediately restimulated by the preclear himself so therefore on circuit version of course it is reactive but it is knowable the reason why you assess for an engram is not to find the hottest charge the reason you assess is to find out what is real to the pc this would be the realest goal to the pc therefore it reacts this would be the realest terminal to the pc therefore it reacts this is the realest level of the prehav scale therefore it reacts this is the realest incident to the pc therefore it reacts it isnt really even what the pc is in it isnt what is wrong with the pc its what the pc can connect with and i would say offhand that with great deal of clever interrogation emeters always require to be backed up by the clever interrogation and security check must always be done by variant questions you must never use security check with repetitivequestion approach if i find anybody in this unit saying have you ever raped anyone thank you have you ever raped anyone thank you have you ever raped anyone thank you i will let the floor disintegrate under you thats what i will do i will notis the floor so if you feel yourself falling in the middle of session you know what youve done now there is the score on anything of this character if it reacts it is knowable reaction means reality and you can just put those two together theyre easy to remember because its so alliterative reaction is reality now although you know whats wrong with the pc although you know what incident it should be although hes sitting there going glup glup glup and every once in while tightens up the space mechanism and it turns out to be shepherdess well that violates your reality but remember that the pc was read by the emeters reality thats why we use an emeter its reality reaction if it reacts it is real sure you have to get the shepherdess off before you get to this space mechanic you get the idea so therefore you at time must be guilty of enforcing reality on the pc which is contrary to what the meter says pcs reality is what the meter says always what the meter says and it is never what you say or what the pc says but in interrogation clever interrogation on any given question have you ever raped anyone have you ever thought of raping anyone have you ever remembered having raped somebody have you ever had consistent dreams of having raped somebody and this needle keeps falling you see and all of sudden he says well i had dream about it once oh you did all right lets go in for freudian dream analysis and give what it is and but its not in this lifetime well all right so its not in this lifetime who did you rape oh well youre being direct about it thats not fair and he all of sudden will have some foggy recollection of something or other and the pc says it isnt real but i sort of remember but its somehow or another and ive got picture of and you go he goes on like this and you say good who did you rape and he finally says well i guess thats the right answer and it clears on the meter well you dont care if his reality is any greater than that and you can clear those that do that but im glad you asked the question for two or three reasons we havent covered this subject of why does an emeter react for some time and an emeter would only react on past track thing that was sitting right there ready to be triggered you know that you can have pc sometimes half out of their chair leaving you know they just suddenly say ahhhhh buuu and they want to blow they want to run they want to get out of there and so forth and you say whats and theyve hit something you see well the space police have been looking for them for two and half billion years and itll come through with that much charge it really will they know theyre being looked for right now if somebody found that out that would be that and theyve been consciously alert you know they havent known why theyve been alert but just that you asked the question triggered it and when you can get one of those off the case youve done the case an awful lot of good because it was right there if it reacts it is real it is attainable now you compare this to your ordinary experience as an auditor that past track is almost out of sight where any ordinary person off the street is concerned you say what were you doing in your last life you cant ask that as casual social question all right youre not going to get an answer to that so you compare it with that experience and this other experience then seems frightening but every so often youre going to get one off the street and youre going to say have you ever robbed bank and its going to go bang and youre going to say well when was that and i dont know and youre going to say good it falls again you say when did you rob this bank oh well umm thats another story uh i dont know when i was little boy i used to have dreams about this sort of thing used to have nightmares about this sort of thing and hes liable to get sudden terrific reality on having robbed bank and been in prison for eighteen years in cook county prison or something like this in his last life you see and hes been scared ever since but he may get direct recall and when you get one of those youve actually freed up considerable amount of track so its very valuable to do that dont limit your question on security check to this lifetime those directions do not apply on processing security check and dont bother to run notknow version why because youve moved the whole thing up youre upgraded now to where youre going to find goal in an hgc straightaway youre going to find his goal youre going to find his terminal simultaneously going to be doing his security check and whats this going to amount to this is going to find the guy on the backtrack straightaway and itll only be maybe the first couple three sessions with the security check that you might have much trouble with and next thing you know hell be running engrams within the twentyfive hours he might very well be running engrams when an hgc auditor gets real hot first day he gets the assessment sheet and he gets the persons goal next day why he gets the persons terminal thats by noon two oclock the fellows on the first run thats the way it ought to be i wont settle for anything less as expertly done the amount of floundering which is being done with goals is technical floundering it is not anything to do with the pc it is technical floundering similarly the security checks the length of time it takes to do security check or clear question is just technical floundering its just not looking at the needle not getting reaction not asking the question not pressing it home youre sitting there security checking sheet youre not security checking pc you get the idea all these various conditions are present its technical that slows it down i hope that answers your questions male voice yes it does the only doubt i have now is how to help the pc you have this as more knowable when it does react when i know theres something that ought to be potentially knowable to him i wouldnt do thing for him male voice just sort of keep on questioning around him i wouldnt do thing for him beyond clever questioning on straight security check that is it you start auditing security check and hard and running repetitivecommand processes while doing security check and that sort of thing and its never paid off here weve just never had it pay off it sounds like it might be good idea but the way youd help him is to point up your questioning and that is by compartmentation of the question have you ever robbed have you have bank bank doesnt fall have you ever robbed falls have you that doesnt fall robbed well what have you robbed oh well you get down to that it was never banks you see it was just clothing stores and the locks will blow off he might have robbed bank on the whole track but youll actually blow the question on compartmentation it wont bother him then that is how you help him out is that more of specific aid to you male voice yes ive got it now thank you all right good enough what other question do we have yes virginia female voice you might have reactions on question but what happens when you do prehav assessment and you dont get very much reaction what error has been what happens to prehav assessment when you dont get very much reaction female voice hmhm go on female voice thats all just that female voice what error has been made or what can we do to get it what error has been made female voice so that it will well the error could be that youve cleared him female voice back up ways just back up ways all right all right you dont get much reaction well theres several things that can happen and that is that during the entirety of the last run of the last level that you were running your rudiments were out that is the most common suppressor of prehav assessment the rudiments have been out during maybe hours and hours and hours of the past run and this has made that level submerge and now it is the only level thats alive and the other levels are not going to react its not flat its submerged you see what i mean if you run level with the rudiments out its just like doing an assessment with the rudiments out the level submerges it drops out of sight it doesnt go flat it invalidates so you get number one your goal can disappear because rudiments are out now we know what to do about that you put the rudiments in and reassess on the goals list terminal disappears because the rudiments are out we know what to do about that all you do is get the rudiments in and reassess on the existing terminals list youve already got his terminals get the rudiments in go over those and youll find the terminal lives up again now its just the same with prehav level run youre getting tone arm action on running the level and you think it is flat and you think you had better reassess and you try to reassess and you cant get any reaction on the prehav scale hmmmmmm female voice can you be more specific now what youve got there is rudiments out and now the rudiments have not been out just before the assessment the rudiments have been out all during the run female voice mmhm aha so what do you do you take up every session the person has had on that run and you put all of the rudiments in the whole lot and now you do reassessment and either that level will now be alive again at which time you keep on running it or youll have new level that will pop up ready for running does that answer your question its the same in each case female voice mmhm its exactly the same action except what you might overlook is the fact that the rudiments have been out ever since youve started the run female voice but i got one reaction and the other times i had had more reaction though id had four or five levels reacting well i got just tiny tick on one and nothing on anything else and this was one that had dropped before this was one that had dropped before female voice mmhm i dont understand the question too tightly here second female voice well what shes worried about is that she says that she went through and she had five levels reacting before she had five second female voice and she found the level and she ran the level and she flattened the level and now she did an assessment again and she found one level only reacting this time on the emeter and that level stayed in and stayed reacting didnt it female voice mmhm second female voice it stayed in but thats whats supposed to happen second female voice i know female voice back up little bit more on the last time when i made an assessment and ran the prehav well there were several that dropped well so then i made another assessment and on this assessment only one level dropped at all well what is wrong with this female voice well it seems to like there ought to have been has the sky been blue all day second female voice its all right that way i mean thats the same order of magnitude youre complaining because the skys been blue all day female voice okay thats what you should get female voice good you shouldnt get anything else virginia female voice i should be so lucky yeah you should be so lucky theres nothing to sort out however if something like that did happen and ill tell you something to keep you from worrying she needs magnetic compass female voice ive got problems shes got problems ill give you something to keep you from worrying youve assessed the prehav scale and found only one level dropping you should be so lucky thats whats supposed to happen very often you find four or five levels dropping you have to sort out the one but you go into prehav assessment and find just one level dropping great all right your works been done for you so everything is dandy but ill give you stable datum when in doubt check rudiments and thats good stable datum for anybody to have you say well there must be something real wrong with what i have just done there must be something wrong here because ive only found the persons goal and they eventually had just one goal and then i found their terminal and they only could have one terminal and then i found their level and they only could have one level there must be something wrong here check rudiments for every session youve given the pc female voice i could do that check rudiments for every session you have given the pc from beginning to end just check rudiments all to pieces in all directions consistently and then just find out if those rudiments have been in all the time and you still only have one goal and you still only have one terminal and you still only have youve got choice but to go on clearing the person all right all right yes bob male voice ron what are the mechanics involved when preclear flattens level whats happening what are the mechanics involved when preclear flattens level male voice yeah it is everything pertinent to that level has been pulled out of that chain it doesnt mean you have discharged the whole engram chain or the bank on terminal but it means that the significance of that level has now been nulled out of every incident that the pc has contacted while doing fiveway bracket and it simply means more less let us say failed leave lets say there is more impulse on the subject of failed leave this however may leave the whole bulk of an incident see whole incident may be there and the only thing taken out of it now is failed leave you got the idea male voice yes all right so what weve done in running prehav levels if you get an idea get mental image picture here of whoole bunch of picket fences and heres picket fence and then on top of that well put another picket fence and then on top of that well put another picket fence and we call each one of these picket fences an engram all right each one is the whole prehav scale and each picket there is level of the prehav scale so we run failed leave well eventually when the level is flat in these three picket fences were not going to find any failed leave thats going to be gone so this many pickets is going to be missing one picket out of each engram got the idea all right now the way you clear eventually is that you just pull all the pickets off all these fences and of course you have run all of the engrams now theres shortcut way to do it thats shortcut is after youve got these things stirred up and the pc is doing an escape mechanism on these things and really isnt pulling up many pickets you put the pc wherever the pc was in valence and run that particular fence and run all the pickets off of the fence but not with all of the levels of the prehav scale notknow runs the whole lot now dont be amazed if later on when youre running the prehav scale there was one picket left in that engram he says whats this i thought we ran that this would be quite common we thought we ran that and here i am parked at this crossroads well its gone now and you say well how about parked at the crossroads well theres nothing to it now but there was that part of that engram left of being parked at the crossroad what youve done is left one picket on the fence and that is the whole thing so there would be two systems of running bank theyre both successful but independently taken one from the other they are not adequate neither one is totally adequate for all cases so you can run both systems now both systems in combination are totally adequate for all cases so youve got the system by which you remove picket from engram one picket from engram two picket from engram three and then picket from oh eighteen hundred pickets from the remaining locks and so forth that have to do with these things all right and that is the end of level theres more postulate of that character left in those pictures next you take your new level and you pull all of those pickets out and then you take new level and you pull all those pickets out and theoretically at the end of all of this youve pulled all the pickets and the pc is capable now of blowing pickets faster so any new bank that shows up he asises it all right now that system is one system and the other system is you find the persons goal terminal and now find all incidents relating to the terminal assess the engrams this is level running you see assess the engrams necessary to resolve the case and run those as engrams one after the other prehav levels see run them one after the other after the other after the other after the other and get rid of engram after engram and lock chain after lock chain all having to do with that well the odd part of it is if you did very good job with that you would wind up with clear all the pickets gone with prehav levels you wind up with clear all the engrams gone with this other type of engram running you run you wind up with clear youre addressing the same thing only there are two different ways to handle them the best system is to take both systems and mix them use mixed system why well you use the prehav runs and that throws the engrams into very plain relief and gets rid of tremendous amount of locks and then finds the pc sitting in places that arent easy for the pc to blow so we pick up an engram or two or three and we run them differently or indifferently it doesnt matter much as long as we get them relatively flat now we go ahead and go back to prehav level running and when he hits these pins again of course the only thing thats left is something like card house and all thats left in there is faith see we didnt hit any faith while we were doing an engram run and we hit faith on general prehav run and bang that is the end of that engram and he gets the delayed reaction on the benefit you think he should have gotten from having run the engram you will very often find yourself sitting around having just run an engram that explains the whole pcs life condition everything else we know everything now about the pc the pc has run it fully and they say oh thats fine and they dont change very much they think and it never really lifted and so on and you get kind of disappointed all right you go back to prehav level run and youll be running along very happily and all of sudden youve assessed him at faith on this terminal see and faith the pc will say well i could have faith in it was an engram with polar bear you see he and the polar bear were fighting over fish or something and he has faith in his ability to get this fish away from the polar bear thats the answer see and hell go you say whats happened it blew up what blew up well that that whole you know the engram we were running last week well you know i hadnt really ever noticed but i never really did get the fish away from the polar bear you know and theres nothing left of this thing you know here we are out on the ice and you know ice isnt bad you know id always figured before it was bad and fish tastes pretty good you know what do you know and youll get the relief on the prehav run after the fact of running the engram see delayed reaction so these two systems work to do the same thing which is what get the pc to confront asis and handle his reactive bank what actually does happen is the reactive bank gets confronted and handled understood and within the realm of control of the pc as soon as this occurs he longer has one you have clear okay male voice right all right we wont go into the technicality of hes got these things and standing ridges of electronic waves and they have flow systems connected with them and that were really running an electric eel in the first place theres too we have too great stress these days on the scientific balderdash you know the ergs and the ohmiwhums go whoompapoom and now we know something we dont know anything okay yes male voice are the change processes still being used in auditing straight auditing and what is their importance in auditing today well the change processes youre asking if theyre still being used in auditing and what their status is right now male voice yes all right tell you that very briefly simply been relegated to the prehav scale on assessment you run into change you can still move over into the secondary scale and you run it but you will find that general runs on the prehav are nowhere near as beneficial as specific runs on the exact terminal of the pc in view of this fact it is actually practically waste of time in comparative times of running to run anything but the pcs terminal so the whole idea of change change processes and everything is still in but it operates only against the preclears terminal only at that time when the preclear in being assessed on the prehav scale gets reaction on change change is the level so you run change and everything you know about change is applied to running change at that level that you find the pc at okay right yes maam female voice ron can you give some more data on how to unravel the grouper can we get some more data on how to unravel the grouper have you got grouper did you yourself get whammoed into grouper female voice i have but also ive had pcs who have too has your grouper unravelled female voice it hasnt female voice at least i can hope on tonight hmm female voice i hope to have it unravelled tonight you hope to have it unravelled tonight well i wont tell you that grouper is one of the most insidious one of the most horrible one of the most fantastic but i actually will tell you that grouper can be thoroughgoing bitch it is mean and when you run pc into grouper his apparency is that all time jams in actuality he has come up against the whole time jam he is confronting something what is grouper grouper is number of incidents becoming located apparently in one time instant number of instances have apparently all occurred in one time instance so we have number of incidents located at one point on the track now i have had pcs say that they felt them all pull in or that it all collapsed on them and they ran to that point of the track where it all collapsed on them but the collapse occurred at another time than it occurred they think it happened in the session it actually happened few million years ago you get the slight difference here all right now that time misnomer all by itself would throw red herring at the pc and he would be thinking about his grouper having occurred in auditing when it as matter of fact it didnt occur in auditing now ill give you number of ways of taking apart grouper there is doubt about the fact that groupers are fairly serious breeds of cat first place let us look at the anatomy of the grouper before we worry about how to take it apart lets find out what were taking apart lets not do the egyptian stunt of repairing radios before we know that they receive broadcasts civiliz i mean the psychiatrist the ancient physician all alike were guilty of this the grouper most commonly is vacuum it is cold installed vacuum and grouper is normally found associated with implants and the person who has grouper has implanted people there you are now that is what that is all about now i didnt mean to make you ashamed i see you blushed because female voice i ran an incident doing that saturday you what female voice i said i ran an incident doing that thats what it is all right now you have to know what you were doing what were you doing now that is the main thing because of course grouper cannot hang up on pc unless the pc has done it grouper anything that can mash electricity the only thing which can mash electricity with crunch like that or cause an individual to slam pictures into his bank like that is cold vacuum there are many systems of doing this for instance the russians talk about brainwashing if you wanted to go after running into grouper itd be very very hard to convince the pc that he ought to engage professionally in brainwashing i think itd be very difficult to convince somebody that had hit grouper that he ought to go ahead and fix himself up for new groupers but the way it is done is this way is all youd have to do is take handful of dry ice and throw it and smash it into the fellows face and hold it there and that would be that thats twentysecond brainwash hed have very little memory of what he was doing his whole bank would collapse and that would be it just get handful of carbon dioxide and smash it into the persons face that is the way grouper is done now you know now you can it takes the russian seventy days and it should take you something on the order of seven seconds cold cold is an extreme stillness time is temperature therefore you must not run nomotions in the vicinity of grouper you must not run nomotion anyhow but dont run it particularly in grouper dont start asking somebody whos in grouper who is that standing there because the only thing in grouper is supreme nomotion it is nomotion fringed entirely with motion now of course the tiniest temperature such as forty degrees below zero is hot compared to the vacuum in which grouper is sitting think it over thats hot thatd be hot day because most of these groupers are at the temperature of about minus two hundred centigrade so you see forty degrees below zero fahrenheit would be warm spring day but that is motion there is enough motion in that temperature to cause motion and stable datum follow that thats an unhappy fact look you look at extreme cold as extreme motionlessness all temperature is based on the phenomena of motion if you have motion you have temperature if you dont have motion you dont have temperature time is temperature if you dont have motion if you dont have temperature you dont have time this is the way thetan has got it all figured out now you understand that so if you say extreme coldness equals motion equals time then you will see that the only thing that you can run in the vicinity of grouper is motion and time so grouper can be taken apart laboriously by motion and time do you see how that would be all right this fellows sitting there in whole bunch of plastered up pictures and he cant make any sense out of it whatsoever now the way to get him into it very solidly would be to say when have you been cold thank you when have you been cold thank you when have you been cold thank you when have you been cold it would group and group and group and itd be tighter and tighter and then to vary the agony say all right what in that grouper isnt moving thank you very much is there anything else in the grouper there that isnt moving thank you very much and hed really be in the grouper tight see you could actually take somebody and audit him this way and hed get tighter and tighter and tighter into the grouper you understand that well understanding that then the road out of grouper should be very plain all you have to do is ask him about motion or ask her about motion and ask them about time so questions about motion and time will free any pc from grouper but dont consider that its necessarily fast action it does not necessarily take place in two minutes all right motion and time will free up grouper now if we put unknownness in connection with that now we really have something interesting in the way of processes see we got time and motion as our basics now we re going to add the ingredient of unknowingness so these three now would be doublebarrelled whirl devil as far as grouper was concerned and we could ask somebody question of this character about grouper we could say when was the time unknown to you yeah when was the time unknown to you what time was unknown what havent you known about time to what person has time been unknown you generally get the most delinquent and procrastinating member of the family you see it doesnt matter how you phrase these im just giving you the skeletal structure of commands all right now we take motion and well say what motion wouldnt you care to undertake now that will lead in the direction of grouper what motion i mean if youre processing somebody who has grouper what motion wouldnt you care to undertake which is the idea of motion and restraint at the same time motion and restraint motion and restraint all right that has some workability give you another nice one is what motion was unknown and youll run every surprise the persons ever had now people who are in grouper are very allergic to surprises they dont like to be startled their hair stands up straight when they have long blond hair it reaches the ceiling practically they dont like to be startled so what motion was unknown will produce some of the bitchier meaner somatics that you have ever had anybody run into what motion was unknown what motion was unknown to you what motion was unknown to another this kind of thing and youll get all sorts of bank phenomena of various kinds and youll get grouper looks like the groupers stacking up and it isnt all youre doing is running off the instant when it stacked up now this is what makes grouper hard to run because matter what you do to it it looks like its stacking up do you see why because youre running moment when it stacked up so that every instant that youre running in the grouper looks like an instant looks like it is stacking up now there is time in it so therefore the stackup then is what the pc sees and conceives it to be stackup now so it always looks like the grouper is getting worse and pcs become very disheartened when they start seeing one of these groupers start going to work all you have to do is keep running the stackup if you had an idea ill give you an idea of what grouper looks like to pc but this is rather poor view of it weve got an art gallery weve got an art gallery the corcoran the metropolitan some such art gallery and you got pictures all over the walls everywhere and theres fountain in the middle of the art gallery and suddenly and mysteriously every picture flies off the walls and hits the fountain and sticks and you have nothing on the fountain but mound of pictures now having hands and truck it would be very easy to pick up these pictures so to get little more sense into this grouper idea we have to go just little bit further if after they all flew off the walls and hit the fountain and laid there in pile the fountain then began to spurt permanent glue and was left to do so for some years we now go back to the fountain to pick up the pictures and put them back on the wall and thats about the way the pc looks to it it looks to him you know and he says this would be the grimmest thing that ever happened to this is terrible the horror of it is is he thinks it happened in the session see it looks to him like it happened in the session why he triggered the incident didnt he in the session didnt he its obvious didnt he only of course he didnt trigger the incident in the session he ran into an incident where all the pictures were flying into the fountain and he ran into this in session and because its got timelessness he gets fooled at once now if you wanted to relieve the pc of having run the grouper you would run the auditor that ran into the grouper and youd run the session out and the grouper would disappear and then the pc would get audited very carefully by somebody else and the grouper would appear and the person would think that this collapse again occurred in this next session and of course it never occurred in the session at all you see where were going now now if you wanted to free up grouper all you have to do is find the picture the pc isnt grouped in and run it dont keep running the pc through the grouper find another picture because although you will find there s grouper there are other pictures north and south of the grouper in which the pc is in valence and which will run so you rehabilitate the pcs confidence in the ability to run picture and eventually the grouper itself will work out what does grouper look like well ive just told you in action that is the way it looks but how is the engram what is the actual engram which contains grouper the actual engram well i have personal acquaintance with one of them rocket jockey lying on bed being hit by electronic rays hes strapped down to this bed and hes being hit by electronic rays so as to disabuse any further idea of him exteriorizing and going out and running one of those confounded planes thats been strafing the capitol so regularly get the idea they want him pinned and they want him there and thats it and they do an implant well he thinks he is being hit by moving rays where as matter of fact they move in cold vacuum on him and plow it straight into his body and of course thetan doesnt move out of that very easily particularly if hes done it see that all right so youd have an incident where the person was actually the incident really is person lying on bed with pictures flying at him all you got to do is keep the pcs attention on the bed not the pictures if youre going to run the grouper find out where the pc is located in the grouper whether as person who was administering groupers the overt which is the better one to run or the motivator lying on bed and then keep his attention on that all right what dont you know about that patient see not what dont you know about his pictures or your pictures or something like that what dont you know about that patient or something of the sort now all this is very interesting not very serious you can unbale i have seen this done i have subjective reality on this you can unbale grouper by running arc straightwire recall an arc break thank you recall an arc break thank you recall an arc break thank you recall an arc break thank you and the person will unstack right down to the actual incident in which the grouper occurs that is an old process that happens to do this exact trick recall an arc break doesnt matter what time or place theyre recalling the arc break they will eventually wind up in the grouper because that is an arc break to end all arc breaks all right so you could unstack the case and find the case lying there and now your auditing must be very careful and you must go on running recall an arc break dont go switching it off just because youve found the incident flatten recall an arc break while having spotted where the grouper is dont go qandaing just because you run into an incident dont ever stop the auditing session and run the incident and then run little more prehav and then he runs into another incident so you decide youd better run that incident aww that is that is for the birds run what youre running according to your plan and when you have flattened it now take up what has happened perhaps in the next session got the idea thats the way you audit you always assess engrams you never at any time run an engram just because it seems hot or the pc seems to be in it or something like this you assess them if the emeter says so they can be run if the emeter reacts the engram can be run if the emeter doesnt react the emeter is right the engram cant be run reaction run so you always assess engrams you never switch off in the middle of prehav run to do this now youre in rather deep and complicated subject when youre into the subject of groupers because it has to do with the fact that somebodys collapsed bank on somebody with thud it has happened to everybody and theres practically everybody who has got grouper at one time or another and it neednt become fashionable the truth of the matter though it requires good wellskilled auditing to handle this kind of thing just in the common course of human events grouper would come apart anyplace but the first rule i would lay down on it is dont run the grouper you can uncover it thats all right and so forth dont bother with it find an engram that the pc can run and get the pc to run it because the pc can be moved out of that grouper area as easily as out of any other engram but pc is so fixated on it and pc believes so implicitly it happened right in the session when they were being audited that they say that the session should cure it and that of course is what is intended when youre implanting people that if they ever run into it theyre not going to get out of it now what kind of person applies groupers almost anybody in space opera is liable to one fine day take his finger off his number and decide that the enemys habit of exteriorizing from bodies shot down and going back and picking up doggone woolworth secondhand body and picking up another scout craft and coming over and attacking again with all of his information must cease so space opera very commonly develops practices by which the enemy is made to forget forget what well thats very essential because after youve captured somebody or shot him down in your operational area of course he knows it and if he simply flies out of his ruddy ead and goes back to base and picks up another body hell bomb you out of existence this kind of thing was quite common on the track all right sounds pretty wild but it nevertheless was very common far commoner than being streetcar conductor now the answer was specialized implanting and it became very very specialized now what is the most antipathetic thing about space it is cold and the next most antipathetic thing about space it is lonely and the next most antipathetic thing about space female voice black hm what female voice its black as tar you see you get what it is so you just take the elements that the space opera doesnt like and you put all those things together and youve got grouper very nice one naturally somebodys sitting in scout craft all by himself and its only two and half years to the next system you see and hes being sent over there and he sits there for two and half years hell start to selfaudit whether he likes it or not yeah the only memories hes got the only thing he can see you see is his own pictures and hell pull his own pictures around and so forth and then space itself does lot of brainwashing youre hoppityguppitting along at umpteen lightyears per whumph and theres meteorite shower well the manufacturers were very good they were very good reliable people but remember it was war when this craft was built so there is shock absorbers for meteorites in the nose and the windscreens and so forth have nothing like double panel and youre travelling at such fantastic rates of speed that when you hit the meteorite shower all you know about it is that you are in space someplace probably falling quietly into sun one moment you were travelling at three lightyears per oomph and the next moment why you were falling into the sun and you hardly know what the hell happened well what the hell happened is that the meteorites came through the ship with whoosh you see and even though they missed you they took all the air out of the ship they took everything out of the ship and having done so they let in this tremendous cold now what becomes very interesting is is the meteorite is very often hot when it does this it was cold moment ago but it has just hit remember very fast travelling object and the disintegration of the meteorite and the disintegration of the object alike have heat so its nothing to be standing on ship and be hit with redhot object after which youre instantly very cold because space is cold redhot icecold boomboom and theyre not split second apart you couldnt even measure the microseconds you see of difference between them all right that makes nice hefty engram it makes nice one it makes lovely one well of course when they start really implanting the boys they naturally will arc break it as much as they can because that really makes it stick they make it betrayal and they tell this fellow now you have good rest because were going to exchange you tomorrow and you can go home only were having hard time putting your ship together you see because it was so badly shattered by our ackack and you have good rest and so forth and heres book to read on our ideology and so on and when you get back home they build him all up you see and heres some nice electronic soup to eat and youre nice boy and whale of fellow and the chaplain usually comes in and talks to him about his soul and its all wonderful you see and hes just in this beautiful mood where these fellows are the princes theyre just the princes of space he really theyve almost won if they only knew it you see and so he stretches out on his bed with deep relaxed yawn and panel drops on the other side of the wall and redhot soup hits him which then turns icecold and there goes his bank now what he never knows is whether or not he is hit by pictures created by them or created by him thats what he doesnt know are they his pictures or their pictures well he thinks hes being hit with an assortment of pictures why is he being hit with an assortment of pictures well theyre all of the same class well hes in that kind of circumstance isnt he so the pictures hes mocking up actually are all of class theyll be something like 180 pictures of deaths stacked up on 180 pictures of wrecked ships stacked up on something else and hes sure that somebody shot these pictures at him well this is nice trick because he disowns them he says theyre not my pictures well who the hell else was around there making pictures just him so another characteristic of the grouper is that its totally disowned and the preclear is totally irresponsible for it now he dramatizes this irresponsibility by saying it happened in the session he dramatized the irresponsibility by saying he can do nothing about it dont you see all these things add up together because these things when they are vicious always go in as an arc break the arc break recall an arc break process unstacks oone and so on if you worry about them too much youre at fault because the pc who is in grouper can be run i assure you in many other incidents which will react on the emeter and you neednt pay any attention to the grouper at all grouper is grouper and sooner or later the pc will fall wise to the fact that while being space jockey or something of the sort he was one fine day recruited as part of the propaganda corps and he was supposed to take the little people they were fighting and lure them in by some kind of statements or another so that they walk straight into redhot electronic cauldron which goes icecold and then they dont go back and pick up new bodies and keep the war going and sooner or later youll run into some kind of an implant like this i see i have certain people present who dont like this idea at all well why get emotional about it i always say its just space opera its not real theres really nothing to it of course man has never lived before we know that hes never been up in space before these by the way are just the common defenses of people stuck in space opera you get some fellow telling that he never under gods green earth would read that trash called science fiction ill say okay get the idea of implanting somebody and leave him in grouper i mean its easy scientologists should not be antagonized you have too many weapons anyway i repeat the best advice is to find an incident the pc can run and run it very nicely and all of sudden light will dawn and bells will ring and so on of course the keynote of any grouper is notknowingness now grouper that turns on with hell of somatic accompanying it is another horse of different hue so this grouper turns on and its the pc finds it uncomfortable all right so its uncomfortable but the grouper turns on and starts ripping hole in his stomach i dont mean this literally but it sure feels like it something of this sort and it is hot and it is heavy and he does not like any part of it ohhhhh can give you process fortunately which happens to handle this exact circumstance that applies only to grouper and applies only to one that is running hot and heavy with heavy somatic special case and that is what was unknown about that pain interesting target isnt it what was unknown about that pain and before i give get off this subject youll find out thats good anyhow thats an awfully good assist all by itself its that pain its the one hes got right now thats the only one youre interested in youre not interested in what was unknown about pain because youve got the whole track flying now its just that pain and on this same subject allied to it pc who is suffering tremendously fixed attention as he is in grouper becomes very hard to audit and if the pc has gone into an incident which is grouper and then you are trying to audit the pc you may have time on your hands you may have bit of trouble on your hands keeping the person insession and not recognize that you have pc in grouper and the pc has horrendous somatic of some kind or another well its time to investigate what the pc is in and if it is this action of theres pictures pictures pictures all over the doggone place theyre all plastered up art gallery and its all gone black and thats what happened and god knows its all terrible and so forth then you use these same mechanisms that you use to take the grouper apart okay use the same mechanisms ive just given you if he is in serious somatic condition this other one handles it what about that pain was unknown or what is unknown about that pain now you must have this datum with regard to running engrams how did the engram chain come up how did it come up why are you handling this particular engram well lets not try to look it up in the encyclopaedia you were running terminal werent you so continuous mistake that could be made in running engrams is to forget that they are on terminal chain and to run them as you you you you what dont you know about that picture you get the idea because remember youre running terminal chain here the only reason the thing came up is because of terminal well you are now trying to get the pc as you to run something which is package called valence and ive already told you the reason youre running valences is because the pc has disowned the somatics and so forth of the valence so if you remember this when you are running engrams you will get into much less trouble that the engram is actually the engram of the valence in which the pc is and therefore therefore and thereby and thereunto you should mention the valence while youre running engrams well all right we get fifteen engrams the pcs been in and out of fifteen engrams were running prehav scale on looper and now we sort these engrams out very carefully and we find out which one falls the most and now we run it all as you does that seem odd to you now that you look at it does it seem odd to you he you found it by running looper you were running looper faith in looper how could you have faith in looper you know and so on and now youve got fifteen engrams sorted out well of course they are the engrams of what theyre not the engrams of the pc except secondarily theyre the engrams primarily of looper so we would have to remember this if we wanted an engram to free up and although we can of course use you copiously in running the engram what dont you know or what wasnt known to you what wasnt known to others and so forth for heavens sakes lets mention looper what wasnt known to looper in that engram see saying that was the terminal just so i wont restimulate you becausee im sure none of your terminals are looper so you get the idea now this also applies to running one of these groupers not how would you get such grouper but how would looper get into one got the idea now just how would looper go about getting himself in that kind of fix all right what wouldnt looper know about it see how would looper get somebody into that kind of fix what would looper make unknown about such thing got the idea so use that terminal when you is running engrams and you will get faster run and you wont have quite so much trouble now ill give you much more serious situation with regard to grouper somebody is run into grouper that you do not have the goal or terminal of aah or you pick up pc off the street and he is in one and you dont know his goal or terminal now what are you going to do about that thats pretty grim isnt that terrible hes obviously in grouper its all black and the pictures are plastered all over and you dont know his goal and you dont know his terminal and what can you do about that come on tell huh female voice arc straightwire huh male voice you find his goal and terminal first yeah thats right you find his goal and terminal of course youre not in the business of running groupers and grouper has nothing whatsoever to do with finding pcs goal and terminal you can find them in people with groupers and snoopers it doesnt matter almost on dare id if insane asylums were open to human beings and other and people and so forth if i could i used to have collar that was on backwards used to put collar on backwards and had card printed reverend witherspoon and used to go in to console the dear dead benighted and so on i should exhume this celluloid collar i suppose its still in good condition because i think you could probably find the goal and terminal on every person in that institution just whimitybam i imagine theyd just audit like welloiled dream because you can run engrams on them why couldnt you find goal and terminal ought to be very easy if you find somebody whose case is all jammed up and has been jammed up this way in former auditing they tell you in other words theyve run into grouper on the track what should you do qanda with pc or go about your job of auditing thats right always always so it works out similarly similarly if youve got somebodys goal and terminal dont neglect the fact that you have the persons terminal in trying to undo grouper see and you would say where would looper go to get warm be almost leadpipe question on grouper because of course its basis is cold and he gets cold all over he has this chilled you in england are very lucky you dont have restimulative weather all the same all the same we have very nice mild weather snowstorms in the summer none in the winter to amount to anything sunshine in the winter none in the summer to amount to anything actually we did very well this last past summer i was very proud of the climate we did very very well only gone through couple of hurricanes lately and carla is still to come carla will be here about the 2nd of october i think i was calculating her speed but i that was many days ago and she may have changed course since then and it wouldnt be so bad if it was still carrying some of the furniture and so forth from the gulf coast but uh all right now ive given you very long and arduous dissertation on this and actually theres quite great deal to know about it i hope you dont treat this information lightly because grouper is an interesting phenomenon it is one of the many phenomena of the track and it is an interesting thing but it is cold its cold in there and you say to somebody now how cold have you ever been recall another time youve been cold good good if you ran that long enough theyd almost certainly wind up in grouper okay time for one more question i guess ive overwhumped you people are looking rather sick people are looking rather sick and ill and pale one more question female voice how would you go about cleaning up every session guys ever had how would you go about cleaning up every session person has ever had well in view of the fact the auditing track is not very long track thats very easy thing to do if you simply ran the arc break process which you now have in the present rudiments youd clean the lot okay its interesting sometime to take off the auditing by whatever means or process we had student one time in washington in the academy that was auditing somebody and came down with measles and he was promptly and immediately rushed to the nearest sawbones and the sawbones couldnt find any measles he looked around but the pc was not measling very much and it finally came down to my desk and i said hey hey hey hey i just said lets see what was he doing two or three days ago and they said so and so and i said well run the session off and so they got hold of him and ran him running the session i think or something like that and the measles disappeared within the hour measles seem to be something that goes into very easy restim i notice in old dianetics ive had letter from somebody that picked up the book read i think half of the first chapter and then audited his wife ran her into measles and she was instantly taken to the hospital with measles only the doctor couldnt find any measles and she was all broken out and three to ten days later why it all ceased and she didnt have measles anymore its of interest to get off an auditing session where something like that has occurred now it sounds like auditing is dangerous doesnt it well actually it usually passes out if whats restimulated by auditing is much more easily restimulated by life and let point this out that there isnt any auditor presence as hes walking through life thats the only reason that you should be good auditors is because its very easy to do things that life will restimulate okay anybody particularly worried about these groupers well ill tell you you should be worried about these groupers the idea of going on down there in the first place the whole war started in fun there was nothing much to it they were just blasting few cities and you know it as fellows will and there was sense in getting serious like this about it and then picking those poor prisoners of war and sticking them in that room female voice well what happened to them after that thats what i want to know well they just kind of threw them out on the trash heap i had an instance of that character not fellow who was given an implant but fascinating instance its the funniest engram i think id ever run into fellow was in spaceship and it had hit something or other hed gotten shot up and the cold air had gotten in or something of the sort or the cold lack of air the air had been let out and the cold had come in and anyway hed been orbiting around as commonly happens in space wagon and hed been orbiting around not minding his own business but with nothing to think of nothing to do and plastered up against the side of the spaceship so finally rescue team you know like one of these air rescue squadrons they have up in alaska or something spotted this ship orbiting around before it ran into sun and warmed him up for good and they picked him up and he was still in his body you see doll body and of course the rescue team didnt pay any attention to this and didnt test for this or anything else but salvaged his shoes you see which were these magnetic walkonthehullanddontdriftoff putoutbythelittlebideawee space jockey society authority stamp good spacing seal of approval you know and they took off his shoes and they took away his belt and the rest of it was just so much scrap tin can and threw it over the side he was still in it and this pc just went on and on and on about his shoes and by george we just couldnt get him unfixed from those shoes and it seems like ever since hed had trouble with shoes you see he had trouble buying shoes he had trouble in getting shoes fitted he had shoes shoes shoes shoes thats how serious it all was left terrible trauma about shoes you say what happens to them afterwards well they throw them on the garbage dump or they do something like this and dont very often suspect the guy is exteriorized very often when guys been hit like this if the intentions were right he wanders away from his basic team or he doesnt go back to his base he feels very degraded so he shoves off and gets on another planet someplace and becomes juvenile delinquent youll find after severe battle youll find people in space activities feeling very degraded and so forth and they cant explain why and theyll tell you that space is very degrading and so forth well yeah they just blew up planet or fortifications and cities and fields and theyve just chewed up lord knows how many people and then they wonder why they feel degraded you know silly things but you should cheer up about grouper of that character you should cheer up on it because if anything is calculated to release lot of memory its one of these things taken apart now thats invitation to get into one thats invitation to run one or otherwise but they just are what they are youll also find out that all the other phenomena mentioned in dianetics are present in engrams there are bouncers there are callbacks you get guy to the end of the incident and hes at the beginning of the incident and you say how the hell did he get there well hes got callback at the beginning of the incident usually however serious engrams have these things symbolically not verbally and when you run engrams in scientology youll run them symbolically theres symbol of some kind or another therell be somebody at the beginning of the engram whos making this sort of motion see and he gets to the end of the track and all of sudden he remembers that and he goes back to the beginning of the thing and he gets to the end and he goes back to the beginning finally you see this guy waving you know tell him to come on or he thinks he ought to leave and its nothing more than an open door in front of him youre running him on down the line all of sudden he isnt in the incident and you say what happened and what happened and hed say well nothing well what happened just moment ago well i was running down this thing and oh theres that door you see its an invitation to leave so he bounces bouncers groupers callback denyers this idea of theres nothing here can be expressed in various ways and the guy will run through something and part of its blank and hell go on through to the end of the thing and then hell finally recover piece of it and its some symbol to the effect there is nothing here you know or somebody has disappeared at that point and he qsandas with it and so that part of the engram is of course missing theres all kinds of oddities in running these things phenomena phenomena you can get phenomenahappy about the whole thing you follow the rules youll get out of it i am happy to be able to say word or two about groupers i have very intimate acquaintance with groupers and theyre little bit hard to run occasionally but the main reason they are is just those reasons the person thinks it turned on in the session it didnt he thinks its some other kind of engram it isnt its just an engram but pictures accumulate to it so its in confusion as to what picture do you run see if theres five thousand pictures flying around in the air well which picture do you run to run it well instead of worrying about it why go find another picture and the basis of them are cold the only thing that can hold anything together like that is motionlessness with an exclamation point you know the trick dont you of directing the pcs attention to the motion beyond something he is stuck at now i heard remark here the other day by an auditor that demonstrated they didnt know this that this was not known said all we could find there was picture of somebody standing still and i dont think they ran it because that wasnt adequate well there was picture of somebody standing still well all the auditor would have had to have done when he found this still picture is just say what motion is going on behind the picture and all hell would have broken loose because the only reason you get severe still is because there is tremendous motion and the pc will always look at the still and ignore the motion so if you just put the pcs attention on the motion in that zone or area the still will disintegrate people who have still pictures are not stuck on the track but withdrawing from motion and the still is remedy for the motion so the pc will always take refuge in something that is motionless when the pc believes that the motion is too much for them and remember all pain is motion all pain is motion so in painful incidents you find the plethora of motionless pictures and youll find them stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck you run him two feet and hes got another stuck picture and so forth some holdup well whats the holdup well youve got to direct the pcs attention to the zones and areas of motion thats all just direct his attention to it ill give you subjective example of this the egyptian area is one of the worst for anybody to get anywhere near because its confusing and violates their beliefs why because egypt was space opera from one end to the other and youll have somebody standing there on pyramid and hes very worried about his cloak blowing open because it exposes might expose the butt of his ray gun and he says well uh cloak ray ray gun well that has nothing to do i must have collapsed series of pictures here or i must be in some kind of state because this doesnt agree with any reality that ive been taught in the history books actually egypt was battleground between two space groups and they set up all this nonsense one way or the other and all the supermagic and all that kind of thing so every once in while you even find youll even find science fiction writer trying to run back the coming of christ to space opera or something hes just talking straight out of his bank you see marvellous what these fellows will actually pick up but the sum and total of this is its such disagreement it disagrees with the history books it disagrees with everything and its sort of got the guy every hes reality is being violated violated violated violated so its these areas of violated reality which give you all kinds of trouble because the pc doesnt feel that this is very good and he doesnt feel that hes playing it straight and he feels the pictures must be dubin and he invalidates himself and all kinds of wild things go on where as matter of fact if he just sat there and ran the picture thats turned up and so on that would be that he would come through it on the other end and then youd know what the whole thing was all about well anyway with that little preamble i was being run one day on books and all of sudden encountered the fact that the greeks had books well this is not generally known of course theyve disintegrated these many years and nobody has anything to do with greek book they dont exist anymore but actually they were books they had little wooden covers and wooden spine and they had printing system and the printing system consisted of having bunch of slaves with the alphabets and the fellow would read these things out and theyd hand another guy the letter and hed stamp it and theyd read out another word and theyd stamp it and finally theyd get block print set up itd be block in frame and theyd crowd the thing together and then they would take piece of papyrus and so on which was quite available to them at the time and theyd spread it over the top of this inked and theyd roll it down with roller and that was page of the book and they would then put it in the book theyre kind of handmade books theyre making thousand copies of this thing manual for how to get along with alexander or something they would put them one after the other make them up and then theyd break this form apart you see because these were carved letters well they were all out of wood the books were out of papyrus nobody ever preserved one theyve never come forward to present time so its quite startling to find yourself sitting in greek garden reading book dont you see this must be dead wrong you know so anyhow that i got that all cleared up and said now what do you know there are books in egypt only the egyptian system of printing went this way and you know the egyptian system of printing suddenly turned up and i remembered what that was and of course that was all pictograph and so it was very complicated printing system fantastic printing system you had to have whole bunch of slaves and they all stood around great trays of various kinds so classes of pictographs were arranged according to tray and reader would sit up on platform and he would read word and the slave you see there were thousands of these pictographs and slave that had that type of pictograph in charge see he would pick it up and hed join the circle and hed just stand in line and actually your words were all in line in number of slaves but theyd bring them in and theyd put them in the form and as the slaves would come by theyd keep putting them in the form and then when you had the frame you made it up just the way the greeks did and youd ink the face of these pictographs and youd run it off on piece of so on and so on and i got looking this over and i said this is very funny because youd think theyd have more light and what started worrying the picture wasnt moving id got into stuck picture which was quite unusual for and id go on about the printing yeah but printing what and for this thing to be this stuck must have been lot of notknowingness there well they were printing the orders of the day for who well for the invader force the orders of the day and this was printing shop that was publishing space orders for issue to space agents operating in egypt of course the second that i started realizing something like that i said space opera well hell back of this picture there must be the wildest motions that anybody ever heard of so i just put my attention on the other side of the picture and of course that was the end of the print shop that was the end of everything else and here we were out there in good solid lovely battle the pharaoh had just died you see so the boys from the other side wanted to get their candidate in quick you know and we wanted to get our candidate in quick and everything was going off in the usual bombastic fashion and right there out in the valley of the dead why you had some boys in khaki uniforms blowing the living pants off of everybody else they could see and anything that moved and then the funeral procession was coming so everybody in the battle by common agreement had to pack it up and get the hell out of there because you didnt dare let the public in on it you talk about secrecy man that was secrecy well theres nice calm subject books pc feels very scholarly about it all you see and there is stuck picture and then of course somewhere in the vicinity of that stuck picture there must be action and the second he spots the action all is explained and of course this type of action is very deep level of dontknow nobody must know about it and as matter of fact except scientology i dont think anybody ever does right up to present time but theyre now flooding the palace of thebes female voice yeah and the location of this particular print shop was on the in back of the lowest dungeons of the print shop and anybody coming in would of course go through all of the prisoners all of the cells theyd pass through the lot and smelly lot it was and then theyd get to the back end of the thing and they would run into the telecommunication system to the space command and the print shop and im sure it is still there im sure its still there but theyre flooding it and i dont know whether thats bad or good because think of the horrible shock historians would get think of the histories that would have to be rewritten if historians started to tell the truth so you see the picture is held in place by an avoidance of motion or notknowness on the subject of motion and that is what holds picture in place and that is all that holds picture in place and if you want to look for stickers or somebody says stay there in picture that isnt really good enough you dont audit that you audit the motion which made the picture stick you got the idea you always audit the motion never audit the still and that is one of the basic rules of auditing today always audit the motion never audit the still as an auditor then always call for the motion always call for the heat never call for the still and never call for the cold and your pc will be kept very nicely out of groupers okay well i said id give you short one today and almost kept my word thats it thank you
