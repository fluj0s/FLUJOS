shsbc 64 grades of auditors lecture given on 28 september 1961 thank you and this is what audience september 28th its the 28th what month audience september 28 september 61 well you better ask some questions today what question do you have yes female voice i have question i would like to know earlier you said in lecture that to be sure that the terminal is flat you would check it on the prehav scale at sensitivity 16 is that correct hm its an exaggerated check but its all right female voice okay the best way to check to find out whether or not terminal is flat is clean up your rudiments the more practical way is clean up your rudiments and then check it with high sensitivity some people apparently have the idea by the way on flattening rudiments ive noticed one in passing apparently have the idea that rudiment is all levels on the whole prehav scale have to have been run on terminal before it can be considered flat i just wanted to get that one very straight you only flatten those levels on the prehav scale on terminal which react the terminals being assessed with all rudiments in and level reacts of course it is flat but when you check terminal on the prehav scale for level you ought to get all of your rudiments in and then check your past level which you have been running to find out whether or not it still quivers or merely do an assessment it doesnt matter what you see your old level that you were running is still on the prehav scale but before you do any changes with regard to the prehav scale on what you have been running and what you should be running before you do any changes at all get your rudiments in and then check now before you bring terminal or goal to somebody else to be checked you yourself should check it out find out if that is the goal in checking goal that somebody else is going to recheck and then get all the rudiments in and then check it yourself and find out if its active otherwise youre just bunch of useless checking and appointments and that sort of thing but you see theres another way of going about this instead of having the person throwing the responsibility for checking it off on the person who is going to do the checking well take the responsibility yourself for the rudiment factor and then recheck it yourself then when you take the terminal over to somebody else to be checked or the goal whatever it is youre going to get checked youll know for sure that its going to continue to react or not as the case may be in other words youve actually checked it yourself before you had it checked because what does terminal check consist of it consists of goals check it consists of first checking the rudiments you see and then checking the goal or first checking the rudiments then checking the terminal first checking the rudiments then checking the level and when youre doing checking on somebody elses goals or terminals when youre doing this that is the first thing you should do the first and foremost thing you should do properly and at once the person comes in to be checked you check out the rudiments if the rudiments are out you dont check the goal or terminal or level you dont go that far it just gives the pc another invalidation dont you see see because youre actually now checking him with the rudiments out now you as checker do not put the rudiments in you merely find out whether or not they are out and then you give the pc back to the auditor to have the rudiments put in otherwise you are violating the auditors code too many auditors now you should know in this unit particularly you should know how to check terminal check goal and check level and how to patch them up if theyre out you should know this definitely because an hco policy letter has just come out which grades auditors it puts auditors into four classes in hgcs and the whole system depends on their having somebody that has had the saint hill briefing course thats part of the rundown in other words you could never have class ill grading on up the line class i being the lowest class you could never have class iii auditor unless you had had somebody in the organization on the saint hill briefing course because the requirement of it is that they be trained by somebody who has been trained at the saint hill briefing course or of course had been trained on the saint hill briefing course this classifies reclassifies auditors classifies them in four grades this is for purposes of staff use in organizations which youll find this gets very widely reflected part of that bulletin is your lecture of september 26 1961 thats part of the bulletin the lecture i gave you about how to train up auditors in the field ill explain this bulletin to you little bit because itll be in your hands shortly auditor comes in you say what have you had success with he says well ive had success with rising scale processing you say all right thats all you can run on pcs and youll get better you get better pc gains thats all now until this person is ready for and can be checked out as and classified as class ii as an auditor thats all he does he takes process that he himself has had some success with all right whatever process that is as long as its scientology and that is all he is permitted to run on pcs youll find out its ordinarily 8c or its havingness of some kind or its scs and connectedness or its something like this see hell have had some spectacular wins in his own line so what are you doing youre making sure that your staff auditor gets some wins and that your hgc pc gets some wins youre making absolutely sure of this right at the in at the onset now to get an auditor to audit something with which he is not familiar on pc and in which he has confidence of course asks for the auditor to get lose and it asks for the pc then to get lose because hes being audited with an auditor who has absolutely confidence right now class ii auditor is one who has been checked out on the fundamental bulletins which you have to be checked out on with perfect score hes got to have had perfect scores on all of these bulletins and on the tape of the 26 of september 1961 hes got in other words to know security checking cold and if he can pass all those things with perfect score he becomes class ii auditor and all he is permitted to do on anyone is security check them thats all he does he doesnt do anything else and then we have class iii auditor and class iii auditor is one who has had some success in security checking and has done good job of it and who has checked out everything necessary to the handling of routine 3 knows how to assess in other words and knows all this cold and when that person knows all those things cold we dont let him audit these things on pcs while he is learning them you see after hes got them all cold with perfect score we call him class iii auditor all right now he can run then sop goals on pcs but part of that requisite to become class iii auditor is to have been trained at saint hill and have had course completion of course thats understood and i dont think its even mentioned in the bulletin or to have been trained which is mentioned in the bulletin by somebody who has graduated from the saint hill briefing course so central organization couldnt make class iii auditor unless they had somebody present who had been here that was training them all right now that goal and terminal has to be checked out by the saint hill briefing course person we permit none to be run that arent checked out by the saint hill briefing course person in other words goal and terminal that has not been checked out by saint hill graduate cannot be run on on central organization pc thats it bang its nonsense about this because its far far too dangerous its too touchy and you will find that they will run the wildest hobbies you ever heard in doing assessments for instance guy just cant stand the idea of being ship captain so if the pcs goal is to go to sea and the terminal is ship captain he isnt going to let him have it thats it hes always had an ambition you see to be himself hes always had an ambition to be an accountant so he gives him the terminal accountant of course every time you mention accountant it arc breaks the pc so you get reactions so it is obviously the terminal isnt it if you dont think this isnt prevalent in the human race look at the conduct of so many fathers wherever youve had father or mother failing in her goals line she insisted on the child doing life continuum of that and there it is so now thats class iii auditor and once more the requisite is perfect score on examinations and these examinations same type of examination as youre taking here you get constantly examined on these things possibly they wont be constantly examined on these things they will be asked to study these things very hard and pass their examination on them but must be perfect score and the examination must be minute examination you know the niggling the exact word you get down to the exact word that gets pretty grim but its the niggling type of examination of you found some obscure fact way down in the corner of the bulletin that nobody ever noticed before and you ask him that and he fails it and then hes had it see its that type of examination very niggling you know very very nasty how many lines are there on bulletin of he says i never counted them you see well thats it you flunk i mean thats thats going pretty extreme but if they failed to answer perfectly any question you ask them they have flunked it they have flunked the whole examination its very easy to examine this way let point out to you maybe youve been examined this way consistently and continually but you may not have noticed the mechanism you maybe have been so involved with getting examined that you didnt notice how the examination was being done the proper way to examine on these things is the person goes over all of the material as unit that is to say he takes the hcob on which hes being examined he studies this hcob and then he takes his copy of it into the examiner and gives his copy of it to the examiner thats the way he should do it or in case of tape the examiner has the examination and the examiner asks questions until the student flunks and that flunks the whole examination he doesnt ask any further questions after the flunk well this makes for very rapid examination now weve all been supereducated into the idea that it was all right to get 70 percent well ill tell you you cant get 70 percent of question on security check clear you cant have 70 percent of goal right so there goes the old traditional of 70 percent you see it has to be perfect the security check has to be perfect and the goal has to be perfect and the terminal has to be perfect and the level has to be perfect and the auditing command has to be perfect and theres compromising with it so of course you cant compromise with examinations so anyway thats class iii and then you get up to class iv auditor and class iv auditor can do all these other things and can run engrams on assessments and runs sop goals on pcs plus engrams now the rest of this is not discussed in this particular policy letter but i might as well say word or two about it since you will probably all of you sooner or later will receive the full brunt of this thing because we have just launched the campaign which makes clears in hgcs this is the first shot actually the first official noncompromising nomorepeptalk thisiswhatweregoingtodo see i think you will agree that that is very very practical method of going about it because it permits hgc pcs to come in and get results and it permits auditors to get wins and it inhibits flubs now we have grooved training in to point where it isnt changing there isnt anything changing about training hasnt been for quite some time there have been some roundups horse wranglertype activities youll get the full brunt of this when you get back into an area where you are having to train up people and so forth you will do lot of horse wrangling just make sure you dont qanda with the escaping pony extraordinary solutions all of you will err sooner or later all of you will err sooner or later in dreaming up the extraordinary solution to fit the extraordinary case that exceeds all rules youll all err in this direction sooner or later the only thing i ask of you is catch yourself when you find yourself doing it because of course you always get flub with the pc extraordinary solutions are only required when the basics of auditing are violated and that is an extraordinary solution definition of that activity which somebody thinks he ought to do because all the basics of auditing have been flubbed the extraordinary solution in other words we have to do an extraordinary type of process on this particular pc why do we have to do an extraordinary process well thats because we didnt do the basic process this is horse wrangling and you got this crowd of ponies and its out on the wide wideopen prairie and theres fence in any direction and youre trying to tell them theres road here and they know better than that see and they all say well theres road here look theres just wideopen prairie there is track and nobody knows how to do any of it and there isnt any right way and besides there are eight thousand hundred million other ways to do all of these things and they just invent them all the time consistently and continually and you have to keep saying well theres road actually there is road its four lanes its concrete marked with sodiumvapor lights the whole distance you see but theyre odd ponies and theyre blind to this phenomenon theyre blind to the roadway and they say well its just open prairie and you have to keep pointing out the road you know and you point out the road until they themselves have reality on the fact that theres road there you dont make them follow the road because theyre afraid you will hit them thats the naval militarygovernmental method of doing it you take all the revolt out of people by beating them down theres quite another way of handling the whole situation but only bright people can do it and that is you take the randomity out of the situation by pointing out to people that there is fact there is something there there is reality to be gained and you educate them until they gain that reality and you go ahead and work at it and youll eventually find that theyre able to stand up to this and say well what the heck there is reality here well what do you know what do you know theres something to be found out oh well you know i never pay any attention to those trs i mean i just audit you see im just natural and thats why i have my feet over the back of chair and you know and finally in horror one fine day finally in horror they suddenly discover that the reason they dont audit with the trs is because they cant thats the first about the first great discovery that they make you see that they never have gotten an acknowledgment across to pc as long as theyve ever been auditing theres something there to be done up to this time they didnt think there was anything there you see it was just number and this type of thing well there is trick to goals assessment you just ask the fellow what do you like to do in life the fellow says well i dont know id like to have pepsi cola and the fellow says all right well lets see who would have pepsi cola well the fellow says i would and good i all right thats good enough now lets assess it on the prehav scale thats fine all right now i dont happen to have copy of the prehav scale right now think of doing something oh i dont know going going to have pepsi cola all right thats fine thats the level well run where are you where are i going yeah they will do thing like that if they didnt realize that person has just one goal and they just have one terminal and they just have one level they realize that and as soon as they realize that they say oh but wait minute how the hell do you find these things and then will ensue possibly the same cycle that has ensued since february unless you had reality on the fact that it could be found wouldnt find it i mean thats why they werent found i mean theres nothing more esoteric to it than that they didnt think they could be found you know and it was just all good idea but there wasnt any reason to really do anything very serious about it because you know and youll find right here in this unit is occasionally where somebodys terminal has been messed up you know somebody wouldnt let him have his terminal auditor will turn right around and wont let the other fellow have his terminal you have people auditing finding terminals i beg your pardon there was one other condition to class iii auditors class iii auditors had to have had found their goal and terminal theres clause in class ii auditors that isnt there but probably should be they have to have passed full security check that would be very good one to add in probably will get added in anyway its part of class iv the class iv auditor of course has to have had an engram run on his goalsterminal line successfully he has to have had subjective reality on this here action so all of these things are based on subjective realities and your job in instructing and your job in handling such people of course is to keep them steered and sooner or later they will collide with one of these realities you know up to that time its doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt pretended know pretended know pretended know doubt doubt doubt doubt pretended know pretended know doubt doubt doubt doubt well thats just bunch of ponies wandering all over the prairie and they dont think theres any road to travel on and nothing of the sort and any bunch of grass is bunch of grass and criteria in other words its sensibility and you just have to keeep it rounded up and sooner or later one of these here ponies will start walking on the concrete and he will say wa whoa what do you know wait minute wait minute wait minute wait minute i got hoof on something here and they put it over here on the prairie thats different thats different ah haaaa hey hey turn around and tell you you know hey you know theres road here and you you generally being of kind heart you ordinarily respond if he hasnt been an exceptionally dumb pony and youll respond and youll say well yes thats right im awfully glad you find it youll youll be very happy with found it but every once in while hes been particularly obtuse pony and has been kept falling into arroyos and doing other things you see anything but trying to find the road you almost cant restrain yourself from saying you know thats what ive been trying to tell you what did you think that was see kind of make him guilty for being so stupid but the truth of the matter is until they find out this one phenomenon you know that there is something there to walk on and there is something there why they youll just you just cant round them up thats all i mean they have an awful time theyre all over the place and thats what normally happens in hgcs auditors come in they pay lip service to all these things that are supposed to exist and they hope they exist and they got fair reality that they do exist and they think they do exist i hope and then theres reason to do any of them see real reason to do any of them because nobody would ever know whether they had done them or not because actually there are factors are there maybe you get the idea its just all sort of mush so this iv scale is based on certainty and common denominator of it is how certain is the fellow of his mind and you let him walk on certainties the whole line well somebody who has been educated hpahca level has some kind of certainty he winds up with some kind of certainty if he wants to audit at all hes got some kind of certainty something doesnt matter how dim he ran something you wouldnt mind forgetting on somebody and it turned on somatic and so he said thats unusual thats very odd and so he goes home and he gets ahold of his elder brother or something and he says hey he says whats something you wouldnt mind forgetting sit down in the chair yeah whats something you wouldnt mind forgetting whats something you wouldnt mind forgetting yeah good whats something you wouldnt mind forgetting turns on somatic in him you know yeah well theres something here and all of scientology becomes something you wouldnt mind forgetting thats the whole lot there isnt anything else in scientology but just that one process now you as the d of p take this person you put him on staff and you say to him all right now what we want you to do is take this emeter i want you to security check this pc and get this thing all straightened out and i want you to do this i want you to do that i want you to do the other thing and make sure that you get all the rudiments in and so on thats enough for you now lets see now joe how about you person walks off stands in the hall minute and says you want to do this well he knows what he ought to be doing see he ought to be going running this pc on something you wouldnt mind forgetting you see so he does very he tries he tries hard and its all to his credit that he does try hard and that he goes in and he actually tries he tries to follow these instructions and he tries to do these things and thats fine he tries nothing much ever happens either here but he tries where as matter of fact hed be cocky as grenadier if he after the winning battle if he were just told well all right now you see that pc over there well you just take him up to that room there and what process do you have great deal of reality on what have you had some wins with well its something you wouldnt mind forgetting and you say thats fine thats what you run on that pc you just take him right up there in the room happy as clam man of course hell get some results he evidently can run it and most most pcs could benefit from it so what have you got to lose nothing same way with security check person who has had security check run on them doing security check hah youll find people will give you all kinds of reasons why they cant give security checks or they dont want to give security checks or what they dont think security checks are all their doubt doubt doubt doubt pretended know and uncertainties and so forth all come up in horrendous black tornado right about the time you say do security check whats basically wrong is that the individual doesnt have any reality on security check ever doing anything for anybody and of course has withholds you get person with lot of withholds doing security check and they do fantastically oddball job very peculiar very peculiar job let tell you theyre going to make all kinds of flubs well theyre all natural the flubs are just natural and they will usually leave questions unflat on which they themselves have withholds all kinds of oddball things occur so person has to know security checking cold and also as should be in the policy letter should have complete clean hands on security checks before you turn them loose on class ii things now youll find out that they get their best results on pcs by security checking and they can security check this way by the time theyre all groomed up on security checking and they know theyve had lots of experience with security checking and that sort of thing why they get very fancy with it indeed and you can do some very fancy things with security checking oddly enough because we havent pushed security checks very hard not even you have have the total reality on what fantastic things you can do with security check youve got reverse reality you know what weird things can happen to case who does gather up whole bunch of withholds he hasnt let go of see youve got that reality well theres another reality there to be found and that is what you can actually do with person with security check on the positive side of the ledger and thats pretty pretty wide and now that ive pointed this up to you im sure youre slugging ahead and doing something with it and all of sudden the stars will be dawning in all directions and as far as routine 3 is concerned well what the hell its too wild to even contemplate until youve found pcs goal and terminal skip it man till person really knows his business and has found goal and terminal on the pc they will do all sorts of wild things and the first wild thing they will do is take forever to assess why do they take forever to assess well they know it isnt there they dont think its there they dont really realize its there they havent any reality that they will be able to do it they get very disheartened these forever assessments are hinged on the rudiments being out that is the mechanical fact but the background music to it actually is that they dont think its possible otherwise they would be in there pitching theyre wandering all over the prairie you see and theres road and when they get reality on the fact the pc has one goal the pc has one terminal the pc has one level and other doesnt have two and when they suddenly get that as reality why youll have people who can do some routine 3 work as far as engrams are concerned its absolutely catastrophic to take somebody who has never had an engram run and ask him to run an engram that is wild if you want randomity just set that going once youve had an engram run why you can run engrams well i just wanted to give you this particular rundown i know this will be put into effect by central organizations particularly because the first association secretary that heard about it at once added something to it and said well that is an opportunity to to change the pay scale of staff auditors very highly practical consideration and thats sufficiently practical consideration that will back up the the sensibilities of it and there we go this is our first elephantsolid step in the direction of full hgc clearing now id better say something about the workability of this in running any kind of clinic or group of auditors because all of you whether you like it or not will wind up somewhere in that direction whether in central organizations or otherwise and that is that the auditor who have gone through class i and class ii and class iii and is now class iii you would say then that auditor all that auditor did you see was do the full of routine 3 well thats not necessarily true you see this auditor could do the assessment could do the assessment and could handle the assessment factors and handle some of the basic runs but wouldnt have to handle the security checks because you got auditors around that can handle the security checks dont you see so pc could then be audited by two auditors one who is class ii and one who is class iii and then supposing you had one class iv in the whole shop well when engrams got ready to be run hed run them you see how that could work out now thats apparently at first glance violation of the auditors code but it isnt because youre not changing the auditor on what the pc is auditing this is an interesting point in other words if you change the pcs auditor on what the pc is being audited on you will have trouble but you can always have somebody else running something else and that happens very often its only when that becomes withhold that it becomes very disastrous being audited every night by one auditor and arent telling the other auditor in the daytime that theyre being audited on the same thing and this really gets to be quite mishmash and that is upsetting but you can do this other one you can push pc into the hgc and you would let him be run for while until you had somebody who could do something else about it by class i auditor and then you get class ii auditor devoted to it on something on the order of twoandahalf hours day or something like that you see and you can give him general run on scs and connectedness or something in the morning and in the afternoon theyd be getting security checked by class ii auditor you see you could split it up this way and then that could move over to where class iii auditor was doing the morning you see and class ii auditor doing the afternoon and that way you could handle more pcs with more advantage in other words you could mix up the auditors on pc and you could straighten this thing out and you keep the pcs moving and youd find out this was quite successful and the fact glares now that hgcs must start clearing and this is very firm forward motion in that particular direction and it hinges on this saint hill briefing course well if theres anything you dont know about checking terminals or anything you dont know about this particular thing before you get out of here you certainly better find out because youll find yourself in lot of embarrassment someplace or another because youre supposed to know and of course ill help you out ill say well when they leave here they know all about it yes yes well i know yes bob was here for quite while he was here all summer yes he certainly knows all about that yes well you just ask him and the only esoteric thing that youre going to run into is youre going to run into the imponderables the pc who doesnt move the pc who doesnt respond the pc who just nothing happens with and your temptation because that is what is being urged on you all the time by class i auditor your temptation is consistently to dream up an extraordinary solution there is your first temptation i know i did it for years and so on finally recognized what i was doing and your only fault is not recognizing what youre doing go ahead and dream one or two up and lay gorgeous egg but recognize what youre doing youre avoiding the fundamentals and cutting it in someplace else with some extraordinary solution of some kind or another it is always gross auditing error i dont care what the staff auditor said he was doing i dont care what the field auditor said he was doing that had nothing to do with it if that case isnt moving there is gross error it is always gross error and when you think up an ordinary solu extraordinary solution you just perpetuate the gross error and thats why the extraordinary solution is wrong you havent actually found out what was going on gross error ill give you an idea clear down in south africa two cases not moving on cchs absolutely not moving not moving not moving not moving not moving not moving any way shape or form nothing happening that sort of thing and this couldnt be called at first glance gross error because the cchs youre just supposed to run the case dont you see well actually the gross error was the cchs were being run wrong or they would have done it it was simple wasnt it see we so we got datum in our laps to the effect the cchs arent working on two cases well our first impulse is to say well lets do something else that is new and marvelous and strange because the cchs arent working your first job in rounding up ponies is to find out what theyre doing never take what the pony said he was doing find out what he was doing and that is very often somebody who has low reality on his tools will often tell you with good faith that he has done all that and you have to have closer checkup on it now that by the way was solved down in south africa it was actually solved not by doing the cchs right it happens to have been solved by the instructor going in and just asking these people if they had present time problems and just cleaning up the rudiments and asking them with real pressure and going really at it and discovering that they both did have and blowing grief charges off both of them on their present time problems and after that even these misrun cchs worked well that was an extraordinary solution but didnt necessarily get cchs working did it so theres datum sitting there that the cchs wouldnt work on cases with present time problems yes the cchs would work if run right on people with present time problems but the easiest way to have done it in this particular instance of course would have been to have put the rudiments in even though you were running the cchs if anybody had ever done that they would have found out something but that is not particularly gross error thats just mishmash see the gross error of course cchs werent run right of course you can always do something for case by putting the rudiments in so these two things go together and but we have misunderstanding when we come out at the other end of it and that is to say the misunderstanding is the cchs dont work on some cases well thats the misunderstanding yes the cchs run wrong dont work on most cases you sit somebody down and pump his hand for seventyfive hours and nothing happens youre violating the auditors code in all directions youre running process that is flat youre running process that isnt producing change well there you are all right let tell you some more extraordinary solutions an extraordinary solution the pc we just cant clue what this pc is doing we just havent got an idea what this pc is doing the pc god knows well we just keep running this and and it just dont know exactly actually we found the pcs goal and we found the pcs terminal and it all seems to be all right but nothing has happened well i dont know there must be some other level to the prehav scale that were not running lets see lets pc responds to indignity all right well run the level of the prehav scale indignity that must be about the way it is yes well well try that and after weve wasted dozen auditing hours well we try something else and after weve wasted twentyfive more we try something else and after weve wasted fifty more we try something else what was wrong in the first place gross auditing error since finding the pcs terminal from there on the pc had never done the auditing command now that is the most gross auditing error there is there is more gross auditing error than that to give pc command which the pc does not then execute isnt that simple so how do you think dreaming up new levels to the prehav scale is going to do anything for this pc who has never done any level of the prehav scale even after it was assessed huh now where is this going to come out how is this going to make things right by adding new errors onto old errors were going to wind up with what new errors so there is more gross error than an auditor auditing pc who is not doing the auditing command now lets define what is not doing the auditing command all right not doing the auditing command is defined as simply not executing it or doing something else or executing the auditing command indifferently and then doing something else you know they say well have you ever have you ever shot duck you know and the pc says thinks to himself dimly well yes ive shot duck and then applies it to his lumbosis which is hurting him today and says well lets see i wonder if there could be any shot in the lumbosis i get the idea of mocking up some shot in the lumbosis yeah all right that didnt work okay see the pc is not being audited the pc is is answering the commands and selfauditing hes doing two things you could say not executing the auditing command technically could be expressed is not doing it and not just doing it not just doing it now when pc has present time problem of long duration the pc will have hidden standard and every auditing command which is given to the pc the pc then audits something else in ordder to affect the hidden standard and theyll do it every time the pc had headache so you give the pc an auditing command and then the pc has figured out that if he audits the mass against his stomach that this will affect his head so the pc then does the auditing command against the mass of the stomach only and then sits back to find out if it has done anything for his head and matter what you say to the pc matter what command you give to the pc the pc does these things he receives the auditing command thinks about it for moment gives you some kind of response then applies it to the ridge in his stomach and then checks to find out whether or not it has affected his head so he hasnt just done the auditing command see hes done lot of things the first time mary sue ran into this down in south africa as very fine example of this and really punched it into view was auditing somebody who was had been audited for just oh lord you know just tremendous numbers of hours and everybody had been thinking up extraordinary solutions for this fellow extraordinary absolutely extraordinary i mean the most marvelous solutions had been thought of for this fellows case catalog of them would have filled the wall you know and just shelf after shelf of books to all these beautiful solutions there was only one difficulty the case had never done anything but audit an electronic incident in an effort to change his sex matter what was said to the pc the pc then audited to the electronic incident because he knew that if he got rid of the electronic incident then his sex would change and for literally hundreds of hours actually the pc had never done anything else the pc then had present time problem of long duration he did not want to be man it was terrible problem to this pc to be man so this was all the pc ever did now that is more broadly understood by the fact that any pc who has present time problem particularly present time problem of long duration will use the auditing command to resolve the problem matter what the auditing command is how do you like that and thats why you cant audit up against present time problem and thats why you cant leave present time problems of long duration just floating because the pc will never do the auditing command they always do something else so thats the most fundamental error that could exist and you could go on thinking up solutions until your hair was down to your knees and you wouldnt ever have the pc doing anything but just sitting there unchanged interesting hm you must be inquisitive you must find out what the pc is doing now if you have to find out too often and too much what the pc is doing you obviously have confidence that your rudiments are in well doesnt that follow because if the rudiments were all in the person wouldnt have present time problem of long duration or short duration awfully simple isnt it now the pc who applies the auditing command to specific target may or may not ever apply the auditing command to the terminal you just got through assessing isnt that fascinating that is very disheartening the pc with present time problem of long duration will apply an auditing command not to their own terminal but to the terminal which is troubling them and this may be the wrong terminal so you think you are auditing ghost and you are busily auditing sixteeninch gun i mean thats as stupidly simple as that see youre not running the pcs terminal thats all and thats the gross auditing error every time the pc answers the auditing question you eventually find out from the pc realizing the pc is stalled in some fashion and has been for some time you see you got great apparency that you can get going these days marvelous apparency you see the security check the pc is getting can give him case advance so you look at the case advance the pc is getting from security check and you attribute it to the auditing youre giving the pc because the pc isnt receiving any auditing from you you see how that could work out the pc is receiving auditing from security check whether youre giving it or not but you think by running his terminal the pc is getting an advance well the pc isnt getting an advance if hes not doing the auditing command he might not be running terminal he might not have any idea of the terminal always good thing to ask the pc if they can get an idea of this terminal and what is their idea of this terminal as they run it and so forth and youll find out very rapidly that the terminal they are running is not the terminal you have just got through assessing isnt that fascinating well we get some kind of case going where this fellow is auditing being audited on on skin diver and thats dandy hes having marvelous time on skin diver but every time he answers the auditing command he actually applies it to mary ann well hes in state of non compos mentis he isnt thinking in this zone its not his fault because he is frozen in this particular zone he is irrational on this particular point of course or it wouldnt be his terminal so you ask him one day you you notice hes not making any progress and you decide its his security checks that are giving him the progress not the running of the terminal and you get very bright you have long blue streak of lightning you see you get this marvelous idea and you say it just may be theres gross auditing error here now that is the first idea you ought to get with regard to the pc who is not making progress whether youre auditing on via through some other auditor or whether youre supervising auditing very casually or whether youre doing it yourself if youre not getting progress you should think to yourself theres gross auditing error here of some kind or another and the first and foremost one is that the pc isnt doing the auditing command thats the first thing you should search out and you get this long bright blue spark and you say to the pc you say who do you think of when i say have you ever destroyed skin diver and the pc thinks for long time theres quite comm lag and says well i think of mary ann and youd say well is mary ann skin diver and you get another long comm lag and the pc then says come to think about it mary ann is not skin diver mary ann has never had anything to do with skin diving now i know that sounds completely idiotic but then youre handling zone and sphere of idiocy everyone is very bright until he gets on the subject of his exact goal and terminal and then hes complete idiot so there you go so having asked this burning question dont say then snarlingly well after this after this when i ask you the auditing command apply it to skin diver you know that would be the wrong way to go about it because obviously the pc is incapable of doing so and you just asked him to spring up to the top of the empire state building in swan dive from the pavement he cant do this so you give him kind of lose now you say well what cooks with this mary ann oh i dont know if ive ever told you but she and i had lot of trouble all right that that would be the way to go youre auditing somebody with present time problem of long duration youre not auditing somebodys terminal your rudiments are out even though theyre not registering as out they dont register as out because the thing is totally submerged the thing is completely out of sight so therefore you have to supplement rudiments with interrogation and what kind of interrogation do you have to do you have to ask the pc well what would have to happen to you in order to find out if scientology worked you know it comes right back to that thing oh well i have to get over this trouble with mary ann there it is present time problem of long duration this can give you lot of trouble present time problem of long duration and could have given you much more trouble few weeks ago than it would now because now with your security check aspect of the broad tool security check is very broad tool you have the rule of the prior confusion and that is one you must remember because he is not fixated on mary ann at all mary ann is the solution to problem of which mary ann had part and you can audit mary ann till hell freezes over and you wont free the pc from mary ann why mary ann is the one piece of paper that was motionless while all other pieces of paper moved its the rule of the prior confusion the broken leg the broken leg is the solution to the confusion believe it or not it is and that is hooked and it violates the rule of auditing the stillness dont audit stillnesses audit motion well what is there motionful about broken leg there it lies pointing the wrong way its awfully still and its sure been still ever since hasnt it its gone on for some years being still guys got psychosomatic now called broken leg only its not called broken leg its called an articulo metalosis of the tibia female voice of the what thats very interesting the one you didnt get is proper word for leg anyway here we go chronic somatic then from viewed from security check basis is solution to prior confusion always its never considered otherwise now how do you get rid of one i can tell you how to get rid of one today as i told you the other day but i can repeat it its very simple activity what do you do you find the prior confusion by assessment what confusion reacts the most on the meter just prior to mary ann the broken leg or anything else the pc is using in running what is the prior confusion you assess it and you find out that just before mary ann turned up god help us it looked like the battle of gettysburg at high speed yeah man it really was motionful and whatever it was whatever it was that assessed out you take that series of personnel and run security checks on them and you never run any security check at all on mary ann or the broken leg now earlier we were making very slow but positive progress by running security checks on mary ann or pardon not security checks but running ow on mary ann running ow on legs and we were getting someplace we were getting someplace that was doubt about that very slow but very positive we could run ows against fellows bad ear you know whats he done to an ear what has he withheld from an ear and so forth we would have gotten someplace but now this new data has turned up that the ear well the new data that turned up is i had to find out for ever and aye whether you ever audited stillnesses and i find out you dont and of course this is the stillest stillness you ever heard of this ears been floating through time it isnt even moving on the time track its awfully still isnt it so obviously youve got to find the confusion for which the ear is stable datum and our tools are now adequate and our sessioning is now adequate with rudiments in to actually audit confusions you can hold the pc insession which you might not have been able to do some little time ago so what do you do you find the prior confusion and the personnel and objects involved in the prior confusion and you security check them you find out what the pc did to them and how the pc tried to make them guilty and you find out all about it and now when youve done that security check you will find out mary ann has blown and the broken leg is now moving on the track which is quite an interesting thing now look at what this pc is doing its not ever as flagrant as this pc whos doing this is having hell of time lets see now if my ear got well then i would know that the auditing which is being done on is working every time he does an auditing command he looks over to see if his ear gets well he does an auditing command see if his ear gets well then he thinks hell audit something else in order to see if his ear got well then hell audit something else and hell have something else as target which he doesnt tell you anything about and then he looks back to see if his ear got well hell hes not insession hes running selfaudit also he must be running some kind of weird oddball mechanism called doubt he must be doubting everything that is happening he must be in hell of lot of doubt going on of one kind or another for this sort of thing to be going on he has positiveness and he has assurance therefore he has confidence therefore theres boost to anything that is happening so therefore its all slow freight through arkansas i mean hes not going to have anything happen so you got now the rule of the prior confusion now thats his present time problem of long duration find the present time problem confusion the confusion that went before the present time problem of the long duration and youve got it now this even might apply to engrams it might be that the person is stuck in some portion of an engram as solution to the confusion which went before and maybe it forecasts new way to run engrams which is to say you dont run the engram you find out where the fellow is stuck and then you assess the prior confusion and having assessed the prior confusion why you could run security check type action on that and the engram would blow thats that forecasts it for engrams but im i dont have any experimental data on it its just theoretical this other is not theoretical this other is quite factual that it is the prior confusion which sticks person into present time problem of long duration now he cannot confront that prior confusion and so he has his attention stuck you see on something he can confront and youd be surprised but thetans can confront busted heads bad legs hopeless love affairs the japanese oh the japanese ever show you what thetan will do the japanese are too you know and i would love to see you i would i would just love to to see your reactions to real honesttogoodness not fakedup for export but real honesttogoodness japanese movie real sound movie from japan for home consumption i would love to see your reaction to it because in the first place i could tell you about it but you still wouldnt believe it its not something on which anybody could have reality because i myself the first time i ever saw one i said this is impossible and i sat all the way through the thing and i hadnt seen it at all because it was all impossible and it was mostly for practice in understanding japanese customs and frame of mind and also practice obliquely in speaking japanese but the next one i saw id already seen it happen once so there was probability that it could happen again and i realized that when i had heard and read of things like this when i was kid around the pacific that i had just notised them they were just total notis i didnt believe anybody ever considered this drama and yet there it was well their fairy tales are very easy to get hold of very easy to read but they dont exaggerate it to the degree that the japanese has got it exaggerated now in the later days of his civilization oh ill give ill give you plot of movie in japan i mean it runs like this the soldier comes home from the wars and greets his girl and then he goes off to the wars and is killed you are now at about ten feet deep in the film you may not even have seen him this we are suddenly collided with we suddenly collide with this immediately after the titles were were acquainted with this almost immediately after we find out that it was directed by kobi mitsuyu this is totally incidental and now my god we have five reels where she does nothing but wander across scenes and areas where she has seen him before he died and thats the movie and of course the western mind is educated to bunch of action and then finally why she receives the news that her lover is dead and she lies down on the bed and cries and that is the end of the film and thats very modern and very something or other thats thats really something marvelous you know thats very tragic picture to us you see very dramatic very dramatic not to japan the whole picture now takes place now it takes place see you have hell of time sorting out who this fellow was all this is incidental the action is entirely missing there is action beautiful photography have these circular bridges and so forth and cherry blossoms and the cherry blossoms are falling blossom by blossom you know and the circular bridge and she is reflected in the water and then shes standing on the bank you see and she looks into the water and she doesnt see her own reflection she sees his face and then she walks on and this goes on for about five reels coo man you read about these things of course theyll give you westernized version of the plot and theyll say well her lover was an aviator and he got killed bombing the saratoga and so on and this broke her heart and she became geisha girl thats the plot and you say well there must be you know and you get the idea of rahahahahah aaaa and all this kind of thing well it has nothing to do with the picture we dont even find out the guys name you know well thats grief engram stuck after the fact of action and you can run it till hell freezes over of course and theres action in it youre running the still theres the still so of course if there isnt any action in it whats keeps holding it in place it must be the confusion which occurred before the action actually it wouldnt have occurred if there hadnt been all that action well the japanese can longer face any kind of action not even in war could they face action they went out and did the most suicidal things they could face death and they could face that very well because it was good and still i know i spent about four years making myself numbers of enemies amongst naval officers in the west by trying to tell them something about japan and i dont think theyve even grasped it yet but the japanese of course hes already in still and he obsessively duplicates and so forth theyre not bad people long way to but they they very easily slide into this particular band they shudder off of the motion they shudder off of the confusion and theye
