necessary authorizing signatures made the actual purchase and processed the associated paperwork to critics this process was inefficient especially for small purchases not only was it time consuming

mandatory and card use did not initially grow as rapidly as some had expected5 in 1993 however report issued by the national performance review npr sparked number of legislative and regulatory reforms intended to increase purchase card use the npr was clinton administration initiative headed by vice president gore that sought to reinvent the federal government by making government operations both less expensive and more effective6 one of the nprs objectives was to identify opportunities to streamline number of governmentwide processes including procurement drawing on input from expert s in the public and private sectors the initial report of the npr recommended expanding the use of purchase cards across the government step it said would low er costs and reduce bureaucracy in small purchases7 in separate report that focu sed solely on procurement the npr estimated that if half of all small acquisitions were made using purchase cards the government would realize 180 million in

and approval processes one of the primary safeguards against improper use of government purchase cards is the review and approval of cardholder tr ansactions by someone other than the cardholder as noted purchase card aos are usually re sponsible for reviewing the cardholders monthly statement given that the ao is often the only person other than the cardholder to assess the validity of purch ase before payment is made to the purchase card vendor the review and approval process is considered one of the most critical components of an agen cys purchase card control nvironment steven kutz gaos managing director of forensic aud its and special investigations stated in testimony before the senate basic fraud prevention concepts and our previous audits of purchase card programs have shown that opportunities for fraud and abuse arise if cardholders know that their purchases ar not being properly reviewed26 despite the importance of the aos role in preventing and detecting improper purchases some agencies have failed to ensure that cardhol der statements were carefully reviewed prior to their approval at the department of education auditors estimated that 37 of monthly cardholder st atements they revi ewed had not been approved by the ao27 most recently gao reported that nearly one of every six purchase card transactions governmentw ide had not been properly authorized28 even when aos did conduct reviews th ey often failed to meet government standards agencies are required by omb to ensure that cardhol der statements are compared with supporting documentation such as invoices and r eceipts as part of the review process29 this is necessary because purchase card statements are rarely itemized they usually provide only the st ore or contractor name and the amount charged for aos receipts nd invoices are the principa l means of verifying what items were purchased and determining whether those items were for legitimate program purposes many

whom and why30 similarly 2004 audit of the ve terans health administrations vhas purchase card program estimate d that 313 million of its transactions lacked key supporting documentation31 one consequence of these weaknesse s is that fraudulent and abusive transactions may slip through the revi ew process unnoticed for instance gao found that aos at agencies across th government have approved cardholder statements that included transactions th at should have been questioned such as purchases of jewelry home furnishings cruise tickets ectronics and other consumer goods at the forest service one employee used her purchase card over period of years to accumulate more than 31000 in jewelry and electronics32 similarly hud cardholders spent 27000 at partment stores like macys and jcpenney in single year33 in one egregious case an faa employee had his statement approved even though it showed he violated agency policy by charging cash advances to his purchase card while at casino34 the want of adequate oversight is also evident where aos have approved duplicate transactions vendors charging the government twice for the same goods or services and purchases made by some one other than the cardholder one audit identified an estimate d 177187 in duplicate charges at one agency35 an audit at the federal aviation administration faa discovered that car dholder had allowed unauthorized individuals to charge over 160000 to her purchase card account36 when unauthorized and duplicate transactions are identified by the ao they should be disputed under the process described

further found that many agencies fail to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of their purchase card controls responsibility that is often assigned to the apc monitoring and evaluation may include sampling purchase card transacti ons for potentially improper purchases ensuring purchase card policies are being properly implemented across the agency or component and assessing program results these dutie s are often unfulfilled at faa for example an audit found that apcs generally were not utilizing available reports to detect misuse and fraud nor was the headquarters apc taking steps to

requi red by us department of agriculture regulations38 lack of separation of duties agencies are required to ensure that key procurement functions are handled by di fferent individuals when having goods shipped for example the same person s hould not both approve and place the order or both place the order and receive the goods at many agencies however the cardholder may perform two functions that should be separated which increases the possibility that items may be purchased for personal use lost or stolen in march 2008 gao estimated that agencies were unabl to document separation of duties for one of every three purchase card transactions39 three navy cardholders ordered and received 500000 of goods for themselves w ith their purchase cards before getting caught40 in this way inadequate separation of duties may contribute to millions of dollars of items that agencies have purchas ed which cannot be located items that are easily converted to personal use commonly referred

house h r 1395 on march 7 2007 the bill was drafted to implement the recommendations of gao regarding internal control weaknesses in both purchase and travel card programs53 the bill would require all federal agencies except the department of defense to implement more than dozen internal controls over th eir purchase card programs54 specifically the bill would require agencies to ensure that

would require the secretary of defense to implement policies that ensure inve ntory and property systems are updated promptly after pilferable propert is bought with purchase card56 other considerations staffing levels few agencies are able to dedicate employees to work full time as aos rather ao duties which include timeintensive activities such as reviewing cardholder statements often fall to staff who already have full workloads not surprisingly some aos have said it is difficult to find the time to carefully review purchase card statements because of the demands of their other responsibilities57 this problem may be com pounded if the number of cardholders assigned to an ao referred to as the span of control increases there is governmentwide span of control polic but gao has recommended that agencies assign more than seven cardholders to each ao beyond that 71 ratio the ability of the ao to conduct effective oversight ma be diminished par ticularly when the ao has other significant duties58 although data are limited audits have found that at some agencies the span of c ontrol exceeds gaos recommendation in 2006 according to gao 2150 purchase card holde rs at the department of homeland security nearly 20 of dhss total number of cardholders were managed by aos with span of control in excess of 7159 additional research might be useful for determining whether aos are hindered in their ability to provide effective oversight due to either the num ber of accounts they are expected to monitor or to the demands of their other duties or both
