special education and related services each child receiving rvices has an individual education program iep created by an iep team delineating the specific special education and related services to be provided to meet his or her needs the statute so contains detailed due process provisions to ensure the provi sion of fape originally enacted in 1975 pl 94142 the act responded to increased awareness of the need to educate children with disabilities and to judicial decisions requiring that states provide an education for children with disabilities if they provided an education for children without disabilities2 paperwork is required to imp lement many of these st atutory provisions and the requirements have often been criticized as being overly burdensome it should be noted that the term paperwork encompasses activities and processes that may not involve paper products in addition to wr itten forms such as plans and report cards the term often includes meetings and other personal interactions administrative duties as well as computerized recordkeeping some may define the term more broadly to including any activity that does not provide direct instruction to pupils others would counter that some noninstru ctional requirements of idea are just as important as direct instruction to ensu re that children with disabilities receive appropriate educa tional services reducing

additional paperwork and administrative burdens for example states are now permitted to use 10 of funds reserved for statelevel activities to create risk pools to assist in aiding highneed children with disabilities pl 108446 611e3 to use idea funds for this purpose state must develop and annually review and amend as necessary state plan that among other requirements estab lishes participation criteria and develops funding mechanism elements of the plan ch as determining definition of high need require coordination with local educational agen cies leas developi ng and revising such plan as

teachers schools local educational agencies and states should be re lieved of irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational outcomes5 in addition both the house and senate committee reports6 for pl 108446 note that reducing paperwork is an impor tant aim of the legislation in its concluding remarks the house report states that the legislation centers on the committees principles for reform which among other thin gs includes reducing paperwork7 the senate report notes that one of the ways the legisla tion would improve idea is to reduce bureaucratic

average each meeting takes 1½ hours12 although only 35 of speci education teachers conduct evaluations of children with disabilities those who do spend nearly 12 hours per month conducting assessments and re viewing assessment information13 provisions in pl 108446 relating to paperwork paperwork reduction pilot program pl 108446 adds paperw ork reduction pilot progra m 609 in order to provide an opportunity for states to iden tify ways to reduce paperwork burdens and other administrative duties that are directly associated with the requirements of this title in order to increase the time and resources available for instruction and other activities aimed at improving educational and functional results for children with disabilities this program permits the secretary to waive for up to four years statutory or regulatory requirements excep t civil rights requirements that applying states link to excessive paperwork or ot her noninstructional burde ns these waivers may be granted to up to 15 states the st atutory provision is not to be construed to affect the right of child with disability to receive fape or to permit state or local educational agency to waive the proce dural safeguards in section 615 of the act the secretary of education is to include in the annual report to congress information relating to the effectiveness of the waivers in reducing the paperwork burden and reducing noni nstructional time spent by teachers in complying with the act enhancing longerterm educational planning improving positive outcomes for children with disabilities promoting

expanding the use of technology in the iep process15 children with disabiliti in private schools child with disability may be placed in private school by the lea or state education agency sea as means of fulfilling the fape requirement for the child in which case the cost is paid for by the lea child with disability may also be unilaterally placed in private school by his or her parents in the latter situation the cost of the private school placement is not paid by the lea unless hearing officer or court makes certain findi ngs however idea does require some services for children in private schools even if they ar unilaterally placed there by their parents exactly what these services are or should be has been contentious subject for many years the 1997 reauthorization of idea expanded on the private school provisions and the 2004 reauthorization includes severa l changes to the provisions relating to children who are placed in private school by their parents the provisions relating to children placed in private schools by public agencies were not changed generally children with di sabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools are to be provided special edu cation and related services to the extent consistent with the number and location of such children in the school district served by lea pursuant to several require ments 612a10ai this provision was changed from previous law by the addition of the requirement that the children attending private school be located in the school distri ct served by the lea the senate report described this change as an effort to streamline and simplify the provision of services to parentallyplaced private school children with disab ilities by protecting leas from having to work with private schools located in multiple jurisdictions when students attend private schools across district lines16 elimination of schoolbased improvement plan pl 108446 eliminated provision in th previous law that allowed public school to

require parental c onsent for reevaluations initiated by the lea unless the parent fails to respond after the lea has taken reasonable measures to obtain such consent 614c3 21 pl 10517 614a2a 22 srept 185 108th cong 1st sess 2425 2003ineffective the senate report further observed schools can undertake school improvement activities and realize improved educational and transitional results for children with disabilities wit hout incurring the additional administration and paperwork burdens require d under this authority18 reevaluations leas19 are required to conduct full and i ndividual initial evaluation of child before special education and rela ted services are provided and to conduct reevaluations as warranted to determine if the education and services provided require revisions or if the child long er needs special education and related services reevaluations are required if th childs teacher or parent makes request or if the lea determines that the child s educational and service needs academic achievement or functiona l performance warrants reevaluation 614a220 for example reevaluation might be warrant ed if the childs performance in school significantly improves suggesting that he or she longer requires special education and related services or if the child is not making progress toward the goals set out in his or her iep indicating that changes are needed in the education or related services the lea is providing the prior version of idea required that reevaluations take place at least every three years21 pl 108446 permits the parent and the lea to override this requirement if they agree that reevaluation is not necessary in addition pl 108446 prohibits reevaluati ons more frequently than once year unless the parent and the lea agree the senate report states in the interest of parents children and school districts the committee believes that requiring costly and timeconsuming reevaluations when both parents and local educational agencies deem them to be unnecessa ry is counterproductive22 the individualized education program contents of the iep the iep is the blueprint for the education and related services that the lea provides for child with disability together with the goals academic assessment procedures and placemen t of the child 614d pl 108446 continues to require an articulation of the childs current academic and functional performance levels and discussion of measurable annual goals however complaints about burdensome ieps led to several changes in previous law the house report states that one of the top goals for the committee is to reduce the unnecessary complications and pr ocesses involved in the iep in order to give parentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32931crs6 23 hrept 77 108th congress 1st sess 110

children with the most severe cognitive disabilities that the elementary and secondary education act regulations permit to be assessed based on alternative achievement standards for the purposes of determining adequate yearly progress ayp this group is estimated to be about 10 of the total population of children with disabilities 26 srept 185 108th congress 1st sess 2829 2003greater control over the iep and to make the process more efficient and more effective for children their parents and teachers23 notable change from previous law is the elimination of the requirement for benchmarks and shortterm objectives for all children with disabilities24 except those who are the most severely cognitively disabled25 614d1aiicc the senate report notes that benchmarks were eliminated due to their paperwork burden on schools while benchmarks and shortterm objectives are thought by some to help track the childs progress their inclusion in ie ps contributes greatly to the paperwork burden on educators and parents and ofte n bears relationship to the nonlinear reality of childs development special education practice via shortterm objectives too often focuses on achieving only small incremental improvements in student performance to the detriment of more effective longer range planningboth educati on officials and the presidents commission on excellence in special education have found that sic benchmarks and shortterm objectives to be unnecessary and time consuming the committee expects that eliminating the requirements for benchmarks and shortterm objectives will reduce unproductive paperwork and allow greater attention to be focused on the childs annual iep goals and on the methods of measuring progress and reporting that progress to parents in meaningful way26 pl 108446 adds rule of construction that additional information is required for the iep beyond that explicitly required in 614 and that information in one part of the iep need not be containe d in another part 614d1aii the senate report notes that th is addition was made to re duce the paperwork burden on teachers the committee is greatly concerned about the paperwork burden experienced by teachers and other education personnel in c onnection with writing ieps lengthy and complex ieps are not necessa rily beneficial to students if they create confusion and take teachers away from instructional time with children the committee has examined number of actual ieps and has discovered that many items in those documents are not required by federal idea law while it has proven difficult to determine the source or sources generating this additional paperwork the committee wants to ensure that the federal law does not contribute to this problem therefore section 614d1aii provides that nothing in the section shall be construe d to require that additional information be included in an iep beyond what is explicitly required in the section the bill retains an existing provision ensuring th at the iep team does not need to includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32931crs7 27 ibid pp 3031 28 for child moving from the infants and toddlers program under part c of idea pl

committee so recognizes that section 617 requires the department of education to develop model iep suitable for adoption by state or lea which will accommodate the committees desire for streamlined straightforward expression of only th requirements mandated by this act however the committee does not intend to eliminate the requirement to individualize an iep based on each childs own unique needs27 the iep team the iep team is composed of the parents of child with disability one or more speci education teachers one or more regular education teachers if appropriate and othe r lea representatives 614d1b28 pl 108 446 made additions and alterations to the iep team requirements aime d at reducing paperwork and other burde ns of the iep process pl 108446 permits members of the iep team to be excused from iep meetings if the parent and the lea agree 614d1c if the meeting topic does not deal with the members areas of concern there are further requirements if the meeting deals with the excused members areas he or she must provide written input to the parent and to the team in all cases the parents agreement or consent must be obtained in writing this provision was added to address the concern that the amount of time spent preparing for and ttending iep meetings and the number of individuals required to attend such m eetings reduces the amount of time that personnel spend with students29 the change was described as key provision that empowers parents to make important deci sions about their childs education and allows local educational agencies to be tter utilize their personnel who are not needed for particular meeting30 the iep process idea requires that each lea have an iep for each child with disability in place at the begi nning of the school year 614d2a pl 108446 added requirements for childre n who transfer from one school district to another during the school year 614 d2c for those children changing districts within state the new lea must provide services comparable to those described in the previous iep until it dopts the previous iep or develops and implements new iep for children transferring between states the new lea must also continue comparable services until it conducts an evaluation of the child if the lea determines it to be necessary and dev elops new iep if appropriate that is consistent with federal and state law 614d2ci

iep meeting may be made via written document without holding an iep meeting 614d3d this change wa s made to eliminate the requirement of reconvening an iep team which requires coordinating the schedules of number of people and often forces parent to take off work to attend31 the previous requirement was seen as so burdensome th at often changes that could benefit student are simply not made32 in addition leas are encouraged to consolidate reevaluation meetings with iep meet ings for other purposes if possible 614d3e this change the senate report notes was made in order to ease time burdens for parents school pers onnel and related service providers33 finally changes to the iep may be made by amending it rather than completely redrafting the document 614d3f pl 108446 also permits lternatives to physical meetings such as video conferencing and conference telephone calls these altern atives can take the place of physical iep meetings and administrative meetings related to

secretary of education is authorized to approve demonstration proposals from up to 15 states these demonstrations would allow parents and leas to adopt ieps covering up to three years that coincide

points the iep team must review the iep at each transition point and annually to determine if progress is being made toward annual goals more frequent reviews are re quired if sufficient progress is not being made beginning in 2006 nd annually thereafter the secretary must report on the effectiveness of the demons tration programs these reports must include discussion of the effectiven ess of the

the differences relate to confusion regarding what the act requires each of these model forms w ill help inform local educational agency efforts as they develop their own forms and will result in
