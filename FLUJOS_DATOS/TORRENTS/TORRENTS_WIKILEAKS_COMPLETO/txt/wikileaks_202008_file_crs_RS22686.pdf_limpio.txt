issued its decision in ledbetter v goodyear tire rubber co inc 1 case that involved questions about the timeliness of claims filed under title vii of the civil rights act which prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin2 in 54 vote decision the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that each paycheck she received reflected lower salary due to past discrimination and therefore constituted new violation of the statute instead the court held that new violation does not occur and new charging period does not commence upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination 3 as result the court held that the plaintiff had not filed suit in timely manner although the decision may limit some pay discrimination claims based on title vii individuals may still sue for sex discrimination that results in pay bias under the equal pay act however the courts decision may make it more difficult for employees to sue for pay discrimination under title vii g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 from 1979 until 1998 lilly ledbetter worked as supervisor for the goodyear tire rubber company although ledbetter initially received salary similar to the salaries paid to her male colleagues pay disparity developed over time by 1997 the pay disparity between ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts had widened considerably to the point that ledbetter was paid 3727 per month while the lowest paid male colleague received 4286 per month and the highestpaid male colleague received 5236 per month in 1998 ledbetter filed charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging that goodyear d unlawfully discriminated against her on the basis of her sex in violation of title vii according to ledbetter her current pay was discriminatorily low due to long series of decisions reflecting goodyears pervasive discrimination against female managers in general and ledbetter in particular jury found in her favor and the district court entered judgment for backpay and damages 4 but the appellate court reversed5 the supreme court granted review in order to resolve disagreement among the appellate courts regarding the proper application of the time limit for filing claims in title vii disparate treatment pay cases 6

an employment practice as unlawful are required to file charge with th eeoc within specified periodeither 180 days or 300 days depending on the stateafter the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred8 the question that arose in the ledbetter case was how to determine precisely what types of activities constitute an unlawful employment practice for purposes of starting the clock on the filing deadline ledbetter argued that two different employment practices could qualify as having occurred within the 180day charging period preceding the filing of her eeoc claim 1 the paychecks that were issued to her during that period each of which she alleged constituted separate act of discrimination or 2 1998 decision denying her raise which she contended was unlawful because it perpetuated the discriminatory pay decisions from previous years in contrast goodyear argued that ledbetters claim was time barred because the discriminatory acts that affected her current pay had taken place prior to the 180 days that preceded the claim ledbetter filed with the eeoc the supreme c ourt granted review to resolve the dispute g22g145g142g561g21g158g153g155g142g150g142g561g5g152g158g155g157g514g156g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g561 ultimately the supreme court ruled in favor of goodyear holding that ledbetters suit was time barred because unlawfully discriminatory acts had taken place within the 180day charging period in rejecting ledbetters claim on statutory grounds the court majority relied heavily on the principle that title vii claims alleging disparate treatment require evidence of discriminatory intent because there was evidence that goodyear had acted with discriminatory intent when it issued the paychecks ledbetter received during the charging period or when the company had denied her raise in 1998 the court found that goodyear had not engaged in an unlawful employment practice during the specified time period as result the fact that ledbetter may have been suffering from the continuing effects of past discrimination was not sufficient for her to establish claim within the statutorily mandated filing period 9 in issuing its decision the ledbetter majority relied on series of precedents in analogous employment discrimination cases for example one such case united air lines inc v evans 10 involved female flight attendant who was not granted seniority when she was rehired despite the fact that she had originally been forced to resign when she got married although the court agreed that the companys discriminatory policy had continuing effect that effect was not sufficient to establish present violation similarly in lorance v att technologies inc 11 the court rejected challenge to discriminatory seniority system because the complaint had been filed when the discriminatory effect was felt rather than within the charging period established by the original discriminatory act namely the adoption of the seniority system in light of these and other precedents the court concluded the eeoc charging period is triggered when discrete unlawful practice takes place new violation does not occur and new charging period does not commence upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the 7 42 usc 2000e2a 8

of acts each of which is intentionally discriminatory then fresh violation takes place when each act is committed current effects alone cannot breathe life into prior uncharged discrimination 12 of primary concern to the court was the question of discriminatory intent in general claims such as ledbetters which allege unlawful disparate treatment must demonstrate discriminatory intent according to the court allowing ledbet ter to shift the intent associated with the discriminatory pay decisions to later paychecks w ould have the effect of imposing liability in the absence of the required intent13 the court also appeared concerned that allowing ledbetters claim to proceed would undermine title vii enforcement procedures and filing deadlines which were designed in part to protect employers from defending against discrimination claims that are long past according to the court title viis short filing deadline reflects congress strong preference for the prompt resolution of employment discrimination allegations through voluntary conciliation and cooperation14 the court also rejected ledbetters reliance on bazemore v friday 15 pay discrimination case involving employees who were prior to enactment of title vii separated into white branch and black branch with the latter group receiving lower salaries although the bazemore court held that an employer who adopts discriminatory pay structure violates title vii whenever it issues paycheck to disfavored employees the ledbetter court distinguished the two cases arguing that the paychecks in bazemore reflected the employers ongoing retention of discriminatory pay structurea current violation of the statutewhile the paychecks in ledbetter reflected the continuing effect of an isolated past violation of the statute 16 finally although the eeoc has interpreted title vii to allow challenges based on discriminatory pay each time paycheck is received17 the court declined to defer to the agencys interpretation18 in contrast the dissent in ledbetter strongly disagreed with the majoritys analysis according to the dissent treating the actual payment of discriminatory wage as an unlawful employment practice would be more faithful to precedent would better reflect workplace realities and would be more consistent with the overall purpose of title vii specifically the dissent argued that the courts holding was inconsistent with the result in bazemore contending that bazemore recognized that paychecks that perpetuate past discrimination constitute fresh instance of discrimination every time they are issued 19 the dissent also drew an analogy between pay discrimination claims and sexual harassment hostile work environment claims which involve series of discrete acts that recur and are cumulative in impact since hostile work environment claims may be filed even when some of the discrete acts that form the basis for claim have taken place outside of the charging period the dissent would have allowed ledbetters claim to proceed as well20 12 ledbetter 127 s ct at 2169 13 id at 2170 14 id at 217071 15 478 us 385 1986 16 ledbetter 127 s ct at 217274 17 eeoc compliance

employment discrimination arguing that pay discrimination is fundamentally different from other types of employment bias for example employees who are generally aware when they suffer adverse employment actions related to promotion transfer hiring or firing may not know they have suffered pay discrimination particularly because salary levels are often hidden from the employees view and pay disparities become apparent only over time as result of these differences the dissent argued that the precedents upon which the court relied were inapplicable because those cases involved easily identifiable acts of discrimination 21 finally the dissent criticized the majoritys opinion as inconsistent with the overall antidiscrimination purpose of title vii g7g143g143g142g140g157g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g561 the courts decision in ledbetter is likely to affect the workplace in several different ways first employees may have more difficult time bringing pay discrimination claims under title vii if employees bring pay discrimination claims early in order to meet the statutory filing deadline they may have difficulty proving discrimination if the pay disparity remains small if employees bring pay discrimination claims later however then they may not be able to meet the filing deadline as result of this dilemma employers may experience an increase in pay discrimination claims being filed against them sinc some employees may file claims in order to meet the deadline even in cases where discrimination is unclear it is also important to note that the ledbetter decision affects more than just pay bias cases involving sex discrimination because title vii applies to discrimination on the basis of race color national origin sex and religion many other classes of claimants are affected by the decision furthermore the ledbetter case may also affect pay discrimination under parallel employment discrimination statutes that are patterned on title vii such as the age discrimination in employment act adea the rehabilitation act of 1973 or the americans with disabilities act ada employees who file pay discrimination claims alleging race or age discrimination for example may be more negatively affected by the decision than employees who allege sex discrimination because the latter group still has recourse under the equal pay act epa the epa which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex with regard to the compensation paid to men and women for substantially equal work performed in the same establishment 22 does contain statute of limitations for filing claims but has thus far been interpreted in such way that each issuance of an unequal paycheck is treated as new discriminatory act23 in addition the ledbetter decision has implications for congress since ledbetter was decided on statutory grounds legislators who disagree with the courts interpretation may introduce legislation clarifying that unlawful employment practices under title vii include each issuance of paycheck that reflects discriminatory compensation practice for example the lorance decision cited as precedent by the ledbetter majority was subsequently superceded by congress in the civil rights act of 199124 after the ledbetter decision was handed down several bills that 21 id at
