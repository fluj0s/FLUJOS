preventing the spread of aids and hiv the senate version of the bill would have prohibited the use of federal but not district funds for needle exchange programs the senate bill would have lifted restrictions on the use of district funds for lobbying and advocacy activities in support of voting representation in congress for residents of the district of columbia however the house and conference versions of the act maintain the prohibition on the use of district and federal funds for such activities although the conference version does allow the city to use district funds to staff the offices of the citys statehood shadow senator and representatives these offices were created by the district to champion the cause of statehood for the district in congress in previous years city officials have objected to the inclusion of number of social riders dealing with such issues as abortion medical marijuana domestic partners health insurance expansion2 and needle exchange programs they asserted that such riders interfered with the right of district residents to make their own policy decisions and violated the spirit of home rule proponents of social riders have argued that such provisions are within the powers of congress under article i section 8 of the constitution which conveys to congress exclusive legislative control over the district of columbia in addition supporters of specific social riders such as the prohibition against the use of federal funds to implement the districts domestic partners health care expansion program contend that they are intended to protect the institution of marriage or in the case of medical marijuana and needle exchange programs prohibit government sanctioning of illegal drug use in addition the districts appropriations may be increased by more than 15 million through the use of reserve fund the reserve fund may only be used for unanticipated onetime expenditures for potential deficits for debt reduction for unanticipated
