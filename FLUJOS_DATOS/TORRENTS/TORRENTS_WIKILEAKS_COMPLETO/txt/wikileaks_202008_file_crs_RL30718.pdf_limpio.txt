medicaid upper payment limits current law agreement section 705 deadline for issuance of final regulation relating to medicaid upper payment limitsmedicaid statute requires states to set payment rates for services that are consistent with efficiency and economy in accordance with these requirements the secretary has established through regulation upper payment limits upls for inpatient and outpatient services provided by certain types of facilities payments may not exceed estimates of what would have been paid for those services under medicare payment principles recently the secretary determined that curr ent regulations create financial incentive for states to make higher than usual payments to non state government facilities eg county and city providers allowing them to claim higher federal matching dollars those matching funds may be transferred from these facilities back to the state and used to cover the state share of medicaid costs andor for other purposes proposed rules to modify medicaid upls establish separate upl for inpatient services provided by nonstate government facilities aggregate payments for inpatient services provided by nonstate public hospitals may not exceed 150 of estimated payments based on medicare payment principles parallel rules are proposed for outpatient hospital and clinic services the proposed rules also specify two transition periods for states that are currently noncompliant these rules vary by when enhanced payment arrangements were in effect before versus on or after october 1 1999 the starting point for the phaseout of existing payment arrangements the percentage reduction in payments each year and the overall length of time permitted for full phaseout state fiscal year 2000 will serve as the base period for determining the amount of excess payments above proposed upls that must be phased outrequires the secretary to issue final regulations governing upper payment limits upls for inpatient and outpatient services provided by certain types of facilities later than december 31 2000 requires that the final regulation establish separate upl for nonstateowned or operated government facilities based on proposed rule announced in october 2000 requires the final regulation to stipulate third set of rules governing the transition period for certain states this additional set of rules would apply to states with payment arrangements approved or in effect on or before october 1 1992 or under which claims for federal matching were paid on or before that date and for which such payments exceed the upls established under the final regulation for these states 6year transition period would apply beginning with the period that begins on the first state fiscal year that starts after september 30 2002 and ends on september 30 2008 for each year during the transition period applicable states must reduce excess payments by 15 full compliance with final regulations is required by october 1
