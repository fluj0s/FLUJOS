cnf key points westminster seethed with rumors over the may 24 holiday weekend that one or more members of gordon browns cabinet were preparing to unseat him as prime ministerlabour party leader following disastrous twoweek period ref by the evening of may 4 however all of the potential successors had publicly declared their support for brown and ruled out challenge against him many of our labour party contacts argue that the crisis was largely mediaprovoked because replacing brown before the next general election is next to impossible according to labour party rules that require wouldbe successor to challenge him publicly ref c our contacts agree that there is virtually chance that brown will step down on his own and point instead to his resilience in the face of the continuing onslaught of crisis and criticism he has faced during his premiership the crisis does reflect high degree of worry among backbench mps that they will lose their seats in the next election if brown continues his downward trend in the polls these mps therefore have increasingly less reason to follow browns lead in parliament on controversial issues such as privatization of the royal mail it is likely that weakened brown will be forced to compromise on such issues in order to maintain semblance of discipline on the labour backbench but this is unlikely to have an effect on key uk or us foreign policy priorities brown still has chance albeit slim one to win the next general election some of our labour party contacts argue if he waits to call the election until the economy shows some signs of recovery brown could take credit for these green shoots and argue that his economic expertise makes him the best person to lead recovery brown and labour are expected to suffer heavy losses in the june 4 elections for the european parliament and local councils labour contacts tell us they worry that disaffected labourites may turn to fringe parties such as the fascist british national party bnp to cast their protest vote end key points another tempest over replacing brown 2 cnf gordon brown has suffered wretched two weeks during which he was implicated in the smeargate scandal suffered his first defeat in the house of commons after massive defection of his own party members over the issue of gurkhas rights and was forced into public lastminute change of policy to avoid second defeat on reform of the second homes allowance for mps refs and b the latest polls show brown and labour 18 points behind david cameron and the conservative party if general election were held now cameron would win with 150seat majority in parliament this disastrous series of events led to rampant media speculation over the may 24 holiday weekend that members of gordon browns own cabinet including communities secretary hazel blears health secretary alan johnson justice secretary jack straw and deputy labour leader harriet harman were ready to mount leadership challenge to replace brown by the evening of may 4 however all four had publicly declared their support for brown and ruled out any challenge against him 3 cnf many of our labour contacts including house of lords deputy leader lord brian davis and special advisor to the leader of the house of lords jonathan pearse tell us the crisis over browns leadership was largely due to inflated media reporting over slow holiday weekend while acknowledging the pm needs to get back on message in coming weeks in any case replacing sitting labour pm is daunting task since any possible successor would have to challenge brown publicly according to labour party rules successor to brown would face the added difficulty of public pressure to call general election as soon as she took office an election that labour would have little chance of winning in the current political climate so while it is london 00001064 002 of 003 technically possible to replace brown thorough study of the mechanics of doing so explains why his rivals have been so cautious in moving against him and why getting rid of brown as unpopular as he is might hasten labours fall from power rather than prevent it note for more on the mechanics of replacing sitting labour pm see ref c end note 4 cnf the only other option that brown will step aside voluntarily in the face of criticism is extremely unlikely according to lord davis and prominent labour member lord bruce grocott with whom poloffs met along with other labour lords on may 5 in fact they point to his personal resilience in the face of the continuing criticism he has endured since becoming pm praising his rebound after labours unexpected defeat in the july 2008 glasgow east byelection and myriad other political setbacks this same cycle played out after that byelection defeat in august 2008 when foreign secretary david miliband appeared to challenge brown for the labour leadership but then backed down ref d then as now the crisis was largely made by the media and was quickly resolved when miliband disavowed any leadership challenge and publicly backed the pm backbench is nervous now 5 cnf new and worrisome element this time for brown is the defection of his backbench many of these mps hold their constituencies by narrow margins with time growing increasingly short until brown must call the next election embassy note brown must call an election before may 10 2010 and hold it by june 3 2010 they are growing increasingly concerned that he might not be able to turn labours fortunes around there is less incentive therefore for them to vote with their party on controversial issues such as gurkhas rights the second homes allowance or the upcoming vote on government plans to partly privatize the royal mail the uks postal network according to may 5 media reports up to 100 rebel labour mps plan to revolt against browns plans to sell 49 percent stake of the company to the private sector new labour modernizers in browns cabinet thought to be led by business secretary peter mandelson are said to be pushing the pm not to back down over the issue but the leftwing of the party is urging him to shelve the selloff and save himself from fresh humiliation which may completely end his ability to impose any discipline on his party backbenchers aides of the pm have reportedly been considering compromise proposals to turn the royal mail into notforprofit company along the lines of the bbc trust claim denied today by downing street how brown could win the next election 6 cnf brown still has chance albeit slim one to win the next general election some of our labour party contacts argue if he waits to call the election until the economy shows some signs of recovery brown could take credit for these green shoots argue that the recovery is still fragile and that the uk public does not want to risk turning to new government that might not have the economic expertise to ensure recovery lord grocott argued that this strategy gives labour hope of victory if the economy turns up in the spring the public will want labour in power they wont want an untried conservative leadership in charge he told us the election he argued will boil down to the publics faith in who will best manage the economy lord charles falconer leading labour advisor to former pm tony blair added that if brown can point to recovery the issue for voters will be where to then make the cuts in government spending necessary to restore the countrys budget balance and voters can be convinced those cuts should be made by progressive left of center government rather than by probusiness tory government british national party may be stealth victor in june eu elections 7 cnf some within labour ranks are concerned that the fascist british national party bnp may be the big winner in the eu parliament and local council elections on june 4 leading labour mp jon cruddas told us may 1 given that many uk voters use the eu elections to register protest vote cruddas said one has any illusions but that the results will be bloody punch to us but what is worrisome surprise are the growing indications that the bnp will be the beneficiary of labour voters anger with their own party not the tories or liberal democrats angry london 00001064 003 of 003 conservative voters who want to register protest will vote for the uk independence party ukip but angry workingclass labour voters turn to the bnp cruddas said and this year there are lot of angry labour voters cruddas feared that voter turnout especially among minorities will be low helping the bnp gain eu seats under the complicated proportional representation system used in the eu elections cruddas said his constituents are battered by the recession and frustrated by competition for jobs and social services from eu and noneu immigrants according to cruddas the bnp will likely do well in the economically hardhit northwest in the eu elections where the party will win at least one seat for its chairman nick griffin and likely one more of the regions eight eu seats unless the tide is turned in the 2004 eu election the bnp won 64 percent of the votes in the northwest but failed to win single seat the bnp will also do better than many expect now in local elections in urban working class councils in manchester birmingham and parts of london such as cruddas own constituency the danger is not the brief public relations boost victory gives the bnp cruddas added but that with an eu parliamentary seat comes access to several hundred thousand gbps in funds from the eu which the bnp can use in any way it chooses when asked cruddas said he did not believe green party candidates in the northwest were viable alternatives that might tamp down bnp support although he acknowledged the green party is making that argument in its campaign 8 cnf other labour leaders with whom poloffs spoke acknowledged the threat of strong bnp vote in the june 4 elections but were split on how serious the threat was lord falconer dismissed the idea that the bnp would benefit from an antilabour protest vote noting that the conservatives are for better or worse the clear opposition party to vote for if you are unhappy with labour the conservatives have been out of power for 12 years lord davis on the other hand perceived trend toward the bnp in his former commons constituency and feared that in periods of economic downturn extremist parties do well all the labour leaders agreed however that bad result in the june elections though disheartening was now expected and that bad results in eu elections in any case have much less impact on the labour backbenchers views than byelection defeat as was the case with last summers glasgow east result the lords predicted another round of media speculation on browns future in june but dismissed its real impact comment 9 cnf wounded but still standing gordon brown remains at the helm of his party and is likely to do so until the voters speak in the next election increasingly likely now to be postponed until the latest date possible next spring the only viable alternative to oust brown delegation of labour wisemen and women advising him to leave for the sake of the party is not likely to occur for the plain fact that one expects brown to step down voluntarily matter how savage the media and party criticism he endures the man who has nursed his dream and grievance of being prime minister since 1994 is not going to walk out of downing street now as guardian political journalist told poloff brown is toughskinned scot who believes dreams come true but not free and he will pay the personal price to keep his alive visit londons classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalunit ed_kingdom
