moldova basic facts steven woehrel specialist in european affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary this short report provides information and analysis on moldova including its history political and economic situation foreign policy and us policy toward moldova this report will be updated as events warrant history moldova is part of the area known historically as bessarabia geographically delineated by the prut river on the west the dniestr river on the north and east the black sea on the southeast and the kiliya chilia arm of the danube delta on the south the republic of moldova approximately coincides with the eastern half of the romanian principality of moldavia 1359 1859 in 1812 it was ceded to russia by the ottoman empire most of this area remained under russian control until 1918 at that time the whole of bessarabia became part of romania this reintegra tion with romania was never recognized by the soviet union which in october 1924 established the moldavian autonomous soviet socialist republic assr on the east bank of the dniestr in ukraine httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95403crs2 source map from magellan adapted by crsbessarabia was among the territories assigned to the soviet union under the terms of the secret sovietgerman nonaggression pact of 1939 the soviet union forced romania to cede bessarabia in june 1940 and in august assigned onethird of the area to ukraine merging the remainder with the moldavian assr to form new moldavian soviet socialist republic ssr in the wake of germanys july 1941 attack on the ussr the soviet union once again lost the bulk of bessarabia to romania with the exception of the territory east of the dniestr romanian occupation forces committed largescale atrocities against the local population especially jews and gypsies the territory was recaptured by soviet troops in 1944 and the moldavian ssr reestablished reincorporation into the soviet union entailed rigorous russification the imposition of the cyrillic alphabet largescale immigration of russians and ukrainians as well as isolation from romania moldova declared its sovereignty on june 23 1990 following the failed august 1991 coup in moscow moldova declared its independence on august 27 1991 conflict between moldovan forces and those of the dniestr republic separatist entity proclaimed by ethnic russian local officials in 1990 erupted in march 1992 over 150 people died in the violence ceasefire was declared in july 1992 which provided for russian and moldovan peacekeepers to patrol security zone between the two regions although cessation of hostilities was achieved the core issue of the degree of autonomy to be accorded the dniestr region remains difficult the gagauz minority which had also proclaimed its own republic in 1990 did not resort to the use of force choosing instead to hold extensive discussions with moldovan authoritie s about the future of the region on july 28 1994 the moldovan parliament adopted an organic law negotiated with gagauz officials establishing nationalterritorial autonomous unit for the gagauz the region has its own elected legislative and executive authorities and will be entitled to secession from moldova in the case of moldovas reunification with romania political situation moldova is parliamentary democracy that has held largely free and fair elections since achieving independence in 1991 in the most recent parliamentary elections on february 25 2001 the communist party of moldova won decisive victory the first such victory by communist party in the countries of the former soviet union since that countryshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95403crs3 breakup in 1991 the cpm holds 71seats in the 101seat parliament an alliance of small centerright groups headed by outgoing prime minister dumitru braghis won 19 seats and the nationalist and proromanian christian democratic popular party won 11 seats analysts attributed the cpms success to public frustration with political gridlock corruption and low living standards under preceding centerright governments on april 4 2001 the new parliament elected cpm leader vladimir voronin as president the formal powers of the presidency are weak ironically due to successful cpmled effort in parliament in 2000 to reduce them but as cpm leader voronin is in fact the most powerful political figure in the country on april 19 the parliament approved new government led by businessman vasile tarlev who is political neophyte and not cpm member the cpm has billed tarlevs government as nonpartisan government of experts only two of its members are members of the cpm while six are from the previous centerright reformist government nevertheless the government is entirely dependent on the cpm for support like its predecessors the new leadership in moldova faces the thorny issue of the status of the dniestr republic dniestr leaders want confederated structure for moldova under which dniestr would be an independent state they demand control over foreign affairs internal security and defense moldovan authorities are willing to give dniestr an autonomous special status within moldova that would devolve significant powers to the region but not ones that would relinquish moldovas sovereignty there the causes of the conflict over dniestr are complex involving ethnic and ideological factors as well as maneuvering for power and wealth among elite groups ethnic russians and ukrainians together make up 54 of dniestrs population of about 650000 while moldovans are the single largest ethnic group at 39 until recently prowestern moderate nationalist governments in chisinau faced nominally leftist sovietstyle pro russia forces in dniestr however many moldovan analysts are convinced that the key factor obstructing settlement is the personal interests of the leaders of dniestr regime including dniestr president igor smirnov who they claim is heavily supported by organized crime groups early efforts by president voronin to reach agreement with the dniestr leaders have failed despite the fact that cpms views on many issues appear to be closer to those of the dniestr leadership than those of the previous centerright governments had been economy moldova is one of the poorest countries in europe according to the world bank its per capita gross national product was 410 in 1999 which is also the average for countries the bank terms low income countries per capita gnp for europe and central asia averages 2150 moldovas main natural resource is its rich soil agriculture especially fruit wine and tobacco plays an important role in moldovas economy most of moldovas industry is located in the dniestr republic and is not counted in moldovan government statistics moldova has had mixed success in economic reform after independence output declined sharply and inflation soared but moldova pursued an imf supported program of tough fiscal and monetary policies it succeeded in achieving measure of macroeconomic stability including the stabilization of moldovas national currency the leu however moldovas small economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks and moldova suffered severe setback during the 1998 russian economic crisishttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95403crs4 it has since staged partial recovery due in part to government effort to cut spending and accelerate reforms moldova has privatized its small and mediumsized business sector and unlike other countries in the region it has had remarkable success in privatizing agricultural land however the sale of large firms has been more difficult foreign investment in moldova is low cumulative foreign direct investment since independence through 1999 amounted to only 339 million the situation improved in 2000 with the sale of moldovan energy distributors to the spanish firm union fenosa key test of the intentions of the new government will be whether it interferes with union fenosas efforts to make the energy sector profitable and whether moldova will privatize the rest of the energy sector as well as its telecommunications sector another key test will be how or whether it privatizes the key tobacco and wine industries some of the cpms strongest support comes from the directors of these sectors the moldovan government has acknowledged that its room for maneuver over such issues as increasing government spending or slowing privatization is limited given the countrys poverty and its weak financial situation moldova is heavily dependent upon loans from the imf world bank and other international financial institutions in december 2000 the imf approved 142 million poverty reduction and growth facility loan for moldova the imf suspended disbursements of the loan in may 2001 waiting to see whether the cpmsupported government will continue economic reforms the resumption of imf funding is critical if moldova is achieve critically necessary rescheduling of its substantial foreign debt burden in april 2001 moldova owed over 13 billion over 100 of the countrys gdp moldova joined the world trade organization in june 2001 foreign policy according to the moldovan constitution moldov an foreign policy is based on neutrality perhaps moldovas most important foreign policy relationship is with russia most of moldovas exports go to russia and over 90 of its energy imports come from russia moldova has accumulated large debts to russian energy firms it has ceded control of its natural gas distribution system to the russian energy giant gazprom to pay part of the debt relations with russia are complicated by the continued presence of about 2500 russian troops in the dniestr republic as well as huge stockpiles of weapons and ammunition this figure does not include several hundred russian troops deployed in the security zone between the dniestr republic and the rest of moldova with the moldovan governments consent since moldovas independence russia has repeatedly failed to honor commitments it has made to withdraw its forces from moldova at the november 1999 organization for security and cooperation in europe osce summit in istanbul russia pledged to complete the withdrawal of its troops from moldova by the end of 2002 both moldovan and russian officials agree that the huge stocks of munitions in dniestr must be removed or destroyed before the russian troops pull out in order to prevent the weapons from falling into the hands of criminals terrorists and undesirable groups however russian officials say that they cannot withdraw the munitions without the permission of the dniestr authorities who claim that the weaponry is their property as result the osce has noted that very little progress has been made towardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95403crs5 the implementation of russias pledge to withdraw its troops from moldova one positive development was the conclusion of an agreement in may 2001 between the osce and russia on osce monitoring and assistance for the troop withdrawal including the use of an osce trust fund to help dispose of the russian munitions russia officially supports the view held by the rest of the international community that moldova should remain single sovereign state russia formally rejects dniestrs demands for recognition as an independent state in confedera tion with moldova an osce mission in moldova is charged with helping to solve the dniestr issue as well as supporting the russian troop withdrawal from moldova however some moldovans charge that russia has in reality backed the dniestr leadership in order to retain political leverage over moldova while publicly supporting osce efforts to avoid international pressure over the issue russian leaders have at times attempted to tie the withdrawal of russian troops to the resolution of dniestrs status moldova is member of the commonwealth of independent states cis however until the cpms victory in 2001 moldova resisted russias desire for closer integration within the cis under russias leadership declaring that it would not participate in political andor military integration within the cis moldova participates in loose group of former soviet republics known as guuam after the initial letter of each member georgia ukraine uzbekistan azerbaijan and moldova guuam countries have tried to enhance cooperation between membership of the group to enhance their independence and to ward of russian efforts to dominate them after his election in april 2001 president voronin has stressed the need for moldova to seek closer ties with russia including by eventually joining the russiabelarus union however some observers question whether voronin will be able to fulfill this pledge given the difficulties the russiabelarus union is having at present president voronin has said that moldova will continue to participate in the guuam group but warned that it sees the group as forum for economic issues not political ones moldovan officials stress that they wish to expand ties with western countries moldova does not seek nato membership but favors cooperation with nato and participates in partnership for peace pfp exercises in february 2001 nato announced the establishment of pfp trust fund to help moldova destroy the large stockpile of anti personnel mines on its territory as required by the ottawa convention on the elimination of these weapons on november 28 1994 moldova signed an agreement for partnership and cooperation with the european union eu which provides for cooperation in wide variety of spheres and holds out the possibility of an eventual free trade agreement from 1991 until 1999 moldova received 70 million euros 604 million in eu aid for political and economic reform moldova has also received eu humanitarian aid as well as assistance for food security and poverty reduction and balance of payment support moldova joined the stability pact for southeastern europe in june 2001 one of the most sensitive issues in the republics foreign relations is relations with romania the question has implications for the identity of the country most romanians consider moldovans in fact to be romanians and support the eventual unification of the two countries although most independent experts consider the moldovan language to be romanian the issue is matter of political controversy in moldova those favoring the term moldovan tend to favor moldovas independence or close ties with russia while those favoring romanian tend to favor union with romania the christian democratichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95403crs6 popular party which has only 11 seats in parliament and few other rightofcenter groups favor unification with romania but the cpmled governme nt and the overwhelming majority of moldovans oppose it in
