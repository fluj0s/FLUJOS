from kevin trenberth trenbertucaredu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re fwd jones et 1990 date wed 20 jun 2007 093139 0600 mdt replyto trenbertucaredu phil hang in there i went thru this on the hurricane stuff and it was hard to take but responding to these guys unless they write papers is not the thing to do kevin kevin my problem is that i dont know the best course of action just sitting tight at the moment taking soundings id be far happier if they would write some papers and act in the normal way id know how to respond to that in way this all seems different form of attack from that on ben and mike in previous ipccs i know im on the right side and honest but i seem to be telling myself this more often recently i also know that 999 of my fellow climatologists know the attacks are groundless cheers phil at 1454 20062007 you wrote phil it is nasty it is also very inappropriate even were some problems to emerge over time those should be addressed in new paper by these guys unfortunately all they do is criticise kevin kevin have also forwarded these emails to susan and martin just so they are aware of what is going on the second email is particularly nasty im not worried and stand by the original paper and also weichyung i do plan to do some more work on urbanrelated issues i also think there is some urban influence in more recent chinese series from the 1980s onwards ive seen some chinese papers on this they are not that well written though the ca web site has also had go at david parkers paper in j climate 2006 david sent them the site locations and where the data came from at ncdc there are also threads on ca about us hcn tom karl and peterson aware of these and also about ipcc and our responses to the various drafts apologies for sharing these with you it is useful to send to very small group as it enables to get on with some real work cheers phil weichyung tom i wont be replying to either of the emails below nor to any of the accusations on the climate audit website ive sent them on to someone here at uea to see if we should be discussing anything with our legal staff the second letter seems an attempt to be nice to and somehow split up the original author team i do now wish id never sent them the data after their foia request cheers phil xymailosg wrt8waevm1mybgklj9hailvnyw9gqqfcbarmyvxdn17eho1e0vf5esq4wigjljnsew from steve mcintyre

phil jones et 1990 cited 260station temperature set jointly collected by the us deparment of energy and the prc academy of sciences stating in respect to the chinese stations the stations were selected on the basis of station history we chose those with few if any changes in instrumentation location or observation times this data set was later published as ndp039 httpcdiacornlgovepubsndpndp039ndp039htmlhttpcdiaco rnlgovepubsndpndp039ndp039html coauthored by zeng zhaomei providing station histories only for their 65station network stating that station histories for their 205station network which includes many of the sites in jones et 1990 were not available s 5 unfortunately station histories are not currently available for any of the stations in the 205station network therefore details regarding instrumentation collection methods changes in station location or observing times and official data sources are not known s 7 few station records included in the prc data sets can be considered truly homogeneous even the best stations were subject to minor relocations or changes in observing times and many have undoubtedly experienced large increases in urbanization fortunately for 59 of the stations in the 65station network station histories see table 1 are available to assist in proper interpretation of trends or jumps in the data however station histories for the 205station network are not available in addition examination of the data from the 65station data set has uncovered evidence of several undocumented station moves sects 6 and 10 users should therefore exercise caution when using the data accordingly it appears that the quality control claim made in jones et 1990 was incorrect i presume that you did not verify whether this claim was correct at the time and have been unaware of the incorrectness of this representation since the study continues to be relied on most recently in ar4 i would encourage you to promptly issue an appropriate correction regards steve mcintyre from dj keenan dougkeenaninformathorg to steve mcintyre stephenmcintyreutorontoca cc phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject wang fabrications date tue 19 jun 2007 204515 0100 xmailer microsoft outlook express 60029003138 xueaspamscore 00 xueaspamlevel xueaspamflag steve i thought that i should summarize what has happened with the wang case first i concluded that the claims made about chinese stations by jones et nature 1990 and wang et grl 1990 were very probably fabricated you very likely came to the same conclusion second some investigation showed that phil jones was wholly blameless and that responsibility almost certainly lay with wang third i contacted wang told him that i had caught him and asked him to retract his fabricated claims my emails were addressed to him only and i told one about them in wangs reply though jones karl zeng etc were ccd fourth i explained to wang that i would publicly accuse him of fraud if he did not retract wang seemed to not take seriously so i drafted what would be the text of formal accusation and sent it to him wang replied that if i wanted to make the accusation that was up to fifth i put draft on my web site httpwwwinformathorgapprisea5620htm and emailed few people asking if they had any recommendations for improvement i intend to send the final version to wangs university and to demand formal investigation into fraud i will also notify the media separately i have had preliminary discussion with the fbibecause wang likely used government funds to commit his fraud it seems that it might be possible to prosecute wang under the same statute as was used in the eric poehlman case the simplicity of the case makes this easierno scientific knowledge is required to understand things i saw that you have now emailed phil ccd above asking phil to publish retraction of wangs claims httpwwwclimateauditorgp1741comment115879 there could be couple problems with that one problem is that it would be difficult for phil to publish anything without the agreement of wang and the other coauthors nature would simply say another problem is that your email says that you presume phil was unaware of the incorrectness of wangs work i do not see how that could be true although the evidence that phil was innocent in 1990 seems entirely conclusive there is also the paper of yan et advances in atmospheric sciences 18 309 2001 which is cited on my web page phil is coauthor of that paper phil this proves that you knew there were serious problems with wangs claims back in 2001 yet some of your work since then has continued to rely on those claims most notably in the latest report from the ipcc it would be nice to hear the explanation for this phil kind wishes doug
