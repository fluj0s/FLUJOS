was conducted pursuant to exe cutive decision 200316 on the establishment of the investigation task force the itf investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations by obtaining documents from the pristina airport admin istration and from pillar iv which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand iv background information 4 pristina international airport constitutes sta owned enterprise under yugoslavian law the assets of the airport include the runways terminal buildings hanger fuel storage facilities and equi pment during the period covered by this investigation from 2001 until 2003 they were maintained by the public enterprise airport pristina

administration of the pristina airport was entrusted to the civil administration p illar pillar ii of unmik including official 4 and official 5 pillar ii supe rvised the department of transport and infrastructure doti official 1 the doti was later known as the transport sector of the unmik directorate of infrastructure ffairs doti official 1 left unmik at the end of june 2002 doti official 2 was recruited by the doti as an international staff member on 31 july 2000 in charg of airport operations reporting to doti official 1 and continued in this role until 30 september 2001 engineering expertise was provided by series of ngineers seconded from the member states armed forces french army specifically airport engineer i airpo rt engineer 2 and airport engineer 3 and later by the consultant from the consulting firm 3 6 on 1 july 2002 the responsibility for the admin istration of the airport passed from pillar ii to the kosovo trust agency kta and pillar iv the divisional manager was appointed at the airport sector kta at the same time under himher were the peap official and the air traffic control services atcs official 7 on 1 april 2004 pristina international airport which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of kfor was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction under icao regulations 8 it is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined v investigation details 9 this report relates to contract for the supply and mounting of suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal t pristina international airport the value of the contract was 4025000 allegation 1 due to poor management and lack forward planning by pillar ii and airport management the contract for the supply and mountin g of ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal was not included either in t he contract for the expansion of the passenger terminal or tendered at the same tim as the contract for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system 10 two offers dated 28 october and 7 november 2002 were received for the replacement of the suspended ceiling in the old par t of the passenger terminal at pristina airport from vendor 1 the company underta king the contract for the expansion and modernisation of the passenger termin and vendor 2 the offer from vendor 2 was accepted in the sum of 40250 00 and contract to replace the suspended ceiling in the old part of the passen ger terminal dated 28 november 2002 was signed by vendor 2 with pristina airport on 2 december 2003 11 an internal memorandum from airport engineer 3 to the divisional manager dated 8 november 2002 requested to go ahead with single source procurement for the replacement of the suspended ce iling in the old part of the passenger terminal this was authorised by the divi sional manager by means of manuscript note on the memorandum on 9 november 2 002 12 analysis of the internal memorandum from airpor t engineer 3 to the divisional manager indicates that it became necessary to repla ce the suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal due to the d ismantling of the existing heating and air conditioning system and cooling pip and the installation of the new heating ventilation and air conditioning system 4 13 the memorandum adds that the dismantling of the ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal was not foreseen in the tender f or the replacement of the heating ventilation and air conditioning system 14 this lack of foresight was confirmed by the div isional manager in interview when heshe commented from my recollection the total replacement of the ceiling should have been included in the original heating ventilation and ir conditioning contract but for some unknown reason this appears to have been overl ooked this deficiency was highlighted in the third paragraph in my memora ndum dated 12 november 2002 to the procurement officer on contract procedu re procurement copied to airport engineer 3 the peap official and official 1 which states due to lack of communications on the heating an d air conditioning contract the replacement of the suspended ceiling was not in cluded in the contract 15 when asked in interview whom amongst the airpor t management was responsible for the project for the expansion and m odernisation of the passenger terminal the divisional manager indicated that the project for the expansion and modernisation of the passenger terminal would have been launched and approved by pillar ii with doti official 1 having overall responsibility for the management of the project 16 the divisional manager added that airport engi neer 3 and the technical managers at the airport the peap official and off icial 2 would have had role in checking the main contract 17 the peap official when asked in interview abou t the replacement of the suspended ceiling confirmed that it resulted from damage during the installation of the heating and air conditioning system and othe r installations 18 however when asked whether any thought had bee n given to possible damage to the suspended ceiling during the passenger termi nal expansion the peap official indicated that the slovenian company who d esigned the heating ventilation and air conditioning system had not tho ught about this this is unsurprising as the company was contracted to desi gn the mechanical installations for the system therefore it would n ot have fallen within the companys area of responsibility 19 when asked who amongst the airport management w ould have been responsible for approval of the project for the expansion and m odernisation of the passenger terminal the peap official indicated doti official 1 however heshe denied any responsibility for checking the main contract h imselfherself or approving the project despite the fact that heshe was manager of peap at the time and attended meeting on 11 december 2000 to redefine the requirements for the upgrading and extension of the passenger airport rminal 20 doti official 2 indicated that the replacement of the existing ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal building had been in cluded in the tender documents for the project to expand and modernise t he passenger terminal at 5 pristina airport however it has not been possible to verify this and evidently it did not form part of the final contract 21 doti official 1 when asked why the tender for the expansion and modernisation of the passenger terminal did not include inter ia the replacement of the existing ceiling stated that the tender was beyond hisher level of control 22 in view of the fact that the project to expand and modernise the passenger terminal at pristina airport entailed the demolitio n of two walls of the old passenger terminal and an expansion in the floor rea of the terminal from 1800m² to 4000m² the failure to consider replacing the existing ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal building as part of the contract for the expansion and modernisation of the passenger terminal demonst rates poor management and inadequate forward planning 23 in addition since the installation of new he ating ventilation and air conditioning system which formed an integral part of the ceilin g necessitated the demolition of the expositing ceiling the failure to include i t in the contract for the new heating ventilation and air conditioning system du to lack of communication also demonstrates poor management and forward plann ing 24 in summary the necessity for separate ct to replace the suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal c ould have been avoided if the project for the expansion and modernisation of the passenger terminal had been better planned or if it had been included in the p roject for the new heating ventilation and air conditioning system the overal l picture presented in evidence provided to the itf is that planning of the passen ger terminal project by senior and middle management in pillar ii and at the airpo rt was poor and managers notably doti official 1 and the peap official faile d to take managerial responsibility allegation 2 the contract for the supply and mounting of susp ended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal was tendered as single sou rce procurement when the conditions justifying single source procurement h ad not been met 25 article 24 of unmik finance administrative inst ruction 19992 on public procurement using kosovo consolidated budget funds provides that direct single source procurement may be used for g oods works or ancillary physical services 241 if such direct single source procurement is not used to 2411 avoid competition 2412 discriminate against other suppliers and 242 direct single source procurement is the appr opriate method to be used 2421 as the goods works or services can be provi ded by only one supplier 26 routing slip from the then kta auditor dated 6 march 2003 alleges that the conditions justifying single source procurement for the replacement of the 6 suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal had not been met in reaching this conclusion the then kta auditor rais ed concerns over inter alia incomplete documentation and the justification for single source procurement 27 analysis of the interoffice memorandum from air port engineer 3 to the divisional manager dated 8 november 2002 indicates that at the time when the single source procurement was requested pieces of the hea ting ventilation and air conditioning system were hanging down from the ceil ing thereby representing risk to passengers 28 the memorandum also indicates that second off er was obtained from vendor 1 for the replacement of the suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal however this indicates that more than ne company would have been able to provide the service 29 the concerns expressed by airport engineer 3 ar supported by an explanatory memorandum from the divisional manager to official 3 dated 13 april 2003 concerning the refusal of the then kta auditor to pprove capital expenditure for the contract in march 2003 the memorandum states t hat an important part of completing the heating ventilation and air conditi oning system was the installation of the new ceiling in the departure ar ea it adds that the replacement of the ceiling was also necessary to make the depar ture area safe from health safety aspect for passengers and staff the divis ional manager confirmed this explanation in the course of two interviews 30 draft capital expenditure approval form sign ed by the divisional manager dated 28 november 2002 adds that the replacement of the s uspended ceiling in the departure area was not included in the original co ntract however it gives reason for this 31 when asked about the single source procurement in interview the peap official corroborated the information given by airport engin eer 3 and the divisional manager heshe added that there had been an incide nt involving passenger who had been injured by an aluminium part hanging d own form the ceiling which resulted in the note from airport engineer 3 32 due to the health and safety considerations an d to the fact that it formed part of the heating ventilation and air conditioning syste m the contract to replace the suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal had become urgent by the time the decision to proceed with it was tak however this was due in part to lack of forward planning and poor managemen t in addition the requirement of article 242 of unmik finance admini strative instruction 19992 stipulating that the goods works or services could only be supplied by one company is not fulfilled the contract for the sup ply and mounting of suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal was therefore tendered as single source procurement when the co nditions justifying single source procurement had not been met allegation 3 7 single source contract procurement was authorise d when the contractor was already on site 33 further allegation made in interview by the p rocurement officer is that the divisional manager and airport engineer 3 authorise d single source contract procurement when the contractor was already on sit 34 when asked whether this was the case the divis ional manager stated that heshe could not recall without detailed examina tion of the file whether the contractor commenced work prior to the single sourc request it will be noted that the divisional manager was given the opportuni ty to examine the airport file relating to the contract for the supply and mountin g of suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal but was unable to locate any relevant documents on this issue 35 unfortunately the itf has been unable to locat airport engineer 3 in order to clarify this issue 36 vendor 2 representative who replaced the termi nal ceiling was asked in interview when heshe commenced work on the suspend ed ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal heshe replied that hes he had commenced work two months after signing the contract this is inconsis tent with both the note from the divisional manager dated 13 april 2003 and the urge ncy of the situation indicated in the request for the single source procurement re quest from airport engineer 3 since the work would not have started until the end of january 2003 if vendor 2 representatives statement were accurate 37 evidence as to whether the divisional manager uthorised single source contract to go ahead after the contractor had comme nced work is therefore inconclusive allegation 4 the divisional manager authorised the contractor t commence work before the contract to replace the suspended ceiling in the ol d part of the passenger terminal had been officially signed and authorised or receiv ed capital expenditure approval and allegation 5 the divisional manager signed off the contract in the sum of 40250 in excess of hisher contractual authorisation limit of 25000 for contracts deviating from normal procurement procedures set out in article 63 of mik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using koso vo consolidated budget funds 38 analysis of the memorandum written by the divis ional manager dated 13 april 2003 indicates that heshe authorised the work to start before the contract to replace the suspended ceiling in the old part of th passenger terminal had been officially signed and authorised or received capit expenditure approval in addition the note indicates that heshe signed off the contract in the sum of 40250 in excess of hisher contract authorisation limit of 25000 8 39 the divisional manager confirmed this to be the case in the course of two interviews although heshe emphasised that heshe took the decision in order to secure the departure area from health and safety aspect for both passengers and staff heshe also commented in an earlier inte rview that there were considerable delays for procurement in the kta whi ch required the then kta auditors signature before official 3 would approve expenditure 40 analysis of an email from official 3 to the div isional manager dated 14 april 2003 confirms that capital expenditure approval was obta ined after both the signing of the contract and the completion of the work the di visional manager confirmed this in interview stating that work was carried out for health and safety reasons for the benefit of both passengers and staff as the parture area was in constant use during the construction period 41 in summary evidence indicates that the divisio nal manager for health and safety reasons authorised the contractor to start work be fore the contract to replace the suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal had been officially signed and authorised or received capital expendit ure approval in addition evidence indicates that heshe signed off the contr act in the sum of 40250 in excess of hisher contract authorisation limit of 25000 vi conclusions 42 the contract to replace the suspended ceiling i n the old part of the passenger terminal should have been included in the project f or the expansion of the passenger terminal failing this it should have be included in the contract for the new heating ventilation and air conditioning sy stem 43 the failure to do so demonstrates poor manageme nt and forward planning by senior and middle managers both at pillar ii and at pristina airport persons responsible are principally doti official 1 and the peap official as well as staff responsible for checking the main contract and the contract for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system specifical ly the airport engineer 3 and official 2 44 the responses given by doti official 1 and the peap official in their interviews with the itf suggest an unwillingness to take manag erial responsibility 45 the work to replace the ceiling in the old par t of the passenger terminal had clearly become urgent by the time the decision to p roceed with it was taken however this was due in part to lack of forward pl anning and poor management in addition the requirement of article 242 of unm ik finance administrative instruction 19992 stipulating that the goods work s or services could only be supplied by one company is not fulfilled the cont ract for the supply and mounting of suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal was therefore tendered as single source procurement w hen the conditions justifying single source procurement had not been met 46 evidence indicates that the divisional manager for health and safety reasons authorised the contractor to start work before the contract to replace the 9 suspended ceiling in the old part of the passenger terminal had been officially signed and authorised or received capital expenditu re approval 47 in addition evidence indicates that heshe si gned off the contract in the sum of 40250 in excess of hisher contract authorisation limit of 25000 for contracts deviating from normal procurement procedures set ou t in article 63 of unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using kosovo consolidated budget funds vii recommendations 48 the itf recommends the following it is recommended that unmik pillar iv kta take ppropriate action against the peap official for hisher management failure in not ensuring that the replacement of the ceiling was included in the project for the exp ansion of the passenger terminal or to include it in the contract for the new heating v entilation and air conditioning system iv0427701 it is recommended that because doti official 1 and the divisional manager have both left the mission unmik pillar iv should place this report on their personnel files for future reference iv2770402 it is recommended that unmik pillar iv kta in fu ture projects such as the passenger terminal expansion appoint qualified ngineer with appropriate expertise to plan and manage such activities iv04 27703
