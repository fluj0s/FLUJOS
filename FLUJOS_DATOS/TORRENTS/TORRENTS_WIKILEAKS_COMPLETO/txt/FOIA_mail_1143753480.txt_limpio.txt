from eduardo zorita eduardozoritagkssde to tosbornueaacuk tim osborn subject re response to wahl et in science date thu 30 mar 2006 161800 0200 met dst cc eduardozoritagkssde kbriffaueaacuk tim yes i also found it strange we noticed that amman and wahl cited their science comment as accepted in their manuscript that is now in press in climatic change personally i think it is convenient that this clarification gets published but i am somewhat disapointed by the fact that very similar content was submitted by buerger and cubasch about one year ago and it was not even sent to reviewers it is the paper that finally appeared in tellus i think that comment was of much higher quality than wahls science knew of the tellus paper since we cite it in our response so actually there is scientifically nothing new in this exchange but it will be published in science anyway i am happy to have more time now for more productive work and hope that ritson doe not bomb with more mails in the future eduardo thanks for letting us know eduardo it is strange that science accepted the wahl et comment before yours we were told of this on 28feb and that is why you will notice if you get to see the latest ipcc draft that wahl et is cited but your response is not cited this will look strange given that they will be published together maybe it can be changed later cheers tim at 1131 29032006 eduardo zorita wrote dear tim the comment by wahl ritson and amman and our response have been now accepted for publication in science eduardo dr timothy j osborn climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk email tosbornueaacuk phone 44 1603 592089 fax 44 1603 507784 web httpwwwcruueaacuktimo sunclock httpwwwcruueaacuktimosunclockhtm
