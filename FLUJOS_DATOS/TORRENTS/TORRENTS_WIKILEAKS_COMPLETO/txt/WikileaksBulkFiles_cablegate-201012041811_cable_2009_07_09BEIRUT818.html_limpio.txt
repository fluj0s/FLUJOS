outside interference if given the opportunity he also thanked the united states for sustained military assistance general petraeus congratulated lebanon on the peaceful conduct of the elections and expressed hope that cabinet would be formed soon siniora continued that lebanon was encouraged by and supportive of president obamas efforts to reach comprehensive middle east peace but cautioned that palestinian resettlement should not come at the expense of lebanon siniora encouraged the us to push syria to respect the sovereignty of other states namely lebanon as way to bring syria back into the arab fold rather than continuing to align itself with iran general petraeus hoped that the obvious cracks in the iranian system illustrated by the demonstrations that followed the iranian elections would distract iran from malign ambitions in the region he also briefed siniora on us military assistance in pakistan and afghanistan end summary 2 sbu meeting general petraeus at his downtown beirut

the commanding general of us central command centcom general david petraeus to beirut on june 30 siniora expressed his thanks for sustained us military assistance to lebanon and asserted that us security assistance had contributed to the positive outcome of the june 7 lebanese parliamentary elections siniora said he was quite satisfied that the majority march 14 coalition had shown that its majority was decisive and not fictitious as it had been described by others after the previous elections in 2005 he described the electoral outcome as vote for the state and its institutions siniora said that although lebanon was not the most important country in the world and despite minor irregularities in the conduct of the elections lebanon had shown that it could be model of diversity and democracy without outside interference in the region 4 c general petraeus congratulated siniora on winning his own electoral campaign and the lebanese people for conducting peaceful elections in addition he expressed hope that the new cabinet would be formed soon siniora predicted the government formation would likely take some time because of debate about blocking third veto power for the opposition middle east peace not at the expense of lebanon 5 c siniora said that lebanon was encouraged by and supportive of president obamas commitment to achieving comprehensive middle east peace he said the us administrations recognition of the centrality of the israelipalestinian conflict was an opportunity to push the arab peace initiative forward and to finally achieve resolution the israelis however were being uncooperative he accused in his june 14 speech israeli pm benjamin netanyahu had said yes to twostate solution with but added thousand siniora analyzed the ultimate fate of

is agaist permanent resettlement tawteen in lebanon end note syria 6 c syria siniora said has geopolitical significance he said lebanon desired mutually respectful relationship with syria and lauded the establishment of diplomatic relations between lebanon and syria as good first step however other issues such as border delineation and the presence of pflpgc military camps supported by syria on the border remain siniora commented on the signs of increased us engagement with syria but he advised the united states to be careful not to give any rewards to syria without syria taking action first most importantly the us should not allow syria or other states in the region to use lebanon as platform or battleground engagement with syria should not come at the expense of lebanon siniora said 7 c general petraeus assured siniora that the us administration understood lebanons concerns he told siniora that syrian president bashar asad had invited him to visit several times but the time was not yet appropriate syria he added continues to allow qaedaaffiliated facilitation networks to operate from its territory and allow the transit of suicide bombers into iraq general petraeus added that the us would like to see syria return to the arab world and develop closer ties to the western world rather than continue to align itself with iran iran 8 c on iran general petraeus said that the crisis following irans june 12 presidential election had revealed significant cracks in the iranian system he said the announced outcome of the election and subsequent demonstrations showed that the urban street and the young street were not supportive of iranian supreme leader ayatollah khamenei candidly the us would like these events to distract iran for awhile from its other ambitions such as pursuing its nuclear program general petraeus said although it was too early to determine whether the current crisis had any significant impact on irans ability to support hamas hizballah or limit its ability to train and support foreign fighters in iraq he added siniora agreed that there were definite cracks in the iranian system and the internal divisions should be exploited however siniora warned against israel taking any military action against iran saying such action would only make the regional situation worse 9 c general petraeus responded that it was not the us desire to see outside force used against iran nonetheless he observed there was phenomenon in the gulf states where leaders were worried someone would strike irans nuclear weapons program while also worrying that someone would not iran he continued had become centcoms best recruiting tool and the number of partnerships and us military assistance agreements with arab partners in the gulf had increased significantly pakistan and afghanistan 10 c turning to other international developments siniora said he had heard rumor that pakistan was ready to sell some of its nuclear stock to other countries general petraeus responded that this was almost certainly rumor but he refused to discount the possibility that gulf states may start shopping if iran acquired nuclear weapon capability he added that during his recent visit to pakistan it was clear that for the first time the pakistani military viewed the taliban and other extremist groups as an existential threat to pakistan the pakistani people general petraeus continued were hugely supportive of its militarys efforts to fight against this extremist threat there were some early signs of some success from pakistani operations 11 c in afghanistan the us was increasing its troop levels by 38000 from the beginning of 2009 and doubling the number of its helicopters general petraeus said the war in afghanistan would be tough and not easily won one key will be the ability of the afghan government to step up to provide governance and be seen to serve the people in areas that have been cleared by coalition and afghan forces afghanistans presidential election was scheduled for august 20 general petraeus added it was likely but not guaranteed that current afghan president hamid karzai would win he predicted 12 u centcom
