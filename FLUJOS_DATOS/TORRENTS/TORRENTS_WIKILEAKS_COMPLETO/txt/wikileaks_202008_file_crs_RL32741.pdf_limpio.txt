enactment in both the 106th and 107th congresses at the conclusion of the 106th congress conference report bill was passed by both the house and the senate but was pocket vetoed by president clinton late in the 107th congress an informal compromise between representatives of the house and the senate over the schumer amendment provision intended to prevent the discharge of liability for willful violation of protective orders and violent protests against providers of lawful services including reproductive health services proved unacceptable to the house consequently the conference report on

its entirety the preexisting bankruptcy act of 18984 in 1970 when congress perceived the need to modernize the bankruptcy laws it created commission on the bankruptcy laws of the united states to study and recommend changes in the law the commission filed its final report with the congress on july 30 19735 in 1994 congress created another commission the national bankruptcy review commissi on

bankruptcy reform the commissioners were generally not in agreement7 consumer filing options consumer debtors usua lly avail themselves of one of two operative chapters of the code chapter 7 involves liquidation of the debtors assets and distri bution of proceeds chapter 13 involves reorganization under which debtors debts are restruct ured and paid over time in accordance with set payment plan chapter 11 govern s business reorganization although an individual may file under chap ter 11 its procedures and costs are significantly greater and more complex chapter 7 chapter 7 of the code governs li quidation of the debtors estate and is often referred to as straight bankruptcy under the supervision of standing trustee the debtors assets are liquidate d ie reduced to cash and the proceeds are distributed to creditors in accordance with the procedures mandated at the conclusion the debtor r eceives discharge which operates as permanent injunction against any attempt by cr

creditors vote to accept or reject plan of reorganization although th ey are given th opportun ity to accept certain provisions and interpose objections only the debtor may propose the reorganization

undergo reorgani zation however many of these provisions have their genesis in considered deliberate policy and political decisions we examine several which are relevant to consumer bankruptcy filings the function of exclus ions and exemptions in bankruptcy the us bankruptcy code by design is not an equalizer of wea lth among all bankruptcy debtors each bankruptcy is highly f act specific but as general proposition debtor who enters bankruptcy with more wealth is likely to emerge from bankruptcy with more assets intact any disparity in the outcome among consumer bankruptcy debtors is in large part function of the bankruptcy system of exclusions and exemptions legal treatise observes that few people would voluntarily take any legal action which meant the surrender of so much of their possessions as to leave them destitute and virtually helpless9 hence when an indivi dual debtors assets are liquidated the law permits him or her to retain certain minimum of money and property necessary to realize fresh start when debtor files in bankruptcy bankruptcy estate is created in some cases the law permits the debtor to exclude property from the estate altogether in others property is included in the estate but is exempted from the reach of creditorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32741crs4 10 the us constitution expressly delegates to the congress the power to establish uniform laws

congress au thority to establish uniform set of bankruptcy exemptions which would be bi nding upon the states by virtue of the supremacy clause the code does not do so10 despite recommendations from the 1970 bankruptcy commission advising cong ress to adopt uniform system of national bankruptcy exemptions11 congress declined to do so congress permits not just that the debtor make an election between federal and state created exemptions but permits the states to deny debtors the use of or opt out from federal exemptions12 there is significant variance between the states in the generosity of their exemptions and more than half have enacted laws that deny debtors the use of federal exemptions13 when the debtors state of domicile has not enacted legislation which precludes debtor from electing federal exemptions the following are available14 the debtors aggregate in terest not to exceed 18 450 in real or personal property that the debtor uses as residence or in burial plot for the debtor or dependent the debtors interest not to exceed 2950 in motor vehicle the debtors interest not to exceed 475 in any one item or 9850 in aggregate value in household furnishings household goods

nonbankruptcy federal statutes the amount and value of state law exemptions varies enormously among the best known are those states with homestead exemptions of unlimited monetary value15 media attention is frequently given to wealthy debtors who establish prebankruptcy residency in state with generous homes tead exemption but what may appear to be anecdotal illustrations of abuse are the result of deliberate congressional decision to permit states to limit their residents to state law exemptions and of the deliberate statutory policy of various states to permit fo r whatever reason residents to avail themselves of an unlimited homestead exemption another area which leads to great disparity in the treatment of consumer debtors is the disposition of pension funds in some instances debtors pension funds may be completely excluded from the bankruptcy estate16 in others they may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32741crs6 17 11 usc 522d10e 18 11 usc 303 19 52 stat 840 june 22 1938 20 292 us 234 1934exemptible under either the codes exemptions17 or state law the net result of the complex interaction of these laws is that debtors pension assets often substantial may be excluded or some or all of the pensions funds may be exempted from the bankruptcy estate available to satisfy creditor claims when assets are excluded from the estate they are not administered by the bankruptcy court when they are exempted they are beyond creditors reach thus the fact that debtors emerge from bankruptcy with various amounts of assets intact though often perceived to be an abuse of the law is often result of the laws application voluntary vs mandato ry reorganization although debtor may be forced into chapters 7 or 11 involuntarily by creditors18 that is rarely the case the vast majority of all bankruptcy cases are filed voluntarily by the debtor chapter 13 may only be entered voluntarily by the debtor chapter 13 was expressly designed to have builtin incentives to encourage debtor filing as an alternative to liqui dation under chapter 7 among those features are the superdischarge ie the possibility of paying down and ultimately discharging some types of bt that may not be discha rged under chapter 7 and the ability to save the debtors home by permitting him to cure arrearages in home mortgage where defaults may have occurred and foreclosure proceedings commenced creditors are benefitted by the best in terests of the creditor confirmation standard ie the requirement that credito rs receive more under the debtors proposed reorganization plan than they would if the debtor were liqui dated under chapter 7 indeed creditors generally receive greater repayment when the debtor pledges post petition income to debt repayment than is the case under chapter 7 where only pre petition assets are dedicated to prepetition debt satisfac tion that is why creditors have long sought mandato ry consumer reorganization the fresh start policy im plicit in bankruptcy law the question whether debtors should be comp elled to pay creditors from future wages is not new one although it is central to the legislati on currently under consideration the issue was raised long before the current code was enacted chapter xiii wage earner reorganization was formally introduced into the bankruptcy act of 1898 by 1938 amendments effected by the chandler act19 in 1934 however the us supreme court in local loan co v hunt 20 had occasion to consider the question whether bankruptcy debtors assignment of fu ture wages under state law created lien that was nondischargeable under the federal bankruptcy law creditors argued that their claim for future wages created security interest statutory lien that could not be discharged in bankruptcy the court held that an assignment of future wages did not create nondischargeable lien in bankruptcyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32741crs7 21 id at 244 citations omitted 22 report of the commissi on on bankruptcy laws supra at 157one of the primary purposes of the bankruptcy act is to relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive inde btedness and permit him to start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes when person assigns future wages he in effect pledges his future earning power the power of the individual to earn living for himself and those dependent upon him is in the nature of personal liberty quite as much if not more than it is property right to preserve its free exercise is of the utmost importance not only because it is funda mental private necessity but because it is matter of great public concern from the viewpoint of the wageearner there is little difference between not earning at all and earning wholly for creditor pauperism may be the necessary result of either the amount of the indebtedness or the proporti on of wages assigned may here be small but the principle once established will equally apply where both are very great the new opportunity in life and the clear field for future effort which it is the purpose of the bankruptcy act to afford the emancipated debtor would be of little value to the wageearner if he were obliged to face the necessity of devoting the whole or considerable portion of his earnings for an indefinite time in the future to the payment of indebtedness incurred prior to his bankruptcy confining our determination to the case in hand and leaving prospective liens upon other forms of acquisitions to be dealt with as they may arise we reject the illinois decisions as to the effect of an assignment of wages earned after bankruptcy as being destructive of the purpose and spirit of the bankruptcy act21 both the 1970 and the 1994 bankruptcy co mmissions considered and rejected the notion of requiring consumer debtors to devote future income to debt satisfaction as condition of obtaining relief in bankruptcy 1973 report of the commission on bankruptcy laws t h commission which helped lay the foundati on for the current code considered proposals for limiting the bankruptcy relief available to wage earners the commission noted that the frequency of utilization of wage earner reorganization chapter xiii under the bankruptcy act of 1898 refl ected local legal culture that is the familiarity of the local bar with and the propensity of attorneys to encourage debtors to file under chapter x iii22 in some districts debtors were advised by attorneys more knowledgeable in implementing re organization as to its viability and were encouraged by the court and creditors to reorganize in others wage earner reorganization was an unf amiliar and therefore nonpreferred procedure nonetheless the commission specifically considered and rejected the notion of requiring wage earner reorganization proposals have been made to congress from time to time that debtor able to obtain relief under chapter x iii should be denied relief in straight

the house judiciary committee determined that it should not recommend the enactment of this proposed change in the provisions of the bankruptcy act applicable to wage earners the proposal was opposed by th judicial conference of the united states the national bankrupt cy conference the association of the bar of the city of new york and spokesmen for labor unions the measure was supported by the american bar association th american bankers association the chamber of commerce of the united states cuna international inc the national federation of independent bu siness and the american industrial bankers association the arguments against the proposal included objections made to the difficulties of achieving any nationally uniform standard of application by referees throughout the country as evidenced by the divergence of their viewpoints regarding the virtues of chapter xiii another view expressed by opponents was that fulfillment of debt ors commitment made pursuant to chapter xiii plan requires not merely debtors consent but pos itive determination by him and his family to live within the constraints imposed by the plan during its entire term and will to persevere with the plan to the end imposition of chapter xiii plan on an unw illing debtor it was said would be almost bound to encourage the debtor to change employment and if necessary to move to another area to escape the importuning calls and correspondence of his creditors likewise those petitioning debtors turned away by the court on the ground that they failed to show that re lief would not be obtainable under chapter xiii would be motivated to change jobs and locations to get away from creditors who would threaten garnishment and other means of collecting debts in states where wage garnishment is an unavailable remedy of creditors the impact of the proposed legislation would have been minimal final argument made in opposition to the proposed legislation was that business debtors are not subject to any limitation on the availability of straight bankruptcy relief including discharge from debts and it was pointed out that quite apart from bankruptcy business debtors are able to incorporat and to limit their liability to their investments in corporate assets to fo rce unwilling wage earners to devote their future earnings to payment of past debts smacked to some of debt peonage particularly when business debtors coul d not be subjected to the same kind of regimen under the bankruptcy act the commission has considered the arguments made for conditioning the availability of bankruptcy relief including discharge on showing by the debtor that he cannot obtain adequate relief fro m his condition of financial distress by proposing plan for payment of his debts out of his future earnings the commission has concluded that forced pa rticipation by debtor in plan requiring contributions out of future in come has so little prospect for success that it

forcing unwilling debtors into chapter 13 would only burden the system decreasing both the overall repayment to creditors and th successful rehabilitation of debtors in time of increasing strain on judicial resources questions also have arisen about the number of judges clerks and ot her staff needed to administer means test to hundreds of thousands of debtor s annually the credit industry has sought means testing consistently for at least 30 years but congress has consistently refused to change the basic structur of the consumer bankruptcy laws there is dispute on one point bank ruptcy should be used only by the needy and not by others the bankruptcy laws should never invite abuse when congress charged the commission with its duties it cautioned that there was evidence that the bankruptcy system needed radical reform it characterized the system as generally satisfactory and directed the commission to review improve and update the code in ways which do not disturb the fundamental tenets and balance of current law the commission conducted an intensive review of consumer bankruptcy that resulted in full set of recommendations but the proposals contemplate change in the basic structure of consumer bankruptcy access to chapter 7 and to chapter 13 the central feature of the consumer bankruptcy system for n early 60 years should be preserved26 in summary the two bankruptcy commissions charged with considering the prospect of mandatory consumer reorga nization cited the following reasons in support of their rejection of the concept difficulty of compliance by

the idea27 legislative goals of consumer reform the high volume of consumer bankruptcy filings during the 1990s fueled the argument that the current law is too leni ent ie debtorfriendly proponents of consumer bankruptcy reform cite many reas ons for their support the legislation is intended among other things to make filing more difficult and thereby thwart bankruptcies of convenience to revive the social s tigma of bankruptcy filing to prevent bankruptcy from being utilized as financial planning tool to determine who can pay their indebtedness and to ensure that they do to lower consumer credit interest rates and to maximize the distribution to both secured and unsecured creditors to effect these goals the pr oposals implement means test to determine consumer debtors eligibility to file under chapter 7 opponents argue that making it more difficult to file will undermine the rehabilitative purpose of bankruptcy and have disparate impact on financially less sophisticated debtors they believe that there is insufficient evidence of pervasive abuse to warrant major revisions to bankruptcy law and that consumer filings continue to be the result of uncontrollabl factors such as job loss catastrophic medical bills andor divorce studies from early in the reform legislations consideration attempted to estimate the increase in creditor recovery that would come about as result of

equity of national bankruptcy system the breadth of the homestead exemption in state with an unlimited one was articulated in havoco of america v hill 29 the supreme court of florida responding to certified question from the eleventh circuit court of appeals held that debtor who converts nonexempt assets into an exempt homestead with the specific intent to hinder delay or defraud creditors is ne vertheless qualified beneficiary of the state homes tead exemption the court explained that the state constitution recognizes only three exceptions to the exemption payment of taxes on the property contractual obligations fo r the purchase improvement or repair of the property and contractua l obligations for house field or other labor performed on the realty nor could floridas fr audulent conveyance law expand or limit the scope of the homestead exemption the court was loathe to provide constitutional sanction to the debtors use of the exemption to shield his assets from creditors but viewed the state constitutional provision as unqualified these constitutional exceptions are unqualified they create personal qualification touching the moral character of the resident nor do they undertake to exclude the vicious the criminal or the immoral from the benefits so provided the law provides for punishment of persons convicted of illegal acts but this forfeiture of homestead rights guaranteed by our constitution is not part of the punishment30 conflicting views on an appr opriate homestead exemption have been prime subject of debate in connec tion with reform proposals although earlier versions of senatepassed legisl ation imposed firm cap on exemptible home equity such provisions have generally been omitted from final versions of the legislation31 the preferred solution is to attempt to dissuade potentia l debtors from venueshopping by imposing homestead caps on residentd ebtor who has moved to take advantage of generous homestead exemption most versions of the bill however allow debtor to exempt up to one million dollars in pension assets pension amendments attempt to clarify and standardize the cu rrent hodgepodge of st ate and federal laws covering protectible pension assets hence consumer reform would still permit debtors potentially to exempt millions of dollars from their bankruptcy estates although this scenario is rare it is cons istent with current law critics of the legislation many of whom may be critics of the current opt out system argue that it would be even more inappropriate in light of means testing the means test formula would be

nondischa rgeability of debts incurred through violations of laws relating to the pr ovision of lawful goods and services37 the version passed by the house did not have comparable provision the schumer amendment in the senate bill provided the basis for housesenate compromise extensive negotiations took place under the leadership of senator schumer and representative hyde it was reported in the press that the conference had reached agreement on the entire bill but for the schumer amendment representative hyde and senator schumer apparently agreed th at antiabortion protesters should not be able to file for bankruptcy to escape fi nes and civil penalties for acts or threats of violence but they disagreed on the extent to which protesters who file for bankruptcy should be compelled to pay judgments for nonviolent acts of prot est nevertheless compromise was reached and the bill was re ported out of conference as in the senate bill reference in the conference report was made to laws relating to the provision of lawful g oods and services subsequent to the filing of the conf erence report renewed opposition to the schumer amendment arose the concerns expressed were those which
