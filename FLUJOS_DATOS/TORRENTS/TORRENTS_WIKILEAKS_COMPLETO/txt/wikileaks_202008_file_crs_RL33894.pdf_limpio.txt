legislative activity on election reform but more importantly to provide information that may be useful in deliberations on those issues in the 110th congress while hava appears generally to have been wellreceived by both election officials and the public1 some provisions have been c ontroversial especially the following accessibility of voting systems section 301a3 of hava requires that each polling place have at least one fully acce ssible voting system beginning in 2006 some observers believe that this requirement is exce ssive and exceptions should be made for jurisdictions with low populati on such as rural areas and small towns where voters are wellknown to election offi cials proponents counter that the high and increasing mobility of the us popul ation and the problem of the hidden disabled make accessibility essential for full enfranchi sement bills were introduced in the 109th congress that addressed this issue that is not the case with the other ma jor controversy relating to accessibility sec 301a3 promotes the use of di rect recording electronic dre voting machines they are widely recognized as the most accessible kind of voting system however they have been criticized as being insufficiently secure in comparison to paperbased systems and several bills w ould have required that they produce paper ballotshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33894crs2 provisional voting sec 302a requires that an person be per mitted to fill out and submit provisional ballot at polling place if the person claims to be registered eligible voter in the jurisdic tion but is not so considered by election officials at the polling place it went into effect in 2004 while some concerns have been raised about difficulty of implement ation the major controversy with respect to this provision has been with respect to the criteria for counting provisional ballots in particular whether ballot should be counted if cast in polling place other than that at which the voter is registere d several bills were introduced that would have addressed th is controversy among other issues that arose in conjunction with recent federal elections and which were addressed by proposed legislation were concerns about political activity and conflict of interest among voting system vendors and among election officials the use of deceptive practices relating to voting by politicaloperatives or others enforcement of hava requirements access to polling places by observers the provisioning of voting machines to polling places the level of training given to pollworkers voting rights of

federal elections see crs report rs20639 internet voting by kevin j colemanexcuse absentee voting which means that any voter can request an absentee ballot without needing to provide reason for the request2 several states permit registering as permanent absentee voter under the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act of 1986 uocava pl 99410 all persons serving in the military their spouses and dependents and us citizens living abroad are eligible to vote absentee in federal elections versions of the law date to world war ii the various state laws and uocava illustrate the trend toward making absentee voting available to larger numbers of voters either for reasons of convenience or to secure the franchise for eligible voters whose circumstances preclude voting in person critics of this trend cite concerns about the possi bility of fraud as none of th safeguards of the polling place exist in the polling place each vote is cast in private it cannot be connected with the person who cast it and the voter ca nnot be easily bribed or coerced those safeguards cannot be guaranteed for absent ee balloting or some ot her types of remote voting3 and many election officials resist the trend toward noexcuse absentee voting for this reason despite those trends and concerns there is little in hava that relates to absentee voting sec 246 requires the eac to conduct study on postagefree absentee voting and 303b requires firs t time registrants who vote by mail to include specified form of identifi cation with their ballots but most hava absenteevoting provisions

participation including privacy and independence as for other voter s 301a3 it requires that there be at least one accessible syst em in each polling place starting in 2006 and that any voting systems purchased with hava title ii funds starting in 2007 be fully accessible it further stat that properly equipped dr will meet the accessibility requirement dres can provide improved accessibility in several ways they include magnified ballots for the visionimpaired audio ballots for blind voters and potentially voters whose primary language is unwritten or english speakers with substantial reading difficulty and special interfaces for physically challenged voters however dres have also been controversia l because of concerns about security and reliability in recording and c ounting votes as result some observers have proposed that alternatives to dres be used to address accessibility needs some argue that paperbased systems can be made sufficiently accessible either electronically or mechanically others believe that making those systems accessible is not currently feasible and that any risks associated with the use of dres can be addressed through administrative measures see also the sections on security of voting systems and on voter verification below three bills required that hava accessibility requirements be met through use of modular voting architecture in wh ich different voting functions such as generating and casting votes are pe rformed by separate devices4 hr 550 required that voting systems used for disability access separate the functions of vote generation vote verification and vote casting if the system is stric tly electronic and allowed the voter to verify and cast the ba llot on paper or anothe r medium privately and independently in an accessible manner hr 939 and s 450 required that at least one voting system per polling place provide opportunity for inspection and verification of the ballot for disabled voters and language

major manufacturers of dres and optical scan systems wald odell in 2003 fundraising letter reportedly stated his commitment to deliver ing ohio for president bush in the 2004 election5 this led some democr atic activists to publicly voice concerns about partisan conflict of interest on the part of diebold concerns about such conflicts have been voiced by some electionreform advocates for years the concerns have not been limited to potential partisan bias but have also included business relationships among vendors election offi cials and testing laboratories some advocates have argued for standards and other controls over ch potential conflicts of interest while others have proposed use of govern ment or nonprof it laboratories for certification with some even proposin g federalization of votingsystem design and manufacturing as occurs in some other countries6 however others believe that such concerns are unwarranted and that additional measures are needed to control conflict of interest several bills would have addressed potential conflicts by manufacturers and laboratories hr 470 would have modified 231b of hava to require the eac to establish standards regarding conflicts of interest by laboratories that certify voting systems hr 550 and hr 3094 required both certification laboratories and manufacturers to meet eac c onflictofinterest standards with the latter

prohibited officers of voting system companies from ta king part in prohib ited political activities as defined in the bill in any election for which voting system produced by the manufacturer is used see also the section on political activities of election officials below early voting early voting usually refers to the practice in which election jurisdictions permit voting in polling place before election day while absentee voting is form of early voting the former involves ballots cas t via mail rather than in person and the two are usually treated separately see the section on absentee and mail voting above texas first impleme nted limited version of early voting in 1963 there are many approaches to early voting and th number of states using it is growing according to the national conference of state legislatures 23 states had some form of early voting in 2004 whereas only 13 states offered it in 2000 in some states voter can cast ballot at any of several locations in the jurisdiction before election day while in other states the voter must visit the election officials office to do so the days and hours for voting vary as well some observers have criticized early voting as distorting to the electoral process and being open to certain kinds of fra ud and abuse one disadvantage concerns developments or issues in campaign occu rring after early voters have cast their ballots also as with other forms of remo voting greater risk of fraud arguably exists proponents state in contrast that early voting can increase turnout and lessen the risk of certain kinds of distorti ons such as undue impact from lateoccurring events in maryland for example the legislature approved early voting for 2006 over the governors veto but the law was rejected by court of appeals ruling on august 257 objections raised in court included the assertion that it would require amending the constitution which guarantees voting in ones ward or election district on election day maryland s version of early voting would have made balloting available before the election at limited number of places in each county despite such controversies the recent increase in the number of states offering early voting suggests that the trend will continue hr 533 hr 939 hr 3557 s 17 s 450 would have required states to implement early voting and for the eac to establish standards for it hr 2104 required states to permit local jurisdictions to allow early voting should they wish to do so s 414 required that voter rolls at pollin g places indicate which voters have voted prior to

elections are held on days when businesses are closed either by holiday or by holding the election on weekend some observers advocate such an approach in the united states arguin g that it will increase turnout and improve the availability of qualified pollworkers opponents argue that there is evidence for those assertions and that alternatives such as early and noexcuse absentee voting already exist to accommodate voters who have difficulty getting to polls on election day hava requires the eac to perform study on the feasibility and advisability of an electionday holiday nd other alternatives sec 241b10 but it is silent on the timing of that study hr 533 hr 939 and s 17 specified deadline of six months after enactment for the eac report on estab lishing an electionday holiday

complaint among advocates of improved election administration is the lack of consistent nd reliable data across states relating to various aspects of the conduct of elections states vary substa ntially in the data they collect and make publicly available for example some jurisdictions when reporting election results release only the number of votes for each candidate that makes it impossible to determine how many voters failed to cast va lid votes for given office these are known as residual votes10 hava requires the eac to serve as national clearinghouse and resource for the comp ilation of information and review of procedures with respect to the administr ation of federal elections sec 202 but does not in general require the eac to co llect or the states to provide specific information in that regard11 the eac has developed an electionday survey that it first administered for the 2004 federal election12 this instrument as well as other eac surveys13 could potentially

over methods to enforce compliance with the acts re quirements as enacted hava provides two methods the us attorney general may bring civil action to enforce compliance 401 and each state is required to estab lish grievance procedures 402 there has been some debate over whether current law provides individuals with the right of federal court action in re sponse to alleged violations ruling in one case before the 2004 federal election affirmed such right15 but whether it would be upheld in other cases is not settled hr 470 would have required that polling pl aces have posted notice of the state

representative 2 usc 2c 32 for example suppose the following scenario there are three candidates b and c at the first tally receives 40 of first c hoice votes b 35 and c 25 candidate has won majority but c having the fewest firstchoice votes is eliminated of those voters who voted for c as first choice 80 chose b as their second choice and 20 chose those votes are then added to the totals for and b leading to final result of receiving 45 of the vote and b 55 b ther efore wins the election the example shows benefits and disadvantages of instantrunoff voting more voters clearly had stronger preference for than either other candidate however majority of voters also preferred b over proportional representation and instantrunoff voting in the united states elected officials are chosen mostly in single member plurality elections whereby the candidate with the most votes in the election district is elected30 parliamentary electi ons often use type of proportional system with candidates elected from party list accord ing to the overall proportion of the vote received by party form of proportiona l representation has been used on occasion at the local level in the united states to elect multiple representatives from single district with voters choosing more than one candidate for the contest variation on this approach is cumulative voting in which the voter can split his or her vote for example voting for 2 candidates gives each onehalf vote voting for 3 onethird and so forth federal law does not permit proporti onal representation for seats in the house of representatives31 another approach is instantrunoff ections in which vot ers rank candidates and if candidate wins ma jority of first choices the candidate with the lowest number of first choices is eliminated nd the second choice on each of those ballots is added to the totals for the corresponding candidates remaining32 the process is repeated if necessary until one candidate has majority of votes this method is used in some other countries and in some local jurisdictions in the united states hr 2690 would have permitted states to use multiseat congressional districts for some or all of

permit recounts requested by vot ers recounts may also be ordered in at least some states if irregularities are suspected some observers believe that to help prevent and det ect fraud and error partial recounts should be done for all elections nd some believe that those recounts should be done by hand rather than machine36 the likelihood that such an approach will detect any irregularities depends on several factors especially the size and structure of the recount37 usually partial recount would i nvolve selecting sample of precincts recounting all the ballots in each and comparing the results with the original count in general the probability that any problems with the original count would be detected will increase as the pe rcentage of precincts recounted increases and as the number of precincts with errors increases nationwide partial manual recount could pose significant logistical ch allenges for example recount of 2 of precincts after the 2004 federal elec tion would have invol ved hand counting 24 million ballots also states are free to adopt different standards for what constitutes vote on given system therefore if the eac rather than states performed the

immigrants on apportionment restoration of voting rights to convicted persons voting eligibility has been an issue throughout the history of the united states most often the focus has been on suffrage itself who should have the right to vote in the colonial period and early years of the republic requirements based on landownership age and sex were the norm and they were intended to limit voting to those with stake in the community and the necessary understanding of public affairs that naturally followed lthough nonlandowners and women may have voted in some places eligibility was mos tly limited to landed freemen of 21 years or older because the us constitution addr essed neither eligib ility nor how elections should be conducted practices varied from state to state over time uniform requirements for eligibility concerning r ace sex economic status and age were adopted the 15th 19th 24th and 26th amendments eventually pattern of registration practices had deve loped to maintain control of the franchise and serve the interests of the political parties citizenship and lengthy residency requirements were adopted in part as reaction to wave s of immigration and the rise of machine politics and by requiring voter to declare their party affiliation at the time of registration voting in primaries would be limited to party members only in the south the dominant democratic party dopted the white primary which excluded african americans from party membersh ip and consequently from any kind of effective participation the white primary poll taxes liter acy tests the grandfather clause and other discriminatory devices were eventually banned yet they illustrate the history of voter registration as means for limiting participation with the advent of universal

the steps proposed are requiring th use of open source software code which would be available for public inspection prohibition of wireless communications in voting systems adoption of stringent security process standards and practices by manufacturers and others in the chain of custody for voting systems the development of systems that effectively mimic electronically the observability of manually counted paper ballo t systems and the printing by dres of document ballots where voter could verify the c hoices made and that would be handcounted if the election results were contested

security expert s believe that ope nsource code is more secure than proprietary or closedsour ce code while others believe that closed source code can be at least as secure43 voting systems currently

providing closedsource cots software would be willing to disc lose the code in additi on hava defines voting system to include components other than those in the voting m achine per such as the computer code used to define ballots and to make materials available to the voter such components are part of all voting systems and proba bly use proprietary software operating systems word processors da tabase software and so fort h in all cases therefore it appears unlikely that any voting system currently in use in the united states except handcounted paperballot systems wher the ballot is not generated with the aid of computer could meet an opensource requirement it is also not clear what impact an opensource requirement would have on the marketplace for voting systems while it may draw in new companies that specialize in using opensource code and provide new opportunities for innovation it could also cause some current voting system manufacturers to withdraw from the marketplace especially if they believed that revealing the code of their systems would substantially reduce the co mpetitiveness of their products44 such potential problems could presumably be addressed by precisely fining what components of what voting systems an opens ource requirement would affect one alternative to open source is the use of reference collection such as nists national software reference library45 digital signature is determined for deposited software and can be compared to the signature of corresponding software received by state or local jurisdiction before it is installed in voting machines if the signatures differ the jurisdictions software has been modified several major vendors have voluntarily deposited software with the library for use in this kind of comparison46 this procedure permits testing of software integrity without revealing proprietary code but it cannot test for problems that mig ht exist in the reference copy itself for example if malicious code were hidden in the software at the factory during the development process it would not be detected by this procedure however other methods are available to reduce the risk of such

information publicly available communications the use of wireless communi cations in computer systems provides unique risks with respect to attack by hackers and therefore requires special attention with regard to security some observers believe that voting systems should not use wireless communications because of those potential security risks while others believe that such communications can be made sufficiently secure however any mode of electronic co mmunication by modem internet or memory card as well as wireless provides pot ential points of attack for voting system but some means of communication is required ma ny computer experts would argue that proper use of cryptographic methods would provide more security than prohibition of any one mode of communication but th at if wireless communication were to be prohibited then internet and possibly even modem communications should be as well nevertheless wireless communication is arguably the least secure by far of the three

an election year and to maintain an updated versi on of this information on an internet website voter error after the 2000 election the problem of voter error was one of the issues driving the replacement of voting machines in many jurisdictions the residual vote50 was especially high for punchcard voting system s in general the worstperforming systems are those that provide little or feedback to the voter for error prevention and correction hava addressed this problem by providing funding to states for replacement of punchcard and levermachine systems51 and by requiring that voting systems provide for error detection and correction however it exempted hand counted paper ballot punchcard and centr alcount systems from this requirement provided that states using such systems educate voters about the impact of marking errors and how to correct them there are established standards or be nchmarks for votererror rates the vvsg contains standards for mach ine error but not voter rror one problem is that voters may intentionally fail to vote on one or more ballot items or may even intentionally mismark the ballot ballot secrecy makes it impossible to determine with any certainty how much of the residual vote is intentional nevertheless some observers have called for the establishment of national benchmarks for residual votes hr 533 hr 939 s 17 and s 450 would

exceed the benchmark they also required the eac to study and report to congress on certain communities that have historically high rates of intentional undervoting compared to the rest of the na tion and directed that the eac may set separate benchmark for or exclude such communities from the national benchmark hr 3557 encouraged states to distribute sample ballots and other voter information prior to elections to reduce voter error voter identification hava requires that certain voters who d registered by mail present form of identification from list specified in the act 303b the identification requirement applies only to firsttime registrants who register by mail if the voter has not previously voted in federal election in the state or in local election jurisdiction in cases where the state does not have computerized statewide voter registration system such voters must present one of the following forms of identification current and valid photo iden tification or copy if voting by mail or copy of current utility bill bank statement government check paycheck or other government document that shows th name and address of the voter hava also requires that mailin voter regist ration forms contain check box for the registrant to certify that he or she is us citizen the act does not prevent states from establishing more stringent identification requirements following the passage of hava states enacted laws to implement the hava identification requirements and in some cases more stringent requirements some states have additional requi rements for voters to present form of identification beyond those in hava other states also require voters to present form of identification from the list in hava or from more extended list still others require all voters to present photo iden tification in all cases voters who cannot present identification are permitted to cast provisional ballot the adequacy of the hava requirement s been controversial and several bills were introduced in the 109th and pr evious congresses both to broaden and restrict that requirement53 hconres 247 and sconres 53 expressed the sense of congress that national photo identifi cation requirements for voters should be rejected and that the us department of justice should challenge any state law that has discriminatory photoiden tification requirements hr 533 hr 939 s 450 and s 17

document ballot systems handcounted paper ballots punchcards and optical scan ballots arguably exhibit somewhat more verifiability than the nondocument systems lever machines and dres with current dres voter sees representation of the choices made on computer screen or ballot face but ca nnot see what choices the machine actually records when the vote is cast there is independent record of the voters choices that the machine totals can be checked against65 document ballots on the other hand permit voter to check the actual ba llot before casting it although the voter cannot verify that the votes on the ballo t were counted as the voter intended many computer security experts view the lack of transparency of dres as significant security vulnerability and some advocate addressing this vulnerability by requiring paper record of the voters choi ces that the voter can verify before casting the ballot this approach is often called voterverified paper audit trail or vvpat the vvsg treat
