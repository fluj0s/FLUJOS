legislation on the house floor are offered in committee of the whole measures considered under suspension of the rules are not amendable on the floor and few amendments are proposed to bills and resolutions considered in the house or in the house as in committee of the whole the houses procedures recognize distinctions between first and seconddegree amendments between perfecting and substitute amendments and among amendments in the forms of motions to strike to insert and to strike out and insert an amendment in the nature of substitute proposes to replace the entire text of bill or resolution all amendments must be germane to the text they would amend and they are subject to other general prohibitions such as that against proposing only to reamend language that already has been fully amended additional restrictions apply to appropriations and tax amendments and the budget process creates various other points of order that members may make against certain amendments in general member must make point of order against an amendment before debate on it begins unless that point of order is waived by special rule in committee of the whole measures usually are considered for amendment one section or title at time members must offer their amendments to appropriate parts of bill when it has been read or designated each amendment is debated under the fiveminute rule providing five minutes for the member offering the amendment and five minutes for members in opposition after this first 10 minutes of debate members may obtain additional time for debate by offering pro forma amendments in the form of motions to strike the last word or the requisite number of words unless barred by the terms of special rule reported by the house committee on rules each amendment in committee of the whole may be amended by perfecting amendment or substitute amendment or both substitute for an amendment also is amendable after the committee of the whole disposes of the last amendment to be offered to the bill it rises and the house then votes again on all the amendments the committee has approved recommittal motion usually offers final opportunity to amend bill or joint resolution before the house votes on passing it httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98995g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561

process on the floor of the house of representatives gives members an opportunity to change the provisions of the bills and resolutions on which they are going to vote this report2 summarizes many of the procedures and practices affecting this process which can be among the most complex as well as the most important stages of legislative consideration3 the discussion that follows is intended to be useful introduction however it is not exhaustive and it cannot substitute for careful examination of the houses rules and precedents themselves for close observation of the house in session and for consultation with the parliamentarian and his associates on specific procedural problems and opportunities the way in which the house considers each measure affects members opportunities for amending it and the procedures that govern the amending process there are essentially four alternative sets of procedures or modes of consideration by which the house considers public bills and resolutions on the floor 1 under suspension of the rules 2 in the house under the hour rule 3 in committee of the whole and the house and rarely 4 in the house as in committee of the whole 4 the overwhelming majority of the floor amendments on which representatives vote are offered while measures are being considered in committee of the whole before being reported back to the house for votes on final passage under the suspension of the rules procedure floor amendments are prohibited although the member making the motion may do so with an amendment in the house and the house as in committee of the whole floor amendments are technically in order but are much less likely to be offered either because of the procedures involved or because of the nature of the measures being considered there are several distinctions among different kinds of amendments as well as some general principles and prohibitions governing the amendments that members and committees can offer these distinctions principles and prohibitions can be important whatever set of procedures the house is following although they are more likel to matter when measures are considered in committee of the whole than under other circumstances this report begins with discussion of distinctions among amendments followed by some observations on drafting amendments and on several general principles and prohibitions affecting the amending process next it examines the specific possibilities and procedures for offering and 1 this report was originally written by dr stanley bach form erly senior specialist in the legislative process at crs 2 all citations in this report which necessarily are selective are to the rules of the 110th congress the annotations to the rules appearing in the house rules and manual for the 109th congress hdoc 108241 and the precedents compiled and published in house practice guide to the rules precedents and procedures of the house cited as house practice procedure in the us

volume 9 of deschlerbrown precedents of the us house of representatives 3 this report only addresses the amending process that may take place on the floor before the house first votes on passing measure it assumes basic familiarity with some of the other stages of the legislative process such as committee hearings markups and reports the manner in which measures reach the house floor for consideration and the general purposes and uses of special rules crs reports that discuss some of these and related subjects are listed at the end of this report 4 clause 5 of rule xv provides for considering private bills and resolutions under this procedure although it is rarely used in practice

with measures that are debated and amended in the house under the hour rule and then those that are considered first in committee of the whole and then in the house the possible amendment tree that may develop is then discussed the report also discusses several other elements of the amending process the special procedures and rules governing appropriations and tax amendments and amendments affecting federal spending programs the procedures for making points of order against amendments and the effects of special rules on the amending process at the end of the report is list of sources of additional information this report concentrates on amendment procedures under the houses standing rules and precedents it does not address the various ways in which special rules can affect the amending process nor does it discuss the points of order that members may make against amendments under the congressional budget and impoundment c ontrol act of 1974 and subsequent laws on these subjects see crs report 98612 special rules and options for regulating the amending process and crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno

their degree their form and their effects moreover these are not merely analytical distinctions they can help us understand what amendments members may offer under what circumstances and with what consequences g6g142g144g155g142g142g156g561g152g143g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 whenever bill or resolution can be amended on the house floor it is subject to amendments in two degrees an amendment in the first degree proposes to change the text of the measure itself after representative offers firstdegree amendment but before the house votes on it another member may propose an amendment to that amendment5 an amendment to firstdegree amendment is an amendment in the second degree the house then debates and votes on the seconddegree amendment before voting on the firstdegree amendment which now may have been amended as general rule third degree amendments amendments to seconddegree amendments are not in order 6 g8g152g155g150g156g561g152g143g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 amendments may also be distinguished in terms of their form first an amendment may propose only to insert something into bill or resolution or firstdegree amendment without changing the provisions already in it for example the amendment may propose to insert new section or title without affecting the existing sections and titles 5 unless otherwise noted references throughout this report to the house also apply to the committee of the whole clause 12 of rule xviii states that the rules of the house are the rules of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union so far as applicable 6 house practice ch 2 sec 14 p 29 when the amendment to an amendment is substitute the substitute may be amended see the section on the amendment tree httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98995g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561

measure or firstdegree amendment without inserting anything in its place for example the amendment may propose to strike out as little as one word or as much as one or more titles of bill third and finally an amendment may propose to both strike out and insert by replacing something that is already in the measure or fi rstdegree amendment with something else for example the amendment may propose only to change dollar amount or it may replace section or title of bill with an entirely different version of that section or title members sometimes characterize their amendments in terms of these effects for instance representatives may state that they wish to offer motion to strike out particular section or that their amendment is motion to strike out and insert as this indicates amendments are special kind of motion g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561g152g143g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 third way of distinguishing among amendments is in terms of their effects with respect to firstdegree amendments an amendment may propose only to make some change in the portion of the bill or resolution being considered for amendment without affecting the rest of it such an amendment is perfecting amendment it proposes to changeand therefore presumably perfectthat portion of the bill without replacing it altogether for instance section of bill may authorize an amount of money to be appropriated for certain purposes an amendment to change only the dollar figure but not the purposes for which that amount is authorized would be perfecting amendment on the other hand an amendment may propose to strike out the entire pending portion of bill whether it be paragraph section or titleand replace it completely for instance the amendment could propose to strike out section of an authorization bill and replace it with new section that changes both the amount that is authorized and the purposes for which it is authorized such an amendment may be designated an amendment in the nature of substitute although members typically do not do so 7 of greater practical importance are the differences in effects among amendments to amendments an amendment proposing to make some change in the text of firstdegree amendment without replacing it completely is perfecting amendment by contrast an amendment to replace the entire text of firstdegree amendment is substitute amendment the significance of this distinction will emerge from the discussion of the amendment tree the difference between perfecting amendments and substitute amendments depends primarily on the way in which they are drafted and not on the magnitude of the policy changes they would make perfecting amendment may replace all but the first word line or sentence of section of bill or firstdegree amendment and so entirely change its substantive effect conversely 7 while an amendment in the nature of substitute is in every instance motion to strike out and insert the term amendment in the nature of substitute applies only to those motions which pr opose to strike out an entire pending text and to insert new matter and is not used to describe those motions to strike out and insert which may be properly characterized as perfecting amendments and which go only to portion of the pending text house practice ch 2 sec 7 p 21

but might make only one minor substantive change and replace the remainder with precisely the same language perfecting amendment may take any one of the three possible forms it may propose to strike out to insert or to strike out and insert on the other hand substitute amendment is proposal to replace one thing with another and so it always takes the form of motion to strike out and insert g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g16g138g157g158g155g142g561g152g143g561g21g158g139g156g157g146g157g158g157g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561 finally special kind of amendment known as an amendment in the nature of substitute always proposes to replace the entire text of bill or resolution not some lesser portion of the measure this amendment strikes out everything after the enacting clause of bill or the resolving clause of resolution and replaces the entire text of the measure with different text8 if majority of members vote for such an amendment representatives cannot offer any additional amendments to the measure because it has been amended in its entirety when members refer to an amendment in the nature of substitute they almost always have this kind of amendment in mind although as noted above the same phrase can be in technical sense applied to an amendment that proposes to replace whatever portion of the measure is then being considered for amendment there are several unique characteristics about the way in which the house considers amendments in the nature of substitutes for the entire text of measures first most often this kind of amendment is recommended by committee at the same time it reports the measure itself and in practice members almost always want to devote far more of their time and attention on the floor to this committee alternative than to the text of the bill as introduced for this reason special rules reported by the rules committee usually give committee substitute special standing during the amending process in committee of the whole by providing for members to offer their amendments to that substitute rather than to th bill itself the committee substitute is considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment meaning that it is not treated as firstdegree amendment instead it is amendable in two degrees as if it were the text of measure 9 second if an amendment in the nature of substitute for bill or resolution is not given this special standing member can propose it as firstdegree amendment at only two points during the amending process in committee of the whole the amendment is in order either at the very beginning of the process or at the very end after the committee has voted on all other amendments to the text of the measure10 but even if member or committee offers an 8 the enacting clause reads be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled and is followed by the text of the b ill there is different resolving clause for each kind of resolution simple concurrent and joint that also precedes the text of the resolution 9 special rules also may give the same special standing to such an amendment in the nature of substitute that has been printed in report of the rules committee or the congressional record or that is embodied as the text of another bill 10 an amendment in the nature of substitute for bill is in order after the first section of the bill has been read for amendmentor following the reading of the final section of the bill however an amendment in the nature of substitute for bill is not in order at an intermediate stage of the reading of course if the bill is considered as havin g been read for amendment then an amendment in the na ture of substitute may be offered at any time during consideration of the bill an amendment in the nature of substitute may ordinarily be offered after the reading of the first section of bill being read by sections notwithstanding the pendenc of committee amendments adding new continued

process the committee of the whole typically does not vote on it until the end of the process because members will direct mostusually allof their amendments to it finally when an amendment in the nature of substitute for everything after the enacting or resolving clause is proposed at the beginning of the amending process other members can propose amendments to the pending portion of the measure as well as to the complete substitute if so they vote on any and all such amendments before voting on the amendment in the nature of substitute this possibility which rarely arises in practice is discussed at the end of the section on the amendment tree g6g155g138g143g157g146g151g144g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 clause 1 of rule xvi requires that every amendment offered on the house floor must be in writing and it must be drafted accurately to achieve its intended procedural and policy effects each amendment must state precisely where and how it would amend the measure or other amendment identifying the specific pages lines and words it would affect 11 the text of every amendment reveals its form whether it inserts strikes out or strikes out and inserts and also may identify it as perfecting or substitute amendment the following examples illustrate some of the ways in which various kinds of amendments may be drafted amendments to measure to insert after line 8 on page 23 insert the following at the end of title iii insert the following new section to strike out beginning on page 3 strike out line 1 and all that follows through line 14 on page 4 to strike out

the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york insert the following perfecting amendmentto strike out in the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from california strike out section 2 perfecting amendmentto strike out and insert in the amendment offered by the gentleman from wisconsin strike out 100 and insert in lieu thereof 50 strike out section 1 of the pending amendment and insert in lieu thereof the following substitute amendment in lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the gentleman from texas insert the following it is sometimes possible to draft an amendment in more than one way it bears emphasizing that the distinction between perfecting and substitute amendments generally is matter of drafting style not substantive effect for example imagine an appropriations bill that includes the following on lines 6 and 7 of page 12 for the salaries and expenses of the congressional research service of the library of congress 500 member who wishes to amend this appropriation to increase it to 1000 could draft the amendment in at least two different ways on line 7 of page 12 strike out 500 and insert in lieu thereof 1000 or strike out lines 6 and 7 on page 12 and insert in lieu thereof the following for the salaries and expenses of the congressional research service of the library of congress 1000 these two amendments would have precisely the same substantive effect even though they are drafted differently representatives sometimes find it advisable to have amendments and especially amendments to amendments drafted in more than one way especially when bill or resolution is considered in committee of the whole because the development of an amendment tree may permit or encourage member to propose an amendment in one form but not in another the examples offered above are illustrative only the house rules committee regularly points out to members drafting amendments that they should use the office of legislative counsel to ensure that their amendments are properly drafted and should check with the office of the parliamentarian to be certain their amendmen ts comply with the rules of the house

restrict the amendments that committees and individual representatives may propose on the floor many of these principles and prohibitions derive from house precedents but the best known restriction on amendmentsthe germaneness requirementis embodied in the house rules themselves like most other house procedures members generally mu st enforce these principles and prohibitions and thereby protect their own rights and interests by making appropriate points of order the procedures for doing so are discussed in later section of this report g11g151g561g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561 the houses published precedents are the source for many of the principles and restrictions affecting the amending process for example the prohibition against third degree amendments is one of the most basic limitations on the amendments that members may offer but it is not stated explicitly in the standing rules 12 precedents govern the amending process in several other important respects g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 standing committees do not actually amend measures during their markups instead committee votes on what amendments it wishes to recommend to the house these amendments then have the status of committee amendments if the committee reports measure with one or more amendments they receive priority consideration on the floor and they are considered automatically 13 the house considers each of them at the appropriate time it is not necessary for committee member to offer them from the floor when and how the committee amendments are considered depends on the set of procedures under which the bill or resolution itself is being considered under several possible procedures for considering amendments to measure it is open to amendment at any pointthat is amendments can be offered to any part of the bill in any order in such case the speaker directs the clerk to read the first committee amendment as soon as the bill is considered for amendment after the house votes on this amendment it considers any additional committee amendments in turn members may be able to offer their own amendments to each committee amendment but they generally may not propose amendments to the text of the bill itself until the house has completed action on the committee amendments the amending process under these procedures usually is routine typically more than one committee amendment is to be considered on the other hand the particularly important procedures governing the amending process in committee of the whole usually are governed by the principle that measure is to be read for amendmentthat is only one paragraph section or title of the measure is open to amendment 12 in section xxxiii of his manual of parliamentary practice thomas jefferson held third degree amendments to be out of order and house rule xviii states in part that the rules of parliamentary practice comprised by jeffersons manual shall govern the house in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the rules and orders of the house 13 for discussion of precedents concerning committee amendments see house practice ch 2 sec 29 pp 4445 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98995g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561

any committee amendments to each part of the bill as soon as it is read again representatives may propose amendments to each committee amendment but the members must dispose of the committee amendments to each part of the measure before they can offer other amendments to that part of it an exception to this principle arises whenever the committee amendment takes the form of motion to strike out some language or provision of the bill while such committee amendment is pending member may offer an amendment to change the part of the bill that the committee proposes to strike out altogether this possibility is considered in more detail during the discussion of the amendment tree also the committees recommendations for changes in bill or resolution often are embodied in single amendment in the nature of substitute as already noted the special rules for considering measures often make special arrangements for members to consider committee substitute in committee of the whole by designating it as proposal that members may amend in two degrees because of this widespread practice it is increasingly rare to see multiple committee amendments considered on the house floor in this way g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g18g155g146g151g140g146g153g149g142g156g561 several other general principles govern the amending process first clause 2 of rule xvi requires that the clerk is to read each amendment when it is offered and before debate on it begins whether it is committee amendment or one proposed by an individual member14 the sponsor or principal proponent of the amendment very often asks unanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read and there usually is objection unless an interested member is not familiar with it and wants time to examine the amendment before it is debated in addition member may move to dispense with the reading under circumstances discussed in later section but only if members already have access to printed copy of the amendment second an amendment should not affect the measure in more than one place this principle protects the house against having to cast one vote on two or more propositions that may be unrelated thus an amendment to replace the text of section 201 and add new sentence at the end of section 203 is subject to point of order if the bill is being read by sections instead the sponsor of the amendment could offer each part of it as separate amendment or the sponsor could ask unanimous consent that the two amendments be considered blocthat is as if they were one amendment 15 there often is objection to such request if both amendments are necessary to achieve single purpose alternatively if the title containing sections 201 and 203 has been read for amendment or if the bill is open to amendment at any point the sponsor could avoid point of order by drafting single amendment to strike out sections 201203 and replace them with the preferred provisions 16 third any member may demand as matter of right the division of an amendment proposing to insert additional provisions into or strike provisions from measure or firstdegree amendment but only if the amendment to be divided or the matter to be stricken consists of two or more 14 house practice ch 2 sec 27 p 41 15 house practice ch 2 sec 30 p 45 16 if so the text of section 202 proposed in the amendment would be identical to the text of section 202 already in the bill httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98995g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561

propositions when an amendment is divided the house considers each division of the amendment in turn as if each were separate amendment this right which also protects the house against having to cast single vote on two or more separable proposals is conveyed by clause 5 of rule xvi however the same rule states in part that motion to strike out and insert is not divisible it is important to keep in mind that special rules can limit the divisibility of amendments fourth the same amendment may not be offered more than once17 if the house has considered and rejected an amendment it may not be offered again unless it has been changed substantively otherwise the house could not be sure of its ability to dispose of questions conclusively however part of rejected amendment may be offered as separate amendment and the entire text of the rejected amendment may be included as part of larger amendment in addition it is sometimes possible to offer two amendments that are substantively identical for example member may propose to add new title to the text of bill and also move to insert the same new title into the text of an amendment in the nature of substitute for the bill these amendments are different procedurally because each seeks to amend different text fifth it is not in order for representative to offer an amendment that proposes only to amend language that already has been amended 18 if not for this principle the house would have difficulty resolving questions once and for all thus if dollar number in an appropriations bill has been amended another amendment that would only change the same number again is subject to point of order or if the house agrees to substitute for section or title of bill further amendments only to that section or title are in order because it has been fully amended 19 any further amendment to it would constitute prohibited attempt to reamend an important implication of this principle is that adoption of an amendment in the nature of substitute precludes all further amendments to the measure this complete substitute replaces the entire text of the bill or resolution so any new amendment would propose to reamend something that already has been fully amended an exception to the prohibition against reamendment is what is sometimes called the principle of the bigger bite representatives may seek to amend something already amended if they do so as part of an amendment to change larger part of the text 20 for example member may reamend dollar figure in an appropriations bill by offering substitute for the paragraph containing that number so long as the amendment also makes some other substantive change in the paragraph similarly after the house has agreed to substitute for section of bill member may propose substitute for the title containing that section and thereby reamend the section in the process of amending other sections of the same title each of these amendments takes bigger bite out of the text than the amendment the house already has considered and adopted g22g145g142g561g9g142g155g150g138g151g142g151g142g156g156g561g20g158g149g142g561 clause 7 of rule xvi states in part that motion or

simple and straightforward in principle but complex and sometimes difficult to apply in practice indeed determining whether an amendment is germane can be the most challenging and even perplexing task in interpreting the houses legislative procedures the fourline rule is accompanied by 28 pages of commentary and explanation in the house rules and manual for the 109th congress and discussions of precedents on this subject consume all the 1957 pages of volumes 10 and 11 of deschler s precedents of the house of representatives 21 the principle underlying the germaneness rule is that the house should consider one subject at time while debating authorizations for military weapons systems for example the house should not be distracted by amendments concerning food safety mass transit or other unrelated subjects the object of the rule is not simply orderliness if not for the germaneness requirement members could offer amendments on any subject of their choice thereby bypassing the standing committee system and depriving the house of the committees expert appraisals recommendations and reports furthermore members could be compelled to vote on unanticipated questions without adequate time for preparation in sum the germaneness rule is designed to encourage systematic and thoughtful legislative decisions germaneness is requirement that applies to all amendments originating in the house whether proposed by individual representatives or recommended by house committees because the rule prohibits amendments on new subject it does not apply to the provisions of measures themselves anything contained in bill or resolution is immune to challenge on grounds of germaneness also members generally may not make points of order against nongermane senate amendments until the house has reached the stage of disagreement with the senate over measureand usually when the house begins to consider conference report 22 in determining whether an amendment proposed on the house floor is germane the chair normally is concerned with the relationship between the amendment and the text it proposes to amend in general seconddegree perfecting amendment or substitute for an amendment must be germane to the amendment it would affect so it may be ruled nongermane even though it could be germane to the underlying text of the bill and firstdegree amendment to section or title of bill must be germane to that section or title the chair may rule it nongermane even though it might be germane to some other portion of the bill 23 on the other hand an amendment proposing to add new section or title at the end of measure may be subjected to broader test whether it is germane to the text of the measure as whole also an amendment must be germane to the text it would amend as that text reads at the time the amendment is proposed thus it is not sufficient that an amendment be germane to the bill as originally introduced or to the firstdegree amendment as originally proposed instead the amendment must be germane to the bill or amendment as it already may have been amended by its votes on amendments offered earlier during its consideration the house may have 21 for more digestable selection of recent precedents on germaneness see house practice ch 26 pp 525585 22 the standing rules of the senate do not require floor amendments to be germane except when proposed to general appropriations measures when rule making statute requires it and after cloture has been invoked on the other hand the senate sometimes imposes germaneness requirement on itself by unanimous consent during consideration of individual measures house procedures for dealing with nongermane senate amendments appear in clauses 9 and 10 of rule xxii see also sources of additional information and

germaneness of other amendments that members then propose this situation adds to the difficulty of anticipating evaluating and protecting against germaneness challenges the parliamentarian and his associates can offer representative expert advice on the germaneness of prospective amendment but by the time the representative actually offers the amendment on the floor the house may have amended the bill or amendment in ways that change the relationship on which the germaneness ruling is basedthe relationship between the proposed amendment and the text it proposes to amend the concept of germaneness is akin to that of relevance or pertinence but more restrictive the mere fact that the house is considering tax bill for instance does not necessarily mean that any amendment affecting federal taxes is germane instead case by case the house has gradually developed an extensive body of precedents to assist and guide the chair in ruling on points of order that particular amendments are not germane other question of order arises so often and other rulings can be as difficult for members and staff to predict the precedents on germaneness are voluminous and often based on fine distinctions distinctions that the chair explains in making rulings but that are not always obvious from the concise way in which the rulings have been summarized in print thus although new rulings are always based on earlier ones it is often possible to develop from the precedents plausible arguments both for and against the same point of order on germaneness however while germaneness decisions may appear to be contradictory if only the published headnotes are studied there is more apparent consistency if the factual situations are carefully reviewed to help members and staff understand how the germaneness rule has been interpreted and applied the parliamentarians commentary in the house rules and manual identifies three tests of germaneness subject matter fundamental purpose and committee jurisdiction first to be germane an amendment must rela to the subject matter under consideration for example to bill seeking to eliminate wage discrimination based on the sex of the employee an amendment to make the provisions of the bill applicable to discrimination based on race was ruled to be nongermane in this case the chair evidently held that the subject matter of the bill was not wage discrimination in general but sex discrimination in particular 24 thus the amendment to extend the coverage of the bill to race discrimination proposed to raise different subject and therefore was nongermane second the fundamental purpose of an amendment must be germane to the fundamental purpose of the bill more specifically an amendment must not only have the same end as the matter sought to be amended but must contemplate method of achieving that end that is closely allied to the method encompassed in the bill or other matter sought to be amended among amendments that have met this test the parliamentarian cites the following example to proposition to accomplish result through regulation by governmental agency an amendment to accomplish the same fundamental purpose through regulation by another governmental agency was held germane on the other hand to bill to aid in the control of crime through research and training an amendment to accomplish that result through regulation of the sale of 24 the remaining quotations in this section are taken from the annotations to rule xvi clause 7 in the house rules and manual for the 109th congress

action proposed by the amendment was closely allied to that of the bill in the second case it was not third an amendment when considered as whole should be within the jurisdiction of the committee reporting the bill this test is most likely to be applied when the jurisdictional issues are clear cutwhen the pending text is entirely within one committees jurisdiction and the amendment offered to that text falls entirely w ithin another committees jurisdiction for instance to bill reported by the committee on government operations now government reform25 creating an executive agency to protect consumers an amendment conferring on congressional committees with oversight over consumer protecti on the authority to intervene in judicial and administrative proceedings rulemaking provision within the jurisdiction of the committee on rules was ruled not germane but committee jurisdiction is not the sole or exclusive test of germaneness especially in cases in which the proposition to which the amendment is offered is so comprehensive overlapping several committees jurisdictions as to diminish the pertinency of that test or the amendment does not demonstrably affect law within another committees jurisdiction or where the portion of the bill also contains language related to the amendment not within the jurisdiction of the committee reporting the bill as this last statement suggests one of these three tests is always conclusive nor is one of them necessarily more controlling than the others an amendment may satisfy one test but not one or both of the others so the chair must look to the particular case in deciding how much weight to give to each of them moreover even when these three tests are taken together they do not constitute complete standard of germaneness an amendment and the matter to which offered may be related to some degree under the tests of subject matter purpose and jurisdiction and still not be considered germane under the precedents to help understand this conclusion the parliamentarians commentary on the rule elaborates other principles of germaneness of which three are particularly explicit the essence of these three principles turns on the relationship between the scope of the amendment and the scope of the matter to be amended first one individual proposition may not be amended by another individual proposition even though the two belong to the same class for example to bill proposing the admission of one territory into the union an amendment for admission of another territory was not germane similarly to proposition to appropriate or to authorize appropriations for only one year and containing provisions extending beyond that year an amendment to extend the authorization or appropriation to another year was not germane the first bill applied to only one territory the second concerned only one fiscal year extending either bill to another item in the same classa second territory or second fiscal yearviolated the prohibition against amending one individual proposition with another even though the amendments may have met one or more of the three tests discussed above second specific subject may not be amended by provision general in nature even when of the class of the specific subject under this principle which applies to amendments that would expand the general applicability of measures that are limited in scope the following illustrate the kinds of amendments that would not be germane to bill relating to all corporations engaged in interstate commerce an amendment relating to l corporations to bill proscribing certain 25 in the 110th congress this committee was renamed the committee on government oversight and reform

provisions thereof applicable throughout the united states and to bill authorizing funds for radio broadcasting to cuba an amendment broadening the bill to include broadcasting to all dictatorships in the caribbean basin these two principles limit the amendments that satisfy the germaneness rule the third related principle on the other hand provides basis for holding amendments germane general subject may be amended by specific propositions of the same class thus the following have been held to be germane to bill admitting several territories into the union an amendment adding another territory to bill providing for the construction of buildings in each of two cities an amendment providing for similar buildings in several other cities and to an amendment prohibiting indirect assistance to several countries an amendment to include additional countries within that prohibition generally if bill already deals with several items in class amendments to add additional items in the same class may be germane under this principle germaneness rulings may be based on combination of two or more of these tests and principles or perhaps others because individual amendm ents may differ in so many respects the application of these tests and the relationships among them cannot be reduced to formula or obviously predictable standard furthermore the illustrative examples quoted above are clear and simple ones they do not fully reflect the difficulties and subtleties that can arise in applying these six tests and principles bill may amend so many provisions of an existing law

legislative process however this phrase refers to one of the four modes of consideration by which the house may act on public bill or resolution bill considered in the house is not debated and amended in the same way as it would be if considered in committee of the whole or under suspension of the rules for example for reasons that will become evident only few kinds of bills and resolutionsmost notably the special rules reported by the rules committee to affect the order of businessusually are considered in the house one of the most important reasons is the difficulty members have in proposing amendments under this set of procedures the essential rule governing debate on the house floor is the hour rule the provision of clause 2 of rule xvii which states that member delegate or resident commissioner may not occupy more than one hour in debate on question in the house representative who has been recognized to speak may not hold the floor for more than an hour under normal house rules without the unanimous consent of all colleagues who are present equally important under this rule each member may speak for an hour on each debatable question and bill or resolution and each amendment to it are different debatable questions as are variety of motions that members may make representative can offer an amendment only when the speaker has

member who controls the floor has yielded to him for that purpose26 measure considered in the house under the hour rule is open to amendment at any point if member controls the floor and chooses to offer an amendment that amendment may propose to affect any part of the bill and if another member were to offer second amendment at later time that amendment also could address any part of the bill that has not already been amended for instance if the first amendment changes section 3 of the measure second amendment could propose to change section 1 in other words the order in which members offer amendments in the house generally is not determined by where or how the amendments would affect the measure most measures that the house considers under the hour rule are privileged clause 5 of rule xiii grants certain comm ittees leave to report measures on certain subjects or for certain purposes at any time this authority includes general appropriations bills reported by the appropriations committee budget resolutions and reconciliation measures reported by the budget committee committee funding resolu tions reported by the committee on house administration and amendments to house rules reported by the rules committee other measures are privileged under other rulesfor instance resolutions approved by the republican conference or democratic caucus to appoint members to house committees are privileged under clause 5a1 of rule x there are two differences between the treatment of privileged measures and the treatment of other bills and resolutions first committee chair filing report on measure normally does so without comment by merely submitting the report to the appropriate clerk on the floor while the house is in session in the case of reports on privileged measures however the chair announces his action and files the report from the floor and the speaker refers it to the appropriate calendar more important when committee reports nonprivileged bill or resolution it is referred to either the union or the house calendar where it remains until it can be made in order for floor consideration 27 on the other hand once privileged measure has been reported and placed on one of the same two calendars and one or threeday layover requirement has been met28 the committee or subcommittee chair may call it up for consideration at any time that another matter is not already pending29 when the speaker recognizes chair or another member to call up privileged measure at the direction of her committee the chair is recognized to control the first hour of debate the chair is certain to yield to other members to participate in debate during this hour but only the chair may offer an amendment or make any other motion during the hour she controls unless she chooses to yield to another member to do so 30 at the end of the first hour another representative usually 26 house practice ch 16 sec 16 p 390 27 on the various calendars see house

recognized to control the second hour of debate and if so this member becomes the only one with the right to offer an amendment or make another motion during that hour and so the process could continue each member can debate the measure for an hour and the member controlling each hour of debate determines whether an amendment is offered if an amendment is proposedwhether it be an amendment in the nature of substitute for the measure or perfecting amendment to any part of iteach representative then may debate the amendment for an hour 31 thus in theory there could be hundreds of hours of debate on the measure itself and an equally lengthy debate on each amendment to it in practice however when the house considers bill or resolution in the houseand therefore under the hour rulethe house almost always votes on passing it without considering any amendments except committee amendments and after more than total of one hour of debate the device for limiting the debate and precluding all floor amendments is the motion to order the previous question representative who has been recognized to control the floor for an hour can make this nondebatable motion which immediately stops debate on the measure the house is considering if majority of members vote to order the previous question the house then proceeds to vote on pending amendments and on final passage of the measure without further debate and without considering any further amendments 32 in practice the committee or subcommittee chair rarely proposes an amendment during the first hour of debate which she controls and is even less likely to yield to another member to do so as the majority floor manager the chair typically supports the measure as it was reported by committee but she always moves the previous question before or when her hour expires and the house normally votes for this motion33 thus representative wishing to offer an amendment must obtain part of the first hour of debate and convince the house to vote against ordering the previous question when that motion is made only if the previous question is not ordered is second memberalmost always minority party memberrecognized for an hour during which he may propose an amendment if the previous question is not ordered or in the very unlikely event it is not even moved and second hour of debate begins the member controlling it then may propose an amendment and debate on that amendment proceeds under the hour rule34 but the representative offering the amendment is almost certain to move the previous question on both the measure and the amendment thereto before or at the end of the h our she controls and if the house votes for this motion it then votes without further debate on the amendment and finally on the measure as it may have been amended continued purposes of debate only if the committee has reported an amendment to the measure it is automatically presented to the house for consideration when the measure is called up 31 the sponsor of the amendment may withdraw it at any time as matter of right before the house amends it orders the previous question on it or votes on it 32 after the house orders the previous question but before it votes on final passage one member usually has an opportunity to move to refer or recommit the measure to committee with or without instructions the motion to recommit does not apply to special rules house practice ch 48 sec 9 p 808 33 in practice measures considered under the hour rule such as special rules from the rules committee often tend to divide the house along party lines so majority usually supports ordering the previous question measures that many representatives wish to amend are unlikely to be considered in this way 34 house practice ch 16 sec 16 p 390

permit one hour of debate per member on each measure considered in the house and another hour of debate per member on each amendment to the measure instead because the previous question is routinely moved and normally ordered there is only one hour of debate in total on the bill and floor amendments may be offered unless the floor manager yields for this purpose the house must vote against ordering the previous question before there can be second hour of debate when the member controlling that second hour can propose an amendment and then the house is virtually certain to order the previous question on both the bill and the amendment during the second hour precluding still more debate and still other amendments in short the procedures governing consideration of measures in the house under the hour rule are not well suitedin theory or in practicefor permitting many members to participate in debate and offer their amendments it is largely because of this problem that the house considers most major bills instead in committee of the whole

state of the union is committee on which all representatives serve and which meets on the house floor the house resolves itself into committee of the whole to consider particular measure and amendments to it then it transforms itself back into the house and the house proceeds to vote on whatever amendments the committee of the whole has recommended followed by vote on final passage of the bill or resolution itself the house uses the device of the committee of the whole largely because it provides set of parliamentary procedures for debating measures and for offering and debating amendments that are more flexible and accommodating than those that govern the other modes of consideration because of these advantages the house first considers most major bills and resolutions in committee of the whole before voting on them in the house clause 3 of rule xviii requires that certain kinds of measures be considered in this way these are essentially the authorization appropriations and tax measures that are placed on the union calendar after being reported from committee in addition most measures members consider important or controversial are called up on the floor only after the house first agrees to resolution or special rule reported by the rules committee that makes the measure in order for consideration and provides for debating and amending it in committee of the whole 35 considering bill in committee of the whole involves fourstage process first the house resolves itself into committee of the whole for the sole purpose of considering the bill second there is period of general debate third the bill is considered for amendment the committee of the whole votes on whatever amendments are proposed and then it rises and reports the bill back to the house with the amendments the committee has adopted fourth the house votes on these amendments and shortly thereafter votes on passing the bill the following discussion concentrates on the latter two stages during which members consider and vote on amendments there are two ways in which the house resolves itself into committee of the whole to consider measure special rule typically authorizes

purpose at any time after the house adopts the resolution on the other hand the special rule governing consideration of general appropriations bill technically need not include such provision although such language is typically included under current practices instead the chair of the reporting committee may make nondebatable motion that the house resolve into committee of the whole to consider measure his committee has reported in either case the speaker designates another majority party member to serve as chair of the committee of the whole during its consideration of that measure 36 the chair then directs the clerk to report the bill by title before general debate begins37 g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g6g142g139g138g157g142g561 the special rule governing consideration of the measure normally specifies the length of general debate typically it is one hour though there may be more time provided for debating bills members view as particularly important or controversial in rare instances the amount of time is controlled by unanimous consent agreement such as in the case of the house resolving into committee of the whole under privileged motion or it may be governed by provision of rulemaking statute for example in the case of budget resolution or reconciliation measure control of the time usually is divided equally between the chair and ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction each of whom yields part of her time to other members during the course of the debate when bill had been referred to two or more committees there often is longer period for general debate with part of it controlled by each committee chair and ranking member in unusual circumstances special rule also may allocate control of some general debate time to other individually named members who oppose the committees position in an important respect 38 the committee of the whole does not consider and act on any amendments during general debate this period is reserved for discussions of the state of existing law the conditions stimulating new legislation the provisions of the measure and the advisability of enacting it members may debate the merits of committee amendments and the amendments individual representatives intend to propose but the amendments are not formally proposed or considered during this time at the conclusion of general debate the committee of the whole may vote to rise which temporarily concludes its business and transforms the committee back into the house then the house may resolve back into committee of the whole at some later hour or date to resume consideration of the measure altern atively the committee may move directly from general debate to the third stage of consideration during which the amending process takes place during this third stage the committee of the whole considers and votes on amendments to the measure and on any amendments to those amendments the committee never votes directly on any section or title of the measure itself or on the measure as whole this amending process is somewhat akin to the markup of bill that has been reported by one committee and then referred sequentially to another after standing committee reports the bill it is referred sequentially to this unique committee on which all members serve the committee of the whole debates and votes on all the amendments recommended by the standing committee and then on whatever additional amendments individual members offer but neither standing committee nor the 36 clause 2 of rule xviii 37 the bill is to be read at this point but this reading is routinely waived by the terms of the special rule or by unanimous consent 38 house practice ch 16 sec 14 p 386387

bill that is the exclusive power of the house both committees only recomme nd amendments for the house to consider the text that members can attempt to amend may be the text of the bill as it was introduced however the special rule for considering it freque ntly provides instead for floor amendments to be directed to an amendment in the nature of substitute that is to be considered an original bill for the purpose of amendment typically this is committee substitute though it may be an amendment in the nature of substitute printed in the rules committees report on the rule or in the congressional record or it may even be the text of another measure on the same subject whatever form it may take an amendment in the nature of substitute considered in this way almost always reflects the position of the committee or committees of jurisdiction or at least their leading majority party members

considered in committee of the whole is to be read for amendment members may propose amendments only to the part of the bill that the clerk has read and they may longer offer amendments to it except by unanimous consent after the clerk has read the next part39 the typical procedure is for bill or resolution to be read for amendment section by section or paragraph by paragraph in the case of general appropriations bill when special rule states that measure shall be read for amendment under the fiveminute rule it is to be read by sections alternatively the special rule may specify that the measure is to be read by titles and especially when special rule prohibits most or all floor amendments it may state that each section shall be considered as having been read or that the entire measure shall be considered as having been read for amendment there would be point in the clerk reading each section or title in turn if members may not offer amendments to it after it is read these alternatives affect what kinds of amendments members can propose and when if measure is being read or considered for amendment by sections representatives may offer amendments only to each section when the clerk has read or designated it it is longer in order to propose an amendment to section that had been read previously and it is premature to offer an amendment to section not yet reached unless the members agree by unanimous consent to consider such an amendment thus after the clerk reads or designates section 4 only amendments to section 4 are in order it is now too late to offer an amendment to section 3 and it is not yet appropriate to amend section 5 furthermore an amendment affecting sections 4 and 5 would not be in order because the bill is being considered for amendment one section at time 40 an important exception to this rule is that of fest amendments to appropriations measures may look forward41 thus members must pay careful attention to the pace of the amending process in committee of the whole in order to protect their right to propose amendments by being on the floor and by seeking recognition at the appropriate time the same procedures govern measure being considered for amendment by titles amendments are in order only to the title that the clerk has 39 house practice ch 12 sec 13 pp 312313 40 house practice ch 2 sec 17 p 33 41 for more

gives members somewhat more latitude because they can offer amendments that span more than one section of the title or that propose to strike or replace the entire title thus when bill is divided into titles which in turn are subdivided into sections special rule frequently provides for it to be considered for amendment title by title the one exception to these procedures concerns amendments in the nature of substitutes member can offer this kind of amendment after the clerk reads or designates the first section of the measure even though the amendment also would affect all its other sections or titles but once this opportunity passes an amendment in the nature of substitute is not in order again until the committee has acted on all amendments to the last section or title of the bill on the other hand when measure is open to amendment at any point members may propose amendments to any part of it in any order so long as the amendments meet the other requirements of house rules and precedents and are not prohibited by the special rule the committee of the whole sometimes expedites co nsideration of amendments by adjusting the process of reading for amendment if bill containing several titles is being read section by section the majority floor manager may ask unanimous consent that title be considered as read and open to amendment at any point 42 or the manager may extend this request to cover several titles or even the entire measure the manager is most likely to make such request when few amendments are anticipated and useful purpose is served by having the clerk read each section or title individually g17g143g143g142g155g146g151g144g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 after the clerk reads or designates the first section the chair directs the clerk to read the first of any committee amendments to it the majority floor manager typically asks unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with the committee of the whole debates and votes on this amendment and any floor amendments to it after which the clerk reads and the committee acts in turn on any other committee amendments to that section individual members then may propose their own amendments to the section43 after the committee debates and votes on all of them the clerk reads or designates the next section and the process is repeated when bill is being considered by titles comparable process occurs as the committee first considers and acts on each committee amendment and amendments to it to title before individual representatives amendments to the title are in order when bill is open to amendment at any point on the other hand the committee first considers and acts on all the committee amendments in the order in which they would affect the measure before members propose their own amendments to the measure beginning in the late 1990s special rules began to include provisions under which the committee did not always vote on one firstdegree amendment before considering the next one these provisions were subsequently incorporated into the houses standing rules and now are routinely utilized clause 6g of rule xviii now provides that the chairman may postpone request for recorded vote on any amendment the chairman may resume proceedings on postponed request at any time the chairman may 42 house practice ch 2 sec 18 pp 3334 43 house practice ch 2

on any postponed question that follows another electronic vote without intervening business provided that the minimum time for electronic voting on the first in any series of questions shall be 15 minutes in most cases there are not very many committee amendments to measure if the committee wishes to amend measure extensively it may report the bill or resolution with long series of amendments however in current practice it is far more likely to recommend an amendment in the nature of substitute by which the committee incorporates all its proposed changes to the measure in single amendment although it is used far less frequently committee may also propose clean measure carrying different bill or resolution number that addresses the same subject in the way the committee prefers when the committee of the whole has disposed of all committee amendments to the section or title being considered or to the entire bill if it is open to amendment at any point the chair looks to the majority and minority tables on the floor for members seeking recognition to offer amendments of their own it is the responsibility of member wishing to offer an amendment to seek recognition for that purpose44 if two or more members are seeking recognition the chair has the discretionary authority to recognize one or the other however the chair is guided in decisions regarding recognition by practices that are very wellestablished if not actually binding as precedent the chair almost always gives preference in recognition to members of the committee and subcommittee that reported the measure in approximate order of seniority alternating between democrats and republicans thus the majority floor manager is recognized in preference to anyone else followed by the minority floor manager if neither of the managers seeks recognition the chair tends to recognize senior committee member before more junior member and any committee member before another representative the chair also attempts to give members of both parties roughly equal opportunity to propose amendments these practices promote fairness and also focus the attention of the committee of the whole first on amendments sponsored by members who are presumed by virtue of their committee membership to have an expert knowledge of the subject every amendment offered must be in writing in addition clause 5b of rule xviii states when member delegate or resident commissioner offers an amendment in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union the clerk shall promptly transmit five copies of the amendment to the majority committee table and five copies to the minority committee table the clerk also shall deliver at least one copy of the amendment to the majority cloak room and at least one copy to the minority cloak room although this rule places the responsibility on the clerk it is generally accepted practice for members to bring multiple copies of amendments with them to the floor or to arrange for copies to be made of amendments they or their staff prepare on the floor during debate this permits the sponsor of an amendment to distribute copies of it to colleagues who want to examine it in most cases representatives find it advisable to alert the majority and minority floor managers of the measure and other interested members of the amendments they plan to offer this is not done only as matter of courtesy floor managers who support the bill often are inclined to oppose 44 in order to obtain recognition to offer an amendment member must not only be standing but must also actively seek recognition by addressing the chair at the appropriate time house practice ch 2 sec20 pp 3536

if the floor managers have copies of an amendment in advance they may decide to support it or at least discuss possible changes that would make it acceptable to them clause 8 of rule xviii also provide for members to submit their amendments in advance for printing in the congressional record under clause 8c material submitted for printing in the congressional record under this rule shall indicate the full text of the proposed amendment the name of the member delegate or resident commissioner proposing it the number of the bill or resolution to which it will be offered and the point in the bill or resolution or amendment thereto where the amendment is intended to be offered the amendment shall appear in portion of the record designated for that purpose amendments to specified measure submitted for printing in that portion of the record shall be numbered in the order printed and clause 7 permits nondebatable motion to dispense with the normal requirement that an amendment be read before it is debated but only if the amendment has been printed in the record in this way or printed in measure as reported from committee it shall be in order in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union to move that the committee of the whole dispense with the reading of an amendment that has been printed in the bill or resolution as reported from committee or an amendment that member delegate or resident commissioner has caused to be printed in the congressional record such motion shall be decided without debate the houses standing rules do not accord any special priority for consideration on the floor to an amendment that has been printed in the record the rules do not require for example that member with printed amendment be recognized to offer it before another representative whose amendment is merely handwritten however members who submit their amendments for printing in the record do gain some assurance of time for debate when they actually propose the amendments in committee of the whole also it is not uncommon for special rules to authorize the chair to afford priority in recognition for offering amendments in committee of the whole to members who did submit them in advance for printing special rules for considering some measuresoften complicated or technical measures such as tax billssometimes permit consideration of only those amendments that have been printed in the record by date certain or at least before the measure is called up on the floor this requirement gives committee members and others an opportunity to study the amendments in advance and evaluate their effect and merit more generally the rules committee may ask members to submit to it copies of the floor amendments they want to offer to bill it is virtually certain that amendments not submitted in response to such request will not to be made in order under the special rule for that bill

debate shall be allowed in favor of and against any amendment that may be offered to an amendment an amendment or an amendment to an amendment may be withdrawn by its proponent only by the unanimous consent of the committee of the whole the five minutes for opposing firstdegree amendment often are claimed by one of the floor managers who supports the measure in its present form in turn the sponsor of firstdegree amendment often seeks recognition for the five minutes to speak against an amendment to her amendment time may not be yielded or reserved this rule clearly states that there shall be only 10 minutes for debating each amendment yet debate on an amendment often continues for much longer sometimes for hours at time the explanation for this apparent contradiction lies in the use of pro forma amendments representative offers pro forma amendment when he or she moves to strike the last word in theory this motion is an amendment that proposes to strike out the last word of whatever the committee of the whole is then consideringa measure or portion of it firstdegree amendment or an amendment to an amendment in practice however the committee recognizes pro forma amendments to be only wellaccepted device by which members secure time for debate after two representatives have consumed the 10 minutes provided by rule xviii for debating an amendment any other member whom the chair recognizes can obtain five minutes to speak simply by moving to strike the last word member also can move to strike the last word when amendment is pending if the member wishes to discuss the measure itself technically the next member wishing to speak for five minutes should move to strike the last two words because the same amendment cannot be proposed more than once this leads some members to move to strike the requisite number of words in order to make certain that they are not offering an amendment for the second time however the committee recognizes that there is point in prohibiting members from offering the same pro forma amendment more than once because these amendments are not substantive thus many representatives often move to strike the last word because pro forma amendment is not actually written out but is only device to get time for debate member claims five minutes to speak against it and the committee does not vote on it when member who has made such motion has used her five minutes or has yielded back the balance of her time the amendment is deemed to have been automatically withdrawn by unanimous consent the time for debating any amendment whether substantive or pro forma may be extended by unanimous consent when offering an amendment for example member may expect that five minutes will not be sufficient to explain it so even before beginning the statement the member may ask unanimous consent that an additional fi ve minutes or more be granted alternatively when the chair informs the member that the five minutes have expired the member then may ask unanimous consent to proceed for an additional minute or more the one who has the floor may yield to others who want to speak and in turn representative to whom the member has yielded may ask unanimous consent that the member be granted additional time so they may continue

unanimous consent requests although they have the right to do so at any time after the sponsor of an amendment has consumed or yielded back the balance of his five minutes for debate other members may seek recognition either to propose substantive amendment that is in order or to offer pro forma amendment even instead of seeking recognition for the five minutes provided by rule xviii to speak against the amendment however representative who has been recognized for one of these purposes may not use it for another thus member who has been recognized to speak against the amendment under rule xviii or who has moved to strike the last word may not offer substantive amendment during that fiveminute period in committee of the whole the chair must recognize representative before he or she can propose an amendment or control five minutes for debate the chairs exercise of the power of recognition is not subject to challenge or appeal but normally the same priorities are followed in recognizing members to move to strike the last wo rd as in recognizing them to offer substantive amendments committee members are recognized before others and the chair usually recognizes them in an order consistent with their committee or subcommittee seniority the chair also makes an effort to assure that members of both parties have roughly the same opportunities to offer amendments and to speak but it is each members responsibility to seek recognition at the appropriate time the chair cannot protect members rights unless he knows that they wish to exercise them pro forma amendments permit each representative to speak for five minutes on each portion of the measure as it is considered for amendment and on each amendment that members propose if every member took advantage of this opportunity there could be more than 36 hours of debate per amendment which would make it impossible fo r the house to conduct its legislative business in timely way 46 however the rules and practices of the house protect against this possibility through device for bringing debate under the fiveminute rule to an end this device can effectively prevent minority from filibustering in committee of the whole by debating amendments at great length by unanimous consent or by motion the committee may decide to close the debate on 1 an amendment 2 an amendment and all amendments thereto or 3 the measure or portion of it and all amendments thereto in the last case however the committee can close debate only on whatever part of the measure has been read or designated for amendment if bill is being considered by sections or titles the committee can end debate only on each section or title as it is considered 47 but if the measure is open to amendment at any point the committee may close debate on it as whole as well as on any amendments that are pending at the time and all other amendments that members intend to offer 45 during general debate in committee of the whole and during debate in the house under the hour rule member controlling time may yield specific number of minutes to colleague or he may yield such time as the other member may consume during debate under the fiveminute rule however the member controlling the floor may yield but not for specified period of time however member who has been recognized for five minutes and then yields to another may reclaim his time whenever he chooses for more information see crs report rl32200 debate motions and other actions in the committee of the whole by bill heniff jr and elizabeth rybicki 46 pro forma amendments are not

his five minutes for debate and at any time that another member does not control the floor the majority floor manager may ask unanimous consent that all debate on that amendment and any amendments to it be brought to an end he may request that the debate end immedi ately or at certain stated time or after the expiration of specified additional period of time while any representative may make such request it is unusual for anyone other than the majority floor manager to do so if another member objects or reserves the right to object that member and the floor manager may discuss whether the amendment and the issues it raises have been fully argued and they attempt to find mutually acceptable accommodation if the floor manager cannot obtain unanimous consent to his request he then may make nondebatable motion to close the debateimmediately at time certain or after specified period of time 48 the committee agrees or disagrees to the motion by simple majority vote again any member whom the chair recognizes may make such motion but this is prerogative normally exercised only by the majority floor manager if the committee agrees to unanimous consent request or votes for motion that leaves some time remaining for debate the chair may continue recognizing members for five minutes each but also has the authority to dispense with the fiveminute rule instead the chair may divide the remaining time between the control of two memb ers for example the sponsor of pending amendment and the majority floor manager and allow them to yield part of their time to others as they choose or the chair may divide the remaining time equally among the members who stand to indicate their desire to be recognized thus if the committee agrees to motion that permits 30 minutes more for debate and 15 members still want to be recognized the chair has at least three options to recognize each of the 15 members for two minutes each to recognize only six of the members for five minutes each or to recognize only two members to control 15 minutes each when all the time for debate has expired pursuant to motion or unanimous consent agreement members may continue to offer amendments that are otherwise in order but they have time to explain their amendments which obviously puts them and their amendments at significant disadvantage 49 anticipating this potential problem clause 8 of rule xviii offers members some protection by reserving five minutes for one of th em to explain and then five minutes for another to oppose any amendment that has been printed in advance in the congressional record if the committee of the whole house on the state of the union closes debate on any portion of bill or resolution before there has been debate on an amendment that member delegate or resident commissioner has caused to be printed in the congressional record at least one day before its consideration the member delegate or resident commissioner who caused the amendment to be printed in the record shall be allowed five minutes to explain it after which the member delegate or resident commissioner who shall first obtain the floor shall be allowed five minutes to speak in opposition to it there shall be further debate thereon this rule permits only this 10 minutes of debate on each amendment members cannot extend the debate through pro forma amendments furthermore this clause may be superseded by the special rule for considering bill if for example that resolution prohibits consideration of all but certain specified amendments 48 clause 8a of rule xviii 49 house

amendment secures time for debating it that otherwise would not be available by moving that the committee rise and report the measure back to the house with the recommendation that the enacting or resolving clause be stricken when representative makes this motion the chair recognizes him and another member to debate it for five minutes each after which the committee votes without further debate50 if the committee agrees to the motion and the house then concurs the bill is thereby rejected because striking the enacting clause removes from it the language required by law that would be necessary to give the bill statutory force51 however members rarely make this motion with any serious expectation that it will carry instead it is most often used as another device to obtain five minutes for debate the motion proposing that the enacting clause of bill be stricken is in order in comm ittee of the whole only once each legislative day unless the bill has been materially changed and it is in order only so long as there remains time for debating the measure itself if the committee has agreed to limit further debate on an amendment for example and all that time has expired member can still debate the amendment and the bill for five minutes by making this motion on the other hand the motion is longer in order once the committee has concluded debate on the bill and all amendments thereto g3g143g157g142g155g561g22g145g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561g20g146g156g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561 when the committee of the whole has acted on the last amendment to be proposed the committee rises and reports the bill or resolution back to the house with whatever amendments to the measure it has agreed to most special rules provide for the committee to rise and report automatically in case where the house resolved into committee of the whole by privileged motion the majority floor manager makes nondebatable motion that the committee rise and report 52 once the committee rises the speaker again presides over the house and the chair reports to her that the committee has had the bill under consideration and now reports it back to the house usually with an amendment or several sundry amendments the committee also recommends that the house agree to the amendment or amendments and then pass the bill as amended the committee of the whole only reports the amendments to the measure that it adopted it does not report any amendments that it rejected nor does it report any amendments to amendments thus if the committee perfects and then adopts firstdegree amendment it reports only the perfected firstdegree amendment and if the committee concludes the amending process by agreeing to an amendment in the nature of substitute as amended it reports only that amended substitute53 the house then must vote on the amendments recommended by the committee of the whole because as has been stated only the house itself actually has the authority to amend the bill more often than not the house agrees to all these amendments gros by one single voice vote if members wanted record vote on one or more of them they probably obtained it when 50 house practice ch 12 secs 2224 pp 320323 51 clause 9 of rule xviii 52 house practice ch 12 secs2530 pp 323327 53 annotations to section xii of jeffersons manual in house

member has right to demand separate vote in the house on any amendment the committee has recommended and this is very likely to be roll call vote54 the goal of requesting separate vote may be to reverse the result of the earlier vote in favor of the am endment if the committee agreed to an amendment by very narrow margin an opponent may believe that second subsequent roll call vote will produce the opposite result and defeat the amendment in some instances the request for separate vote or votes in the house has been undertaken as dilatory tactic when members demand one or more separate votes the house first agrees to the other amendments gros by voice vote and then acts on each of the amendments that require separate votes members normally may demand separate votes in the house only on the amendments proposed by the committee of the whole to the bill or resolution itself not on any amendments to those amendments that the committee may have adopted 55 but this right to vote second time on the committees proposals could be effectively nullified when the committee recommends an amendment in the nature of substitute in this situation the committee reports the bill back to the house with only that one amendment even though most or all of the other amendments on which the committee voted probably were amendments to the substitute there are separate amendments on which members could demand separate votes in the house for this reason when special rule anticipates or provides that the committee of the whole is to consider an amendment in the nature of substitute it also routinely permits members to demand separate votes in the house on amendments to the bill itself or to that substitute when the committee of the whole has reported bill or resolution and the house acts on the committees recommended amendments the measure and the amendments are considered under the set of procedures that govern consideration in the house especially the hour rule in theory therefore the amending process that took place in committee of the whole could be repeated under the hour rule each amendment the committee of the whole reported could be debated for one hour or more and perhaps even amended depending on when and if the house orders the previous question on the bill and all amendments to it then if the house failed to order the previous question after acting on all the committees amendments members could offer their own amendments each of which would be debatable for at least an hour but this would not only be repetitious it would effectively nullify the value of having already considered the bill and amendments to it in committee of the whole to avoid this situation special rules for considering measures typically provide that after the committee of the whole rises the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit the effect of the previous question is to preclude further debate and amendments thus ordering the previous question in advance requires the house to vote on each committee amendment without debate or amendment and precludes members from proposing additional amendments in addition this provision prevents consideration of any other motion except one motion to recommit discussed below consequently after the house votes on the committees amendmentsusually gros but with the possibility of one or more separate votes on individual amendmentsit votes on engrossment and third reading and the clerk then reads the

when discussing the houses consideration of amendments adopted by the committee of the whole it should be noted that in the 110 th congress procedure was incorporated in house rules providing for the automatic reconsideration of certain amendments adopted in the committee of the whole if the votes of the territorial delegates and the resident commission from puerto rico were deemed to have determined the outcome on the question of adopting the amendment under changes made to rule iii and rule xviii on january 24 200758 when the house is sitting in committee of the whole the delegates and resident commissioner have the same right to vote as representatives subject to immediate reconsideration in the house when their recorded votes have been decisive in the committee the rule governing voting in the committee of the whole by delegates and the resident commissioner has not been interpreted to mean that any recorded vote with difference of five votes or less is subject to automatic reconsideration in determining whether the votes of the delegates and the resident commissioner were decisive the chair follows but for test namely would the result of vote have been different if the delegates and the commissioner had not voted 59 if the votes of the delegates and resident commission on question are determined to be decisive by this standard the committee automatically rises and the speaker puts the question to vote the vote is first put by voice and any representative may with sufficient second obtain record vote once the final result of the vote is announced the committee of the whole automatically resumes its sitting 60 g22g145g142g561g15g152g157g146g152g151g561g22g152g561g20g142g140g152g150g150g146g157g561 under clause 6c of rule xiii not even

prevailing side in the overwhelming majority of cases the motion is made and routinely tabled thereby disposing of it adversely normally the speaker merely states that without objection motion to

might change their positions and reverse the outcome 58 hres 78 110th cong 59 under previous incarnation of this rule on may 19 1993 series of parliamentary inquiries were directed to the chair about

the motion takes one of two forms one is designed to reject the measure the other to amend it simple or straight motion to recommit only proposes to send the bill back to committee this motion is not debatable61 if majority of the house votes for it the measure is returned to committee while the committee has the option to rereport the legislation it rarely does so in practice adoption of simple motion to recommit has the effect of killing the bill in other words this motion offers members an indirect opportunity to defeat the bill and the opportunity arises immediately before they would vote directly on final passage for these reasons simple motions to recommit are not made frequently and rarely succeed the alternative is motion to recommit the bill to committee with instructions these instructions may take various forms for exam ple they may direct the committee to hold additional hearings on some issue relating to the bill before reporting it back to the house in most cases however the instructions direct the committee to report the bill back to the house immediately forthwith with one or more amendments stated in the motion clause 2 of rule xix provides for ten minutes of debate on motion to recommit with instructions but also permits the majority floor manager to demand that the debate be extended to an hour in either case the time for debate is divided between the representative making the motion and the majority floor manager or another member opposing it 62 motion to recommit with instructions usually constitutes one last attempt to amend the bill before the house votes on passing it the instructio ns typically direct the committee to report the bill back to the house forthwith with cert ain amendment when the house votes for such motion it is telling one of its committees exactly what it must do and it also is requiring the committee to act immediately under these circumstances there is point in the committee actually meeting to comply with the instructions because it has been given time or discretion instead the committee chair immediately rises on the floor and states that pursuant to the motion and on behalf of the committee the bill is reported back to the house with the amendment the house then votes on the amendment itself normally agreeing to it by voice vote because the amendment presents the same policy choice as the motion to recommit on which the house just voted finally the house votes on passage of the bill as it now has been amended by the motion to recommit with instructions although less common motion to recommit with instructions may instead direct committee to report back with an amendment or amendments promptly rather than forthwith such wording sends the bill to committee whose eventual report if any is not immediately before the house as it would be when the word forthwith is used in addition these instructions are considered advisory and are not required to be carried out by the committee 63 because of this some have characterized the use of the word promptly in motion to recommit with instructions as an attempt to kill not amend measure64 61 see commentary accompanying rule xix house manual sec 1002a 62 the instructions are amendable if the house votes against ordering the previous question on the motion 63 house practice ch 48 sec 17 pp 813814 64 see rep david r obey remarks in

order another can be proposed65 in addition two other important kinds of constraints on the recommittal motion affect who may make it and what instructions it may contain first in order to qualify to offer the motion representative must be opposed to the measure at least in its present form equally important this motion is the prerogative of the minority party the speaker recognizes any member of the minority to make it before recognizing any member of his own party the speaker gives preference in recognition to the minority leader or his designee to offer the motion and then to minority party representative who serves on the committee that reported the bill second when the instructions contain an amendm ent that amendment must comply with the principles and prohibitions that apply to amendments under other circumstances members may not propose as instructions anything that they could not have proposed directly as amendments for instance member may make point of order against motion to recommit with instructions if the instructions require the committee to report the bill back with an amendment that is not germane similarly recommittal motion may not propose instructions to amend part of the bill that the house already amended when it agreed to the amendments recommended by the committee of the whole once again special problem could arise when the committee reports bill or resolution back to the house with single amendment in the nature of substitute when the house agrees to this amendment it thereby amends every part and provision of the measure this common occurrence could preclude any recommittal motion with instructions containing an amendment because such motion would be subject to the point of order that it violates the prohibition against amending something that already has been amended with this potential problem in mind when special rule anticipates or provides that the committee of the whole is to consider an amendment in the nature of substitute it normally provides explicitly for motion to recommit with or without instructions this phrase as well as the provisions of rule xiii clause 6 permits the instructions to contain an amendment even if the effect of agreeing to the recommittal motion would be to reamend the text of the measure 66

committee of the whole is hybrid set of procedures involving some of the characteristics of consideration under the hour rule in the house and some of those applicable to consideration under the fiveminute rule in committee of the whole these procedures are utilized infrequently traditionally they have been used to act on measures concerning the district of columbia reported by the committee on oversight and government reform when the chair of this committee calls up measure which is privileged on the second and fourth mondays of each month under clause 4 of rule xv he may ask unanimous consent that it be considered in the house as in committee of the whole the house occasionally acts on other public bills and resolutions under these procedures either by unanimous consent or pursuant to special rule 67 65 house practice ch 48 sec 13 pp 810811 66 house manual sec 859 p 636 67 where the house grants unanimous consent for the immediate consideration of bill on the union calendar or

preside over the house there is general debate and the bill or resolution is considered as having been read for amendment it is immediately open to amendment at any point and all debate is governed by the fiveminute rule68 thus the majority and minority floor managers secure time for making their opening statements by moving to strike the last word other members then may offer substantive or pro forma amendments the speaker normally following the same priorities for recognition as does the chair of the committee of the whole in general the same rules principles and practices governing the amending process in committee of the whole also apply in the house as in committee of the whole except that measures are not read for amendment there is one other important exception in the house as in committee of the whole member may move the previous question on an amendment and all amendments thereto or on the measure as whole and all amendments thereto just as in the house 69 this motion which is invariably made by the majority floor manager permits the house to decide by majority vote whether it wishes to consider amendments and how long it wishes to debate the bill and any amendments that members do offer after the house orders the previous question or if one seeks recognition the house votes on engrossment and third reading of the measure then on recommittal motion if offered and finally on passing the bill70 g23g151g141g142g155g561g21g158g156g153g142g151g156g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 individual representatives may not offer floor amendments to measure considered under suspension of the rules 71 however amendments to the measure may be included as part of the motion itself member may move to suspend the rules and pass certain bill as amended after the 40 minutes of debate permitted on suspension motion is used or yielded back the house then casts one vote on suspending the rules and passing the bill as proposed to be amended under the terms of the motion separate vote on the amendments individually or collectively is in order 72 support by twothirds of the members present and voting is required to pass measure under suspension of the rules suspension motion typically is made by committee or subcommittee chair consequently the amendments proposed as part of the motion are usually committee amendments or at least amendments making postcommittee adjustments supported by the chair of the committee or subcommittee of jurisdiction the amendments also enjoy the support or acquiescence of the speaker because the speaker has discretion in deciding whether or not to recognize member to offer suspension motion continued which would belong on the union calendar if reported the bill is considered in the house

committee of the whole to close debate on the bill or on an amendment annotations to section xxx of jeffersons manual in house rules and manual however the previous question is used more often than

usually are not proposed to measures considered in the house under the hour rule because the house precludes them by voting to order the previous question although it is possible to propose amendments to bills and resolutions considered in the house as in committee of the whole these procedures are rarely used finally the house acts on more measures under suspension of the rules than under most other procedures and floor amendments are in order at all under the suspension procedure it is when the house has resolved into committee of the whole to consider measure that representatives are most likely to offer amendments some of which members may debate at length more often than not however there are few if any procedural complications in many cases the amendment process will be limited and scripted by the terms of structured special rule adopted by the house even under an open rule however the amendment process rarely becomes complicated member proposes an amendment and other members join her in debating it the committee of the whole eventually votes on the amendment and proceeds to consider the next amendment to be proposed alternatively another member may offer seconddegree amendment to the amendment and the committe then votes on the seconddegree amendment before voting on the firstdegree amendment as it may have been amended yet from time to time the amending process does become more complex as members take advantage of the opportunities afforded by clause 6 of house rule xvi when an amendable proposition is under consideration motion to amend and motion to amend that amendment shall be in order and it also shall be in order to offer further amendment by way of substitute for the original motion to amend to which one amendment may be offered but which shall not be voted on until the original amendment is perfected an amendment may be withdrawn in the house at any time before decision or amendment thereon an amendment to the title of bill or resolution shall not be in order until after its passage or adoption and shall be decided without debate this rule creates the possibility for as many as four and sometimes even five or more amendments to be proposed before members must vote on any of them it would be extraordinary for such situation to develop when bills are considered in the house or in the house as in committee of the whole and it arises infrequently in committee of the whole nonetheless rule xvi clause 6 creates number of strategic possibilities that members can employ when they believe it to be in their interests to do so the situation that may result can be depicted graphically and is often described as the amendment tree the amending situations that may develop depend primarily on the form of the firstdegree amendments that representatives offer if member proposes firstdegree amendment in the form of motion to insert or in most cases in the form of motion to strike out and insert this amendment tree depicts the kinds of amendments and the maximum number of amendments that representatives may propose before the committee of the whole or the house must vote on any one of them somewhat different situations to be discussed later may arise if the firstdegree amendment is motion to strike out or if it is an amendment in the nature of substitute proposing to replace the entire text of the measure

either be second perfecting amendment that would strike from add to or replace something in the firstdegree amendment or it may be substitute amendment that proposes complete alternative to what the firstdegree amendment would insert or strike and insert under rule xvi both of these amendments are in order after one member proposes second perfecting amendment and before the committee votes on it another representative may offer substitute for the firstdegree amendment and it is equally possible for members to propose these two amendments in the opposite order thus members can offer two different amendments each directed toward the firstdegree amendment before the committee votes on either of them in addition rule xvi provides that the substitute for the same firstdegree amendment also is amendable another member may propose an amendment to the substitute either before or after the secondperfecting amendment is offered and the amendment to the substitute is in order even though it could be construed to be third degree amendment an amendment to substitute amendment for an amendment which normally is prohibited 73 in this way members may propose four different amendments before any votes must occur the representative offering the firstdegree amendment may not propose the perfecting amendment to or the substitute for her amendment because member may not amend her own amendment however this member may amend the substitute for her amendment after representatives have offered these four amendments they and other members may continue to debate them when there is more debate or when the committee has voted to end the debate rule xvi specifies the order in which the committee votes on the amendments first members vote on the secondperfecting amendment thereby perfecting the firstdegree amendment next comes the vote on the amendment to the substitute which perfects the alternative to the firstdegree amendment third the committee votes on the substitute amendment as it may have been amended and finally vote occurs on the original firstdegree amendment again as it may have been amended 74 in this way the committee can perfect two alternatives before choosing between them the substitute for the firstdegree amendment presents the committee with choice between two alternatives one alternative the firstdegree amendment is perfectible by seconddegree amendment therefore rule xvi also permits th committee to perfect the other alternative the substitute amendment 75 both alternatives are perfected before the committee votes on the substitute and thereby chooses between the two of them if the substitute wins the last voteon the firstdegree amendment as amended by the substituteis nothing more than second vote on the same substantive proposal made by the substitute on the other hand if the substitute loses the committee usually ratifies its decision by agreeing to the firstdegree amendment perhaps as perfected the committee may reject the firstdegree amendment whatever the outcome of the preceding votes but the decisive vote more often occurs on the substitute amendment 73 for this reason it is not wholly accurate to characterize each amendment to an amendment as sec onddegree amendment under rule xvi substitute for firstdegree amendment is also treated as firstdegree amendment in that it is amendable 74 house practice ch 2 sec 28

this amendment tree for instance different members may offer perfecting amendment to and substitute for firstdegree amendment but amendment to the substitute or they may propose substitute for the first degree amendment and an amendment to that substitute but secondperfecting amendment in any event the order in which the committee votes on the amendments that members do offer remains the same the first votes are to perfect either or both alternatives before the committee votes on substitute if any furthermore the situation depicted by the amendment tree is not necessarily static one there may only be one amendment on each branch of the amendment tree at time but after the committee votes on each amendment member can offer different amendment on the same branch subject to the prohibition against attempting only to reamend matter that already has been amended member who seeks recognition may offer an amendment on any unoccupied branch of the tree if it is otherwise in order and member can claim right to be recognized before another because of the nature of the amendment he wishes to offer after the committee votes on secondperfecting amendment for example it does not necessarily proceed to act immediately on the next amendment in the voting order instead member may propose another secondperfecting amendment so long as it would not only re amend something already amended the committee then debates and votes on this new amendment and any other subsequent perfecting amendments even if substitute amendment and an amendment to it had been offered previously in other words members may offer series of secondperfecting amendments each addressed to matter in the firstdegree amendment that has not yet been fully amended and the committee acts on each of these amendments in turn before voting on the amendment to the substitute and the substitute itself if member seeks recognition to offer another secondperfecting amendment the committee votes on the amendment to the substitute after which representative may propose different amendment either to the substitute or to the firstdegree amendment the vote on an amendment to the substitute does not preclude additional perfecting amendments to the firstdegree amendment and should the committee eventually reject the substitute the firstdegree amendment remains open to another substitute and to other perfecting amendments the amending process may continue until the firstdegree amendment has been fully amended or until members have further amendments they wish to offer 76 the opportunities that rule xvi offers suggest several strategic considerations if member plans to offer an amendment to bill and knows that member b is likely to have different amendment on the same subject it is not necessarily advantageous for member to offer his proposal as firstdegree amendment member b then can offer her amendment either as perfecting amendment or as substitute and should it win there will be clean direct vote on the unamended version of member as original firstdegree amendment if member does offer his amendment as firstdegree amendment to the bill member b may decide to propose her amendment as secondperfecting amendment if that can be done in way that makes substantive sense so that the committee of the whole will first vote on member bs position but if member b adopts this strategy member can attempt to recoup the situation by having member c offer slightly changed version of member as amendment as substitute for 76 house practice ch 2 sec 28 pp 4244

secondperfecting amendment it could vote for member as basic position as well by adopting member cs substitute and if the committee votes for both amendments it is member cs amendment that ultimately prevails because the effect of adopting substitute for an amendment is to fully replace the text of that amendment as it already may have been amended by one or more perfecting amendments of course member cs substitute also is amenda ble so member b or colleague could offer the substance of her proposal second time as an amendment to the substitute although member may not offer the same amendment twice member b may propose equivalent amendments to both the firstdegree amendment and the substitute for it because each of her amendments would amend different text anticipating this development member or another ally could seek recognition first to offer an amendment to the s ubstitute that is consistent with member as original proposal finally after the committee votes on both perfecting amendmentsone to the firstdegree amendment the other to the substitutemembers might still be able to offer additional perfecting amendments to either alternatively member b could propose substitute for member s firstdegree amendment to ensure that the eventual vote on the substitute would not preclude vote on member s position an ally of his could offer secondperfecting amendment on which the committee will vote first if the committee votes for this perfecting amendment it may be unwilling to vote also for substitute that is inconsistent with the amendment already adopted but if the substitute prevails the victory achieved by the secondperfecting amendment is lost because the substitute will replace the text of the firstdegree amendment as perfected member s ally also has the option of amending member bs substitute if the committee supports that amendment there will be clean vote on the substitute in response however member b or an ally might obtain vote on the essence of their position in the form of secondperfecting amendment to member s original amendment as these possibilities suggest there is ideal strategy for representatives to adopt when they anticipate the development of an amendment tree members preferred strategy can depend on such considerations as the amount and intensity of the support for the members position and the importance of having the committee vote first on that position the nature of the issue also may matter in some cases members may be inclined to vote for more than one approach to responding to widely shared concern in others members are less likely to vote for one approach and then to vote as well for second inconsistent approach in addition the positions of the representatives offering the amendments can make difference the sequence in which the amendments actually are offered depends on the order in which the chair recognizes members to propose them and the chair traditionally gives preference in recognition to the senior members of the committee that reported the bill being considered another implication of these possibilities is that the way in which an amendment is drafted whether as perfecting or substitute amendmentdepends not only on the nature of the proposal but also on the parliamentary circumstances under which it is likely to be offered this is particularly true of amendments to amendments which members and staff may have to prepare after the floor debate has begun it sometimes is advisable to draft the same amendment in several different forms to preserve procedural flexibi lity and to

that the firstdegree amendment from which the tree grows is either 1 motion to insert or 2 motion to strike out and insert which affects only part of the measures text so mewhat different opportunities arise if instead the firstdegree amendment is motion to strike out or an amendment in the nature of substitute proposing to strike out the entire text of the measure and insert different version in its place g15g152g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g21g157g155g146g148g142g561g17g158g157g561 motion to strike out usually is not amendable in the conventional practice of the house members do not offer perfecting amendments to or substitutes for such motions however house precedents do permit members to propose amendments to the part of the measure that the motion would strike in other words the house can perfect part of bill or resolution before deciding whether to strike it 77 in this case therefore two members can propose firstdegree amendments to the text of measure before the committee of the whole votes on either of themthe amendment to strike and the amendment to change the text proposed to be stricken the latter amendment can be perfecting amendmentreplacing striking or adding to part of the language to which the motion to strike is directed or the amendment may be substitute for whatever the first amendment offered would strike in either case the amendment to the text proposed to be stricken is firstdegree amendment that is amendable and the other three branches of the amendment tree may grow on this amendment thus five amendments may be offered before any votes occur first the motion to strike second an amendment to the text proposed to be stricken and then perfecting amendment to the second amendment substitute for it and an amendment to the substitute all of the preceding discussion of the amendment tree applies to this situation with one exception after the committee votes on all the other amendments there also may be final vote on the original motion to strike if the amendment that comes behind the motion to strike is perfecting amendment the committee votes on th perfecting amendment and then on the motion to strike but if the amendment proposes to replace the whole text at which the motion to strike is directed and if it attracts majority vote on the floor vote occurs on the motion to strike the matter proposed to be stricken has been completely amended so the motion to strike becomes an attempt to reamend something that the committee already has amended the chair announces that the motion to strike falls without the need for vote because the motion is longer in order 78

finally considerably more elaborate amendment tree can develop when member offers an amendment in the nature of substitute for the entire text of bill or resolution though there are procedural reasons why this rarely occurs such an amendment in the nature of substitute presents the committee of the whole with choice between two versions of the bill the version embodied in the bill as it was introduced and brought to the floor and the version embodied in the complete substitute the amendment in the 77 on how motions to strike may affect the amending process see house practice ch 2 secs 14

amendable to the same extent as any other firstdegree amendment the amendment is perfectible in addition it is subject to substitute in effect third version of the bill which also is amendable after the committee votes on all amendments to the amendment in the nature of substitute it then votes on that complete substitute as it may have been amended if the committee adopts the amendment in the nature of substitute it replaces the entire text of the measure amending it fully this precludes any further amendments to the bill because of the prohibition against reamendment if this were the extent of the amendments in order the committee of the whole would be able to perfect one version of the bill but not the other it could vote on amendments to the amendment in the nature of substitute before voting on it and thereby choosing between it and the other version the text of the bill but it could not perfect the text of the bill itself before making this choice for this reason house precedents allow members to offer amendments to the bill itself as well as to the complete substitute for it the result is the potential for members to offer eight amendments before the committee begins to vote the amendment in the nature of substitute and three amendments relating to it and four amendmen ts relating to the original text of the bill under such scenario two full trees of the type depicted above would arise after representative proposes the complete substitute another member may offer an amendment to the substitute or firstdegree amendment to perfect the pending part of the original version of the bill if the latter is offered it is subject to the same amendment tree as any other firstdegree amendment unless of course it is motion to strike if any or all of this two trunk tree develops the committee votes first on amendments to the perfecting amendment and then on the perfecting amendment perhaps as amended before it acts on amendments relating to the amendment in the nature of substitute and after the vote on the perfecting amendment to the bill members may propose additional perfecting amendments one at time and amend and vote on them while the complete substitute and any amendments to it remain pending fortunately there are at least two reasons why such extremely complicated situations rarely develop most amendments in the nature of substitutes for measures are committee amendments or substitutes supported by committee chairmen which special rules regularly make in order as the original text to be amended under such rule it is the substitute not the bill that is read for amendment and may be amended in two degrees members may not offer amendments to the text of the bill as introduced until after voting on all amendments to the amendment in the nature of substitute and on the substitute itself and then only if the committee rejects it because the committee of the whole rarely if ever rejects an amended committee substitute it almost never reaches the original text of the bill and even if this were to happen both versions would not be open to amendment at the same time first the committee would act on the substitute and all amendments to it and then on amendments to the original version of the bill the twotrunk amendment tree is unlikely to develop even if special rule does not provide for the committee of the whole to consider the amendment in the nature of substitute as original text and instead member offers it as firstdegree amendment the reason lies in two elements of the amending process first as already noted representative may propose an amendment in the nature of substitute at only two points during the amending process in committee of the whole either at the very beginning after the first section has been read or at the very end after the committee has disposed of all other amendments second members may only propose amendments to that portion of the measure itself that has been read or designated for amendment and bills and resolutions typically are considered for amendment section by section or title by title httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98995g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g10g152g158g156g142g561g152g143g561g20g142g153g155g142g156g142g151g157g138g157g146g159g142g156g561

reads or designates the first section of the bill members can propose amendments to any part of the substitute but only to the first section of the bill which often does nothing more than state its short title79 the clerk resumes reading the remaining sections or titles of the bill for amendment only after the committee acts on all amendments to the substitute and then rejects it unless the committee agrees by unanimous consent to consider the entire bill as read and open to amendment at any point this situation effectively precludes substantive amendments to the text of the bill while the amendment in the nature of substitute is pending if on the other hand member proposes the substitute at the end of the process the committee already will have considered and voted on whatever amendments to the bill itself members wished to offer there is little likelihood that they would want to propose many additional amendments to it after the complete substitute is finally offered except under the most extraordinary circumstance s therefore only the first of the two amendment tree develops on the house floor also while in theory this tree could grow during consideration of measures in the house or in the house as in committee of the whole this is even more unlikely in practice members do not create amendment tree very often and then only in committee of the whole

g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561 in addition to the principles and prohibitions that apply to all amendments house rule xxi imposes certain special restrictions and procedures governing floor amendments to tax and appropriations measures clauses 4 and 5 are intended to ensure that members offer tax and appropriations amendments only to measures on those subjects that have been reported by the appropriate house committees clause 4 prohibits consideration of an am endment proposing an appropriationduring the consideration of bill or joint resolution reported by committee not having that jurisdiction namely any committee other than the appropriations committee and similarly clause 5a provides for point of order against an amendment in the house or proposed by the senate carrying tax or tariff measureduring the consideration of bill or joint resolution reported by committee not having that jurisdictionnamely any committee other than the ways and means committee the same clause contains two other provisions affecting tax measures first amendment measure or conference report is in order if it proposes retroactive increase in federal income tax rates second threefifths vote is required to approve any amendment bill or joint resolution or conference report that carries federal income tax rate increase clause 2 also includes provisions which are invoked more often than those of clause 4 or 5 that restrict amendments to general appropriations measures their essential purposes are 1 to enforce the requirement that appropriations are to be authorized by law and 2 to preserve

restrictions apply only to general appropriations bills but not to other legislation that may include appropriations80 clause 2a1 states that almost all appropriations must have been authorized by law before they may be considered on the house floor whether as provisions of bills and resolutions or as amendments to them an appropriation may not be reported in general appropriation bill and may not be in order as an amendment thereto for an expenditure not previously authorized by law except to continue appropriations for public work s and objects that already are in progress furthermore clause 2c provides in part that an amendment to general appropriation bill shall not in order if changing existing law enforcing the second of these prohibitions depends on what constitutes change in existing law or legislation the house has traditionally distinguished between legislation and limitation which is an appropriations provision or amendment that restricts the purposes for which or the means by which appropriations may be used an amendment limiting the availability of appropriations may be in order if it meets the requirements of complex body of precedents 81 for example if it applies only to the funds appropriated by the bill or resolution to which it is offered and not to the funds appropriated by this or any other act and if it does not impose any new duty or responsibility on an official of the federal government82 however clause 2d imposes special procedures relating to limitation amendments member wanting to offer limitation to certain paragraph of general appropriations bill may not do so after the clerk has read that paragraph even though that normally would be the appropriate time for offering an amendment in committee of the whole instead as the bill is read for amendment the committee of the whole considers and acts on all amendments except limitations then after the bill has been completely read for amendment and the committee has voted on the last amendment representative may propose limitation amendment relating to any paragraph of the bill or to the bill as whole but clause 2d provides means by which the house can vote not to consider this or any other limitation either before member proposes limitation amendment or after she offers it but before debate begins the majority floor manager can offer preferential and nondebatable motion that the committee rise and report the bill back to the house with whatever amendments the committee already has adopted 83 the committee of the whole normally does not rise and report until after it has considered all the amendments that members wish to offer in this case however the committee can vote against considering limitation amendment by agreeing to motion to rise and report before the limitation is proposed or before debate on it begins if the motion is rejected the limitation amendment is in order but after the committee votes on that amendment 80 house

report and thereby preclude consideration of the next or any subsequent limitation84 thus this special procedure under clause 2d permits the committee of the whole to cast vote which in effect can preclude members from proposing one or all limitation amendments that otherwise would be in order clause 2f of rule xxi also contains an exception to the general principle that when bill is being read amendment in committee of the whole members may offer amendments only to the part of the bill that has been read or designated and is open to amendment clause 2f permits member to offer amendments bloc if the combined effect of the amendments is to transfer appropriations among objects in the bill without increasing the levels of budget authority or outlays in the bill such amendments are in order even if they amend portions of the bill that have not yet been read for amendment and the am endments are not subject to demand that they be divided and considered separately 85 house rules also limit the ability of members to add socalled earmarks to legislation via certain types of amendment under clause 9 of rule xxi it is not in order to consider amendments to bills or joint resolutions to be offered at the outset of its consideration for amendment by member of committee of initial referral unless the proponent has caused list of congressional earmarks limited tax benefits and limited tariff benefits in the amendment and the name of any member delegate or reside nt commissioner who submitted request to the proponent for each respective item included in such list or statement that the proposition contains congressional earmarks limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits to be printed in the congressional record prior to its consideration clause 10 of rule xxi is known as the houses payasyougo or paygo rule this provision requires that bills and joint resolutionsas well as amendments theretothat affect direct spending or revenues must not increase th deficit or reduce the surplus over sixyear window this window includes the current year the upcoming fiscal year and the four following fiscal years as well as an 11year period the period cited above as well as the ensuing five fiscal years this requirement like all other rules of the house may be waived by special rule beginning in the 110 th congress when crafting special rules on certain measures affecting direct spending or revenues the rules committee has strongly encouraged members to send their amendments to the congressional budget office cbo for an alysis regarding possible violations of the paygo rule before submitting them for rules committee consideration86 84 these same procedures apply to germane amendments which retrench expenditures by reduction of amounts of

identified points of order to which amendments may be subject if representative makes point of order against an amendment and the point of order is sustained the amendment may not be considered the speaker or the chair of the committee of the whole usually does not rule an amendment out of order until after member makes point of order against it it is the responsibility of each member to enforce the procedures of the house and thereby protect her own rights by making appr opriate points of order if member makes point of order an amendment normally may be considered even though it violates some requirement of the houses legislative procedures when representative wants to make point of order against an amendment she usually does so as soon as the amendment is offered or she may reserve the point of order before the debate begins and then make it at later time during debate on the amendment however the special rule under which measure is being considered may waive applicable points of order against specific amendments that members are expected to propose furthermore point of order lies against an amendment presented to the house as part of motion to suspend the rules and pass measure as amended the suspension procedure has the effect of waiving all points of order that otherwise might lie against the bill or any amendment incorporated in the motion in almost all cases there is only one appropriat moment for making point of order against an amendment after the clerk has finished reading the amendment or after the reading has been dispensed with by unanimous consent but before the sponsor of the amendment begins to debate it 87 in some cases therefore member may insist on having an amendment read in full to give him time to examine it once debate begins on the amendment in most cases it is too late to make point of order against it the exceptions to this general rule are points of order made under clauses 4 and 5 of rule xxi prohibiting an appropriations or tax amendment to measure that was not reported by the appropriate committee such point of order may be raised at any time member may make it at any time that the committee of the whole is considering the amendment under the fiveminute rule instead of making point of order against an amendment at the appropriate timebefore there has been any debate on ita member may seek to reserve the point of order and then make it after there have been five or more minutes of debate on the amendment88 there are two primary reasons for doing so first the member may want more time to study the amendment to decide if it is subject to point of order and if so whether she chooses to make it second the member may intend to make point of order but prefers to allow the amendments sponsor and perhaps other members some time to discuss it if member reserves point of order and colleague then demands the regular order the chair hears and rules on the point of order as expeditiously as possible 89 87 house

instead the chair has discretion to entertain as much or as little debate for his information as he wishes traditionally the speaker or the chair recognizes the member making the point of order to explain the basis for itidentifying the principle rule or precedent that the amendment violatesand to argue in favor it the sponsor of the amendment next has an opportunity to defend it against the point of order after which the chair may recognize other members to speak on the procedural question the speaker or chair then makes ruling with the advice of the parliamentarian which reflects past interpretations of the applicable rules and precedents any member may appeal the ruling of the chair on point of order against an amendment in which case the house then decides by majority vote whether to sustain or overturn the ruling 90 but this is rarely done and virtually never done successfully the presiding officer of the house has not been overruled against his will in more than 50 years thus rulings of the chair either in the house or in committee of the whole are conclusive for all practical purposes

report to the usual or possible impact of special rules on the amending process these effects are summarized here91 first special rules usually specify the set of procedures under which the house considers measure the overwhelming majority of rules provide for consideration in committee of the whole but they may state instead that bill or resolution is to be considered in the house or in the house as in committee of the whole on rare occasions special rules concerning general appropriations measures which are privileged fo r floor consideration may only waive points of order against the measure its provisions and amendments to it second special rules specify the length of general debate in committee of the whole and allocate it between or among committee chairmen ranking minority members and in rare instances other members as well third special rules routinely provide for an ame ndment in the nature of substitute usually recommended by the committee that reported the measure to be considered as an original bill for purpose of amendment the effect of this provision is to make the substitute amendable in two degrees and to direct all amendments to it rather than to the text of the measure as introduced except in the unlikely event that the committee ultimately rejects the substitute fourth special rules may restrict the amendments that representatives can offer in committee of the whole closed rule precludes all amendments or all but those offered at the direction of the committee of jurisdiction structured rule is restrictive special rule that either permits only the amendments identified by the special rule or prohibits amendments on certain subjects or to certain parts of the measure modified open rules permit amendments to be offered as long as they have been preprinted in the congressional record special rules also may prohibit amendments to amendments 90 house practice ch 37 sec 12 pp371372 91 for additional information see crs report 98612
