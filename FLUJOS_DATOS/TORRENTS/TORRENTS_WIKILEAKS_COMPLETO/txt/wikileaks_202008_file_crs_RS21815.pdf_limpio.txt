on other proposals to address the s ituation see crs report rl32286 asbestos litigation prospects for legislative resolution by edward rappaport s 2290 108th congress grew out of supreme court decision that rejected the amchem also known as the georgine asbestos settlement on the ground that it failed to satisfy rule 23 of the federal rules of ci vil procedure which g overns class actions in federal courts2 justice ginsburg in her opinion for the court wrotehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21815crs2 3 id at 628629 in ortiz v fibreboard corp 527 us 815 1999 justi ce souter wrote for the court like amchem products inc v windsor 521 us 591 1997 this case is class action prompted by the elephantine mass of as bestos cases and our discussion in amchem will suffice to show how this litigation defies customary judicial administration and calls for national legislation in norfolk western r co v ayers 538 us 135 166 2003 the court repeated that the elephantine mass of asbestos cases defies customary judicial administration and calls for national legislation but held that courts may not reconfigure established liability rules because they do not serve to abate todays asbestos litigation crisis 4 because s 2290 was written in the present tense we have for convenience from this point on retained present tense in our description of it even though it was not enacted into lawthe argument is sensibly made that nationwide administrative claims processing regime would provide the most secure fair and efficient means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure congress however has not adopted such solution3 s 2290 would create privately funded pub licly administered fund that will provide compensation for legitimate present and future claimants of asbestos exposure 24 the fund would be called the asbestos injury claims resolution fund 221 and the bill would create within the department of labor the office of asbestos disease compensation to administer the fund 101 the office would be headed by an administrator appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate the administrator would serve fiveyear term and report directly to the assistant secretary of labor for the employment st andards administration 101b asbestos claims could long er be filed or pursued under state law except for the enforcement of judgments longer subject to any appeal or judicial review before the date of enactment of the bill 403d if the fund were to sunset however suits could again be filed or pursued but only in federal court and unde r federal common law see below payment of asbestos injury claims any individual or if he is deceased hi s personal representative who has suffered from an eligible disease or condition may file claim with the office for an award with respect to such injury 113a the claimant would have to prove by preponderance of the evidence that he suffe rs from an eligible disease or condition 1112 he would not have to prove th at his injury resulted from the negligence or other fault of any person 112 the statute of limitations would be four years from the date the claimant first received medical diagnosis of an eligible disease or condition or discovered facts that would have led reasonable person to obt ain medical diagnosis with respect to an eligible disease or condition 113b1 if however cla imant had filed timely claim that was pending in federal or state court on the date of enactment of the bill such claim would have to be dis missed and the statute of limitati ons to file claim under the bill would be four years from the date of enactment of the bill 113b2 not later than 90 days after the filing of claim the administrator shall provide to the claimant and the claimants representa tive proposed decision accepting or rejectinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21815crs3 5 the benefit table appears on page 77 of the pdf version of s 2290 it does not appear in the html version some but not all of the amounts pres cribed by s 2290 are higher than the amounts prescribed by s 1125 for example the awar d for severe asbestosis was increased from 300000 to 400000 and the award for disabling asbestosis was increased from 750000 to 850000 but the award for mixed disease with impairment was kept at 20000 and the award for mesothelioma was kept at 1 million the highest award prescribed the claim in whole or in part and specifyin g the amount of the proposed award if any 114b any claimant not satisfied with the proposed decision of the administrator would be entitled on written request made within 90 days to hearing or to review of the written record by representative of the administrator 114c after hearing or review or if hearing or review is re quested within 90 days the administrator would issue final decision 114d claima nt would then have 90 days to petition for judicial review of the final decision 302a review would be by the us court of appeals for the circuit in which the claimant resides at the time of the issuance of the final order 302b the court would uphold th decision unless it determined that the decision is not supported by substantial evid ence is contrary to law or is not in accordance with procedure required by law 302c the administrator would establish comprehensive asbestos claimant assistance program 104a including legal assi stance program 104d attorneys could charge more than 2 percent of the amount of the award for filing an initial claim and 10 percent with respect to any claim under appellate re view 104e the term appellate review is not defined so it is not clear whether it would include both the hearing or review by the representative of the administrator and judicial review the amount of an award under s 2290 would be determined pursu ant to the benefit table in section 131b which prescribes different amounts fo r different medical conditions and in cases of lung cancer di fferent amounts for sm okers nonsmokers and exsmokers as it defines those terms5 beginning in 2006 awards would be increased annually by costofliving adjustment 131b5 awards shall be reduced by the amount of collateral source compensation 134a but the term collateral sour ce compensation would refer only to the compensation that the claimant received or is entitled to receive from defendant or an insurer of that defendant or compensation trust as result of judgment or settlement for an asbestosrelated injury that is the subject of claim filed under section 113 36 s 2290 provides explicitly that collatera l source compensation would not include workers compensation or vete rans benefits 134b but it would apparently also not include any other compensation such as disab ility or health insurance payments or medicare or medicaid that was not paid by defendant or an insure r of that defendant or compensation trust claimant in ot her words could receive all these amounts in addition to his award from the asbest injury claims resolution fund asbestos claimants would not receive lu mpsum awards but should receive the amount of the award through structured pa yments from the fund made over period of three years and in event more than four years after the date of final adjudication of the claim 133a1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21815crs4 6 participant is defined as any defendant partic ipant or insurer particip ant subject to payments under

billion for the first 23 years of the fund unless the 575 billion is recei ved sooner 204h1 after the 575 billion has been paid the administrator coul d if necessary issue contingent call for mandatory additional payments of up to an aggregate maximum of 10 billion the administrator would first however have to publish notice in the federal register and consider comments from defenda nt participants on the necessity of additional payments 204m the total payment required of all insurer participants ove r the life of the fund shall be equal to 46025000000 212a2a insu rer participants would pay prescribed amounts for 27 years 212a3c the unite d states government would not be liable for any asbestos claims even if the f und is inadequate to pay them 406b the administrator would be

reasonable fees incurred for collection expert witnesses and attorneys f ees and fine equal to the total amount of the liability that has not been collected 223c at any time after seven years following the date on which the administrator begins processing claims if the administrator termines that the fund will not have sufficient resources then the fund would suns et 405f if the fund sunsets then claimants could again file or pursue lawsuits the applicable statute of limitations would be deemed tolled for the time during which claim had been pursued against the fund and the

downhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21815crs5 7 the inclusion of defense costs which is not defined suggests that even defendant who had been found not liable or against whom suit had been dismissed or dropped would ordinarily have to contribute to the fund because it would likely have incurred prior asbestos expenditures in defending the suit brought against it 8 insurer and insurer participant are
