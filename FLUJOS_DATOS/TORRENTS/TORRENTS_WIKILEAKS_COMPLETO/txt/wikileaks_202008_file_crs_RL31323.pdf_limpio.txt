export and foreign investment data statistical overview summary this statistical overview is collection of tables summarizing key international trade data by state the tables show for each state the overall level of exports the relative importance of various trading partners and the importance of foreign investment more specifically the tables ar divided into three categories providing 1 data on export levels and export growth since 1993 ranked by state both within the united states and within census regions 2 state export data to eight countries and eight key international regions with which or for which the united states already has or is considering trade agreements and p referential trade laws and 3 data on levels of foreign direct investment both overall and for the manufacturing sector by state these tables can be used as general background or as input into debates on trade agreements and preferential trade ws from the perspective of the individual state in the past 25 years international tra has surged merchandise exports plus imports have risen from roughly 10 of gdp in 1973 when exports and imports were nearly equal to about 20 of gdp in 2000 in which year imports constituted 61 of all goods traded since 1993 shortly before the north american free trade agreement nafta went into effect in 1994 and the final act of the 1986 1994 uruguay round of trade negotiations which created the world trade organization went into effect in 1995 impor ts have grown roughly 15 times as fast as exports the rising importance of imports and xports to the us economy has led to increased congressional focus on trade issues while data are readily available on exports by state data are not available on imports by state this is because for the most part each states exports are tracked from the air sea or land port of exit typically in the same state in which they are produced to their destination countries while imports are tracked from the originating country only as far as the first port of entry into the united states similarly state data on foreign direct investment are available solely for foreign investment in the united states data in this report reflect the current international investment position in the united states state export data in this report include the following countries and trade areas which are key trading partners are covered by existing trade agreements or are covered by proposed or possible future trade agreements and preferential trade laws canada mexico north american free trade agreement nafta partners japan china the

this rising importance of imports and exports with implications for both individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31323crs2 1the white house economic report of the president february 2002 tables b1 and b 103 2us trade representative estimates based on department of commerce data for preceding years 3these figures are extrapolations from an input output model developed by the university of maryland under contract with the department of commerce in the 1980s and 1990s the last year for which data were actually calculated by the model was 1994 because these extrapolations may not capture important changes in the us economy since that time they should be used with cautionstates and the us economy has led to increased congressional focus on trade issues1 exports offer number of benefits for states they are source of pride because they reflect states interests in promoting jobs in manufacturing in the larger world economy export industries tend to be thos in which state has comparative advantage and can produce goods relativel more efficiently ie have higher productivity than can its trading partners exports are also source of jobs in 2000 each billion dollars worth of merchandise exports supported roughly 10270 jobs23 as result of their higher productivity expor t industries tend to support higher wages than other manufacturing industries thus state export industries contribute to higher productivity and higher income for the economy as whole imports are often viewed as threats to producers in importcompeting industries since competition from cheaper imports shrinks profit margins and reduces market share imports often represent sunset i ndustries and subindustries those for which the technology has matured enoug h for production to b moved abroad and carried out by less developed countries w here they provide springboard for economic growth this leaves us companies to focus their energies on emerging and evolving industries imports offer va riety of benefits to consumers and to the economy as whole including greater vari ety of products and quality and lower costs of imports as result consumers are able to buy larger quantity of all goods including domestically produced goods im ports have other benefits as well they can serve as inputs for domestic production which may in turn be exported alternatively they may be finished p roducts which incor porate us exports overall imports because they are typica lly less expensive than country could produce domestically enable consumers t enjoy in effect higher standard of living inward flows of foreign direct inves tment into states which may appear in number of forms including manufacturing operations retail stores financial institutions and insurance businesses are viewed by some as threat to established businesses and established ways of life on the other hand states often go to great lengths to attract foreign direct investment including competing against other states for it however inflows of foreign direct investment also bring new companies new technologies new management strategie s new work practices and new jobs in some cases there is broad support for foreig n direct investment in other cases there is controversy the total stock of foreign direct investment in the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31323crs3 which comes primarily from europe and canada has grown from 1247 billion in 1982 to 12 trillion in 2000 outward flows of us investment abroad are also seen by some as social andor economic threats long established factor ies might close down and relocate abroad or usbased multinational corporations might set up new operations in other developed or developing countries i n deciding to choose whe ther to invest domestically or abroad and where firms make choices based on broad spectrum of economic factors the majority of us direct investment abroad is concentrated in advanced economies with cost structures similar to those in the united states and the share has been rising in recent years only 30 of us direct investment abroad is in developing countries in part this is b ecause when businesses are simply packed up and relocated or when lower technolog laborintensive operations are set up in developing countries the costs per busin ess the value of us investment abroad are typically relatively low outflows f foreign direct investment often support interindustry trade by us multinati onal corporations thus goods produced in us factories abroad may find their way back to the united states either as components for us produced goods or as final products for us consumption us direct investment abroad for 2000 is equal t foreign direct investment in the united states 12 trillion congressional interest members of congress often express interest in how their states are being affected by international trade and inves tment flows inquiries may be driven by legislative proposals for reauthorization f presidential fasttrack negotiating authority b legislation implementing new trade agreement or adopting other trade liberalizing measures or c oversight of an existing agreement as input in the legislative process members tend to be particularly interested in trade and investment data by state ideally the purpose of this report would be to track exports imports foreign direct investment and us investment ab road by state unfortunately data are not available on either imports by state or us investment abroad by state the census data track us exports from their port of exit typically land sea or airport in the same state in which the goods are produced t the country of their final destination but census data track imports from the originating country only as far as their port of entry into the united states and not to their final state destination similarly census data track foreign investment inflows to their destination however they do not track outflows of us investment abroad from their source as result this report is able to include data only on expor ts and foreign direct investment in the united states and not data on imports and u s investment abroad thus data in this report show onehalf of the full state trade picturehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31323crs4 highlights of data presented tables 14 present data on state expor ts for 2000 ranked by total export value by absolute and percent change in exports nd by percent of gross state product that is exported tables 910 repeat the first three tables organizing them by census regions tables 58 track state exports for 2000 to

commanding about onefifth of all fdi in the united states most regions however except for new england and the mountain region are fairl equal in the percent of total fdi which they have received from other countries fdi in manufacturing accounts for nearly half of all fdihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31323crs6 4information for this section was taken from u s department of commerce international trade administrations appendix gu ide to state and substate export data httpwwwitadocgovtdindustryoteastatetechnotehtmla note on the data4 data in the following tables are from the exporter location series provided to the international trade administration b the us census bureau the published data are based on initial data compiled from us export declarations this series allocates exports according to the physical location of exporters it typicallyallocates exports to locations from which the goods were sold locations from which firms sell their products do not always coincide with the locations where export goods are produced alaska is perhaps the best exa mple of how export production and sales can diverge possiblymore than twothirds f alaskas export production is typically sold by wholesalers or other intermediary exporters that are located outside the state thus only about one third of alaskas export v alue is represented by the data on the tables that follow moreover the diverge nce between production and sales locations means that the statistics will sometimes s how substantial exports of manufactured products from states or localities where manufacturing plants are
