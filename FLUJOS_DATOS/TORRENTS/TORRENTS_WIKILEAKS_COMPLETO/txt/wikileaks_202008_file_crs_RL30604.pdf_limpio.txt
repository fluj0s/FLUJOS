be bellwether for the region and the country is facing threat to its national security from the narcotics trade and refugees from burma since thailand is military ally the united states has direct interest in its disputes with burma us relations with thailand are generally favorable both in terms of security and economics consensus existed among thai government officials and business executives that their economy was on the road to recovery after growth rates of 18 in 1997 100 in 1998 and 36 in 1999 real gross domestic product gdp is expected to expand by about 4 in 2000 question remains however about the sustainability of the recovery and the strategy of relying on exports to the booming american economy since the onset of the financial crisis in 1997 the us bilateral trade deficit with thailand has doubled thailands northern border with burma myanmar presents the greatest current threat to thai security it is the scene of increased illegal drug trafficking aimed at the thai population and flood of refugees mostly from ethnic groups in burma thailand has pursued policy of engagement with burma and led in the movement to admit burma as member of the association of southeast asian nations although that policy of engagement now seems to be undergoing revision thai authorities are taking stronger action to stem the illegal drug trade and to attempt to deal with the displaced persons from ethnic groups across the border this encompasses larger role for the thai military who are cooperating with the police in drug interdiction and suppression the drug problem with burma has gone beyond the traditional opium and heroin to methamphetamines these are produced primarily in plants across the border in the shan state and aimed at thai consumers in 1999 an estimated 200 million tablets were smuggled into the country thailand is housing more than 100000 displaced persons from burma in ten temporary camps which all too often have turned into semipermanent settlements an estimated 700000 additional burmese live in thailand outside the established camps most have been displaced because of the fighting between the military junta and ethnic minorities

improvement in thailand is being offset by serious and worsening illegal drug and refugee problem with burma myanmar this report summarizes information and observations from research trip to thailand conducted may 27june 5 2000 with supplementary material from other sources1 the focus of the trip was on relations with the united states thailands recovery from the financia l crisis and problems with myanmar centered on illegal drug trafficking and refugees2 thailand is of interest to the united states at this time because 1 its apparent recovery from the asian financial crisis can be bellwether for the region 2 it is facing threat to its national security in the form of sizable illegal narcotics trade from burma that not only is putting the younger generation of thais at risk but the profits from that trade are being used to strengthen certain ethnic groups in burma who make the drugs and who are at times hostile to thailand 3 the burmese military juntas crackdown on ethnic minorities in burma is causing huge refugee problem forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30604crs2 3 newly established election commission recently has disqualified several senators for alleged vote buying

under the southeast asia collective defense treaty manila pact of 1954 and run about 30 joint exercises per year including peacekeeping and emergency evacuation during the gulf war the us was provided access to thai bases thailand quickly responded to the call for support of the peacekeeping effort in east timor formerly of indonesia by dispatching some 1500 troops there thailand and the united states also cooperate on number of other issues particularly in stemming the flow of illegal narcotics and coping with refugees from neighboring countries in 1999 the united states ran 93 billion merchandise trade deficit with thailand this was nearly double the 3 to 5 billion in trade deficits prior to the beginning of the financial crisis in 1997 see figure 4 the top us imports from thailand include electronic machinery and equipment other machinery apparel fish and miscellaneous manufactures the top us exports there include electrical machinery and equipment other machinery transportation equipment chemicals and agricultural products for details see the appendix to this report the thai economy provides an attractive base for us firms from which to reach southeast asian markets companies such as dole proctor gamble general motors and ford motors have sizable operations in thailand after the united states thailand is the second largest market worldwide for pickup trucks ford ranks third in this market in thailand pickups often are converted into minibuses us companies are said to play an important role in the thai economy in providing models of safe and healthy workplaces in general they are considered to follow us standards with respect to labor and the environment groundswell of opposition to us investment in thailand has arisen two issues however seemed to mar the otherwise cordial usthai relationshi p the first is the initial us response to the thai financial crisis in julyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30604crs3 4 according to the convention between the united states of america and the kingdom of thailand for the avoidance of double taxation when information is requested by contracting state in accordance with article 3 section 28 the other contracting state is obligated to obtain the requested information as if the tax in question were the tax of the requested state even if that state has direct tax interest in the case to which the request relates since thailand had such provision in its law this requirement was suspended in the convention until such time as the united states receives from thailand diplomatic note indicating that thailand is prepared and able to implement the provisions of this paragraph which would require enabling legislation to be enacted and to become effective if the diplomatic note is not received by june 30 2002 the convention is to terminate on january 1 2003 us government officials are aware of the problem and hope that it will receive higher priority within the thai government as the deadline draws near1997 the united states did not pledge to provide backup loans as part of the financial support package coordinated by the international monetary fund imf this created the impression among the thai people that the united states was not concerned about their crisis particularly after the us later pledged secondary financing for indonesia and south korea they also expected us financial assistance because of their movement toward democracy later the united states compensated somewhat for its initial lack of support by providing thailand with 1 billion in exportimport bank credits cancelling the sale of us fighter planes thereby saving thailands hard currency and providing 400 billion in loan guarantees by the overseas private investment corporation for projects involving us investment in thailand these involved real resource help quite unlike the promises of secondary financing in the imf support package in which the us did not participate and which thailand never activated the second issue of contention was the administrations decision in 1999 to support new zealander mike moore for the post of director general of the world trade organization rather than the thai candidate deputy prime minister supachai panitchpakdi the thais viewed the united states as the leader among the nations favoring the new zealander for the post thai feelings were allayed however when under compromise each nominee is to serve half the sixyear term of the post with respect to the illegal trafficking in women and labor for the us market thai officials only noted that they try to cooperate with other countries in combating the problem they are training their police and trying to enforce laws they also noted that the networks dealing with narcotics seem unrelated to those dealing with the traffic in women and children us businesses in thailand raised concern about the double taxation treaty that took effect at the beginning of 1997 after thirteen years of negotiations this treaty is to terminate on january 1 2003 unless the thai government changes its laws to allow disclosure4 according to us business interests to let this treaty terminate would put them at large disadvantage in operating in thailand they urged the us side to pursue talks more aggressively on this issue us agricultural exporters in thailand also expressed concern that the official policy of thailand was to not allow genetically modified gm products into the country since american companies export considerable wheat potatoes soybeanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30604crs4 5

there they pointed out that thailand has only one laboratory to verify gmfree products recovery from the financial crisis the visiting congressional staff group sought answers to three basic questions with respect to thailands financial crisis what was the cause of the crisis was the economy recovering will the policy measures allow for sustained recovery the cause of thailand s financial crisis was rooted in combination of fixed exchange rate current and capital account liberalization underdeveloped regulatory reporting and supervisory institutions and mismatc hes among borrowers and lenders that created enormous risks for the financial system5 particularly significant was the mismatch between foreign shortterm borrowin g used for domestic longterm lending that fed speculative bubble in real estate and stock markets this was combined with attempts to maintain fixed exchange rate in the face of rising trade deficits and the threat of massive bankruptcies among finance companies and other banking institutions that faced nonperforming loans of about 18 of their loan portfolios once investor confidence was shaken stampede to move assets out of the thai baht into foreign currencies doomed the fixed exchange rate despite government attempts to maintain it by selling foreign exchange reserves eventually the thai authorities had to turn to the imf to coordinate 17 billion financial support package the package however came with stringent requirements on monetary and fiscal policy that in retrospect resembled conditions imposed on hyperinflationary latin american economies and may not have been appropriate for the situation in thailand eventually the imf eased its requirement that thailand run budget surplus but not before the economy had dropped into recession as can be seen in figure 2 after the worst of the currency depreciation in 199798 the thai baht has remained relativelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30604crs5 6 for review of the causes consequences and policies related

growth rates for thailand s korea and indonesia 19932001 forecaststable at about 75 of its precrisis level it has performed similarly to the south korean won and much better than the indonesian rupiah6 in june 2000 consensus existed among thai government officials and business executives that their economy was on the road to recovery one think tank analyst however described the recession and recovery not as v or w shaped but as l shaped it had dropped and is expected to stay down as shown in figure 3 after growth rates of 18 in 1997 100 in 1998 and 36 in 1999 real gross domestic product gdp is expected to expand by about 4 in 2000 the recession for thailand as well as south korea and indonesia appears to be v shaped but the post crisis levels of growth for thailand are only about half those in the early 1990s question remains among policymakers however about the sustainability of the recovery in mid2000 the recovery seemed more broadly based than it did in late 1999 but the economy definitely is not back to where it was prior to 1997 considering that businesses had become accustomed to growth rates of 5 to 10 per year prior to the crisis the two years of recession plus slow recovery have put the economy about 25 below where it would have been without the financial crisis this means that many businesses are suffering from excess capacity in production lines and real estate developers are facing low occupancy rates in office buildings built with borrowed funds according to the bank of thailand at the end of 1999 capacity utilization in the motor vehicle sector was only 36 in construction 50 in food 44 in iron and steel 39 and in petroleum production 86 overall manufacturing production in 1999 however was up 125 over 1998 unemployment was still around 4 concern for americans is that the recovery strategy for thailand includes exportled growth that depends on shipping products to the booming american economy as shown in figure 4 since the onset of the financial crisis in 1997 the bilateral trade deficit with thailand has doubled from 41 billion in 1996 to 93 billion in 1999 thai policymakers point out that thailands exports of goods to

imports that exceeded 10253 billion that year still it seems that this development strategy of increasing demand in the economy by selling to the booming and open american market is not sustainable it is the same strategy being pursued by dozens of other countries in the world single country might succeed in doing it but all countries cannot do it without causing balanceofpayment problems for the united states point to note is the rising influence of japan in thailand of the 130 billion baht 34 billion stimulus package announced in march 1999 53 billion baht 14 billion came from the miyazawa plan financed by the japanese government also according to us business executives japan has been promoting its influence through its aid and training programs particularly with respect to small and medium sized enterprises the japanese government has been providing experts who are introducing the japanese model for small businesses like most newly industrializing nations thailand has developed dualistic economy with rising middleclass population centered primarily in bangkok and rural population scattered throughout the rest of the country the middleclass and wealthy still have pent up demand for the accouterments of massconsumption world cars consumer electronics fashionable clothing and comfortable housing the middle class are important not only for their effect on the economy but for the workings of democracy and for the taxes they pay they vote for government officials and then finance their policies during the financial crisis the middle class bore the brunt of the downturn and they still face lower wages higher debt and more job instability than before the crisis thailands rural areas were less affected by the economic disruption although laborers who lost their jobs in bangkok often went back to the countryside looking for work agriculture accounts for half of the thai population as the crisis progressed depressed world prices for commodities particularly rice hurt thai farmers agricultural incomes are down and thai authorities are seeking ways to assist farmers without violating the rules of the world trade organization in the postmortem on the financial crisis the thai public seems to be making scapegoat out of the international monetary fund the criticism of the fund is that its conditions as part of its financial support package required the thai government to pursue tight fiscal and monetary policies and to close ailing financial institutionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30604crs7 7 financial times information asia intelligence wire international market insight reports thailand update on privatization of com authority international market insight reports june 23 2000 internet versionthis worsened the recession and compelled the government to incur sizable fiscal deficit in trying to recover from the crisis much of the criticism of the imf however seems based on the fact that it reversed its initial stringent conditions and admitted its early mistakes the criticism does not seem to be based on any solid economic assessment that some alternative policy would have worked better during the extraordinary turmoil in the early part of the financial crisis in meetings with thai officials none of them was willing to spell out in detail to what extent the imf recovery plan was responsive to thai input or whether it merely reflected similar plans made previously for latin american countries some said that given the situation they had to take the bad medicine with the good the fiscal stimulus required to bring the economy out of the recession has pushed the governments budget into deficit in 1999 the fiscal deficit reached 119 billion baht about 3 billion or 23 of gdp as of february 2000 the government held public debt of about 23 billion roughly equivalent to one years government revenue or 13 of gdp while the bank of thailand had debts of another 13 billion the public now is debating over who will pay for this borrowing the nascent economic recovery seems to have slowed the pace of reforms the closing of insolvent financial institutions and imposition of new banking standards have progressed apace but privatization of key governmentowned monopolies and improvements in corporate governance seem to be lagging the government is working to recapitalize financial institutions reprivatize stateowned banks and solve the problem of nonperfo rming loans total of 68 finance companies were either liquidated or merged the government took over 6 of 15 commercial banks and eventually sold two of them to foreign investors the government also has injected about 12 billion into the equity of state and intervened banks in terms of privatizi ng companies in the telecommunications sector thailand has made promises as part of its reforms under the imf financial support package and commitments with the world trade organization to liberalize its telecommunications services the government has directed three stateowned enterprises to make preparations for initial corporatization and eventual privatization of their organiza tions these include the communications authority of thailand international telecommunications the telephone organization of thailand telecommunications in thailand and neighboring countries and the mass communications organization of thailand radio and television broadcasts in thailand they are to begin by establishing holding company fully held by the government which is to own the companies and eventually sell shares in them to the public7 progress in implementing this privatization plan however has been slow one explanation for the delay is that the thai military and other government officials are involved in some of the state enterprises their family wealth may depend on these businesses another explanation is that labor unions who tend to be strong in stateowned enterprises vehemently oppose privatizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30604crs8 crossing the thaiburma border on inner tubesone bright light in the reform process has been in data dissemination by financial institutions the first step in establishing sound regulatory and oversight systems is in gathering accurate and timely data on the activities of financial institutions the bank of thailand and finance ministry seem now to have much improved data collection and dissemination mechanisms in place as the thai policymakers look beyond basic recovery from the financial crisis they have identified education as major weakness in supporting future sustained growth they point out that their technical education level is lower than that in singapore malaysia and other newly industrial ized nations given that china is expected to capture more and more laborintensive industry they are concerned that thailand will not have the skills for the hightechnology industries to which their economy will have to move the country lags behind neighboring economies in internet and computer usage

thailands northern border with burma myanmar presents the greatest current threat to thai security it is the scene of increased illegal drug trafficking aimed at the thai population and flood of refugees mostly from ethnic groups in burma with respect to their national security thai officials considered high intensity conflict major war with any of their neighbors unlikely within the next five to ten years they were concerned however over two low intensity categories international terrorism organized crime and conflicts with burma since 33 of the 76 provinces in thailand are near the border with burma the conflicts with that country have affected thai security in terms of the priorities of thai security policy the first priority is relations with neighbors second is relations with the great powers and third is relations with regional groups with neighbors the political objectives are to promote good understanding build trust and protect thai security thai officials noted that relations with cambodia had improved considerably and relations with malaysia were considered to be excellent the problems with burma stem from three basic causes the first is that the border with

attempting to unify the country by force and is loathe to grant autonomy to minority groups along the border since the late 1980s the burmese military junta has carried out military campaigns against the minority populations along the thai border thai officials in the area report that the fighting in burma will sometime s spill over into thailand artillery shells occasionall cross the river on the border the fighting also has triggered flood of refugees into thailand with karen people even crossing land mine fields to reach thai border crossings these clashes have been occurring for 15 years according to thai officials one problem is that the myanmar ruling junta has turned over the area of karen control to the karen buddhists and has been using them to suppress the karen christians and muslims many karen christians and muslims therefore have fled to areas across the border in thailand these fights between the burmese government and minority populations have compelled some of the ethnic groups particularly the wa in the shan state across the border from northern thailand to depend even more on drug trafficking to generate income for their people thai policy towards burma thailand has pursued policy of engagement with burma it was leader in the movement for admitting burma as member of the association of southeast asian nations unfortunately thai officials now express their disappointment that after membership burma seems not to be following certain asean principles the country allegedly pursues its own interest with little regard to commitments under asean thai

each day to cross the friendship bridge at mae sot in tak province many of whom are on onewee k visitor visas despite the attacks by burmese ethnic groups on the refugee camps across the border in thailand there is evidence that the burmese government has territorial ambitions in discussions with thai officials it was apparent that thai policy of constructive engagement towards burma was being toughened but the exact nature of the change was difficult to pin down when the issue was brought up with officials at the national security council by group members in may 2000 they denied that any changes had taken place and brushed off any such information as speculation still it was apparent that the situation along the border with burma posed the greatest immediate threat to thai security the illegal flow of narcotics threatened to make addicts of new generation of young people along with sizable part of the thai workforce while financing hostile activities by groups in burma the burmese suppression of ethnic groups moreover was pushing displaced persons across the border and placing heavy social economic and political burden on thailand it appears that the thai government is moving toward policy of selective engagement with myanmar that includes more aggressive measures to deal with the illegal drug trade along the northern border this policy encompasses larger role for the thai military who are cooperating with the police in drug interdiction and suppression even though military leaders in northern thailand expressed regret that they should have to devote resources to do what they consider to be police work they are now coordinating the antinarcotics effort in the area scattered news reports indicate that more aggressive stance is being taken by thailand against drug trafficking the shan herald agency for news located in chiang mai thailand for example reported that remnants of the shan forces defeated by the wa in 1994 have recently received arms from their old thai friends8 the far eastern economic review reported in june 2000 that thailand was supporting clandestine sabotage operations in wacontrolled territory inside burma details are scarce but

thailand each member would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes 11 with respect to burma the customs and trade act of 1990 authorizes the president to impose such economic sanctions determined to be appropriate the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibits use of us foreign assistance paid as the us proportionate share to international organizations when those organizations run programs in burma as well as in certain other nations the foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriations act 1997 prohibits most foreign assistance and authorizes the president to restrict visas and impose investment sanctions until such time that the president determines and certifies that burma has made measurable and substantial progress in improving human rights and implementing democratic government 12 us department of state conditions in burma and us policy toward burma for the period september 29 1999 march 27 2000 may 3 2000if war should break out along the thaiburmese border questions may arise with respect to us obligations under the manila pact which allies it with thailand10 the probability of escalating the conflict to the point where treaties would be invoked however seems small at this time thailand is wary of war with burma since they have been enemies since ancient times and in conflicts burma usually wins in the past ethnic groups in burma have served as buffer armies larger conflict moreover could weaken asean as it would involve two of its members and its principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of member nations might be called into question the issue of dealing with hostilities between two asean members has precedent for the organization hostilities also could bring china more into the picture since it is reportedly supplying weapons and personnel to the wa army and is burmas only real ally thai officials pointed out that china is interested in gaining access to burmese ports on the indian ocean with respect to us policy toward burma opinions expressed by officials and business leaders in thailand was that unilateral sanctions such as those imposed by the united states are not solving the problem they pointed out that the us pursues policies of engagement with north korea china and vietnam so why not with burma the basis for us policy toward burma stems from the military regimes repression and failure to move towards democratic government us sanctions toward burma include suspension of economic aid and withdrawal of burmas eligibility for trade and investment programs an arms embargo blocking assistance from international financial institutions downgrading us diplomatic representation to charge daffaires and visa restrictions on senior officials and their families in 1997 the united states tightened the sanctions to prohibit certain us transactions with and new investment by us persons there11 also each year since 1989 the us has certified that burma has cooperated insufficiently in counter narcotics efforts12 despite opposition to us sanctions however some officials indicated that lifting them unilaterally without some action by burma might send the

intersection of burma laos and thailand for production of opium and heroin the thai government estimated that in 1999 burma produced 1090 metric tons of opium laos 140 tons and thailand 6 tons the decline in thai production is considered to be one result of vigorous eradication and crop substitution program the current threat however is not from heroin or opium even though thailand still has an estimated 300000 heroin addicts but from methamphetamines referred to in thailand as yaa baa or the mad drug and as speed in the united states these drugs are produced primarily in plants across the border in the shan state in burma they are highly addictive relatively cheap13 and can easily be smuggled into the country in backpacks unlike most opium and heroin they are sold in thailand rather than transported further into international markets according to thai officials in 1999 an estimated 200 million tablets were smuggled into the country from burma of which about 40 million were seized

process from synthetic or natural ephedrine plus caffeine and other ingredients is simpler than that of heroin manufacturing laboratories can be smaller and more mobile thai officials asserted that the burmese government condones the illegal drug trade by the wa in exchange for cut of the profits14 the uwsa consider themselves nation they are sophisticated highly organized and armed allegedly with heavy machine guns mortars and even chinese made surfacetoair missiles procured possibly through cambodia15 evidence of the profitability of the drug trade can be seen in the new construction on the burmese side of the border of housing schools roads and hospitals16 the uwsa have an estimated 3500 to 4000 armed drug trafficking soldiers some estimate that the wa could beat the burmese army in confrontation so the rangoon government for now stays clear of the area illegal drugs from the wa are brought into thailand in caravans on trails since the actual border is in question in many areas traffickers can walk across it carrying backpacks they often are armed with ak47s and hand grenades they will shoot it out with the police since if they are caught the penalty is death at times

have been strengthened the caravans have moved south to the area around mae sot and around to the east to the border with cambodia with respect to suppression of the illegal drug trade in northern thailand the plan for northern thai authorities is to establish narcotics prevention line close to the burmese border engage in media psychological campaign to teach the dangers of narcotics suppress narcotics producers and businesses seek international cooperation with burma and laos and consolidate the thai organizations for managing the narcotics problem their first mission is to reduce imports of narcotics produced in neighboring countries the us drug enforcement administration has been in thailand for 30 years and has close working relationships with thai authorities the dea works with local law enforcement agencies by providing financial support intelligen ce information help in arrests and in overseeing their operations even though the metham phetamines are generally not transhipped to us markets the dea has helped in their suppression because the thai have helped in the antiheroinopium effort and because suppliers tend to produce both types of drugs the longterm threat from the uwsa transcends the immediate problem with illegal narcotics and refugees it is part of the geopolitical importance of the area the wa had been assisted by the chinese in their insurgency against rangoon rule chinese advisors engineers teachers and political advisors reportedly are working in the uwsa areas another complication is that links between the uwsas southern command and taiwan also are long standing and taiwan provides assistance to schools and associations in villages in northern thai provinces bordering the wa areas17 as for the close relationship between beijing and rangoon thai officials stated that chinese military assistance to burma was not significant concern they have heard complaints from burma about the poor quality of chinese weapons and feel that the burmese will not let foreign power dictate policy to them even if that power is china thai officials also noted that if the myanmar government gets too close to china india may react because india has opposed chinese influence in the indian ocean region displaced persons and refugees from burma as of april 2000 thailand was housing 102343 displaced persons from burma in ten temporary camps which all too often have turned into semipermanent settlements an estimated 700000 burmese live in thailand outside the established camps the country divides the displaced personsrefugees from burma into four groups 1 those who entered thailand before the burmese military took power they are legal refugees and most have thai citizenship 2 those displaced from the fighting in burma who are in temporary shelters controlled by the thai government they are not allowed to leave the camps 3 those displaced from the fighting buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30604crs14 ban mae temporary shelter thailandnot in the camps and who are illegally in the country 4 burmese or members of minority groups who have entered thailand seeking economic opportunity without proper documentation they also are illegal immigrants for the second category of persons in thai shelters because of the fighting in burma the policy of the thai government is to provide them with temporary shelter and humanitarian assistance and to facilitate their safe return to their homes in myanmar when the situation there returns to normal in march 1998 after several attacks from burma on two temporary shelters along the border some 10000 displaced persons were moved further inland in administering to the needs of the refugees the thai government is assisted by various international nongovernmental organizations ngos these include the burmese border consorti um medicins sans frontieres international rescue committee and handicap international as well as the united nations high commission on refugees educational efforts receive support from ngos such as international christelijk steunfonds catholic office for emergency relief and refugees taipei overseas peace service and zoa refugee care for asylum seekers the thai government first determines if they are entitled to refuge if so they are placed in temporary shelter deeper inside thai territory if they are economic migrants they are deported back to their country if the situation permits in reality many of the displaced persons simply find their way into thai society httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30604crs15 18 us

mae camp in tak province with 30758 persons primarily ethnic karens of christian and muslim backgrounds unlike the wa the karen are not known for dealing in narcotics despite being called temporary shelter it has existed for three decades located in valley bisected by small stream its thatched roofed huts house families that are provided minimal levels of food and care children abound in the camp as the high birth rate of 4 results in relatively large families and heavy schooling needs major problem with the camp is shortage of water during the dry season for fy1999 and 2000 the us state department is administering us appropriated funds related to the crisis in burma and along the thaiburmese border of 65 million of this 30 million is targeted for humanitarian activities administered by the us agency for international development and 35 million for democracy activities administered by the office for democracy human rights and labor18 most us funds used for the refugee camps are provided to ngos working there for thailand the temporary shelters as well as general refugee problem impose significant economic burdens on society particularly after the economy was hit by the financial crisis some thai villagers complain that the displaced persons receive more food and better medical treatment than thai citizens themselves in fact the medical clinics in some camps are also used by local patients for specialized medical treatments thai officials also point out that the problem of displaced persons fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30604crs16 burma follows upon flood of refuges from vietnam cambodia and laos during the vietnam war and turmoil that has continued for decades in southeast asia with burma moreover the situation appears particularly bleak because thailand maintains policy of not compelling displaced persons to return to burma until it is safe to do so at this point that is not possible since the rangoon government claims most of the displaced persons are not burmese citizens the flow of displaced persons also has brought health problems communicable diseases rise in crime and the spread of internal burmese political unrest to thailand among the health problems have been rise in malaria tuberculosis and encephalitis they also have placed an extra burden on social welfare services the illegal refugees also are accused of engaging in drug trafficking smuggling and theft as for political unrest in october 1999 burmese student activists seized the myanmar embassy in bangkok which led to rangoon closing its land and sea borders with thailand after what it considered to be lenient treatment by thailand of the students involved and in january 2000 another group of students and dissidents took over the ratchaburi hospital near bangkok both incidents were viewed unfavorably by the thai public the thai government has expressed the need to balance its international responsibilities with respect to burma with its domestic needs the displaced persons from burma illegally working in the thai economy also have become an issue for the thai government in the tak province alone officials estimate that about 30000 illegal refugees work in the industrial sector another 30000 work in agriculture the thai government has allowed some of the workers to remain temporarily but as their temporary work permits expire the government has been powerless to do much about them the deadline for them to leave has already been extended once and may be extended again in 2000 essentially they have place else to go that is the crux of the problem for most of the refugees from burmahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30604crs17 appendix table 1 top 25 us imports from thailand in 1999 by standard industrial classification dollars sic commodity
