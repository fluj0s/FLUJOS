federal government from acting as third party by negotiating the prices that the drugs plans would pay to pharmaceutical manufacturers both the new speaker of the house and new senate majority leader

wish to provide guidance on how it expects prices to be negotiated in order to clarify and inform the debate this report prov ides an overview of the pharmaceutical pricing policies used by the department of veterans affairs v and medicaidthe largest federal purchasers of prescription drugs other than medicare the veterans health administration vha operates the nations largest integrated direct health care delivery system unlike medicare which operates as an insurer by reimbursing beneficiaries for the cost of medical care provided by doctors and other providers in private practice as well as by private and public hospitals vha provides care directly to veterans largely in v clinics and v hospitals currently v utilizes four contracting mechanisms to acquire its pharmaceutical supplies 1 the federal supply schedule fss 2 performance based incentive agreements 3 pricing under the veterans health care act of 1992 and 4 national standardization contracts medicaid state administered program that operates under broad federal rules directly controls drug prices by putting federal ceiling on reimbursements for drug products available from multiple sources and by requiring drug manufacturers to pay rebates to states for drugs purchased on behalf of medicaid enrollees states further control overall drug costs through multiple methods including using formularies and preferred drug lists requiring that medicaid enrollees make copayments and requiring generic substitution several options exist for affecting outofpocket and overall prescription drug costs including 1 establishing federal price ceiling for medicare like medicaid 2 mandating that manufacturers provide larger rebates to part d plans like medicaid or 3 establishing medicare pharmacy

motivating factors for congress to create medicare part d in the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 was seniors rising outofpocket drug costs prior to mma 38 of medicare beneficiaries did not have drug insurance coverage1 people without sufficient drug insurance were paying drug prices that were 15 higher on average than the prices paid by insurance companies2 some medicare beneficiaries who did not have drug insurance coverage coped with these higher prices by filling fewer of their prescriptions and taking medications less frequently than their doctors recommended3 medicare part d provides voluntary insurance coverage of drugs for beneficiaries albeit at high price to the federal government4 the federal cost of part d benefits is estimated to be 447 billion in 20075 medicare part d was designed to take advantage of market competition in accordance with market competition principles the drug plans that administer the drug benefit are corporations who may rely on rebate negotiation and pricevolume discounts as way to affect prices provision in the mma termed the noninterference provision prevents the federal government from being third party in drug price negotiations between the part d drug plans and pharmaceutical manufacturers both the new speaker of the house and new senate majority leader have expressed their support for repealing this noninterference provision and regard it as priority for consideration in the 110th congress6 furthermore one poll indicates that about 85 of americans also seem to support repealing the provision and allowing the government to negotiate prices7 1 for more statistics on drug coverage in the medicare population from 19961999 see mary laschober michelle kitchman et trends in medicare

federal purchasers of prescription drugs other than medicare this report first provides brief background of the current us pharmaceutical pricing for medicare and the implications of this policy the report then discusses the types of pricing policies used by the v and medicaid to stem the rise in drug expenditures the report concludes by discussing the implications of negotiating drug prices and

are the most frequently used incentive in drug price negotiations importantly other carrots and sticks may be available to drug price negotiators and an open formulary does not necessarily preclude price negotiation formulary is set of drugs for which part d drug plan or other health insurer has agreed to pay portion of the costs the formulary may also specify contingencies for payment 8 drug pricing policies do not dictate formularies drug pricing policy may have bearing on which drugs will or will not be included in formulary adopting drug pricing policy from medicaid the v or even another country does not imply that the formulary is also adopted in contrast knowing the extent to which formulary will include or exclude pharmaceuticals may help to determine which drug pricing policies would make the most sense for example if formulary was to include every drug on the mark et competitive bidding process would not be the most sensible drug pricing policy since those policies generally involve accepting the best bid and rejecting the other bidders in contrast competitive bidding process may be reasonable option for formulary that only includes one drug in each drug class 9 however simply having competitive bidding process for pharmaceutical pricing does not provide any information about the inclusiveness of the formulary because the resulting formulary may include one two or even five drugs in each drug class g15g142g141g146g140g138g155g142g561g18g145g138g155g150g138g140g142g158g157g146g140g138g149g561g18g155g146g140g146g151g144g561 under current law prescription

have contracts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to provide prescription drug coverage to medicare beneficiaries individually and with great deal of flexibility the plans construct benefit packages including the formulary deductible copayments and utilization management tools arrange network of pharmacies to dispense the drugs and negotiate prices andor rebates with the pharmaceutical manufacturers11 enrollees are required to make copayments which is the entire price if the drug is not covered12 and pay premiums that may be affected by the negotiated prices ie the lower the prices paid by the plan the lower the amounts the plan must charge in premiums beneficiaries satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their drug plan is likely to be related to the amount they pay for drugs among other factors g15g142g141g146g140g138g155g142g561g8g152g155g150g158g149g138g155g146g142g156g561 part d plans are required to include two drugs in each therapeutic class except if only one drug is available the cms requires coverage of all or substantially all drugs for some mental illnesses including antidepressants antipsychotics and anticonvulsants anticancer drugs immunosuppressants and hivaids drugs are also incl uded in the all or substantially all list of formulary drug classes plans can neither ch ange their formularies wi thout cms approval nor drop coverage for persons currently using the drug except at the beginning of the calendar year these minimum requirements do not imply that bene ficiaries have access to every drug or its chemical equivalent that they may be prescrib ed for example the mma did not require part d plans to cover the costs of any drugs in the doughnut holethe common term for beneficiaries drug expenditures between 2400 and 5451 in 2007 while few plans are offering coverage in the doughnut hole in 2007 most of this coverage is for generic drugs only 13 moreover any system that grants patients the freedom to choose their own plan will have some inefficiencies namely that patients may not select the best plan for their needs nonetheless polls indicate that most patients are satisfied with their drug plans14 10 part b also covers the cost of some drugs for more information on part b drugs see crs report rl31419 medicare payments for covered part b prescription drugs by jennifer osullivan 11 for

changing the way medicare drugs are priced is the noninterference provision in mma specifically this provision forbids the secretary of health and human services hhs from negotiating the price of prescription drugs on behalf of medicare beneficiaries15 the mma states in order to promote competition under this part and in carrying out this part the secretary1 may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and pdp sponsors an d 2 may not require particular formulary to institute price structure for the reimbursement of covered part d drugs 16 the conference report adds that conferees expect pdps to negotiate price concessions directly with manufacturers17 the pharmaceutical pricing policies discussed later in this report could not be implemented in the medicare program without allowing the secretary of hhs or some other authority to negotiate with the pharmaceutical manufacturers for part d drugs repealing the noninterference clause may lead to changing the drug pricing policy for medicare if congress repeals the provision and allows the secretary of hhs to negotiate drug prices it may also wish to provide some guidance as to what type of drug pricing policy they want the secretary of hhs to negotiate and what the goals of such pricing policy would be since the number of different drug pricing policies is innumerate examining policies that have been applied in other settings may help in exploring the options in theory the federal government may be able to leverage its market share to negotiate lower prices the extent to which the federal government could negotiate lower prices than the part d drug plans is unknown in fact some argue that market powers have already achieved lower prices18 without more knowledge about the extent to which prices could be lowered it is impossible to predict whether new pricing policy would lead to lower costs for medicare beneficiaries the federal government or other us consumers g18g152g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g20g146g153g153g149g142g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 importantly any new drug pricing policy for medicare may have ripple effects on manufacturers research and development of new pharmaceuticals part d drug plans role and ability to compete pharmacies profits as well as other us consum ers the size of these ripples will depend upon the type of pricing policy selected and the extent to which the federal government negotiates 15 in october 2001 as the anthrax attack was unfolding on capitol hill thensecretary of health and human services hhs tommy thompson sought to purchase large amount of the preferred antibiotic ciprofloxacin cipro from the manufacturer bayer corporation at reduced price thompson made headlines with his negotiating tactics including threat to override the drugs patent the stra tegic national stockpile the hhs program to assure treatments for victims of bioterrorism and other emerging health threats was established following an appropriation in fy1999 and flowed from the secretarys general authorities to control disease explicit statutory authority for the stockpile was established in 2002 pl 107188 the authority of the secretary to negotiate prices when procuring for the stockpile while not explicit in law is implicit and derives from his general authority to enter into contracts for goods and services under federal programs 16 section 1860d11i of the social security act 17 for more information see hrept 108391 p 461 18 for more information see the january 10 2007 letter from the

federal government to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs under the medicare part d program considerable attention has been paid to the v pharmaceutical procurement model28 before discussing v as pharmacy procurement system it is essential to understand that the veterans health care system is an integrated closed system where physicians and other clinical staf f are employees of the v unlike medicare which administers medical care through the private sector the v provides care directly to veterans the v purchases its pharmaceutical needs directly from manufacturers and provides prescription medications to veterans through its pharmacies and its own consolidated mail outpatient pharmacy cmop network this closed system contributes towards successfully implementing national formulary which does not exist in medicare or medicaid the section below discusses the v s contracting techniques used to purchase pharmaceuticals that is followed by an overview of v as formulary management process currently the v utilizes four contracting mechanisms to acquire its pharmaceutical supplies 1 the federal supply schedule fss 2 performancebased incentive agreements or blanket 25 costsharing amounts are those specified for standard coverage specific copayments may vary by enrollee and part d drug plan 26 va provides full prescription drug benefit including both formulary and nonformulary drugs for description of priority groups see crs report rl33409 veterans medical care fy2007 appropriations by sidath viranga panangala 27 amounts are for 2005 as of march of 2006 states have additional options for cost sharing for prescription drugs that certain medicaid beneficiaries can be charged those with income above 100 of poverty can have higher copays for drugs as long as total aggregate cost sharing for all services do not exceed 5 of family income and as long as the copayment amounts do not exceed between 10 and 20 of the cost of the drug depending on family income

in response congress enacted the veterans health care act of 1992 pl 102585 section 603 of this act required pharmaceutical companies to list covered drugs on the fss as condition of continued participation in the medicaid program 36 it also required them to roll back price increases and created statutorily mandated ceiling prices for sales to the four largest federal purchasers of

agencies each covered drug at more than 76 of the nonfederal average manufacturers price nonfamp minus any additional discounts as determined each year39 furthermore under current law when the drug manufacturer raises the price of drug faster than the rate of inflation based on the consumer price index cpi then the manufacturer must offer an additional discount in an amount that will ensure that

pharmaceuticals depending on what drug is purchased other agencies such as dod phs and the bureau of prisons can participate in these contracts the department seeks competitive bids from manufacturers for products that are therapeutically equivalent within specific drug classes and contracts with those manufacturers whose products it believes provide the best value based on medical effectiveness safety and price in exchange for including their products on the v as national formulary and committing to use products throughout the v health care system 42 these contracts are also known as committed use contracts because the v commits to use specific drug instead of another therapeutically interchangeable drug and to guarantee drug companies high volume of use in exchange for lower prices these are oneyear contracts with the option to renegotiate the contract in fy2005 the v purchased 446 million worth of pharmaceuticals through national contracts according to the v national

because it has direct bearing on the purchasing mechanisms prior to 1995 the v s 156 medical centers managed their pharmaceutical needs through individual fo rmularies the departments drug product and management division based in hines illinois managed and monitored drug usage and purchasing for those facilities but had utilization oversight responsibilities43 in september 1995 the v established pharmacy benefit management pbm health care strategic group tasked with establishing national formulary managing pharmaceutical costs and overseeing pharmacologic guideline development for common diseases within the v health care system44 in november 1995 as part of its reform efforts the v created nationwide system of veterans integrated service networks visns consisting of 22 geographically defined networks and each entity was instructed to create formulary 45 to develop their formularies each visn generally combined their medical center formularies and on april 30 1996 visn formularies became effective to ensure that all veterans have access to pharmaceuticalsno matter where they live in the usthe v established national formulary by combining the core of drugs common in the visn formularies the national formulary t ook effect on june 1 1997 the standardization helped the v lower its prescription drug costs through bulk purchases from system standpoint this standardization not only defined the core national pharmacy benefits package but also provided leverage for bulk purchasing and wi th that contracting within drug classes when appropriate46 according to the v the overall strategy of creating formulary process is to create comprehensive pharmaceutical benefit offered to all v patients seeking care in the v v as pbm continuously reviews formulary decisions to ensure that patients achieve the desired outcomes the v as formulary management process involves the v medical advisory panel map the visn formulary leaders committee v s clinical subject matter experts and the v pbm staff the map consists of 12 fieldbased practicing physicians one dod physician and six clinical pharmacists the pbm staffs role is facilitative except for clinical subject matter specialists who provide input when selecting drugs based on i nput from the abovementioned stakeholders v s pbm reviews pharmaceutical purchases and identifies highusage pharmaceutical items the team

physician and patient choice of drugs 48 furthermore some reports have stated that the drugs used in the v health system are older than the drugs used in the rest of the us health care system 49 however in previous study the national academy of sciences found that the v national formulary was not overly restrictive and the limited available evidence suggests that it has probably meaningfully reduced drug expenditures without demonstrable adverse effects on quality50 moreover the v has provided its clinicians guidelines on prescribing nonformulary drugs to veterans when it is medically

approving expeditiously the use of nonformulary drugs by local physicians in general nonformulary requests are reviewed and the requester is notified of the decision within 96 hours of the receipt of

including prescription drugs are set by the states unlike many other medicaid items and services however prescription drug prices are subject to upper limits established in federal law that restrict the amount of federal matching payments available for those products in addition federal law also requires manufacturers whose drugs are made available to medicaid beneficiaries to pay rebates to states the medicaid rebates were established to achieve best price policybased on the philosophy that medicaid as health coverage program of last resort should have access to the lowest prices offered to other drug purchasers in the market in addition states can and do aggressively negotiate for lower medicaid drug prices many states administer their own upper limit payment formulas generally intended to keep prices below the federal upper limits many states also have negotiated supplemental rebates over and above those required under federal law these rebates are often related to the state formularies for example under floridas medicaid supplemental rebate program manufacturers that agree to pay the supplemental rebates will have their products included on the states list of preferred drugs all others are subject to prior authorization 53 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g23g153g153g142g155g561g14g146g150g146g157g156g561 medicaids federal upper payment ful levels are calculated consistent with statutory formula and based on data submitted by pharmaceutical manufacturers the fuls apply separately to multiple source and to all other drugs and are applied in the aggregate to each states spending for drugs the fuls for multiple source drugs fined to include any drug for which there is at least one other drug sold and marketed during the period that is rated as therapeutically equivalent and bioequivalent are calculated by the cms and are periodically published in the state medicaid manual for these multiple source drugs the ful beginning january 1 2007 is equal to 250 of the average manufacturer price amp for the product computed without regard to prompt pay discounts the amp is price reported to cms by manufacturers and is calculated to be the average price at which manufacturers sell drug product to wholesalers each state must assure the secretary that its medi caid spending for multiple source drugs is in accordance with the upper limits plus reasonable dispensing fees the effect of the ful requirement is that when lowercost generic equivalent exists for brandname drug state can only claim federal matching share for reimbursement level that is tied to the generic price even if the brandname drug is actually furnished the state has incentives therefore to establish policies to encourage the substitution of lowercost generic equivalents for the brandname counterparts the upper limit for multiple source drugs does not apply if physician provides handwritten certification on the prescription that specific brand is medically

following groups the drug falls into the first group includes single source drugs generally those still under patent and innovator multiple source drugs drugs originally marketed under patent or original new drug application nda but for which generic competition now exists rebates fo r the drugs in the first group are equal to the greater of 151 of the amp and the difference between the amp and the best price additional rebates are required if the weighted average prices for all of given manufacturers single source and innovator multiple source drugs rise faster than inflation as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers the second class includes all other noninnovator multiple source drugs generics rebates for noninnovator multiple source drugs are equal to

programs however federal rules impede states from establishing restrictive formularies first federal rebate policies essentially ensure that all drugs sold by manufacturer are made available to medicaid beneficiaries if the manufacturer participates in the rebate program in addition states are required to co ver any nonformulary drug with the exception of drugs in 10 specific categories that is specifically requested and approved in advance through defined process generally referred to as prior authorization the 10 categories of drugs that states are allowed to exclude from coverage include drugs used to treat anorexia weight loss or weight gain b to promote fertility c for cosmetic purposes or hair growth d for the relief of coughs and colds for smoking cessation and f prescription vitamins and mineral products except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations g nonprescription drugs h barbiturates i benzodiazepines and j drugs requiring tests or monitoring that

program set of ceiling prices may be sufficient to achieve such an objective if on the other hand the primary purpose of such actions would be to lower overall costs while minimizing the number of parties who are negatively affected by policy then mandated rebates could be appropriate however none of those approaches directly impact the premiums drug plans might charge or copayments that beneficiaries face at the pharmacy rather indirect effects are possible if congress primary objective is to impact those amounts an explicit policy targeted at cost sharing or premiums could ensure those objectives are met the following section identifies few alternative approaches that congress may consider

drug prices might translate into lower overall costs is through medicare ceiling price 55 ceiling prices could be established to resemble medicaids federal upper limits or the federal supply schedule prices there are however both administrative and other complications to establishing such system without combining such policy with national medicare formularyand the threat of excluding high priced drugs from such formulary cms may not be able to negotiate adequately favorable ceiling prices also ceiling price policy does not necessarily translate into lower costs at the pharmacy counter for beneficiaries nor does it translate into lower purchasing prices for pharmacies other policies could be combined with ceiling prices to ensure lower prices for beneficiaries or pharmacies finally ceiling prices that reduce reimbursements significantly could have indirect effects on beneficiary access to future innovative drug products and even economic impacts on other payers and providers for example manufacturers may lose profits which may adversely affect pharmaceutical research and development as well as increase costs for nonmedicare consumers pharmaceutical manufacturers have argued that lower profits impede their ability to research and develop new disease treatments 56 this argument has been both supported and refuted by many academics57 the manufacturers may also choose to recoup the lost profits by increasing the drug prices for other consumers such policy would need to be carefully crafted to minimize unintended consequences

another way of lowering outofpocket payments for beneficiaries might be to mandate larger rebates from manufacturers to part d drug plans this system could resemble medicaids rebate system larger rebates would lower part d drug plans net costs of drugs for beneficiaries assuming market competition works in the part d program lower net costs could be passed onto beneficiaries in the form of lower premiums nd perhaps also lower copayments alternatively manufacturers could provide these rebates directly to the cms if market competition does not 55 for more information on price ceilings see

new medicare pharmacy purchasing system would be another option that might help translate lower manufacturer drug prices for medicare part d into lower outofpocket and overall costs for beneficiaries one example of such system could resemble the v s mailorder pharmacy system the new medicare pharmacy purchasing system could negotiate drug prices and purchase drugs from manufacturers or wholesalers and then distribute the drugs and receive payment from beneficiaries this approach is potentially the most administratively burdensome of the options since it would require developing medicare pharmacy dist ribution system pharmacists may experience increased administrative costs if they were to be required to track and purchase drugs separately for their medicare customers since pharmacists rarely track drugs by payer under the current system some of the burden could be alleviat ed through heavy use of mailorder system if mailorder system is established pharmacists and possibly wholesalers could lose profits because they would lose medicare business the part d plans might have considerably reduced role in the new system as with any price reduction manufacturers profits from medicare might be reduced and they may choose to recoup lost profits by increasing drug prices to other consumers finally complete mailorder system is not realistic option because many beneficiaries may prefer to talk to their pharmacist directly and may not wish to participate in mailorder program
