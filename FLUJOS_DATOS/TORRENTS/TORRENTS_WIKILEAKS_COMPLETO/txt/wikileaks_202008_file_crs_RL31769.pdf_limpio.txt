adoption summary united states citizens adopt more childre n from abroad than the citizens of all other countries combined and the number of foreign children adopted annually by us citizens has more than doubled in the last decade from 8333 to 22884 over the previous five years the largest num ber of children adopted have come from china 28690 followed by russi 24561 and guatemala 10938 under statute international adoption is twostep process first the parents eligibility to adopt must be verified and then once the child is identified and the parents have complied with the laws of the sending country the adoptive parents apply for visa for the child so that the child can legally immigrate to the united states the application for the visa triggers an investigation into the childs background to confirm that the child has not been bought or stolen and meets the definition of orphan under the immigra tion and nationality act ina the department of homeland securitys bureau of citizenship and immigration services uscis verifies the eligibility to adopt while the department of state dos processes the visa application for the chil d once the prospective parents have been deemed eligible to adopt uscis policy stat they have 18 months to complete the adoption if the adoption is not completed in that time the prospective parents must restart the application process in 2000 the senate approve d the ratification of the hague convention on protection of children and cooperation in respect of intercountry adoption the convention and congress enacted the in ternational adoption act of 2000 iaa which is the implementing legislation for the convention the purpose of the convention is to establish uniformity in the standards and procedures for international adoption and to achieve this goal th legislation mandates the establishment of central adoption authority in dos and an adoption accreditation program the iaa requires that the childs eligibility to immigrate be determined before adoption or placement for adoption in countries party to the convention this is important as there are in stances when child has been adopted in the home country by us citizen parents and yet is unabl to immigrate to the united states because the child does not meet the definition of an orphan under the ina the convention seeks to alleviate some of the perceived abuses of the international adoption system abuses range from charging exorbitant fees by facilitators in some countries to cases of kidnaping and baby selling there have also been cases where deception is used to get parents to relinquish their children for example parents may turn over their children to an orphanage for what they assume is limited time period and when they return to claim their child the child has been adopted internationally proposed regulations to implement the iaa were released on september 15 2003 but dos has not released the final regulations due to questions about the integrity of adoptions in cambodia in december 2001 moratorium was issued by uscis on processing adoptions from that country in addition romania has susp ended international adoptions except for those by the

act of 2000 the international adoption act of 20009 iaa provides the domestic legislation to implement the convention the senate approved ratification of the convention on september 20 2000 the same day that it passed the iaa however the united states has not form ally ratified the convention10 the proposed rule on the implementation of the iaa was published in the federal register on september 15 200311 and the comment period ended on december 15 2003 the final regulations on the iaa have not been published the iaa requires the department of state through the secretary of state to serve as the central adoption authority of the united states and outlines responsibilities of the secretary incl uding liaison information exchange accreditation and approval and other coordination ac tivities relating to the convention the iaa requires the attorney general to be respons ible for the filing of applications by prospective adoptive pare nts to the central authority the act also requires annual reports from the secret ary to specified congressional committees describing activities of the central authority during the previous year in addition the law requires the cer tification of indi viduals and entities involved in international adoptions it also amended the i mmigration and nationality act to include 1 under its definition of child child adopted through the convention and 2 under those eligible for approval to immigrate child for whom the secretary has certified that us c itizen has effected final adoption under the rules of the convention the iaa require s that the childs eligibility to immigrate to the united states be determined befo re adoption or placement for adoption from countries party to the convention this is important as there are instances when child has been adopted in the home country by us citizen parents and yet is unable to immigrate to the united states because the child does not meet the definition of an orphan under the ina or it can not be proven that the child meets the definition thus under the laws of the sending country the parents are legally responsible for the child but the child is unable to legally immigrate to the united states finally the iaa authorizes the attorney general to consider whether there is petition pending to confer immigrant status on one or both of such natural parents when determining whether the purpose of particular adoption under the act is to form bona fide pare ntchild relationship in response to concerns about the lack of regulation of in ternational adoption agencies the iaa requires

foreign nationals for example recently romania stopped allowing foreign adoptions for fear of losing generation also in the 1980s guatemala rest ricted foreign adoptions due to rumors that adopted guatemalan children were being killed for their organsconnection with any country that is part to the convention there is uniformity in state licensing of adoption agencies and most states lack specific standards covering internationa l adoptions it is possible fo r agencies and individuals to provide international adoption services without being licensed in any state since the provider may be located overseas in addition it is difficult to hold adoption agencies and individuals acc ountable if problems arise b ecause many of the agencies are located in states other than where the adopting parents reside moreover agencies cannot be held responsible for th actions of their agents and facilitators abroad who may be untrained or unlicenced12 additionally international adoption has developed into lucrative and largely unregulated business the expense of adopting child can range from few thousand dollars to more than 3000013 some are concerned that although there are legitimate expenses associated with adoptions that the large expenses may give the appearance of child trafficking14 current law and procedure international adoption begins essentially as legal matter between private individuals and foreign court the foreign country must permit adoptions by foreign nationals and the prospective pare nts must comply with the adoption rules of that country15 us authorities cannot intervene on behalf of prospective parents with the courts in the country where th adoption takes place united states government agency is directly involved in the adoption process in another country or locates children to be adopted nonethel ess the perspective parents must meet the us legal requirements as defined in the immigration and nationality act ina to bring child adopted abroad into the unite d states under us law petitioning for an orphan requires two distinctive determinations 1 the ability of the prospective adoptive parents to care for the child and 2 whether the child

if the home study is done abroa d the home study preparer must be licensed in any state in the united states or by the fo reign country uscis will not accept home study that is more than six months

this definition parents cannot release the child to specific person for adoption as this would not meet the definition of abandonment once the child has been irrevocably released by the natural

there is dhs office in the country this investigation may cau delays in the adjudication of the case not all children adopted abroad fit the definition of orphan under the ina24 the dhs or consular office must complete th report on overseas orphan investigation i604 which consists of review of the facts and documents to verify that the child qualifies as an orphan the doc umentation that is

there is nothing in statute that specifies the length of validity of an advanced processing petition the time limit was established in regulation by uscis32 some contend that the 18month time limit is too short since finding child to adopt and going through the adoption process may take longer than 18 months this has especially been problem with people adopting from china since processing in chinas centralized adoption system can take longer than 18 months however uscis contends that time limit is necessary to protect both the adoptive child and the parents and that 18 months is long time during which the circumstances of the adoptive parents could change33 uscis officials also state that china is the only country in which it tends to take longer than 18 months for the adoption to be completed and that as of now there are plans to change the policy34 others argue that since china is the primary sending country of children for adoption and appr oximately onefourth of international
