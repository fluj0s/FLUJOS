has been redirected to process of considering numerous individual measures dealing with issues included in the technical assistance trade promotion and anticorruption act of 2000 after the foreign relations committee reported s 2382 in early april the bill was referred to the banking committee and further senate debate on the broader legislation stalled subsequently however congress has considered and in few cases enacted as separate bills several of the major issues initially incorporated in the omnibus foreign aid authorization legislation in august president clinton signed an hivaids authorization measure hr 3519 pl 106 264 and in early october he approved broad security assistance authorizing legislation hr 4919 pl 106280 congress cleared on october 6 bill the president

initiatives are major components of s 2382 new legislation on poor country debt relief and international financial institution accountability has been introduced s 3129 but the issue remains under negotiation between congressional sponsors and the administration introduction for one of the few times during the past 15 years legislation was reported in the senate authorizing broad portions of us foreign assistance programs s 2382 or the technical assistance trade promotion and anticorruption act of 2000 as reported by the senate foreign relations committee on april 7 selectively authorizes range of foreign aid activities updates permanent foreign assistance laws expands several aid initia tives such as those to combat the spread of hivaids and tuberculosis launches new initiatives and repeals obsole legislation s 2382 incorporates number of provisions previously approved by the senate or some that have been enacted annually within appropriation bills but never in permanent statute although s 2382 is not comprehensive foreign assistance authorization bill addre ssing each aid program it represents the first broad foreign aid measurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30530crs2 reported by the senate foreign relations committee since 1995 and would be the first of this type of legislation debated by the full senate in decade until the mid1980s congress typically would consider two comprehensive foreign assistance bills each year largely under the jurisdiction of the house international relations and senate foreign relations committees the first piece of legislation would authorize us economic and militar aid programs setting the maximum amount that could be spent on various activities establishing congressional funding and policy priorities mainly by amending the foreign assistance act of 1961 and the arms export control act restricting executive branch management of aid programs in selected areas and launching new assistance initiatives these foreign aid authorization bills which were sometimes enacted annually and sometimes biennially often allowed congress to debate broader policy issues beyond aid matters and became important vehicles for congressional influence over executive foreign policy making in general following enactment of these authorizing measures congress would also approve an annual bill appropriating funds for foreign assistance programs although this represented the traditional foreign aid legislative process authorization measures became increasingly difficult to enact due to sharp policy differences between congress and the president first during the vietnam war and later regarding us central america policy the executive branch objected strongly to aid restrictions and conditions imposed by congress through authorization bills believing that they eroded the presidents ability to effectively manage foreign policy matters the last comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill signed into law came in 1985 the international security and development cooperation act of 1985 since then the house and senate individually have passed authorizing measures on several occasions but the bills have either not been taken up by the other body or have died in the face of presidential veto threat in 1994 the clinton administration submitted draft legislation proposing to substantially rewrite us foreign aid laws but congress did not act on the initiative in the absence of foreign aid authorizing legisl ation congress has approved funding levels and influenced policy decisions through annual enactment of the foreign operations appropriations bill like the authorization measures these bills frequently have generated controversy between the two branches resulting in some years in presidential veto or funding through continuing resolution but ultimately each year congress has enacted some type of foreign aid appropriations bill that has become the major vehicle through which lawm akers oversee and influence us foreign aid programs and foreign policy more generally after the senate banking committee sought referral of s 2382 all action on the bill stopped when the legislation became embroiled in dispute regarding provisions authorizing us participation in the heavily indebted poor country debt hipc initiative and world bankimf reforms in an effort to continue debate on specific elements of s 2382 the foreign relations committee marked up and reported several individual bills addressing the same issues as included in the omnibus foreign aid authorization measure two those dealing with hivaids programs and security assistance have been enacted into law while microenterprise bill is awaiting the presidents signature bills recommending similar positions to those

table 2 funding for each program included in s 2382 is authorized at levels requested by the administration or more within the security assistance accounts s 2382 earmarks specific amounts for certain high priority recipients including israel egypt greece turkey and new nato members major policy issues addressed in s 2382 trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 20001 the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 title i subtitle c most closely reflects the intent of the food and medicine for the world act measure introduced in several forms in the first session of the 106th congress and nearly enacted in last years agriculture appropriations bill2 the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 prohibits the president from restricting or denying other countries access to us agricultural commodities agricultural assistance medicine and medicinerelated devices for foreign policy or national security reasons unless he justifies such restrictions to congress and congress enacts joint resolution supporting the sanction it further requires that existing sanctions regimes be adjusted to allow for most agricultural and medical commerce with the sanctioned country the president retains the authority to restrict food assistance programs or the availability of agricultural commodities medicine or medical devices under current law in some cases and may also prohibit agricultural and medicine transactions in times of war or armed conflict any sanction s imposed to restrict access to us agricultural commodities or medicine however would terminate two years after their imposition unless the president once again justified their continuance and congress enacted joint resolution supporting the policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30530crs6 3 commercial transactions are restricted when country is placed on the terrorist list required by section 6j of the export administration act 50 usc app 2405

legislation revised version of the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 was agreed to by housesenate conferees as part of the fy2001 agriculture appropriations hr 4461 differences between the conference agreement and s 2382 center on cuba the agriculture appropriations provision bars any us private financing of food or medical sales to cuba and codifies existing travel bans to cubato some extent the clinton administration has already minimized the impact passage of such bill would have in april 1999 the president announced that the united states would exempt commercial sales of agricultural commodities and medicine from future unilateral sanctions imposed by the executive branch the president directed the secretary of the treasury to issue new regulations that would allow commercial food and medical exports to libya iran and sudan three states previously severely restricted from such transactions because they are on the state departments list of countries that support acts of international terrorism3 current us policy continues to restrict to varying degrees such exports to cuba iraq and north korea although the united states provides food and medicine to these three countr ies through other means such as unmandated oilforfood relief for iraq world food program humanitarian assistance to north korea and humanitarian donations to cuba congressio nal opinion has been uniformly positive on the matter of making agricultural commodities and medicine universally available except when the policy is applied to countries found to be supporters of acts of international terrorism last years efforts to enact the food and medicine for the world act foundered on the notion that some day cuba could be removed from the terrorist list and thus become eligible for us commodities assistance and contracts this measure provides for the continued use of the secretary of states authority to restrict access to us foreign assistance export assistance credits and credit guarantees under the foreign assistance act of 1961 agricultural commodities and medicine may otherwise be made available to terrorist state by way of oneyear licenses and without benefit of federal financing how countries are put on or removed from the state departments terrorist list and what food or medicine is available to those countries while on the terrorist list are likely to be key contentious issues when this measure is considered on the senate floorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30530crs7 population assistance certification population aid and abortionrelated restrictions have been among the most controversial foreign aid policy issues since the supreme courts 1973 roe v wade decision since 1973 us permanent law has prohibited federal funds from being used to perform abortions involuntary sterilizations or related biomedical research in developing nations at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan administration broadened this restriction by requiring foreign nongovernmental and international organizations receiving us family planning grants to certify that they did not engage in the performance or promotion of abortions even if ussupplied funds were involved despite congressional attempts to overturn this policy known as mexico city restrictions these executive directives continued until early 1993 when the clinton administration lifted the mexico city policy since 1995 when the majority in congress changed lawmakers have attempted to restore the mexico city restrictions last year president clinton reluctantly agreed to accept modified mexico city conditions when congress linked the issue with approval of arrears payments the white house will oppose efforts to renew these restrictions when they expire at the end of fy2000 for more information see crs issue brief ib86026 population assistance and family planning programs issues for congress provisions in s 2382 section 205 would not affect the current controversy over whether to extend the revised mexico city restrictions that expire at the end of fy2000 but instead would add further conditions to the 1973 ban on the use of us funds for performing abortions and other related activities as part of international family planning programs section 205 would require the usaid administrator to certify annually that any organization about to receive us population aid funds had not violated abortion involuntary sterilization and biomedical research restrictions under permanent law first enacted in 1973 if any organization violated these conditions the group would be barred for ten years from receiving any us foreign aid funds authorized under the foreign assistance act of 1961 under current policy usai d using discretionary authority would most likely take remedial action or suspend grants to any organization it found to be in violation of the abortionrelated restrictions there is agency policy however regarding how this might affect an organizations eligibility for other nonpopulation foreign aid grants nor is there specified penalty like that imposed by section 205 again usaid administrators would make determinations on casebycase basis although it could be expected that the relationship between the agency and an offending organization concerning future grants would be strained the administration as well as family planning organizations and prochoice proponents will oppose these additional restrictions in s 2382 on the grounds that they undermine usaid discretionary authority impose excessive administrative burdens on agency officials and represent yet another although perhaps symbolic attack on international family planning programs sudan peace act for almost four decades sudan has been the scene of intermittent conflict an estimated two million people have died from warrelated causes and famine in southern sudan while millions more have been displaced the sudanese conflict africas longestrunning civil war shows sign of ending the sources of the conflict are deep and complicated religion is major factor because of the islamichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30530crs8 fundamentalist agenda of the current government dominated by the mostly muslimarab north southerners who are christian and animist reject the islamization of the country and favor secular arrangemen t social and economic disparities are also major contributing factors to the sudanese conflict for over decade the united states has been at the forefront in providing humanitarian assistance to millions of sudanese including more than 231 million in fiscal year 1999 congress has been actively engaged on sudan and has passed number of resolutions over the years in 1999 congress gave the clinton administration legislative authority to provide food to opposition forces in sudan in february 2000 the clinton administration informed congressional leaders that it has not taken decision to use or reject the authority s 2382 title ii subtitle c incorporates the sudan peace act legislation passed unanimously in the senate on novembe r 11 1999 calling for viable comprehensive and internationallysponsored negotiations to end the 17year civil war in sudan the act supports the intergovernmental authority for development igadsponsored peace process and urges the clinton administration to provide diplomatic and financial support to igad the bill condemns the government of sudan for human rights violations including slavery and for restricting the delivery of food to affected areas in southern sudan the sudan peace act calls for reforms of operation lifeline sudan ols encourages the clinton administration to provide more assistance to nonols non governmental organizations and requests contingency plans for delivery of humanitarian assistance outside the ols system the initiative allocates 16 million for fiscal years 20002003 for the administrations sudan transition assistance for rehabilitation star and provides additional authority to the president to administer the program the legislation also calls for report on options or plans for nonlethal assistance for opposition groups in sudan assistance to

immense toll in terms of human suffering and death in coming years hivaids is expected to have serious economic political and security consequences as well and there is concern that problems on the scale africa is facing could eventually occur in india china or elsewhere several aidsrelated bills have been introduced since january 2000 and subtitle d of title ii reflects provisions in these bills although in contrast to some it does not provide multiyear spending authorizations for further information see crs issue brief ib10050 aids in africa subtitle d includes provisions aimed at reducing mothertochild transmission of aids promoting the development of an aids vaccine supporting aids prevention efforts and encouraging programs to educate african aids orphans the bill would also

and 35 million through the department of health and human services on january 10 2000 vice president gore chairing session of the united nations security council said that as part of the fy2001 budget the administration would request an additional 100 million for aids programs principally in africa but also in india and other countries this increase if approved would bring total fy2001

approved and the president signed the global aids and tuberculosis relief act of 2000 hr 3519 pl 106264 the legislation is nearly identical to the tuberculosis policy and funding authorizations in s 2382 one difference is that pl 106264 authorizes 60 million for each fy2001 and fy2002 instead of just fy2001 as in s 2382international tuberculosis control act of 2000 title ii subtitle of s 2382 calls for stepped up effort to control tuberculosis tb around the world the legislation authorizes 60 million for usaid in fy2001 to achieve the goals of detecting 70 of infectious tuberculosis and to cure by december 31 2010 85 of those infected with tb in countries where usaid has programs in fy2000 usaid expects to spend 26 million on tb out of its child surv ivalhealth appropriation the agency plans to spend the same amount for fy2001 proponents of the tuberculosis initiative are most concerned about the large number of people infected onethird of the world population the ease of tb transmission its prevalence among hivaids infected persons the growing numbers of tb treatment resistant cases due to poor treatment programs and rising travel trade and migration with areas hosting large numbers of infected people while tb is receiving considerable attention from international health experts usaid currently funds number of other programs dealing with serious diseases including hivaids out of its child survivalhealth account some fear that increasing funds for tb as well as hivaids programs without increasing the account overall will result in activities to control other devastating diseases being reduced or terminated advancing the glob opportunities for biotechnology in agriculture act of 2000 bioengineered foods or genetically engineered foods ge foods refers to the use of recombinant dna and related techniques to alter the genetic makeup of living organisms these techniques allow scientists to identify and isolate genes of interest from any organism and put them into other plants or animals currently ge food crops planted and marketed by us farmers include corn canola rice tomat oes potatoes soybeans and sunflowers all us food safety agencies the food and drug administration the us department of agriculture usda and the environmental protection agency are involv ed in the regulatory process for ge foods concerns have been raised about the effects of ge agricultural products in this country some critics have questioned whether us federal agencies have scrutinized the longterm effects of these products on human and environmental health for more information see crs report rl30198 food biotechnology in the united states science regulation and issues httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30530crs11 overseas this concern has become trade issue the european union eu for example requires mandatory labels for products containing more than 1 of ge material and it has moratorium on any new approvals of ge crops while it debates the establishment of new regulatory framework and new eu food safety agency the eu has also been instrumental in influencing other countries to view bioengineered foods with caution on january 29 2000 delegates from 140 governments most signatories were developing countri finalized the biosafety protocol the protocol requir exporters of bioengineered commodities used for food feed or for processing to label shipments with declaration that the product may contain ge materials and that the products that have seeds are not intended for release into the environment the protocol does not require exporters to segregate bioengineered products from traditional products for further information see crs report rs20507 labeling of genetically modified foods title ii subtitle f of s 2382 the glob opportunities for biotechnology in agriculture authorizes 6 million for usaid to establish technical exchange programs such programs would bring foreign nationals to the united states to learn about the us regulatory process for ge foods and send us experts to foreign capitals to provide infor mation on the scientific and regulatory process underlying us approval of ge foods the programs are to encourage acceptance by those countries of us approved ge products usaid would be required to create group of federal government experts to carry out this education program the president acting through usaid would coordinate federal strategy to advance the benefits of biotechnology in international fora usaid and usda would work to ensure that foreign countries find ge grain and food acceptable food aid when it meets us standards s 2382 also expresses the sense of congress that the secretary of state should develop through us embassies support from foreign governments for approval of sciencebased trading regimes in multilateral forums and organizations the primary purpose of this provision is to spread acceptance of ge foods particularly among developing countries and international organiz ations through variety of educational activities it is unclear how other countries would interpret these educatio nal activities given the current level of controversy surrounding ge foods it has been suggested that the eu and others could interpret these activities as an attempt by the united states to force its products and regulatory approval system onto its trading partners which could produce results counter to the goals of this subtitle debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries hipc initiative last year major foreign aid donors agreed to expand significantly the heavily

ifis creditor governments cover their own expenses individually for the forgiveness of bilateral debt at the paris club an informal arena for negotiating debt reschedulings and reduction of publically held loans to finance the cancellation of multilateral debts the world bank and imf created the hipc trust fund into which ifis and aid donor gove rnments would deposit contributions the bank and the fund will cover their own costs but other ifis especially the african development bank do not have enough resources to cover the losses of cancelled loan repayments donor governments have agreed to make up the gap for those ifis with insufficient funds although the imf will not draw from the trust fund members agreed last year to permit the imf to engage in offmarket gold transactions that would have the affect of revaluing imfheld gold at current world market prices about 270 an ounce rather than the original value of 48 per ounce the profits from these transactions would be invested and the imf would use the earnings to finance the writeoff of hipc debt during consideration of the foreign operations appropriations fy2000 congress agreed to the bilateral debt component but rejected the 600 million proposed for hipc trust fund contributions fy2000fy2003 and allowed the us to support only partial imf use of the gold transactions profits 914ths for debt relief the administration has asked congress in the fy2000 supplemental hr 3908 to approve 210 million for the trust fund and separately to finance the balance in fy2001 and 2002 appropriations and to agree to the full imf gold transaction plan officials say that the absence of us contribution has convinced other creditor governments to hold back their own pledges until the us acts they argue that while most of the existing pledges are earmarked for african nations that will be among the earliest qualifiers resources for latin amer ican debt relief for bolivia nicaragua and honduras are not available without us contribution they contend debt workouts for these countries will be delayed critics of multilateral debt relief including some in congress believe that before the us contributes to the trust fund ifis should agree to suspend for period of time new lending to hipc countries once they receive debt relief so that they do not return to severely indebted state s 2382 section 401 adopts both administration requests it authorizes over four years beginning in fy2000 600 million us contribution to the hipc trust fund the provision further repeals the limitation enacted last year regarding the imf gold transaction mechanism thus permitting us officials to fully support the planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30530crs13 status of hipc funding in other legislation the senate foreign relations reported legislation s 3129 on september 28 that is identical to hipc debt relief provisions in s 2382 differences remain however between some congressional leaders and the adminis tration and reportedly negotiations are continuing over whether to link hipc trust fund authorization and release of the additional gold to requirements for world bank and imf reforms meanwhile the house and senate have included hipc debt relief funding in fy2001 foreign operatio ns appropriations bills the house approved 238 million for debt relief hr 4811 while the senate included 75 million s 2522 international financial institutions anticorruption and accountability standards title iv of s 2382 seeks to establish standards and procedures to assure that money disbursed by the international monetary fund and the multilateral development banks mdbs is used for the purposes intended it instructs the us executive directors at the mdbs to seek the establishment of procedures in each bank to insure that the funds disbursed by the banks are used as intended and in manner that complies with the conditions of the banks loan to the borrower countries it also stipulates that the general accounting office should be given sufficient access to information and documents of the world bank and imf for it to audit and monitor their operations the gao is also required to report annually to congress as regards the sufficiency of the audits of the mdbs conducted by persons or entities outside the banks the secretary of the treasury is required to certify that gao has received adequate access to bank and fund documents to perform these tasks and if sufficient access is denied the secretary must report to the appropriate congressional committees the reasons why this information was not obtained the secretary is also required to certify that the bank and fund have adopted procedures to prevent the diversion of funds to assure that countries must implement the reforms specified in their loans before funds are disbursed and to prevent their loans from displacing private sector finance the imf should also take steps to assure that it is catalyst for private sector financing the secretary is also required to certify that loans from the world bank finance specific development programs rather than providing short term liquidity financing for borrower countries the provisions in title iv aimed at preventing corruption and assuring that funds disbursed by the ifis are used for their intended purposes seem to be in line with recent statements by top officials at the world bank international monetary fund and us treasury depa rtment likewise treasury secretary lawrence summers and the congressionally appointed international financial institutions advisory commission called

2000sector in their loan operations5 they disagree however about what this principle means in practice this bill does not address the central issue of that debate it specifies sec 401c1bii and cii that the imf and multilateral banks should have policies assuring that their loans do not supplant private sector financing but it does not address the crucial related issue of whether private money would be available at rates the developing countries can afford it is not clear from this bill or the broader debate whether the ifis are supplanting private finance if they lend at interest rates below those the private market would require regarding the issue of gao access to documents and information the fy1999 foreign operations appropriations act pl 105277 require d the treasury secretary to certify that gao had full access to financial records and managem ent procedures of the world banks marketbased and concessional loan programs for audit purposes gao recently issued its final report it is not evident however that the world bank is prepa red to accept an annual audit of its books the regional development banks may not accept the idea that they should give gao sufficient access to their books to allow it to double check the audits conducted by their outside auditors the annual audits of the imf are conducted by an external audit committee composed of three representatives from member countries rather than by an indepen dent audit organization the imf may not welcome the suggestion that it give gao access to its internal financial records the bill says sec 401c1cv that the imf should concentrate chiefly on shortterm balance of payments financing the bill does not say how countries should be expected to make the types of institutional reforms needed to make crisis lending effective most economists now agree that without major improvements in countries budgetary financial and monetary institutions macroeconomic reforms will have limited perhaps even counterproductive effects6 the meltzer commission would have the imf lend only to countries that qualify for its assistance in advance by adopting major reforms in their financial systems secretary summers says the imf should be able to make loans to countries with weak monetary and banking systems but it should expect them to undertake meaningful reforms as condition for access to its resources the bill specifies sec 401c1b that the world bank should take steps to assure that its funds are used to fund development projects rather than shortterm balance of payments financing this does not address the question of what role if any the world bank should play in helping countries institute institutional reforms in the wake of financial crisis it would also challenge with current practice the world bank has put considerable emphasis in recent years on programs that seek to promote policy reform in borrower countries in most instances the proceeds from the loans cannot be released until the borrower implements certain policies or takeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30530crs15 certain steps generally however the money disbursed for the loan is not used to fund the actual reforms the costs of devising and implementing them is often much less than the total value of the loan many of those costs are also incurred in the countrys own currency for which foreign loan is required the proceeds of the loan go directly into the countrys central bank where they can be used for general budgetary support and current balance of payments financing many analysts believe the multilateral banks might have more difficult time persuading countries to undertake difficult or politically awkward reforms if they are unable to offer short term financing of this type as benefit

1999 s 720 was adopted by the senate by unanimous consent on november 4 1999 but was not taken up by the house title v authorizes 50 million in assistance to groups in serbia and montenegro in fy2001 to promote democracy and free markets it instruc ts the voice of america and radio free europe to increase broadcasts to serbia and montenegro the legislation authorizes humanitarian and recons

institutions on presidential certification that the fry has made progress toward settlement in kosovo compliance with the dayton peace accords internal democratization resolving succession issues arising from the collapse of prewar yugoslavia and cooperation with the yugoslav war crimes tribunal the title also enumerates other sanctions currently in effect including the blocking of fry assets in the united states prohibiting the entry of leading fry and serbian officials into the united states barring the sale of strategic exports to the fry forbidding us government and private loans and investments for companies controlled by fry and serbian officials and prohibiting militarytomilitary cooperation kosovo and montenegro are exempted from these sanctions the president may waive the sanctions for up to 12 months if he certifies that it is important to the national interest of the united states or if the fry makes significant progress toward establishing democratic government the title states that it is us policy to support fully and completely the indictment of milosevic as war criminal and to provide the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia with intelligence information on milosevics crimes it condemns the persecution of ethnic hungarians in the vojvodina region of serbia and calls for nato and the united states to devote attention during negotiations on kosovos status to establishing guarantees for the rights of ethnic hungarians and other minorities in vojvodina it also calls for just resolution of the disposition of diplomatic and

kostunica and the subsequent partial removal of us sanctions however many of the issues in house and senate bills have been overtaken by events microenterprise assistance for more than two decades the agency for international development usaid has explored ways to provide credit and other assistance to microentr epreneurs those with businesses too small and with too few assets to be counted in the formal economy with little or collateral microentrepreneurs have had access to financial credit with which to start or expand their business outside of the exorbitant fees of moneylenders microenterprise programs provide credit often using group pressure to guarantee repayment business skills training to microentrepreneurs and technical assistance to organizations that supply credit and other support to entrepreneurs the most successful microcredit institutions have become financially selfsufficient microcredit programs are viewed by many as an effective way to help those in poverty increase their income the majority of beneficiaries are women who use additional income to help their families and build their businesses the microenterprise for selfreliance act of 2000 title vi of the s 2382 would formally authorize microenterprise programs that usaid has implemented for many years the legislation authorizes for fy2000 level of 150 million up from the fy1999 and fy2000 targets of 135 million the bill would ensure that programs target the poorest of the poor requiring that half of funds be directed at those living in the bottom half below the pove rty line with loans of 300 or less in most of the world and somewhat higher amounts in more affluent regions it also authorizes establishment of microfinance loan facility that would help microfinance institutions avoid bankruptcy as result of natural or other disasters the measure calls on usaid to use its leadership role on this issue to encourage expansion of microcredit activities among international aid donors since 1987 many in congress have supported microcredit programs either through earmarking funds in the foreign operations appropriation s or by recommending them in the appropriations committee report language in 1994 and again in 1997 usaid and members of congress approved microenterprise initiative that supported many of the principles embodied in the current proposed bill several authorizing

nuclear chemical biological and advanced conventional weapons providing guidance and limitations and authorizing 129 million for these activities in fy2001 the subtitle also specifies that of the total amount authorized 2 million may be used for training and educating foreign personnel in the united states 59 million may be used to fund science and technology centers in the former soviet union to help keep highlyt rained personnel from emigrating to proliferating countries and 5 million may be used to establish cargo xray facility in malta country that is frequently transited by

authorized under the new chapter added by s 2382 however would make these funds available notwithstanding any other provision of law that restricts assistance to foreign countries this would have the effect of circumventing the restriction on assistance to russia included in the appropriations act should congress decide to continue the current foreign operations text in the fy2001 bill although s 2382 would consolidate some of the legislation on nonproliferation and export control assistance other agencies will continue similar efforts the department of energy provides training of foreign officials in export control focused on nuclear nonproliferation and the department of defense conducts export control and border security training programs in conjunction with the customs service and

issues for congress assistance for israel in 1996 israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu announced that israel would reduce its dependence on us econ omic assistance at the same time israel maintained that it needed to buttress its military capabilities by seeking an increase in us military assistance israeli and us officials agreed on plan in 1998 by which us economic support fund esf aid then running at 12 billion per year would be eliminated over tenyear period reduction of 120 million per year and us military assistance would be increased from the 18 billion level for fy1998 to 24 billion in ten years an increase of 60 million per year subsequently congress earmarked fy1999 esf for israel at 108 billion and 960 million for fy2000 the administration has requested 840 million for fy2001 congress earmarked military aid for israel for fy1999 at 186 billion and 192 for fy2000 the administration requested 198 billion for fy2001 in addition the administration requested 12 billion in fmf for fy2000 for israel to implement the wye agreement the 12 billion additional funding was included in the fy2000 appropriations bill passed by congress section 781 of s 2382 codifies schedule for the years fy2001 through fy2008 that would reduce the esf aid for israel by equal annual increments of 120 million and would increase fmf assistance by equal annual increments of 60 million thus section 781 would place into permanent law the tenyear plan begun in fy1999 to phase out economic aid to israel while increasing military assistance because the language in s 781 states that authorizations shall be not less than the amounts specified this could have the effect of denying future administrations the opportunity of reconfiguring the pace of the 10year plan in fy2000 the administration proposed but congress rejected an acceleration of the reduction in esf assistance in order to gain funding for other aid activities likewise in the past congress has been reluctant to commit future congresses to course of action it may be argued that section 781 closes the option of shortening the time period during which the esfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30530crs19 status of israeli

more limited way than in s 2382 instead of codifying the entire 10year plan to decrease economic assistance and increase military aid pl 106280 authorizes 120 million reduction in esf and 60 million increase in fmf for each of fy2001 and fy2002 only this would not alter the pace during the next two years of israeli aid modification envisioned in s 2382 but excludes funding authorizations beyond
