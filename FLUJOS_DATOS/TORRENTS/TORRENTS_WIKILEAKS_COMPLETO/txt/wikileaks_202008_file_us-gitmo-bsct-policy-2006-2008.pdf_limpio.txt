unintended direction it occurs as establi dards of behavior are not enforced ambiguous guidance poor supervision and lack of training and oversight contribute to this change in observed standards certain psychological and social pressures can greatly increase the likelihood of behavioral drift this phenomenon is commonly observed in detention and other settings in which individuals have relative control or power over others activities of daily i functioning drift is detrimental to the mission and may occur very careful oversight mechanisms and training discussed more fully in section on mission essential tasks command consultation he mission of bsc is to provide psychological expertise and consultation in order to assist the command in conducting safe legal ethical and ctive detention operations intelligence interrogations and detainee debriefing operations his mission is composed of two complementary objectives 1 to provide psyc ise in monitoring consultation and feedback whole of the detention environment in order to assist the command in ensuring the humane treatment of detainees prevention of abuse and safety of us personnel 2 to provide psychological expertise to assess the individual detainee and his environment and provide recommendations to improve the effectiveness of intelligence interrogations and detainee debriefing operations c these mission objectives contain four critical components of operations that bscs must manage as they work in this arena any other military personnel do civilian or contractor employee help to safety of both dod personnel an detainees bscs use of social psychology group behavior and the dynamics of lihood of abuse by providing behavioral science expertise processes that reduce the opportunity for

setting bscs have responsibility to report information that constitutes clear and imminent threat to the lives and welfare of others such information acquired from detainees should be treated differently and must be reported through proper channels 5 bscs will become aware of all applicable policies and procedures regarding circumstances for protection and release of detainee medical information the health insurance portability and accountability act hip does not apply to the medical records of detainees dod 6025 c51 c710 c711 under us and international law and applicable medical

or other designated senior medical activity officer suspects that the medical information to be disclosed may be misused he or she should senior command determination that the use of the information will be consistent w applicable standards for example it would i kel be necessary to reveal to detention and interrogationde briefing staff information g food restrictions and allergies to ensure inadvertent harm to detainee likewise guards and interrogation teams would need to be advised about contagious conditions in order to take appropriate precautions to prevent the spread of disease from one detainee to others and to us personnel it would also be necessary to release medical information to appropriate personnel about medications and other medical conditions prior to travel 6 bscs will be alert for signs of maltreatment or abuse of detainees and report alleged or suspected abuse to p orities in accordance with dodd 51 0077 dodd 31 1509 and this policy obligated to report any actual suspected or possible violations of applicable laws regulations policies to include allegations of abuse or inhumane treatment in accordance with 0 51 0077 dodd 31 1509 and olicy statement bscs shall report those circumstances to the chain of command s who believe that such report has not been acted upon properly should also report the circumstances to the technical chain including the military department specialty consultant technical chain officials may inform the joint staff surgeon or surgeon general concerned who then may seek senior command review of the circumstances presented as always other reporting mechanisms such as the inspector general criminal investigation organizations or judge advocates also may be used 7 bscs are authorized to make psychological assessments of the character personality social interactions and other behavioral characteristics of detainees including interrogation subjects and based on such assessments advise authorized personnel performing lawful interrogations and other lawful detainee operations nciud ing intelligence activities and law enforcement 8 bscs may provide advice concerning interrogations of detainees when the interrogations are

but are based on experiences and observations would not be 5 as in any setting behavioral science personnel will not perform any duties they believe are illegal immoral or unethical if behavioral science personnel feel they have been ordered to perform such duties they should voice their concerns to and seek clarification from the chain of command if the chain of command is unable to resolve scs should seek alternate means of resolution by contacting their specialty consultant as always other mechanisms such as the inspector general criminal investigation organizations or judge advocates also may be used 6 bscs will not display recognizable patches or other designations on uniforms ing them as healthcare providers or medical personnel while supporting detention operations intelligence interrogations or detainee debriefings so as to avoid any misperceptions of the bscs function or role scs shall not conduct or direct interrogations 6 mission essential tasks understanding the limits of each of the functions below and establishing clear boundaries around these functions will allow bscs to perform ethically in field with many potential challenges these boundaries also assist in establishing clear and proper relationships with command and staff interrogationdebriefing assessment and consultation bscs function in intelligence interrogation and detainee debriefing assessment is to evaluate the psychological strengths and vulnerabilities of detainees and to assist in integrating these factors into successful interrogationidebriefing process bscs who consult to the interrogationdebriefing processes are an embedded resource they consult as the process unfolds and do not simply react to problems or obstacles that arise this consultative process normally begins well before the actual interrogation b environmental setting consultation bscs with their expertise in human behavior can act as consultants to advise detention facility guards military police interrogators military intelligence personnel and the command on aspects of the environment that will assist in all interrogation and detention operations the detention environment includes physical aspects of the facilities as well as social and behavioral aspects of detained population the physical environment includes holding cells hallways toilet and bathing facilities vehicles and interrogation rooms bscs can provide insight into the likely effects of this environment and how changes may affect detainees the social and behavioral aspects of the environment may include access to recreational and social activities educational incentive programs disciplinary plans and scs may also ct training on topics such as ehavior considered acceptable in act of confinement cognizing the use of resis the detainee establishing and clari ing the roles of the supervisor i and the bsc f identifying interpreting and managing behavioral drift g the psychology of persuasion and influence 3 in addition to providing training on the psychological aspects of detention intelligence interrogation and detainee debriefing bscs also serve as another set of eyes and ears for the commander to ensure that guards and interrogators are regularly conducting training on standing operating procedures bscs should identi and recommend to the chain of command areas of training that have either been neglected or are in need of review f command consultation direct consultation to the chain of command may help prevent the inclination of guards nterrogators to drift behavioraliy from the proper execution of their mission essential to roper command consultation is the ability of bscs to ace s directly consult with nd advise all personnel involved in detention operations elligence interrogations and detainee debriefings from the commander to the m junior private including dod civilians and contractor employees ideally while the bsc must coordinate with and interact productively with all members of the command and staff as member of the commanders special staff bsc must hav means to advise the commander directly on matters that affect mission integrit cs may serve as the commanders onsite representatives and should have ted access to detention interrogation and debriefing areas in fact bscs should assist the commander in mo ring as much of the detainee and interrogationdebriefing operations as possible havioral drift can occur extremely rapidly and must be quickly corrected when it occurs the goal is to address problems with tact and at the lowest level possible while ensuring that the command is informed of all issues and concerns noted when appropriate although minor deviations can be corrected at the individual level and typically on the spot more significant issues or pattern of deviations should be addressed with the command passive oversight reinforces inappropriate behavior drift begins in as early as 36 hours without oversight again intervention should occur at the lowest level safety should never be compromised what is tolerated will occur issues must be documented as they arise g psychological screening under some circumstances it is possible for the bsc rovide screening of do0 military or civilian personnel contractor employees and other personnel prior to their assignment to role interacting with detainees this can greatly assist though not eliminate the risk of inappropriate behavior the screening of interrogators may include an interview objective and projective assessment instruments and an estimate of intellectual functioning the assessment should evaluate the prospective in terragators qualities including but not limited to motivation alertness patience and tact credibility objectivity selfcontrol adaptability perseverance and personal appearance and demeanor individuals considered for an assignment in uired to interact with detainees also should conceptualizatio and problem solvk ty integrity and good selfconcept be open to criticism and fee ack and have selfawareness 7 training requirements note any exceptions require approval by assistant surgeon general for force projection 1 licensed for independent practice 2 volunteer for the training and bsc mission this does not imply that the bsc must be volunteer for specific assignment rather that they understand the nature of the mission the shift from noncombatant to combatant status and if strongly opposed to the role be afforded the opportunity to epby in nonbsc assignment 3 final top secret security clearance this is not essential for the training which can be conducted at the s cret level but will be essential for actual employment as bsc 4 completion of training required for designation of skill identifier m6

interrogation operations 7 multiple relationships s related to deters ion operations bsc functions s command ie in this environment to avoid military military civilian and contractor employees like psychologists in small communities must be keenly aware of the nature of these multiple relationships b except under emergency circumstances the psychologist consulting for detention or interrogationldebriefing operations does not conduct mental health evaluations or provide mental health treatment to detainees i medical treatment for detainees to include mental health evaluation and treatment is provided by designated medical element the psychologist will take all reasonable steps to ensure that he or she is not perceived as healthcare provider for detainees c when concerns about health status or medical condition of detainees are raised through observation by the psychologist through inquiries by others involved in detention operations by interrogators or through other reporting mechanisms these concerns will be conveyed to medical personnel for evaluation treatment and disposition d the issue of multiple relationships is addressed in paragraph 305 of the ethics code psychologist refrains from entering into multiple relationship if the multiple relationship could reasonably be expected to impair the psychologists objectivity competence or effectiveness or otherwise risks exploitation or harm to the person with whom the professional relationship exists the code goes on to say that multiple relationships that would not reasonably be expected to cause impairment or risk exploitation or harm are not unethical only in case of an emergency for example when other healthcare providers can respond adequately will the psychologist supporting detention operations intelligence interrogations or detainee debriefings break with their function and provide emergency services to ensure that services are not denied paragraph 202 furthermore the services are discontinued as soon as the emergency has ended or appropriate services are available paragraph 202 f psychologists supporting detention operations intelligence interrogations and detainee debriefings must always be alert to the risk of multiple relationships for example it would probably be inappropriate for psychologist to conduct longterm psychological therapy with an interrogator that is working alongside the psychologist on the other hand brief consultation with the same interrogator on personal issue relevant to the interrogators ability to interrogate effectively may be appropriate in certain circumstances the psychologist in consultation with other psychologists if possible must evaluate each situation and act in order to minimize the risk of harm 8 informed consent
