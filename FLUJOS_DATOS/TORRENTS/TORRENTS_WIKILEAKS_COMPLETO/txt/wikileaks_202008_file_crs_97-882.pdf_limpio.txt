appropriated by the governmentchinas treatment of religious practices introduction in the past year religion has become nother component of the continuing us policy debate on china at its basic level the debate focuses on beijings intolerance for any religious activity that is either uncontrolled by the state involved in political activities or intertwined with foreign re ligious groups many in the us human rights and religious communities center thei r attention on beijings efforts to close down unregistered underground churches or arrest clergy members involved in banned activity but the debate also has raised larger controversies within the united states over religious practices in china some representatives of the us religious community fear that focusing on proscribed religious activities in china ultimately will hurt the millions of chinese religious adherents operating within an officially sanctioned framework as result us policymakers are now faced with questions about what the appropriate us response should be in dealing with government whose attitude toward religious practice differs dramatically from our own this report attempts to address the context and background surrounding chinas policies toward religion and re ligious practices it shoul d be said as caveat that much of the data involving chinas treatme nt of religion comes either from official chinese sources and news reports or fro m unsystematic or an ecdotal reports in addition it should be noted that policy ensh rined in chinas constitution or in state regulations may not be followed in practi ce or may be interpreted and enforced differently in different provi nces and local jurisdictions background on religions in th peoples republic of china historically the chinese communist partys ccp treatment of religion has been uneven early in the 1950s the ccp appeared to espouse policy of religious tolerance this attitude changed to policy of total prohibition of religious practices during the cultural revolution of 196619761 after the death of mao zedong in 1976 the party began permitting greater expre ssion of religious belief the new policy of greater tolerance was solidif ied in 1982 in document 19 the basic viewpoint and policy on the religious qu estion during our countrys socialist period this document set forth guidelin for the opening of religious

religious freedom2 subsequent updates to document 19 have established trend of state control of religious activities that religious groups and human rights organizations see as increasingly repressive infringing on thei r rights of assemb ly and association3 chinese constitutional prot ection of religious freedom chinas constitution recognizes five re ligions buddhism catholicism daoism islam and protestantism article 36 of the constitution states citizens of the peoples republic of china enjoy freedom of religious belief state organ public organizati on or individual may compel citizens to believe in or not to believe in any religion nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in or do not believe in any relig ion the state protects normal religious activities one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order impair the health of citizen s or interfere with the educational system of the state religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination4 article 36 is codified in ar ticle 251 of the criminal law which makes it crime for government officials to illegally deprive citizens of their right to religious belief the term normal religi ous activities however is not defined in the constitution and is therefore left open to interpretation at the various levels of government enforcement since 1994 beijing has tightened restricti ons on religious practices prompting increasing international concern over official efforts to control and contain religious freedom5 on january 21 1994 premier li peng signed decree 144 of the state council regulations governing the re ligious activities of foreign nationals within china it prohibits all evangelistic activities and permits foreign nationals to participate in religious activities in officially recognized venues only foreign nationals are permitted to bring religious materials into china but only for personal use second edict decree 145 regulations

effort by the chines government to control religious groups experts are divided about the reasons for the increased suppression some view the regulations as the partys attempt to contain new social forces associated with economic reform party leaders know the role that religion played in political changes in eastern europe and they ma have drawn connection between the growth of religious groups in china and decline in party membership that was apparent in the early 1990s li kewise some suggest the pa rty is deeply concerned by possible ties among political dissidents religious groups and international organizations13 others link the suppression to lessened internat ional criticism of chinas human rights policies report by human rights watchasia14 on the situation in tibet for instance claims that chinese repression against tibetans increased since may 1994 when the clint on administration delinked human rights issues from the annual process of re newing chinas mfn trade status15 reported repression has included renewe d efforts to prohibit the possession of pictures of the dalai lama efforts to bar the construction of new monasteries and severely limit the number of monks and

evident in tibet but is particularly acute with respect to the muslim areas of northwest china16 evidence suggests that muslim separatists in these areas over the past two years have become more active organized and violent and that chinese authorities have been zealous in their response since spring 1996 in particular chinese officials and press re ports have referred increasingly not only to specific incidents involving muslim separa tists and rebel groups but also to the dangers inherent in religious activity ge nerally in one example in 1996 chinese delegate to the commission on human ri ghts said one association and religion can be allowed to violate nati onal law infringe upon the interests of the people foment splits among its nationalities and sabotage national unity17 as has been the case with monasteries in tibet chinese authorities have reportedly come to regard mosques and koranic schools in northwest china as centers for political dissent according to press reports muslim activism in china appears more aggressive than tibetan calls fo r greater autonomy or independence18 intensified repression of demonstr ations in xinjiang and closing of mosques have been reported since 1995 amnesty international reports that an article appeared in the xinjiang daily on may 7 1996 accusing some people of inciting religious fanaticism under the cloak of religion and of using religion to int erfere with administrative judicial education marriage and family planning affairs19 in january 1996 at beijing national conference on religious wo rk chinese state councillor ismail amat delivered hardline speech calling for new restrictions on religion and religious groups in his speech he announced plan to build framework of legal supervision over religion in china over th next 15 years and called for increased research into the beliefs of people using religion to subvert the state on april 12 1996 china launched str ike hard against crime campaign although the primary focus of the campaign has been to combat chinas increasing rates of violent and gangrela ted crime many believe that it is also being used as cover for cracking down on ethnic separatism and religious activities especially in outlying areas human rights watchas ia in its july 10 1 997 report entitled china the cost of putting business first specifically noted link between

pope to do so despite this tension between the rab and the holy see belief in the pope is accepted and visible in chinas catholic churches according to human rights organiza tions forms of police interference in religious activities generally include harassment fines confiscation of unapproved religious materials confis cation of property frequent detention and interrogation arrest beatings and torture22 sentencing to reeducati on camps and execution the chinese government has stated repeatedly that it does not imprison people solely for the practice of religion those who ar imprisoned are charged with committing crimes or using religion to ove rthrow the state chinese legal procedures allow for prolonged detentions without charges be ing filed in some cases political and religious figures have been held inco mmunicado for periods of year or more23 reeducation through labor sentences are considered an administrative punishment that can be imposed without charge or tr ial trials

among other things they concluded that the number of religious adherents appears to be growing rapidly in china and that china has made some progress over the past 20 years in its policies toward religion they also found that many in china still regard religion as potentially threatening to chinese social stability and that the chinese government maintains intrusive controls over most if not all religious activity among the groups recommendations were that china and the united states should continue and expand upon dialogue fro m midlevel to the most senior level leaders with respect to religious freedom in china that efforts should be made to attract and provide more training to greater numbers of clergy in china and that special attention should be paid to the pr oblems of religious freedom in tibet and to promoting dialogue between china and the dalai lama implications for the united states beijings more restrictive regulation of religious practices continue to generate controversy and debate in the internati onal community some groups such as the hong kongbased holy spirit study center may keep focusing on growth of religious practices particularly in catho licism and protestantism as positive trend in an environment that permits greater religious expression than was tolerated during the cultural revolution such groups belie ve that improving social conditions and the bankruptcy of communist ideology will continue to promote religious growth on the other hand many inte rnational christian groups increasingly criticize the limits placed on the practice of religion by government that pr ofesses to promote freedom of religious expression they see th is as the beginning of trend backward leading to further control of religion or repression of religious followers in the future the issue of religious tolerance also will continue to put china at odds with significant segments of the american policy community social stability is seen as fragile and is paramount to chinese lead ers beijing is also undoubtably mindful of chinese history in which the taiping muslim and other religious upheavals proved ruinous to chinese governance american s are unlikely to be receptive to chinas claims that strong governmental control and suppression of relig ious practices are two essential components of national stability many relig ious groups in the united states have established ties to religious groups in china providing much needed religious materials and training and it is feared that these ties will be jeopardized in the new repressive environment the issu of religious freedom in china has drawn special attention from the 105th congress which is considering legislation to require us monitoring of religious persecution around the world as well as legislation targeting china specifically for religi ous persecution and other human rights violations congressional initiatives and actions in 1997 members of congress have
