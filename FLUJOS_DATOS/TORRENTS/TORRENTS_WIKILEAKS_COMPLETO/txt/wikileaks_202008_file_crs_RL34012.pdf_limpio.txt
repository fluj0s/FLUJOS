offices are often approached by cons tituents seeking grants for projects including local governments nonprofit groups community organizations small businesses and individuals though many hope for federal funding such assistance is often limited and other funding sources such as private foundations should be considered federal grants are not benefits or entitlements to individuals grants are intended for projects serving state community and local needs mo st federal funding goes to state and local governments which in turn may make subawards to local entities such as eligible nonprofit organizations local governments seeking funds for community services infrastructure and economic revitalization may be eligible to tap into state or federal funds government assistance may also be available for nonprofit organizations including faithbased groups for initiatives such as establishing soup kitchens or afterschool tutoring programs benefitting entire communities for others such as for individuals seeking financial help starting or expanding small business or needing funds for education benefits or loans may be available individuals looking for government benefits such as for child or health care housing or energy costs disability or veterans needs or living assistance may find useful the website govbenefitsgov at httpwwwgovbenefitsgov students seeking financial aid can search student aid on the web at httpwwwstudentaidedgov to start or expand small business the federal government provides help in the form of loans advisory and technical assistance see the small business administration sba website at httpwww sbagov to find programs and state or local sba offices groups seeking funding for projects need first to determine the most appropriate sources of funds because government funds may be limited sources of private funding should also be considered state and community foundations may be particularly interested in funding local projects many projects may require combination of government and private funding local business or foundation funding might be appropriate for supporting local memorials or programs community fundraising may be more suitable for school enrichment activities such as band or sports uniforms or field trips for eligible state and local governments and nonprofit organizations identifying appropriate programs and then contacting federal and state agencies early in the process before submitting formal applications is recommended statelocated federal offices often handle federal grant applications and disbursement of funds state government departments and agencies also fund projects and administer federal block grants
