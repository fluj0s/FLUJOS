prepchecking with mid rud buttons lecture given on 26 july 1962 well now we still i thinkwhat date do we still have audience twentysixth oh youre still here on the 26th hey twentysixth july ad 12 second lecture saint hill briefing course the subject of this lecture is prrrrrrrrepchecking prrrepchecking it goes without saying that everything that you are working oni refuse to leave any errors in it just to appear right in other words thats peculiarity i have and youll just have to put up with it most scientists get enamored with an idea and they have so fewthey spend the rest of their lives trying to prove it and were they to change their minds concerning this they would of course lose in repute i dont consider that repute is more important then getting the job done i dont care what you think of my repute im going to go on being honest when i find something wrong why i jolly well reserve the right to say so and when i have been wrong i have uniformly been the first to tell you when something can be improved and make the job easier for you i dont care what it invalidates im going to tell you now theres certain amount of effort spent in the direction of trying to force over into the other position every once in while i get blamed for not having invented scientology in the last lifetime somebody comes along and says well why on earth didnt you tell us about missed withholds back in 1952 you see all right if i had known about missed withholds in 1952 i would have told you its as simple as that you see dont ever assume that i am dealing you data off stacked deck which has been in existence for lord knows when although this data existed at one time or another on the trackand i dont mean the whole body of the datathe various data and postulates were made up to remedy and solve things as people went along the track packaging it up in one piece and so forth justwell let put it this way hasnt been customary and thetan got the way he is because of the introductions of arbitraries and when you find out you are dealing with few more arbitraries than you have to well the thing to do is to throw them away thats the proper thing to do you say theres more arbitraries than we need so lets dispense with them and any time i can get two procedures to do job that was formerly being done by fifty well i for sure will give you the two procedures and if i can find two jobs that could be done with one procedure ill sure throw one of those procedures away thats the only sensible way to look at it and ive just found way to use middle rudiments and make them double in brass and get the job done much better in prepchecking which is quite remarkable and this is very embarrassing because i have just gotten out two policy letters giving you canned prepchecks all right if i had wanted to appear the big man and im always right you know right right exclamation point right and so forth i would of course have to suppress this data because data which is slightly more complicated was just released at the beginning of the week that would be good for my reputation but its sure hard as hell on you as an auditor and pc you see so i dont subscribe to that policy now the middle rudiments were carefully sorted out of tremendous number of buttons which could have been used now oddly enough you could add another fifteen or twenty buttons with the greatest of ease and have your middle rudiments maybe twentythree or twentyfour items long and what youd dothis is probably the way the session would goin any twohour session youd get in your beginning rudiments you would ask one prepcheck question and then to check the thing youd spend the remainder of the body of the session and then if the original prepcheck question that you asked in the session were found to be alive you wouldnt have any time left of course to clean it so youd have to leave it that way so that you can get into your end rudiments this doesnt appear to to be very efficient so ive carefully taken out all the stuff we knew and so forth and believe tremendous amounts of stuff have accumulated as far as data is concerned you know this research line is only something on the order of about i think its about thirtytwo years old right now and the most concentrated part of the area is about fifteen years and to rack up this much data and cover this much territory in measly fifteen years particularly regarded from whole track viewpoint is not only incredible its impossible theres been certain amount of rush on it and so forth but basically its just working on it that has been important and working on it without any pitch you see theres pitch i am not working for the intergalactic survey you see or something like that come to earth to civilize the natives you know or something like that that arbitrary we can delete that doesnt mean that i am not connected with the intergalactic government you see but they dont know about it either yet i have my name rank and serial number just like other people but thats very funny hardly anybody can ever clearhave you ever worked under an assumed name clang yeah what and i have to answer you see and i keep giving this thingi keep giving this thingi keep giving this thingand it always gets cleared any time i get that prepcheck question very very funny people wonder why it doesnt clear well it doesnt clear because it is true it goes on and on and on and on and on you see its present time now we look over this situation and we had all this bushelbasket load of buttons in the human mind youve seen them lot of principal ones in the chart of attitudes lot of other areas of data and so forth theres various buttons that you can push and frankly although they were announced and given to you very softly and very quietly the middle rudiments are an assembly and stripdown of buttons based on this fact they consist ofwhen you add the word suggest which is used in your prepchecksthey consist of just those things which can keep one of the others from reading and which if present can keep goal or item from reading that is the whole assembly well this makes them pretty powerful buttons lets take look at them theres suppress now if you got all the suppress off the case nearly everything would blow dont you see if suppress is alive of course you dont get read on the remainder so just as rule and law youve got to run suppress before you add in another series of anything thats the law thats the rule youve got to put in suppress by getting off suppress then you will get read on the remainder now suggest could be translatedand sometimes by the way has to beasisness thats evaluation out of your auditors code thats evaluation that says something isthats the isness of things now it is very powerful button because you say something is and although it wasnt reading before it will now read the auditor says that is still alive and oddly enough he can possibly make pc wonder about it you see and the pc jams on it and says that couldnt be still alive to himself dont you see and it would create little ridge there and itll just read on the meter and read on the meter and read on the meter see so evaluation can make something read and that is contained in the mostits nearest cousin in the english language that anybody can understand in the form of suggest now the next point would be invalidate and invalidation if present if goal is invalidated it will now read as the goal itll make an item read which wouldnt otherwise read when you take the invalidation off the item longer reads which is very peculiar now youve got suppress of course on top of an invalidate keeps the invalidation from showing up now failed to reveal is off the line because it gives you the dirty needle that isthat is that little minute rock slam that is always failed to reveal so that gives you particular and peculiar needle read the item careful of is to marked degree another suppress but it has this characteristic after the person has been having something done for little while that is little bit offbeat they can hang up in the thing if they have become too careful of something or other and they could also make something read in quite the reverse by not suppressing careful of that gives you an opposite flow so you get youryou get your middle rudiments in short as being something which are capable of making goal or item read if present now that suggest moving that suggest in there which you will find in your prepcheck is actually not as current or as constant as you might think ityou wouldnt use it in every middle rudiment that came by because you can pick it up at all one fell swoop mostly based on this fact that auditors seldom suggest anything but they might seem to some place or another so you pick it up on prepcheck basis rather than middle rud basis every time you go by you actually then have in essence five middle rudiment buttons that could be used now the way you would arrange these buttons if you wanted the optimum service out of these buttons onfor prepcheck purpose which i am about to give you because i am going to show you how to use just the middle rudiments to perform whole prepcheck which is very interesting little advance here you would say suppress and then you would say suggest you see and then you would say careful of and then invalidate and failed to reveal do you follow how those things are played together of course the one which is most important and can blow the session up in bits and pieces we put at the end to occur when everything else has been beautifully swamped up and we actually put suppress in twice by putting its opposite in you see careful of so youd haveyoud have these arranged in that particular fashion as being very powerful youd have suppress suggest you would then have careful of and invalidate and then failed to reveal all right in that order you would have two cracks at suppression now that would be very interesting if these buttons could be used for the bulk of prepchecking wouldnt it well if they are that strong series of buttons why they must have some value last night i sat down and looked at pcit was very late and id had lot of auditing that hadnt recommended itself to one way or the other i was already violating the auditors code one of the only times i get chance to audit way after ten man you have to be good to audit after ten had the pc sort of gummed up and said what am i going to do here and said well the best thing i can do with something like this is form some zeros here before i get on about my business form up some zeros i was thinkingzeros why the hell should i form any zeros i know the pc has not been feeling very well for an exact period of time lets just throw the middle ruds in as zero questions man man ive seen assists in my time but that was about the wildest ive seen in some while that was just about the best zeros i ever saw so after the session i said what the ruddy bleeding hell happened here almost blew the roof off you know and i said well of course you idioti seldom call myself an idiot exceptbut sometimes do youve carefully got together the most powerful buttons that you can possibly give because theyre the only things that can make goal read or not read or an item read or not read and you summed these things together in the middle rudiments then you dont move them over into prepchecking well what can you expect will happen if you move them over into prepchecking well of course they are the main buttons that are sitting there crash all hells going to break loose if you prepcheck these things against period of time quite interesting so i sat down and wrote this down for you this would just be sample action this would be sample action this would be prepcheck guaranteed to do something very interesting with pc this is more complicated than it need to be im just giving you an idea of what you could do with this see this is fun just for you when did you decide to come to saint hill you ask this guy see you ask this student when did you decide to well he finally picks it out of the ether and you get the thing confirmed on the meter and so forth and you get the date you write the date down in your auditors report then you ask him just beforewhatever the date was seewhat happened in other words you discover an area of overts which is the prior confusion to the date got the idea an area of overts and then date the beginning of that prior confusion were moving it back little earlier date the beginning of the prior confusion and now just for the hell of it in case hes skidded and missed why lets select an arbitrary date month earlier and let that be our date by which we head these questions you know your prepcheck question has got to have time limiter this all starts to get very very amusing and very interesting indeed because youve moved back to specific date now youve got the beginning of the prior confusion before he made this decision now were going to move back month earlier just in case he slipped and didnt forget the original overt you knowdidnt remember the original overt so were going to take that as the arbitrary date and then were going to do this with it all were going to do is frame an expanded mid rud series of questions were going to flatten each one repetitively and then we are going to go over this two or three times going to frame the questions like this let us sayit wouldnt be but let us say it was june 1st 1955 wouldnt be but lets just say that was the date your prepcheck question would be since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have suppressed well now if you dont think that isnt going to keep your pc running for while youre mistaken and were just going to run this repetitive see just totally repetitive since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have suppressed thank you since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have suppressed thank you since june 1st 1955you dont have to answer these just so i am not missing any withholds on you since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have suppressed see and finally the pc says huh thatsthats all thats it thats the lot and you say thank you ill check that on the meter understand this is done terribly formally very formal auditing you are not interjecting comments or running twoway comm nothing because its very easy its almost automatic you get it over here and say all right going to check that on the meter since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have suppressed that reads that that that that oh yes well thats my mother so forth and so forth you just lay the meter aside since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have suppressed since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have suppressed and you go on and on and on oh honest youre goingyoure gonnayoure gonna get yourself somea bucket of answers man in the first place the pc is perfectly willing to tell you things they have suppressed in fact they practically springboard off as he remembers them see this is auditing with bedsprings under it boong bing boong thats dandy oddly enough lot of somatics come off at this time now what i thought would happen when i was doing this is that everything might restimulate but it didnt the somatics came off with the suppressions lot of them all right well lets say the pc has come to point of saying and lets say that we have asked the pc i will check this on the meter since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have suppressed and lets say that we have read the meter correctly and that it was clean now clean is awfully relative in this case man this is relative but it didnt show on the meter and the pc isnt thinking of any answers and as far as he is concerned as far as youre concerned thats clean all right fine fine fine fine that sounds good all right without doing anything else extraordinary or doing anything we simply swing into the second question since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have suggested now the funny part of it is that you will quiver on this if you will redecide perhaps to run this as decided or something like that but that is not the meaning of it the meaning of the thing is evaluated dont you see but suggested is very mild isnt it yes ive suggested to my father that he go to hell and ive suggested to mamie that she buy new hat and ive suggested that we separate you get the idea ive suggested that its better that they blow the world up you know these first little things its very mild its not any overts to amount to anything at all well we follow the same repetitive on and on and on and on and on and on and on this and we dont care if it runs shortly or longly we are going to run it to point where both the pc and the meter agree utterly that thats it thats clean thats good all right thats fine we drop that everythings running along fine itll probably be the second or the third prepcheck session when it is done butthis is actually twentyfivehour intensive probabilities quite possibly because my question last night was in the past two weeks and it ran and ran and ran all right so we go on and on and now we get into this sort of situation we want to know now of course some more suppressions so we say since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have been careful of isnt that mild and innocent man thats mild and innocent of course all this time why given that you are reading the meter and getting your rudiments in every session and that sort of thing and not goofing anywhere along the line your pcs arc is building up building up building up building up with the auditor hell be able to blow things better and all that sort of thing so we flatten that one since june 1st 1955 is there anything that youve been careful of and of course we get the remaining suppressions off of this thing and then we let the pc have it right in the eyes see got that all beautifully flat and so we saygot it on the meter and everythingeverythings clean since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have invalidated well thats nice quiet sort of word isnt it invalidated anybodyd answer that pow you know now you are going to get some somatics he didnt dream of you know here and there and this and that various things cognitions that sort of thing going to come up we run that thing on down pc says its flat and the meter says its flat and because we know by this time how to read our meter we know its flat and we got that one all set and all squared away and pc is feeling fine and now we say since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have failed to reveal well whats very interesting about this is you of course during the sessions as you went along will probably have had to use your random rudiment now and then or something like that you might have had this to boost along but this will come as totally natural action to your pc by this time failed to reveal thats very innocent thats very calm thats very nice and hell just walk on through and unload withholds left and right hardly noticing that he does so because it seems so easy and natural and everything will go fine now the possibility is certainly if that becomes flat at that time we could actually skip the whole thing and not do anything further about itdont overlook that possibilityproviding we dont do this idiocy of check the mid ruds on the period do fast check of the mid ruds on the period lets just cut our throats right there see since june 1st 1955 is there anything you have suppressed suggested been careful of failed to reveal you know ugh lets just miss all the rest of the withholds see if you just left it at that went through each one of these things once youd have practically different pc sitting in front of you providing it was done in model session and you were reading the meter and you had your rudiments in see this would be quite interesting this would be highly informative you say well you couldnt possibly have gotten the bottom of every chain well heres what i found out and the only reason im releasing the data is because you are taking them up in this particular sequence and because these are very odd little buttons to be taking up and they appear to be very innocent and that sort of thing they clear away an awful lot of track without worrying about fundamentals and basics and that by omitting the withhold system we left ourselves wide open dont you see some guy just wouldnt clear up on this subject because we never had any method by which to get the earliest on the chain dont you see but this doesnt matter whether you get the earliest on the chain or not because these buttons are hot enough apparently to wash out whatever is going on without you finding big missed withhold sitting in your lap and that sort of thing but you couldthis is for the purposes of the establishment of system hereyou could now start in all over again if you were running an intensive and you had lots of time or if the pc had given it very shallow pass you start in all over again and you could get it from the beginning to the end in other words you do the whole cycle of those middle rudiments probably take you another session or two or three to get that all the way through again but youd pick up some deeper fundamentals along the line however i wish to caution you to this effect that is cleaning clean youve already said that thats all that he has suppressed and that sort of thing youd only get into trouble with this if you werent able to read meter or you left one of them muddied up now couple of times on tv demonstrations here ive seen prepcheck question left unflat as though it were not very important or something of the sort well let tell you man thatexclamation pointimportant dont ever leave prepcheck question unflat whatever else you do the catholic church has sins of blasphemy and other types of sins for which they burn people and armies shoot men for cowardice in battle i think they shoot them now for being brave in battlebut anyhow armies shoot people for desertionwhen they are headed by eisenhower every group has its sins see but we dont have many sins we dont pay attention to many sins but there is really is leaving prepcheck question unflat because it amounts to sinful situation youve got somebody all upset and without knowing what is wrong he gets blowy and he is liable to leave scientology and deny himself auditing see its important its important all sorts of wild things can happen by just leaving one sec check question unflat the darnedest thing you ever heard of ive never seen so much commotion god ive had telex machines going wildly in all directions and everything else just on that one basis so well put that down as and youre teaching an academy student sometimehis is not to reason why he cant seem to pass the missed withhold bulletin or something like that just tell him it is now thats quite interesting as cleanup little intensive for prepcheck area quite interesting if that were run on you you would be quite amazed at some of the results and things that would come off now i have just given you method of discovering date by taking decision which somebody has obviously made ill give you an obvious decisionthe fellow has gotten married couple of years ago we dont do problems intensive to find the key problem on the track before we audit him if we havent done that we are not going to spend any time doing that something like that you can arbitrarily pick up some obvious decision the person has made whats the most obvious decision with this guy well he must have decided to get married of course the girl is probably of two opinions about that but he must have decided this therefore just pick on it and decide that if he made decision of this character why there must have been prior confusion ahead of it and you will always be right oddly enough you will always be right now if you just back up the time month arbitrarily before the prior confusion that youve spotted of course youve included any little additional activities that might have occurred that he has kind of forgotten about so you sort of have basic to the prior confusion just method of doing it now you can also run this wildly enough on athis basisill tell you the basis you cant run it on in minute but you run on this basis in this lifetime now lets really shoot the moonlets settle in for fiftyhour intensive just like that see in this lifetime is there anything you have suppressed yeah were settling in for the long haul here see gosh youll get to the end of the first question you see about three or four sessions later see well thats fine thats fine and you just follow exactly the same action except you dont have to establish any arbitrary prior confusion dont you see there is one but dont try to establish it and you just carry on exactly in that fashion you first clear up of coursealways the same sequence suppress and then suggest and then careful of and then invalidate and then failed to reveal the magic five and youre going to get all kinds of wild things coming up oddly enough if you attacked it in that particular way you would get withholds off pcs more or less easily and voluntarily you wouldnt have to be slugging for it very hard dont you see now theres only one caution on this i talked to you little earlier this evening follow the rules follow them right straight down the middle of the path so forth but dont be an idiot failed to reveal communicates nothing to this pc let us say just kind of fish around on question before we go overboard on the thing see failed to reveal means nothing to them it doesnt mean an overt it doesnt mean anything else failed to reveal well reveal hes never undressed in public and this is what reveal means to him see so his answer is nothing ive never failed to reveal anything see nothing hes got it all backwards and somehow or another cant realize that when he answers that way means hes always undressed in public he just doesnt seem to untangle this thing so youd have to at this point why any of those points youd have to be smart enough to stay on the exact meaning but within the intelligence of the pc give you an example youre auditing little kid you know youve got to translate the word around and sometimes you can make wild mistake it doesnt mean the same thing at all but youve got to use the words in the meaning that will communicate to the pc so you might run that one since early in this lifetime is there anything youve done that people didnt find out about at the time see its what you are trying to get see he says well i was audited last year at the hasi see i was audited last year and i gave them all of my overts so therefore there is nothing i have failed to reveal if you dont think you dont sometimes get this answer you ought to read some auditors reports sometimes thats pretty wild and sure enough the auditor pulled lot of them so its now unanswerable you see as question but people didnt find out at the time oh at the time they didnt find out about it well they didnt find out about it at the time yes they didnt you know its true oh there were quite few of those oh thats what you mean big cognition well you can run that thing but the only error you are going to get into in handling this little system im giving you here of using the middle rudiments doubling them in brass the only error youll make is failing to get communication established here invalidated boy he does not understand that man of course an invalidation you should know is notis and is the notis axiom and so you realize that translates into maybe tried to make nothing of so its in this lifetime is there anything youve tried to make nothing of see its almost direct translation in fact its possibly little directer than invalidate that communicates so it goes by this rule that if you find the pc is unable to answer or give you many dont blame it on the pcs unwillingness to give up withholds or something or the caginess of the pc blame it on the communication the communication is not occurring see youve got to make the communication so it does bite itll be the offbeat of that communication which stomps this thing naturally you go to all trouble of finding out what each one of these words means and translates well to the pc youve got newworded set of middle rudiments havent you to use on the pc they might sound very strange but they are communicating to the pc dont you see see thats what it is so anyway if you were to do that and do just that the bank unstacks in its natural sequence which is always desirable in sec checking and prepchecking and you have just about the easiest job in the world which is doing repetitive prepcheck it becomes just as easy as can be now im not recommending that your prepcheck assignment be immediately transferred over to this see that what you are doing in prepchecking immediately be transferred over into this activity and so on youve got the last two pages of the joburg 6a these are specialist actions which of course have to be checkable and so forth its mainly done as class work and to sweeten up the tempers of your fellow students thats why it is and dont let them accumulate lot of auditing overts and that sort of thing but if you get assigned to long stretch of prepchecking and so on and youve completed your assignment there is some more auditing that you can do in this particular line or if you are assigned to prepchecking and you have already completed your requirements on the thing thats what i would do i wouldnt go into any arbitrary form arbitrary forms have their value they particularly have value in instruction because you can check and find out what the person did id use more this type of approach now ill show you another way this could be used and combined and made up lets take the old style problems intensive the way it was finally canned up and released with its 0 and p sections and sort out by assessment the chief problem by assessment thats selfdetermined decision the person has made of course thats immediately preceded by problem and thats immediately preceded by prior confusion and by assessment of the decisions selfdetermined decisions the person has made by assessment discover the most charged decision in this lifetime now this would appear absolutely magical to rawmeat pc and would stand psychoanalyst on his ear what you do is just take an assessment of these selfdetermined decisions date the problem date the prior confusion and remember now theres one thing everybody has missed consistently and continually in the problems intensive that just drives them completely astray and makes problems intensive unworkable we mean the prior confusion to that decision and we are talking about period of time as little as five minutes and as great as week or two and we are not talking about three years before auditor after auditor i have watched them i have read their reports and i absolutely groan they come in from central orgs and that sort of thing and i groan on this thing they take periods of three to five years before the selfdetermined decision that is not prior confusion thats not the prior confusion that is meant the prior confusion that is meant takes place from five minutes to couple of weeks its right there and if you ask the pc youve got this terrifically charged selfdetermined decision and you ask the pc for the prior confusion you see it happened when he was twentyseven and it was decisionit was decision to go to work for the bideawee soap company this thing is absolutely dynamite i mean youd get it on the meter and youve been going down this list and it goes pow see to go to work for the bideawee soap company we ask the prior confusion and the pc says well it was my mother washing my ears when i was little boy and the auditor says well all right what werewho were the people who were present during that period well there was myself and my mother and the auditor then runs overts against self you see to solve the whole thing that is not the way you do it i thought i had written it down plainly but apparently i missed there because prior confusion means the just prior confusion it could be within five minutes of the decision but the pc will slide off of this and go anyplace else rather than face the thing youve got to scramble him right in there youd be surprised whats left on problems intensive what gets left you know what never gets touched the whole prior confusion never gets touched you know theres murder and bank robbery see that just happened the last saturday before the fact all there thats all clean you say well is there any prior confusion to that oh it falls off the pin well what was the prior confusion to that well when my mother was washing my ears when i was little boy an auditor and i took that all up see its just prior so if you think of just prior confusion all will be beautifully resolved your actions on putting one of these things together are elementary actions you want the selfdetermined decision you dont want an otherdetermined decision like sometimes marriage and so forth is not selfdetermined decision you want something he decided decisions he made and you ask most pcs this and they sometimes start off very sloppily and give you otherdetermined answers see you want selfdetermined changes in your life is what you need that you decided you see and if you say selfdetermined changes in your life that you yourself decided to change on you can kind of get it across you know across and the pc says to you well i was ill and they changed to the hospital and you just leave your pencil in the air and you say to the pc all right thats fine now thank you very much now ill repeat the auditing question now i want you to answer this question this is the question you know until you finally get all of sudden oh you mean things i decided oh well thats different changes in his life changes in his life and so on because sometimes it has to take little while to dawn on the pc that he himself has effected any change in his life when you first address him on this subject he thinks of himself as pawn who was moved from one end of the board to the other he never thinks that he himself pushed himself around so you sometimes have to dig little bit before you get these things and you get those written down and you make nice list each one and that selfdetermined change see its got to be very short very very short you shorthand it well my wife and i why we owned motel and we had been around the desert for quite while and weweweweve hadwe had this service station first in waco see and thenthen we owned this motel we owned this motel and i went up to montana for little while and saw friend of mine up there hes goat hunter and i saw him for long time and actually i brought him back down and he made couple of insulting remarks about this motel and that sort of thing but that was after i went to angeles and i finally found buyer for the motel and wewe decided to go to san francisco and honest to god you will find this sometimes on the auditing report the whole story honest youll find the whole thing ive seen some of them andi havent written that hard enough see its veryyou know decided to go to san francisco you see june 1928 decided to go to san francisco june 1928 thats all you want youre going to have to read those things back and youve got time and that was the place where wewayco you know and we had the petrol station in wayco and then i went up to montana and theres fellow up there shooting goats you know you havent got time to read all that totally practical considerationim not making fun of you actually i thought i had originally stressed this madly and you should see some of the old records that we have around here on that they are quite ludicrous weve corrected it and after that they get so they can really do it but some of the first efforts have to be carefully explained to them that it had to be in two or three words with date following it you see and you still get this short story and they keep running out of forms you know let tell you the liability of putting down an otherdetermined change all you do is assess the list of engrams they must be selfdetermined changes you must not have on that list any otherdetermined change or you are liable to find yourself assessing an engram well the doctor decided i had to go to the mountains for my health and the auditor writes down gone to the mountains for health october 1956 he comes along and hes assessing wildly here and god this octobermountains for health october 1956 boy he just falls off the pin you know you canyou can hear the air being split as the needle falls boy thats it you know thats it now lets look for the prior confusion to this area weve got that straight it has to be within the last week or so before that all right thats fine all right whats the personnel in this confusion well there was the lorry driver and the three children that were riding in back back of what you know we got car smash you see and he spent the next several days in the hospital between life and death and we are running the beginning of beautiful engram and this system i assure you does not handle engrams so watch it there can be moments of pain and that sort of upset in there and this system will get you out of them more easily than other systems and you mustnt avoid an area just because there was an accident in it or something like that as long as you are assessing selfdetermined decisions to change you dont run into this difficulty and you get proper assessment you go on the line but the pc has to sort this out for while sometimes he really goes around in circles yeah hell tell you about the doctor ordering him to the mountains and you just hold your pencil up give him tr 4 on it say oh doctor ordered you to the mountains thank you good yeah fine good all right now lets have selfdetermined change that i just asked for lets have this selfdetermined change selfdetermined change that you made yourself oh oh oh oh my mother took out of prep school you say good thank you thank you thats fine like that and so forth now ill repeat the question here ill repeat the question what i want is selfdetermined change that you did yourself on your own initiative oh oh oh oh ive got that ive got that well my father and mother moved to another town when i was young dont commit suicide just keep at it until youve got this thing grooved in lay down the pencil and say now look what i want from you is times when you yourself you you you yourself decided on change in life now for instance churches or you decided to you know shift something in your religion or something like that thats what i want thats what i want you got that hes got that now you pick up your pencil again and you sit there and look at him alertly all right and youll probably get them and then you get list of that and then you make sure that every one is selfdetermined change dont keep challenging the pc each time he gives you one he says i decided thats good enough you go down that list you assess that thing out you take the one with the greatest fall or assess it by elimination oddly enough they will assess by elimination just like the prehav scale but you want to watch it because they will assess all the way out if you dont grab the last one just as it disappears dont sit there like an idiot saying which one was the one that went out last youve got two you see and you are going between these two and you go from one to the other and keep making marks and you go back and read that one and you say well it must have been the other one but thats gone too so which one did you have and do your assessment take that thing now move back find out if there was anything happened just before that and then move it back about month to be safe and take that as your arbitrary date its an arbitrary date that is made to include distance as close to that as month and thatll include anything that happened in that period and everything will be dandy but if you permit that date to go back several years for the prior confusion you will miss it wildly and youll get the pc all wound up in circle you want that area that just happened because let tell you his decision was just preceded by the recognition that he had an awful problem to which the decision is solution the decision is always solution to problem and just before he had this awful problem well he was in there committing overts and people were missing withholds with both fists he had both feet into life up to the neck if thats the hottest one that comes up but you mustnt go back any great time period from that dont go back years take that as your date and give it the works here just as i have been giving you here do those middle rudprepcheck type of thing lets say it turned up to september the 2nd 1951 so youd say since september 2nd 51 is there anything you have suppressed on and on and on and on and on now you get sometimes thrown by this type of action i might tell you at this time that im interested in this and interested in prepchecking in an effort to upgrade the therapeutic value of prepchecking im quite interested in doing that to make prepchecking more meaningful to make it do more for case and what im giving you i should have probably given you better preliminary on the thing but what im giving you actually makes prepchecking pretty beefy if it is well done the things that you can do with this will i think astonish even you when you have already had results on this i think you will be quite astonished you get somebody you only got twentyfivehour intensive on this person and that sort of thing youd be unhappy to prepcheck this person perhaps and try something desperate if it was all the money the poor bloke had and you didnt think youd get very far with your prepchecking and so forth if you had little experience with this particular type of mid ruds type prepchecking why youd feel comfortable about sitting there and giving it to him because man some things are going to fly off he never heard the likes of and also because youve achieved sufficiently high result the possibility of your getting dirty needle after this is quite slight your auditor altitude you see has taken rocket ride to venus see youre amongst the stars as far as this guys concerned well its all real to him thats the main thing that happens its all quite real because of course he isnt going to tell you anything that he doesnt think he has and you dont fish for any data you dont push him around you dont try to get any overts off particularly you wind upmake sure when you finish all this that you get your middle rudiment in that you havent missed any withholds on him because that could be catastrophic but thats middle rudiment type action fast check see and you guys are going to wind up at the end of this line or the lady involved and i think you will find youll be quite happy with what you have done and actually youve done something rather relaxed about the whole thing now in handlingin handling prepchecking in general you would perhaps feel shy of doing it if you werent going to get result which was desirable result to the pc well i think youd find thislet us take an example here mrs jones has just been delivered of nineteenpound bouncing boy and has slight postpartum psychosis and you think the best thing to do is to run out the birth engram i can tell you that the best thing to do would be this middle ruds prepcheck predated on some prior confusion prior to that not taking the birth as date but letting your date fall so that the birth is included in the period you are not targeting at it you are auditing her month and half after the date of the delivery well you fish back and find out little bit more and talk to her about her life in that period and just take it at two months that includes that period and i think youd be astonished to find the somatics fly off without winding the pc stuck in the incident you see it has value man this amounts to pt problem dont you see its just happened you dont get it out of the way why youre going to have mess on your hands that gives the auditor another weapon too and how successful it is is totally dependent upon the quality of your meter reading and the degree the pc is insession and the excellence with which you clean off those questions one after the other as youi mean clean them off when you test them i think youd wind up at the other end of the line with very happy pc because pc asked permissively in this fashion wont pull themselves deeper into the pit than they think they can go at any given moment and youve got that interesting rule that is given i think in book three of dianetics the modern science of mental health that the mind has selfprotective mechanism you dont tend to overthrow that now this was necessary at this time since we have so many techniques that will overthrow the balance of the mind we could run into somebody today like athats one of the reasons you want towell my god when auditing in the old days i never had this many arc breaks from the pc just putting in rudiments and that sort of thing ah must be my auditing is deteriorated youve got steppedup model session dont you see the potential of arc is fantastic if you dont learn how to drive this car rightits like ferrari or cooper special man that thing is going to go off the curves see you are driving racing car you might as well make up your mind to it see this thing has got power and it has got speed if you want to go back and drive mercedesbenz 1898 model why you wont get anywhere near the amount of arc breaks and upsets from pc you wont get the results either you get the difference of what youre learning right now well similarly this is gunnedup prepchecking but there was anecessary at this time to have relatively permissive system which didnt overthrow the balance of the mind all right lets take an extreme example of this this girl never under gods green earth ever dared go near the time she was thrown into the institution and electric shocked within an inch of her life she begs you not to go anywhere near this well thats one thing she wont talk about if you guarantee not to talk about this in any way shape or form shell be perfectly happy to be audited select period two months ahead of it run it i think if you audit well youll be on the safe side but if you dont audit it well and find yourself with the feeling that you have just shot off the edge of the grand canyon within racing car and it is turning over and over and over in empty space dont say i didnt warn you the thing to do is of course go back to giving touch assist cant miss meter read with touch assist it has that advantage you know theres some guy in practice someplace in the middle west of the united states right now who does nothing but touch assists has never been trained as an auditor and has roaringly successful practice so we mustnt we mustnt sneer at these little things but i just give you the word of warning see you put 500horsepower supercharged engine in an aluminum tubularframed hull and it takes some neat driving thats all the driving is neat and if you notice on such car there are number of curves in the road ill just point out one little thing to you that there are number of curves in the road and therefore you cannot go on the average of not missing many you are allowed just one curve and then they bury you thats pretty near the way it is okay you think that might do you some good audience yes all right thank you audience thank you good night
