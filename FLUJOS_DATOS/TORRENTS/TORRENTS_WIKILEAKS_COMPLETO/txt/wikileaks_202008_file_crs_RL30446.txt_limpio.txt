community renewal legislation containing an increase in low income housing tax credits and private activity bonds the president signed the vahud fy2001 appropriations bill hr 4635 on october 27 pl 106377 the new law provides hud with 306 billion for fy2001 47 billion above the previous years 259 billion but 18 billion less than the administrations request all major programs received increased funding except for drug elimination grants and the hope program both funded at last years levels the housing certificate fund primarily section 8 rental assistance received 139 billion 26 billion more than the previous year although the house and senatepassed bills recommended few or incremental vouchers the conference report contained 483 million for 79000 new vouchers to increase voucher utilization 20 of vouchers up from 15 can be used at assisted rental projects provisions to increase both the low income housing tax credit and private activity bonds were attached to number of bills moving through the 106th congress none had become law until tax bill hr 5662 containing housing tax credit and private activity bond increases was added to broader appropriations package hr 4577 the president signed hr 4577 on december 21 2000 pl 106554 the tax credit cap will increase to 150 per capita in 2001 and to 175 in 2002 this change is expected to subsidize the construction of an additional 180000 rental units over the next 5 years the private activity bond cap will increase to the larger of 6250 per state resident or 1875 million in 2001 and 75 per resident or 225 million in 2002 number of affordable housing and homeownership provisions in hr 1776 bill passed by the house on april 6 by 4078 were added to bipartisan housing authorization bill hr 5640 the president signed this bill on december 27 2000 pl 106569 among the provisions in this wideranging act is the authorization to use section 8 housing vouchers to help families accumulate downpayments to purchase homes

president signed pl 106377 on october 27 the approved budget provides about 47 billion more than the 259 billion enacted for fy2000 thenhud secretary cuomo called it the best budget in 20 years although the amount is 18 billion less than president clinton had requested for hud negotiations between congress and administration representatives in late september and early october resulted in large increase in section 8 recaptures recaptures are unused funds from prior budget year that are taken back from public housing authorities either to be redirected into another fiscal years budget or as cancelled appropriation the 275 million of section 8 recaptures approved by both the house and senate increased to 18 billion in the conference negotiations the reprogramming of these funds allowed more funding for number of hud programs in some cases more than the administrations original request the housing certificate fund which provides rental assistance to about 3 million lowincome households received 139 billion nearly 26 billion more than the previous year although 187 million less than the clinton administrations request the administration had asked for 120000 new housing vouchers in response to the rising number of low income households paying more than half of their income for rent both the house and senatepassed bills recommended few or additional vouchers however the conference report included 453 million for 79000 new vouchers during the 106th congress there were discussions about the strong economy the resulting difficulties of using vouchers in tight rental markets and whether new hud production program was needed number of studies indicated growing shortage of affordable rental housing households with low income who pay more than 30 of their income for shelter for example in march 2000 hud sent report to congress rental housing assistance the worsening crisis which documented that record 54 million unassisted verylowincome families pay over half of their income for housing or live in severely distressed housing in june 2000 the center for housing policy released report housing americas working families1 which stated that having job does not guarantee family decent place to live at an affordable cost among its findings more than 220000 teachers 1 the center for housing policy research affiliate of the national housing conference housing americas working families new century housing june 2000 p 2 washington dc crs2 police and public safety officers across the country spend more than half their income for housing and the problem is growing worse the low level of incremental vouchers originally approved by the house and senate stands in contrast to the 50000 additional vouchers approved by congress for fy1999 and the 60000 for fy2000 during 2000 hud was called upon in congressional hearings to explain why so few of these 110000 incremental housing vouchers had been put to use the reasons generally given were that the sustained economic growth had driven down vacancy rates pushed up rents to levels where vouchers could not be used and made participation in the section 8 program less appealing to landlords who could easily fill their units with marketrate tenants and avoid the red tape of this program the house vahud appropriations subcommittee said that there was need to put more vouchers into the pipeline until the difficulties of using the current supply were adequately resolved both hud and the subcommittee discussed options to address this matter including increasing the fairmarket rents in some expensive areas and giving landlords more incentives to participate in the rental program as noted final negotiations produced an agreement for 79000 new housing vouchers prior to conference negotiations hud was concerned that many of its programs would either face cuts or be funded at the previous years level for example as passed by the house hr 4635 would have provided 50 million less for the public housing operating fund than requested and the public housing capital fund would have received 155 million less than in the previous year the senate bill approved funding for public housing at the clinton administrations requested amounts however the conference report provided 625 billion for these two funds about 95 million above the requested amount about 13 million families now live in public housing efforts to revitalize or replace nearly 100000 severely distressed public housing units continue under the hope vi program the conference report provided 575 million the same as the previous year but 50 million less than requested many housing organizations worry that fewer replacement units will be added than the number torn down under hope vi and that not all of the replacements will be affordable to those who are displaced since more mixed income communities are being built see crs report rl30589 hope vi the revitalization of severely distressed public housing by susan vanhorenbeck the clinton administrations fy2001 hud budget asked for an 18 increase in homeless assistance grants up 180 million from 1020 billion in fy2000 to 12 billion in fy2001 the conference report provided 1025 billion for homeless assistance grants and also for the first time funded the shelter plus care program in separate line item at 100 million thus the total approved for homeless programs for fy2001 was 1125 billion 105 million more than the previous year but 75 million less than requested programs for the elderly and disabled were funded in the conference report at close to 1 billion up from slightly more than 900 million the previous year several hud programs provide funds for the economic stabilization or revitalization of communities especially for areas with high unemployment and concentrated levels of poverty the conference report approved 5 billion for community development block grants significantly more than in either the house crs3 or senatepassed bills and about 100 million more than the administrations request the home block grant program also benefitted from last minute negotiations with the conference report providing 18 billion 200215

the poor 347 million for about 60000 additional general use vouchers funding for other large hud programs included 911 million for housing for the elderly and disabled 102 billion for homeless

fy199600 figures are from budget submissions of subsequent years estimates for fy2001 are from the house appropriations subcommittee on va hud and independent agencies low income housing tax credits and private activity bonds housing tax credits the low income housing tax credit lihtc 1986 provision in the federal tax code has become the major engine for subsidizing the production of assisted rental housing affordable to lower income households at least 800000 new and rehabilitated units have been supported over the programs 14 year history 1997 general accounting office study found that this program crs4 combined with funds from other federal housing programs was helping households with very low incomes averaging about 13300 per year these are families with incomes equal to about 37 of the area median considerably lower than the households with 50 to 60 of the median that the program was generally intended to serve with the robust economy reducing vacancy rates and pushing rents higher housing tax credits are being increasingly called upon to help prevent the loss of the existing stock of federallyassisted rental units rather than to increase the overall supply of affordable rental units an increasing number of tax credits are being used to encourage section 8 landlords with expiring contracts not to leave the program more tax credits are also being used to convince section 8 landlords to participate in the marktomarket program and more tax credits are being used with huds hope vi program which is tearing down some of the worst big city high rise public housing projects and replacing them with lowerdensity mixed income apartment complexes these new uses for housing tax credits along with reports about the difficulties tenants are having using housing vouchers in tight rental markets help explain the strong congressional support for increasing the annual supply of tax credits hr 175 n johnson and the identical s 1017 mack had more than 450 cosponsors these bills would have increased the annual amount of federal tax credits that state housing finance agencies can distribute to developers from 125 per person in the state to 175 and would also have indexed the limit to inflation this would have raised the yearly supply of tax credits by 40 an identical proposal was included in president clintons fy2001 budget request but without indexing for inflation several modified versions of these bills were added to other legislation moving through congress on december 15 2000 the house and senate passed hr 4577 h rept1061033 the consolidated appropriations act of 2001 incorporating the provisions of tax bill hr 5662 it will increase the housing tax credit cap to 150 for 2001 and 175 thereafter with indexation for inflation beginning in 2003 there will also be 2 million state minimum starting in 2001 with inflation protection beginning in 2003 this law also modifies the criteria for allocating housing credits among projects requiring community revitalization plans public housing waiting lists special housing needs and other factors to be taken into consideration there are also additional responsibilities for housing credit agencies including the requirement for comprehensive market study of the housing needs of lowincome households and for regular site visits to monitor noncompliance with habitability standards it is estimated that an increase in the cap to 175 will result in an additional 30000 tax credit units year at cost of 1 billion over 5 years and 6 billion over 10 years issues and concerns in terms of apartments produced the lihtc has been very successful as builders and investors have responded to this tax incentive although the extent if any to which these units would have been produced in the absence of the tax credit is not known but program of this size and complexity is free of concerns some observers worry that some of the more unfortunate results of past housing programs could surface later in this program crs5 for example there is concern that some of the early tax credit projects will be converted to marketrate units after their 15th year of service as the law allows under certain conditions creating an issue similar to landlords who opt out of huds section 8 assisted rental program recent report by the joint center for housing studies of harvard university and the neighborhood reinvestment corporation expiring affordability of lowincome housing tax credit properties the next era in preservation estimates that 15year affordability restrictions will end for the first 23000 tax credit units in 2002 the report concludes lack of monitoring or insufficient funds for property repair or purchase will place even properties for which there is interest in preserving affordability at risk of market conversion reduced incometargeting or disinvestment and decline p 37 there are also questions about whether the cost of producing tax credit rental units is reasonable relative to alternative ways of helping low income households with their housing needs new construction is almost always more expensive than the use of existing apartments and some observers think it is inappropriate to put low income households in new units while moderate income households nearby in less desirable housing struggle without assistance the general accounting office is currently conducting study to compare the costs of tax credit apartments with other existing federal rental housing programs others wonder about how well developers investors and state allocating agencies are following the complex requirements of this program the internal revenue service irs is concerned about noncompliance among early tax credit projects that have now passed the 10year credit period by which time all awarded tax credits have been claimed by the investor and may longer feel compelled to abide by program rules while the irs considers overall compliance with program requirements to be good there has been significant increase in the number of violations reported by irs field agents the agency has conducted broad criminal investigation of lowincome housing tax credit projects suspected of illegal activities housing and development reporter june 26 2000 the affordable housing finance magazine housingfinancecom reported on charges of favoritism and

tax exempt private activity bonds proceeds from the sale of these bonds are frequently used in conjunction with the lihtc program businesses and individuals who buy these bonds in effect lend money at belowmarket interest rates because they do not have to pay federal income tax on the interest they earn on these bonds the annual limit of bonds that each state could sell imposed in 1986 was the greater of 50 per capita or 150 million this cap was scheduled to be gradually increased to 75 per capita or 225 million over 5year period beginning in 2003 hr 864 houghton crs6 and s 459 breaux would

homes the average cost of new unit in 1998 was 43800 not counting the land compared with 136425 excluding land for new sitebuilt home according to the american association of retired persons aarp 44 of manufactured home owners are age 50 and above the industry has been regulated by hud since 1974 although the staff that oversees manufactured housing has declined from peak of 34 to less than quarter of that number in recent years in 1990 congress established national commission and pushed it to forge consensus on key reform issues but this effort collapsed in 1994 over proposal that installation defects be covered by 5year retailer warranty in october 1999 the housing and transportation subcommittee of the senate banking committee held hearings on s 1452 the american association of retired persons testified that the 1974 act is not working well for the manufactured housing industry nor for the owners of these homes and emphasized the failure to enforce the construction standards as now written huds assistant secretary for housing william apgar said his agency had worked with industry representatives and consumer groups for over decade in an effort to update the code to reflect changes in the technology that have transformed the industry but he noted numerous legislative initiatives have failed as consumers and manufacturers have wrangled over how best to regulate this industry vice president of fleetwood enterprises representing the industrys two national trade associations agreed that the act has not kept pace with the rapid evolution of the industry and its productsand said these associations enthusiastically supported the proposed reforms on april 6 2000 the house passed hr 1776 major homeownership bill that also contained reforms to huds manufactured housing regulations on may 2 2000 the senate passed s 1452 bill to revise the manufactured housing safety standards act of 1974 hr 5640 an affordable housing and homeownership bill that became law on

established to represent producers of manufactured housing 7 users of manufactured housing 7 and the general interest and public officials 7 the purpose of the committee will be to make recommendations to the hud secretary for developing amending and revising the federal manufactured home construction and safety standards act and the enforcement regulations twothirds vote will be required to adopt proposed standards states will have 5 years to adopt dispute resolution program for manufacturers retailers and installers to address the correction or repair of defects in manufactured homes reported within 1 year after the date of installation crs9 in states not adopting their own dispute resolution program hud could contract with an appropriate agent in the state to implement such program during these 5 years hud and the consensus committee will also be charged with developing model manufactured housing installation program in states not adopting an installation program hud could contract with an appropriate agent in those states to implement the model installation program this legislation also encourages innovation and costeffective construction techniques and calls for the establishment of practical and uniform federal construction standards to protect owners of manufactured homes from unreasonable risk of personal injury and property damage homeless assistance programs hr 1073 the homeless housing programs consolidation and flexibility act lazio would consolidate seven mckinney act homeless assistance programs into block grant to states the bill was voted out of the housing and community opportunity subcommittee of the house banking committee with minor amendments on april 15 1999 although further action occurred during the 106th congress the issue of block granting homeless assistance funds could come up in the 107th congress several significant homeless provisions were approved as part of the vahud fy2001 appropriations bill hr 2684 pl 106377 october 272000 these are summarized at the end of this homeless section on may 23 2000 the subcommittee on housing and transportation of the senate banking committee held hearings on the most appropriate means to consolidate homeless programs at hud the purpose was also to hear from the gao on the results of several of their completed studies on federal homeless programs one report found that there are 50 federal programs with funds that can assist the homeless with 16 programs targeted exclusively at the homeless2 since 1987 congress has appropriated over 12 billion under the hud mckinney programs at the hearing and elsewhere there has been some frustration expressed over evidence showing that despite the strong economy the number of homeless has not declined and may even have increased subcommittee chairman allard said this hearing was to begin discussion on how we do better on july 27 2000 senator allard introduced s 2968 the local housing opportunities act an omnibus housing bill that would consolidate and reform many current hud programs it would consolidate hud homeless assistance funds into the mckinney homeless assistance performance fund initially distributing funds according to the cdbg block grant formula every three dollars of federal block grant money would have to be matched with one dollar of state or local money although there is liberal definition of the match including salaries paid to staff volunteers and the value of lease on building converting to block grant means homeless funds would be distributed to states and localities based on formula most of the mckinney act homeless assistance is now awarded to metropolitan areas on competitive basis according to hud 2 us general accounting office homelessness coordination and evaluation of programs are essential february 1999 gaorced9949 crs10 there were about 3000 applications in 1999 with 1835 applicants receiving funds number of jurisdictions complain that this process is very time consuming and the uncertainty of winning funds makes longrange planning difficult they maintain that formulabased distribution would assure that more communities receive at least some funds opponents argue that giving funds to all communities based on static formula may not reflect changing needs in local areas or special situations they believe that the automatic distribution of funds would reduce the incentive to be creative and resultsoriented at the may 23 2000 hearing the thenhud deputy assistant secretary fred karnas jr testified that over the years hud has worked with local governments and their nonprofit partners to refine their efforts to attack homelessness he said that hud strongly opposed moving to formulabased process of distributing homeless assistance funds because it believed its current continuum of care approach balances local decisionmaking and flexibility with strong national performance goals and that this has proven very successful some nonprofit organizations that administer services to the homeless worry that block grant approach would lessen hud involvement in the mckinney programs suggesting more comfort with huds stewardship of these funds than with some state or local jurisdictions some advocacy groups for the homeless cite an increasing number of jurisdictions that they say are becoming overly harsh on the homeless treating them like criminals in some cases for survey of cities and how they have changed their laws see outlawing homelessness shelterforce national housing institute julyaugust 1999 maria foscarinis executive director of the national law center on homelessness and poverty says that nonprofit organizations are vulnerable to being denied funds for homeless assistance because their advocacy may have been critical of local government actions the conflict in late 1999 between the hud secretary and the mayor of new york city over the awarding of homeless grants gives an example of the tensions that can surface over the allocation of homeless assistance in this publicized case the hud secretary temporarily took control of 60 million of the citys federal homeless funds citing federal district court ruling that found the city had improperly tried to prevent group from receiving homeless assistance after they had criticized the mayors get tough approach to homeless people the hudva appropriations bill for fy2001 that was signed into law by president clinton on october 27 2000 hrept 106988 contained several homeless provisions the shelter plus care program that funds annual rental assistance contracts for families moving from homelessness to permanent housing was established under separate account at level of 100 million for the renewal of contracts expiring in fy2001 and fy2002 in addition government entities receiving homeless funds will be required to implement coordinated discharge system for individuals leaving institutions or health care facilities with the goal of preventing an immediate return to homelessness third at least 30 of all federal homeless funds must be used for permanent housing with the hope of moving away from system of temporary approaches to one of longterm solutions to homelessness crs11 on october 30 2000 president clinton signed hr 5417 into law pl 106 400 to rename the stewart b mckinney homeless assistance act as the mckinneyvento

earthquakes there had been predictions of hurricanes of increased intensity along the east coast and florida in the immediate years ahead although there was notably little hurricane activity in the year 2000 during the 1990s unusually expensive natural disasters have put strain on some insurance markets leaving some homeowners without coverage and increasing their risk of mortgage default some

distribution memorandum comparison of predatory lending legislation by bruce foote august 2 2000 use of surplus fha reserves for affordable housing the accounting firm of deloitte touche reported in2000 that the fha mutual mortgage insurance fund had record economic value of 166 billion at the end of fy 1999 more than 5 billion above previous estimates the fund was close to bankruptcy in the recession of 1990 with negative value of 27 billion since this report hud and various housing groups have discussed how this surplus might be used to increase affordable housing opportunities number of bills were introduced to address how the surplus might be used none of these bills were adopted during the 106th congress thenhud secretary cuomo said recommendations for using the surplus could include subsidizing the construction of new affordable rental housing funding for new rental assistance vouchers and homeownership initiatives new study by housing america and the national training and information center new direction how fha surpluses can solve americas housing crisis said since fha revenue has increased due to the economic prosperity that has contributed to the affordable housing shortage it is only appropriate to use the fha funds to mitigate and even reverse such impacts the report says that the 5 billion could produce over 200000 units of affordable housing on july 27 2000 senator john kerry introduced s 2997 the national affordable housing trust fund act the housing trust fund would receive income generated by the main fha mortgage insurance program that was in excess of the amount necessary to maintain capital ratio of 3 for the preceding fiscal year that some consider safe level of reserves similarly certain excess income from huds government national mortgage association would be directed into the housing trust fund currently the excess income from these programs is returned to the federal treasury and used to fund general government activities and thus perceived as lost to housing use however accounts are maintained by the treasury on whether these programs are running surplus or deficit much like the net balance of the social security trust fund under s 2997 money transferred into the housing trust fund would be used to build rental housing for extremely lowincome families and to promote homeownership for lowincome families the committee on banking housing and urban affairs subcommittee on housing and transportation held hearings on the fha surplus on september 12 2000 crs14 while not necessarily disagreeing about the need to address the issue of affordable housing some in congress are uncertain about the desirability of using the surplus reserves or profits from the fha insurance business assuming they are as large as the estimates to pay for other housing programs some believe that if the economy were to turn downward with unemployment increasing substantially from the current level that the fha surplus would rapidly be reduced among other alternatives being considered is to reduce the fha mortgage insurance premiums since they are paid by many minorities firsttime buyers and others of moderate incomes on july 12 2000 thenrepresentative lazio chairman of the house housing and community opportunities subcommittee introduced hr 4795 the homeowners rebate act of 2000 which would require hud to rebate fha excess reserves to certain fhainsured homeowners an identical bill s 2914 was introduced by senator allard on october 31 2000 hud announced homebuyer savings plan that the agency says will save more than one million homeowners with fhainsured mortgages more than 1 billion annually in insurance costs under the plan the fha upfront insurance premium was reduced from 225 to 15 of the original loan amount the plan also eliminated entirely fhas annual premium of 5 on all loans once homeowners build 22 equity in their home modeled after private mortgage insurance cancellation legislation passed by congress in 1998 under the third part of the plan current fha borrowers will receive refund on premiums paid when they sell their home or refinance their loan hud secretary cuomo said that none of the fhas 16 billion in reserves will go to pay for this premium cut and that the economic value of fhas insurance fund is expected to grow to 34 billion by 2006 for other versions of this document see
