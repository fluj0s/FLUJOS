judicial review that mark one of the national security letter practices constitutionally defective pr oponents of expanded use empha size the effectiveness of administrative subpoenas as an investiga tive tool and question the logic of its availability in drug and health care fraud cases but not in terrorism cases critics suggest that it is little more than constitu tionally suspect trophy power

administrative subpoenas in criminal investigations background and proposed adjustments by charles doyle background administrative subpoenas are not traditional tool of criminal law investigation but neither are they unknown administrative subpoe nas and criminal law overlap in at least four areas first under so administrative regime s it is crime to fail to comply with an agency subpoena or with court order secured to enforce it second most administrative schemes are subject to criminal prohibitions for programrelated misconduct of one kind or another such as bribery or false statements or for flagrant recalcitrance of those subject to regulatory direction in this mix agency subpoenas usually produce the grist for the administrative mill but occasionally unearth evidence that forms the basis for referral to the department of justice for criminal prosecution third in an increasing number of situations administrative subpoenas may be used forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22407crs2 purposes of conducting criminal investigation finally par ticularly in the context of subpoenas used for criminal investigativ purposes involving intelligence matters disclosure of the existence of s ubpoena may be criminal offense several statutes at least arguably aut horize the use of administrative subpoenas primarily or exclusive for use in criminal investigation in cases involving health care fraud child abuse secret rvice protection controlled s ubstance cases and inspector general investigations in ddition five statutory provisions vest government officials responsible for certain foreign intelligence i nvestigations with authority comparable to administrative subpoena access to various types of records administrative subpoenas generally administrative agencies have long held the power to issue subpoenas and subpoena s duces tecum in aid of the agencys adjudicative and investigative functions th ere are now over 300 instances where federal agencies have been granted administrative subpoena power in form or another the statute granting the power ordinarily desc ribes the circumstances under which it may be exercised the scope of the authority forcement procedures and sometimes limitations on dissemination of the informa tion subpoenaed in some instances the statute may grant the power to issue subpoena duces tecum but explicitly or implicitly deny the agency authority to compel testimony the statut may authorize use of the subpoena power in conjunction with an agencys investigations or its administrative hearings or both authority is usually conferre d upon tribunal or upon the head of the agency although some statutes preclude or limit delegation agen cy heads are usually free to delegate such authority and to authorize its redelegation thereafter within the agency failure to comply with an administrative subpoena may pave the way for denial of license or permit or some similar adverse administrative decision in the matter to which the issuance of the subpoena was originally related in most instances however administrative agencies ultimately rely upon the courts to enforce th eir subpoenas generally the statute that grants the subpoena power will spell out the procedure for its enforcement objections to the enforcement of administrative subpoenas must be derived from one of three sources constitutional provision an understanding on the part of congress or the general standards governing judicial enforcement of administrative subpoenas constitutional challenges aris most often under the fourth amendments condemnation of unreasonable searches and seizures the fifth amendments privilege against self incrimination or the claim that in criminal context the administrative subpoena process is an intrusion into the power of the grand jury and its concomitant fifth amendment right to grand jury indictment in an early examination of the questions the supreme court held that the fourth amendment did not preclude enforcement of an administrative subpoena issued by the wage and hour administration notwithstanding the want of probable cause neither the fourth amendment nor the unclaimed fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination were thought to pose any subs tantial obstacle to subpoena enforcement soon thereafter second case echoed the same message the fourth amendment does not demand great deal of administrative subpoenas addressed to corporate entities governmental investigation into corporate matters may be of such sweeping nature and so unrelated to the matter properly under inqui ry as to exceed the investigatory power but it is sufficient if the inquiry is within the authority of agency the demand is not too indefinite and the information sought is reas onably relevant the gist of the protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22407crs3 is in the requirement that the disclosure s ought shall not be unreasonable statute or judicial tolerance however may require what the constitution does not nevertheless when asked if the internal revenue serv ice irs must have probable cause before issuing summons for the production of documen ts the court intoned the standard often repeated in response to an administrativ subpoena challenge the commissioner need not meet any standard of probable cause to obtain enforcement of his summons he must show 1 that the investigation will be conduc ted pursuant to legitimate purpose 2 that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose 3 that the information sought is not already within the commissioners possession and 4 that the administrative steps required by the code have been followed this does not mean that unde r circumstances may the court inquire into the underlying reason for the examination it is the courts process which is invoked to enforce the administra tive summons and c ourt may not permit its process to be abused criminal administrative subpoe nas controlled substances act the earliest of the three federal statutes 21 usc 876 used extensively for criminal investigative purposes appear ed with little fanfare as part of the 1970 controlled substances act and empowers the attorn ey general to issue subpoenas in any investigation relating to his f unctions under the act in spite of its spacious language the legislative history of section 876 emphasiz the value of the subpoena power for administrative purposes its utility in assigning and reassigning substances to the acts various schedules and in regulating the activities of physicians pharmacists and the pharmaceutical industry rather than as criminal law enfo rcement tool nevertheless the attorney general has delegated the au thority to issue subpoenas under section 876 to both administrative and criminal law enfo rcement personnel and the courts have approved its use in inquiries conducted exclus ively for purposes of criminal investigation section 876 authorizes both testimonial subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum it provides for judicial enforcement failure to comply with the courts order to obey the subpoena is punishable as contempt of court it contains explicit prohibition on disclosure inspectors general the language of the in spector general act of 1978 provision is just as general as its controlle d substance counterpart each inspector general in carrying out the provisions of this act is authorized to require by subpoena the production of all information n ecessary in the performance of the functions assigned by this act its legislative history supplies somewhat clearer evidence of an investigative tool intended for use in both administrative and criminal investigations the justice department reports that the inspector ge nerals administrative subpoena authority is mainly used in criminal investigations and the courts have held that the act gives the inspectors general both civil and criminal i nvestigative authority and subpoena powers coextensive with that authority the act c ontains explicit prohibition on disclosure of the existence or specifics of s ubpoena issued under this authority health care child abuse and presidential protection unlike its companions there can be little doubt that 18 usc 3486 is intended for use primarily in connection with criminal investigations it is an amalgam of three relatively recent statutory provisions one the original dea ling with health care fraud one with child abuse offenses and one with threats against the president and others who fall under secret service protection section 3486 is both more explicit and more explicitly protective than either of its controlled substance or ig stat utory counterparts in addition to judicialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22407crs4 enforcement provision it specifically author izes motions to quash and ex parte nondisclosure court orders it affords those served reasonable period of time to assemble subpoenaed material and respond and in the case of health care investigations the subpoena may call for deliv ery more than 500 miles away in child abuse and presidential investigation cases however it imposes such geographical limitation and it may contemplate the use of forthwith subpoenas it includes safe harbor subsection that shields those who comply in good faith from civil liability and in health care investigations limits further dissemination of the information secured although the authority of section 3486 has b een used fairly extensively reported case law has been relatively sparse and limited to health care investigation subpoenas the first of these simply held that the subj ect of record subpoenaed from third party custodian has standing to move that th administrative subpoena be quashed the others addressed constitutional challenges and with one relatively narrow exception agreed that subpoenas in question complied w ith the demands of the fourth amendment they cite oklahoma press powell and morton salt for the view that administrative subpoenas under section 3486 need not satisfy probable cause standard the fourth amendment only demands that th subpoena be reasonable standard that requires that 1 it satisfies the terms of its authorizing statute 2 the documents requested were relevant to the department of justice s investigation 3 the information sought is not already in the department of justice s possession and 4 enforcing the subpoena will not constitute an abuse of the courts process of the three statutes that most clearly anticipate use of administrative subpoenas during criminal investigation section 3486 is the most detailed ne ither of the others has nondisclosure feature nor restricti on on further dissemination neither has an explicit safe harbor pr ovision nor an express procedure fo r motion to quash all three however provide for judicial enforcement reenforced by the contempt power of the court only the controlled substance authority of 21 usc 876 clearly extends beyond the power to subpoena records and other docum ents to encompass testimonial subpoena authority as well the inspector genera l act speaks only of subpoenas for records documents and the like and has been held to not include testimonial subpoenas section 3486 strikes position somewhere in between the custodian of subpoenaed records or documents may be compelled to testify cerning them but there is indication that the section otherwise conveys the pow er to issue testimonial subpoenas proposals for change although more extensive pr oposals were offered in the 108th congress the law enforcement related administrative subpoena proposals in the 109th congress appear in s 600 relating to th secretary of states responsibility to protect us foreign missions and foreign di gnitaries visiting this country in hr 3726 relating to federal obscenity i nvestigations and in hr 4170 relating to the apprehension of fugitives charged or convicted of federal or state felonies
