bridge publications inc newsletter date space and the future we havein this universe space has peculiarly and there are three kinds of space marking on blackboard three kinds of space theres was space is space and will be space theres three kinds of space and how is this space formed by postulating it exists very tough mechanistically i mean youre either going to worry over this and worry over thisbut how does space get there its because you say its there and the fellow cant admit that he has this much power because if he admitted he had this much power then he could change the future and his mind running on stimulusresponse mechanism and not under control and cant be trusted might destroy his future so he cant permit anything to be postulated in the present so he says i couldnt possibly postulate space space must have an actual entitymust be in existence l ron hubbard excerpted from the command of theta lectures the secrets behind declining civilization an article by l ron hubbard from the command of theta lectures oh yes it could happen the greatest empire on the face of the earth went by the boardsthe greatest empire earth had known went by the boardsbecause of the miracles produced by thirteen men now remember that and boy it caved in quick but it caved in because it was vile and vicious empire and all it took was an injection of hope into the multitude thats all it took something can happen for us we are not pinned here forever we dont have to be in apathy and you know what they learned they learned very interesting fact and that interesting datum was this they knew this inherently and they learned this then by religious teaching we cant die we dont die there is life after death thats what they learned and therefore you could fly in the teeth of any unreasonable force because you couldnt be punished simply by having your body cut up to pieces now weve gone on the opposite side of insanity they had body that could die so they were spared the other and they learned all of sudden that the machine guns of large and vicious stateit wasnt machine guns in those days they did it with arenas and crucifixeswere powerless because all they could do was kill them thats all that could happen to them they could just be killed and boy that state which reduced into slavery almost two thirds of its populationtwo thirds of its populating was living in kennels the like of which you wouldnt keep london pet inand they suddenly said youre through boys and roman empire was through now im not saying at any moment that theres any great empire to be overthrown at the present time there isnt we havent got an empire in this world today we just dont have one there is an anarchy of nations the family of nations on earth today live in anarchy and they go to war because the people are afraid you can make populace afraid so long as the populace believes it can die and you can make it so afraid of dying that they will enter into the enterprise of killing and dying to just throw in the sponge finally and say well thats all thats fantastic thing but if you took some of the pressure off just took some of the pressure off internationally it would be very very difficult for anybody to get people hot enough so that we would have another war if just the people in this room did their job well and spotted their target where the target should beand you dont have to go out and stand on soapboxes or anything else all you have to do is apply some techniques thats all and theyre easy techniques to apply and all of sudden bunch of cant cases suddenly can and people say hey whats happening you dont have to have it in the newspapers the devil with the newspapers the only publicity there is thats worth anything is just word of mouth its uncle joe getting helped and aunt agatha hearing about it and it looks slow at first and it creeps at first but then it goes little faster and little faster and little faster and with theta clearing they knownobody has to tell them againthey know they cant be killed now thats fascinating isnt it you actually can carry message to the people of the world to the effect that man is immortal and that takes all the international pressure offjust that little fact all by itself and lets take much more important project than insanityinfinitely more important than insanity lets take one just one criminals criminals supposing all the time in the past the psychotherapists have been putting in on insane people they put in on criminals the criminal is kind of bad off but hes criminal because hes in revolt against the society and because he is degraded and hes easy to patch up and the best way to patch up the criminal is to get the young criminal and the young criminal is so easy to process youd ashamed of yourself for ever thinking for two seconds that you couldnt handle these techniques you get ahold of some young juvenile delinquent and you say just be yard back of your head bang you say all right change the postulate about how you have to get even with everybody bang okay step back inside thats fine johnny next youd be ashamed of yourself if you were to learn how easy it was to process out of existence the criminal and you had spent thousand hours of auditing time curing up somebodys aunt who believes that the goblins are going to get her and curing up mr blow the notorious alcoholic just because his family had money youd have feeling of shame and bad time investment all of sudden you walk into this big problem which is big problem in the world today you know why nations go mad they go mad because of police and why do you have to have police because you have criminals and why do they go mad because of police because the police exist as the interconnecting link between the honest forthright and constructive citizen and the criminal element of the society they carry plague you take police sergeant who has had to be in the midst of criminals for four or five or six months and you turn him loose amongst bunch of good citizens and he takes days and days to reorient he has terrible time reorienting awful gosh its very amusing thing theyve found in most police forces now that you have to take people off the criminal division and put them in the traffic division regularly every three or six months and what do they do the first few days that they are in the traffic division pull over to the curb where do you think youre going fire well heres ticket were going to show you few weeks later the fellow said whats the matter you in an awful hurry well thats all right only just dont take it so fast dont take it so fastother people on the road too okay next lets go fantastic if you dont think the criminal actually is in an aberrated area but the only reason its terrifically aberrated and terrifically aberrative is because the police are applying force to it oh youd be amazed at how much force the police force exerts against the criminal and when that much violence and when that much lawlessness can exist in society that society can be oppressed down the tone scale the best man in it eventually is longer free and was results when freedom goes l ron hubbard from the
