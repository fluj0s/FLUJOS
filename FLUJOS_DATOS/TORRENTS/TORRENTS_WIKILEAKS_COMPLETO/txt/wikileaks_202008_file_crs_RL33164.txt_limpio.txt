other disaster with special emphasis on hurricane katrina updated december 14 2005 gerald mayer economic analyst domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress understanding government employment data after natural or other disaster with special emphasis on hurricane katrina summary the federal government uses surveys of households and employers to estimate monthly employment and unemployment natural or other disaster may disrupt the collection of labor force data in addition survey estimates of employment and unemployment may not fully capture the job loss resulting from disaster at the beginning of each month the us bureau of labor statistics bls releases employment and unemployment data for the previous month the monthly national unemployment rate is based on the current population survey cps which is commonly called the household survey each month the bls also releases estimates of the number of wage and salary jobs for the previous month these estimates come from the current employment statistics ces survey commonly called the payroll or establishment survey the local area unemployment statistics laus program uses data from the household survey establishment survey unemployment compensation uc program and other sources to produce monthly estimates of employment and unemployment for approximately 7200 geographic areas in the united states these data are used to administer and allocate funds under numerous federal programs natural or other disaster may result in loss of jobs due to damage to buildings and infrastructure eg roads bridges or utilities the job loss may extend to governments that lose tax revenue and businesses that lose customers because of the labor force definitions used in the household and establishment surveys estimates of employment and unemployment may not fully capture the job loss from disaster some persons who lose their jobs may be counted as employed other persons may be classified as having left the labor force ie neither employed nor unemployed in addition it may be difficult to separate the employment effects of disaster from the effects of other factors eg changes in interest rates business investment consumer spending and government spending finally because the monthly estimates of employment and unemployment are based on samples of households and employers any reported monthtomonth changes in employment may not be statistically significant natural or other disaster may result in shortterm loss of jobs rebuilding generally creates jobs and restores lost jobs rebuilding may however result in temporary mismatch of skills therefore some persons who lose their jobs may not return to work soon for example the skills needed to rebuild bridge levee office building or house may be different from the skills needed to operate store casino restaurant or other business in the longerterm rebuilding may raise employment above levels that existed before the disaster the employment effects may be widespread some people may move away from disaster area affecting employment and unemployment elsewhere on the other hand rebuilding may attract workers to the disaster area and increase the demand for goods produced elsewhere eg building materials office equipment and household goods this report will be updated as issues warrant contents introduction 1 how

2005 laus data 11 understanding government employment data after natural or other disaster with special emphasis on hurricane katrina introduction the federal government uses surveys of households and employers to estimate monthly employment and unemployment the information is used in determining both fiscal spending and revenues and monetary policy money supply and interest rates and to administer and allocate funds under numerous federal programs natural or other disaster may disrupt the collection of labor force data in addition survey estimates of employment and unemployment may not fully capture the job loss resulting from disaster this report describes and compares three sources of government labor force data 1 the monthly current population survey cps commonly called the household survey 2 the current employment statistics ces survey commonly called the payroll or establishment survey and 3 the local area unemployment statistics laus program the report also examines the potential effect of natural or other disaster on government estimates of employment and unemployment and considers why these estimates may not fully reflect the job loss caused by disaster the report gives special emphasis to hurricane katrina according to news and other accounts the damage to homes and businesses caused by hurricanes rita and wilma was less severe than the damage caused by hurricane katrina nevertheless where rita and wilma caused damage similar to katrina the effects on labor force data may be similar the appendix provides reference guide to the sources of data and labor force concepts discussed in the report how the government estimates monthly employment and unemployment the governments usual practice is to survey households and businesses to estimate monthly employment and unemployment the surveys provide reliable labor force data for the nation states cities counties and other geographic areas this section describes and compares three sources of monthly labor force data1 1 for more discussion of the concepts and surveys discussed here see crs report rl32642 employment statistics differences and similarities in jobbased and personbased employment and unemployment estimates by julie m whittaker and us department of labor bureau of labor statistics employment from the bls household and payroll continued crs2 employment and unemployment estimates based on the household survey at the beginning of each month the us bureau of labor statistics bls releases employment and unemployment estimates for the previous month the estimates are from the cps which is household survey conducted for bls by the us census bureau the cps collects information on the size of the labor force and the number of persons who are employed or unemployed the survey also collects wide range of demographic social and economic information eg age gender race education hours worked and earnings the survey does not include persons in institutions eg nursing homes mental institutions and prisons persons in hotels or motels or individuals on active military duty the survey provides reliable monthly estimates of national employment and unemployment and annual estimates of employment and unemployment for the 50 states and the district of columbia the data are based on persons state of residence2 in november 2005 according to the household survey the total us labor force numbered 1502 million persons 1426 million were employed and 76 million were unemployed3 because the labor force data from the household survey are estimates based on sample of households monthtomonth changes in employment or unemployment may not be statistically significant4 for instance monthtomonth change in national employment of less than 436000 is not statistically significant5 employment estimates based on the establishment survey each month the bls also releases estimates of the number of wage and salary jobs for the previous month these estimates are from the ces survey

2005 available at httpstatsblsgov p 2 hereafter cited as bls the employment situation november 2005 4 employment estimates based on surveys have two kinds of error nonsampling and sampling error examples of nonsampling error include information that is misreported and errors made in processing collected information sampling error occurs because sample and not the entire population is surveyed the difference between an estimate based on sample and the actual population value is known as sampling error when using sample data researchers typically construct confidence intervals around population estimates confidence intervals provide information about the accuracy of estimated values 5 bls employment from the bls household and payroll surveys p 3 crs3 survey of nonfarm establishments the survey collects information on the number of payroll jobs hours worked and employee earnings the survey does not include selfemployed persons unpaid family workers private household workers agricultural workers or persons on active military duty the survey provides reliable monthly estimates of national and state employment the estimates are based on the place of work6 according to the establishment survey in november 2005 there were an estimated 1343 million payroll jobs nationwide7 because the payroll survey does not collect information from all establishments change in monthtomonth national employment of less than 103000 is not statistically significant8 local area unemployment statistics the laus program is cooperative program between bls and state employment security agencies the program produces monthly employment and unemployment estimates for approximately 7200 geographic areas in the united states these areas include states counties and cities of 25000 or more9 laus estimates are based on persons place of residence federal programs laus data are used to administer and allocate funds under numerous federal programs for example under the food stamp program state may request waiver of the work requirements for ablebodied adults without dependents for areas where the unemployment rate is over 10 or there are insufficient jobs10 under the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program the period allowed for job search increases from 6 to 12 weeks if the state unemployment rate is at least 50 above the national average11 in some states extended unemployment benefits are triggered if the state unemployment rate for the most recent threemonth period is at least 65 and at least 10 above the state unemployment rate for the same threemonth period in either of the two preceding 6 bls handbook of methods chapter 2 pp 15 8 bls employment and earnings vol 52 jan 2005 pp 287290 7 bls the employment situation november 2005 p 2 8

temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant primer on financing and requirements for state programs by gene falk crs4 years12 laus data are also used in economic development programs and programs affecting dislocated workers youth veterans and others13 most of the federal programs that use data from the laus program use data for period covering year or more but in case period of less than three months in some cases laus data are used to administer programs in other cases federal programs use laus data to allocate federal funds to state and local areas or to determine whether state or area is eligible for federal funds14 differences in the three sources of labor force data the monthly estimates of employment and unemployment from the above sources of labor force data may differ for several reasons definition of employment the definition of employment differs between the household and establishment surveys the establishment survey estimates the number of payroll jobs the household survey estimates the number of persons employed in the household survey person with more than one job is only counted once in the establishment survey person with more than one job is counted more than once definitions of unemployment and not in the labor force the establishment survey does not estimate the number of persons who are unemployed the household survey estimates the number of persons who are unemployed as well as the number of persons who are not in the labor force person is unemployed if they do not have job but they are available and looking for work person who is not employed or looking for work is not in the labor force who is included in the surveys the household survey includes persons not included in the establishment survey farm workers the selfemployed private household workers and unpaid family workers15 the ages of persons included in the surveys the household survey collects labor force information on persons ages 16 and over the 12 alabama louisiana and mississippi do not use this trigger for extended benefits for discussion of extended unemployment benefits see crs report rl33084 unemployment and employment programs available to workers from alabama louisiana and mississippi affected by hurricane katrina by julie m whittaker and ann lordeman 13 for list of federal uses of laus data see us department of labor bureau of labor statistics administrative uses of local area unemployment statistics available at httpstatsblsgovlaulauadminusespdf herafeter cited as bls administrative uses of local area unemployment statistics 14 in fy2003 laus data were used in programs that accounted for an estimated 45 billion in federal spending most of this spending was under tanf and the food stamp program bls administrative uses of local area unemployment statistics p 3 15 selfemployed persons work for themselves in an unincorporated business unpaid family workers work 15 hours or more week as unpaid workers in family business crs5 establishment survey collects information on all nonfarm wage and salary workers regardless of age estimates from survey samples versus estimates from statistical models the labor force data from the household and establishment surveys are based on samples of households and employer establishments the state and local estimates of employment and unemployment from the laus program are based on statistical models which use data from the household and establishment surveys as well as data from the unemployment compensation uc program and other sources16 how employment and unemployment data may be affected by natural or other disaster with special emphasis on hurricane katrina natural or other disaster may disrupt the collection of labor force data which may affect the accuracy of employment and unemployment estimates in addition labor force data from the household and establishment surveys may not fully capture the number of jobs lost as result of disaster data collection estimates of employment under both the household and establishment surveys are based on samples of households and employers respectively households and businesses that are damaged or destroyed by disaster and that are in the survey samples may not be surveyed therefore at least temporarily employment estimates under both the household and establishment surveys may be based on smaller samples which generally reduces the statistical accuracy of labor force data hurricane katrina because of the damage and destruction of homes and businesses caused by hurricane katrina normal data collection under both the household and establishment surveys was disrupted17 in response for september and october 2005 bls modified its usual data collection and estimation procedures in some cases these changes were unprecedented due to the extent of the damage and the nearevacuation of new orleans household survey in september 2005 census interviewers did not attempt to contact survey households located in the city of new orleans or in jefferson parish interviewers did attempt to contact survey households in the remainder of the 16 the unemployment compensation program was created by the social security act of 1935 pl 74271 the program is commonly called the unemployment insurance or ui program 17 the information in this report on the impact of hurricane katrina on data collection under the household and establishment surveys is from us department of labor bureau of labor statistics effects of hurricane katrina on bls employment and unemployment data collection and estimation dec 2 2005 available at httpstatsblsgov crs6 gulf coast disaster area following usual procedures persons living in temporary shelters churches hotels or motels were not surveyed in october interviewing resumed in new orleans and in jefferson parish from september to november fewer households especially in louisiana and mississippi were surveyed18 households and persons in the area who were interviewed were given larger sample weights which may result in less accurate estimates of employment and unemployment establishment survey many employer establishments in the gulf coast were damaged or destroyed by hurricane katrina according to bls over third of employers in the disaster area have payroll offices outside of the area in september bls received normal response from these employers in september and october bls attempted to follow up by telephone with employers in the gulf coast area who did not respond to the survey nevertheless the response rates for both months were lower than normal in louisiana and mississippi19 if bls was not able to contact an employer bls assumed that the employer did not have any employees on its payroll in louisiana and mississippi for both september and october sample weights were increased for establishments that did respond to the survey the result again may be less accurate estimates of employment in november bls resumed normal data collection and estimation procedures laus program the laus program produces estimates of state and local employment and unemployment the program uses data from the household and establishment surveys as well as administrative data from the uc program the statistical models used to produce laus estimates smooth out large monthtomonth changes in claims for uc and payroll employment for september and october however in order to improve the employment estimates for louisiana and mississippi the large changes in claims for uc and payroll employment were not smoothed out20 employment estimates after disaster because of labor force definitions in the household and establishment surveys estimates of employment and unemployment may not fully capture the job loss from disaster persons who have lost their jobs may be classified as employed under both the household and establishment surveys under the household survey other persons who have lost their jobs may be classified as not in the labor force ie 18 compared with august in september about 600 fewer interviews were conducted in alabama louisiana and mississippi in october about 250 fewer interviews were conducted in november about 100 fewer interviews were conducted 19 in september the nationwide response rate to the establishment survey was 67 the response rate was 57 in louisiana and 62 in mississippi the response rates for louisiana and mississippi for october were also below normal for november the gap in response rates between the gulf coast states and the rest of country closed considerably 20 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics regional and state employment and unemployment september 2005 available at httpstatsblsgov pp 12 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics regional and state employment and unemployment october 2005 available at httpstatsblsgov pp 12 crs7 neither employed nor unemployed in addition the longterm employment effects of disaster may differ from the shortterm effects household survey the household survey may understate the job loss from hurricane katrina when the census bureau contacts survey households respondents are classified as employed unemployed or not in the labor force based on their activities during the reference week for the survey person who is temporarily absent from work is counted as employed whether or not they are being paid for the time off or whether they are looking for work other persons who have lost their jobs may be classified as not in the labor force for example person may not be looking for work because they are busy repairing or rebuilding their home someone may not be looking for work because they believe there are jobs available or there are jobs for which they would qualify person may not be looking for job because of lack of transportation family responsibilities or injuries suffered during the disaster person may be doing volunteer work for religious charitable or similar organization individuals who leave the labor force after disaster may later reenter the labor force and be counted as either employed or unemployed establishment survey due to offsetting factors the establishment survey may either overstate or understate the job loss from hurricane katrina on the one hand many employers whose businesses were damaged or destroyed by the hurricane have said that they will offer their employees jobs at other locations some employers have said that they will continue to pay their employees in some cases for period of up to three months or more21 the katrina emergency tax relief act of 2005 pl 10973 includes an employee retention tax credit for small businesses that were damaged by hurricane katrina and that continue to pay employees who worked in the disaster area even if the employees are not working22 because the establishment survey counts the number of persons on an employers payroll even if the employees are not working and do not have jobs to which they can return anytime soon the survey may understate the extent of worker displacement from hurricane katrina in addition selfemployed persons private households and unpaid family members some of whom may have lost their jobs are not included in the survey 21 bureau of national affairs following katrina employers look to assist pay workers get operations up and running daily labor report 175 sept 12 2005 p c2 bureau of national affairs gulf coast casinos offer employees aid continued pay benefits following katrina daily labor report 175 sept 12 2005 p c4 22 the credit is available to businesses that are not operating because of damage caused by hurricane katrina and that had 200 or fewer employees the credit is available if employees continue to work for the same employer but at another location the credit is available on wages paid through the end of 2005 or if sooner until the employer resumes significant operations at the location damaged by the hurricane crs report rl30089 the work opportunity tax credit wotc and the welfaretowork wtw tax credit by linda levine pl 10973 section 202 on november 18 2005 the senate approved the tax relief act of 2005 s 2020 which would extend the employee retention tax credit to all businesses regardless of size crs8 on the other hand if an employer did not respond to the september or october surveys bls assumed that the employer did not have any employees on its payroll for this reason the survey may overstate the job loss from hurricane katrina because some employers may in fact be operating the net effect of these two offsetting factors on the estimates of payroll employment in the gulf coast area is uncertain shortterm versus longterm employment effects the longerterm employment effects of disaster may be different from the shortterm effects first although disaster may cause shortterm loss of jobs rebuilding may create jobs and restore lost jobs rebuilding may raise employment above earlier levels23 rebuilding may result in temporary mismatch of skills however for example the skills needed to rebuild bridge levee office building or house may be different from the skills needed to operate store casino restaurant or other business therefore some persons who were not working before disaster may find jobs while other persons who lost their jobs may not find work soon hours of work may also be affected some workers may work longer hours others may work fewer hours second the job loss from disaster may continue for several weeks or months for example on october 4 2005 the mayor of new orleans announced that because of loss of tax revenue the city would layoff as many as 3000 city workers24 other city and county governments in the affected area may do the same businesses that were not damaged but lost customers because of hurricane katrina may also lay off workers third the employment effects of disaster may be widespread disaster may cause some people to move away from the area on the other hand rebuilding may attract workers to the area and increase the demand for goods produced elsewhere eg building materials office equipment and household goods thus the employment effects of hurricane katrina will likely extend beyond the gulf coast finally employment and unemployment change for many reasons therefore it may be difficult to isolate the employment effects of disaster from the effects of other factors such as changes in interest rates business investment and government and consumer spending for instance bls reported that nonfarm payroll employment nationwide increased by an estimated 17000 jobs from august to september by 44000 jobs in october and by 215000 jobs in november25 the changes in september and october were not statistically significant the relatively 23 kevin l kliesen the economics of natural disasters the regional economist federal reserve bank of st louis apr 1994 p 7 after four large hurricanes hit the

level of employment nationwide suggests that the job loss caused by katrina from august to september when most of the job losses occurred eg see table 1 was partially offset by job gains caused by other factors the stable level of employment from september to october on the other hand suggests that job growth nationwide slowed because of factors not directly related to katrina hurricane katrina this section examines the employment situation in alabama louisiana and mississippi before and immediately after hurricane katrina hit the gulf coast on august 29 2005 the section also summarizes initial estimates of job loss caused by katrina employment before and immediately after hurricane katrina table 1 shows estimates of employment from the establishment survey for alabama louisiana and mississippi for august through october 2005 the table shows that from august to september there was large decline in employment in the three states the decline occurred mainly in louisiana and mississippi from september to october there was little or recovery in employment from august to september employment in alabama louisiana and mississippi fell by an estimated 295900 jobs the largest decreases were in louisiana 240000 and mississippi 52300 prior to katrina estimates of monthtomonth changes in employment from the establishment survey were significant if they were more than 7900 in alabama 8100 in louisiana and 5700 in mississippi26 therefore from august to september the employment decreases in louisiana and mississippi were statistically significant the decrease in alabama 3600 was not table 1 also shows that from september to october employment in the three states increased by an estimated 7700 jobs thus the decline in employment from august to october 288200 occurred in the first month after the hurricane from september to october mississippi registered statistically significant increase in employment of 6700 jobs 26 calculated by crs from us department of labor

the establishment survey data from the laus program show that the decline in employment from august to october 309700 occurred mainly in the first month after the hurricane initial estimates of job loss from hurricane katrina cbo the congressional budget office cbo has estimated that hurricane katrina may have resulted in job loss of 280000 to 40000030 the lower bound of cbos estimate comes from the number of claims for unemployment compensation filed during the first four weeks after hurricane katrina hit the gulf coast31 the upper bound of cbos estimate comes from an estimate of payroll employment in the areas most severely damaged by the storm32 according to cbo the effect of hurricane rita on employment appears to be considerably smaller than the effect of hurricane katrina33 claims for unemployment compensation according to the employment and training administration eta of the us department of labor through the week ending december 3 2005 an estimated 599700 people who lost their jobs as the result of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma filed claims for regular uc after hurricane katrina hit the coast34 the number of claims for regular uc does not include claims filed under the disaster unemployment assistance dua program which provides assistance to persons who are unemployed as result of major disaster but are not eligible for regular uc in september and october

mississippi 11 establishments had at least 50 workers who filed uc claims during the fourweek period ending october 29 2005 total of 1140 workers from these 11 establishments filed claims for uc36 other estimates according to survey of 50 economists katrina may have resulted in loss of 500000 to 750000 nonfarm payroll jobs in september37 according to an estimate by the conference board the job
