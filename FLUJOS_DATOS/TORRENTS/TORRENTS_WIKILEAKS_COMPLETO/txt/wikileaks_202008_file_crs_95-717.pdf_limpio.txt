circumstances are not limited to the same circumstances but include analo gous circumstances ited states v olson 546 us 43 47 2005 5 united states v olson supra note 4federal tort claims act introduction the federal tort claims act ftc 28 usc 1346b 26712680 is the statute by which the united states authorizes tort suits to be brought against itself as result of the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity the united states cannot be sued without its consent1 congress alone has the power to waive or qualify that immunity2 in 1946 by enacting the ftca congress waived sovereign immunity for some tort suits with exceptions it made the united states liable for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any empl oyee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or em ployment under circumstances where the united states if private person would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred 28 usc 1346b thus the ftca makes the united states liable for the torts of its employees3 to the extent that private employers are liable under state law for the torts of their employees4 the fact that state law would make state or municipal entity as opposed to private person liable under like circum stances is not sufficient to make the united states liable under the ftca5 the ftca however contains exceptions under which the united states may not be held liable even t hough private employ er could be held liable under state law three of these exceptions are examined in separate sections of this report the feres doctrine which prohibits suits by military personnel for injuries sustainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs2 6 federal civilian employees covered by the federal employees compensation act 5 usc 8101 et seq are also prohibited from suing under the ftca for workrelated injuries 5 usc 8116c 7 the requirement in 28 usc 1346b that liability be based on negligent or wrongful act or omission has been construed to preclude strict liability see dalehite v united states 346 us 15 4445 1953 however th national swine flu immunization program of 1976 pl 94380 made the united states liable for injuries arising out of the administration of the swine flu vaccine to th extent that manufacturers would be liable under state law including negligence strict liability in tort and breach of warranty 8 in molzof v united states 502 us 301 1992 the supreme court held that damages for future medical expenses and loss of enjoym ent of life for veteran in permanent vegetative state as result of government hospital employees negligence were not punitive and therefore could be awarded the government had argued that these damages were punitive rather than compensatory in nature because the award for future medical expenses duplicated free medical services alre ady being provided by the veterans hospital and the award for loss of enjoyment of life ca nnot redress comatose patients uncognizable loss the court held however that 2674 bars the recovery only of what are legally considered punitive damages under traditional commonlaw principles id at 312 emphasis in original 9 subsequent exceptions cited in the ntence also appear in 28 usc 2680 10 in dolan v united states postal service 546 us 481 2006 the supreme court held that the postal exception is inapplicable to claim that mail left on the plaintiffs porch caused her to trip and fall just as it is inapp licable to the negligent operation of postal motor vehicles congress intended to retain imm unity the court wrote only for injuries arising directly or consequentially because mail either fails to arrive at all or arrives late in damaged condition or at the wrong address id at 489 losses of this type the court added are at least to some degree avoidable or compensable through postal registration and insurance id at 490 11 section 6241 of the technical and cellaneous revenue act of 1988 pl 100647 authorizes taxpayers to sue the united states if any officer or employee of the internal revenue service recklessly or intentionally disregards any provision of the internal revenue code and to recover up to 100000 in actual direct economic damages sustained as result of such action 26 usc 7433 12 public law 106185 2000 added an exception to this exception to the ftca allowing suits in some cases involving forfeiture of prope rty other than as sentence for crime in ali v federal bureau of prisons 128 s ct 831 834 2008 the c ourt held that the broad phrase any other law enforcement officer co vers all law enforcement officers including officers of the federal bureau of prisons and does not apply only to law enforcement continuedincident to service6 the discretionary function excep tion and the intentional tort exception among the other exceptions the united states may not be held liable in accordance with state law imposing strict

foreign country for this purpose even t hough it is sovereignless region without civil tort law of its own in sosa v alvarezmachain 542 us 692 712 2004 the supreme court held that the ftcas foreign country exception bars all claims based on any injury suffered in foreign country rega rdless of where the tortious act or omission occurred the plaintiffs suit therefore was dismissed even t hough his abduction in mexico was the direct result of wrongful acts of planning and di rection by dea agents located in california id at 702 the court was unwilling to adopt the headquarters doctrine because it will virtually always be possible to assert that the negligent activity that injured the plaintiff abroad was the consequence of faulty training selection or supervision or even less than that lack of careful training selection or supervision in the united states id although the united states is not liable for cl aims arising in foreign country federal statutes give several federal agencies the aut hority to compensate victims of torts committed by federal employees in foreign countries these statutes incl ude 22 usc 14755 2269f 22691 department of state 38 usc 515b department

did not reac h the issue whether an award of attorneys fees would be barred by the ftca prohibiti on against punitive damages 28 usc 2674 subsequently however in molzof v united states supra note 8 the supreme court in different context held that 2674 bars the recovery only of what are legally considered continuedan agency may not settle claim fo r more than 25000 without the prior written approval of the attorney general or his designee unless the attorney general delegates to the head of the agency the authority to do so18 such delegations may not exceed the authority delegated by the

supreme court unanimously held that although the ftca contains ex plicit exclusion for injuries sustained by military personnel incident to service such an exclusion results from construing the act to fit so far as will comport with its words into the entire statutory scheme of remedies against the government to make workable consistent and equitable whole 340 us at 139 one reason the c ourt found that to prohibit recovery for injuries sustained incident to service w ould fit the entire stat utory scheme was that the act at 28 usc 2674 makes the unite d states liable only to the same extent as private individual under like circumstances this limitation could be construed to exclude serviceconnected in juries because the court found that plaintiffs can point to liability of private individual even remotely analogous to that which they are asse rting against the united states we know of american law which ever has permitted soldier to recover for negligence against either his superior officers or the government he is serving nor is there any liability under like circumstances for private individual has power to conscript or mobilize private army with such author ities over persons as the government vests in echelons of command 340 us at 141142 another basis for the courts decision in feres was that the act makes the law of the place where the act or omission occurred 28 usc 1346b govern liability yet in the case of soldier who is not free to choose his habitat that the geography of an injury should select the w to be applied to hi s tort claims makes sense id at 143 the court also was influen ced by the fact that congress has enacted laws that provide systems of s imple certain and uniform compensation for injuries or death of those in armed serv ices yet congress made provision as to how recovery under the ftca would affect entitlement to such compensation the absence of any such adjustment is persuasive that there was awareness that the act might be interpreted to permit recovery for injuries incident to military service id at 144 the court concluded that the government is not liable under the federal tort claims act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service without excepti on the relationship of military personnel to the government has been governed exclusively by federal law we do not think that congress in drafting the act cr eated new cause of action dependent on local law for serviceconnected injuries or death due to negligence we cannot impute to congress such radical depart ure from established law in the absence of express congressional command 340 us at 146httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs6 23 804 f2d 561 9th cir 1986 modified 813 f2d 1006 9th cir

foundation for the feres doctrine first the relationship between the gove rnment and members of its armed forces is distinctively federal in character it would make little sense to have the governments liability to members of the armed services depend on the fortuity of where the soldier happened to be stationed at the time of the injury second the veterans benefits act estab lishes as substitute for tort liability statutory fault compensation sche which provides generous pensions to injured servicemen without regard to any negligence attributable to the government third factor was explicated in united states v brown 348 us 110 112 1954 namely the peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors the effects of the maintenan ce of such suits on discipline and the extreme results that might obtain if suits under the tort claims act were allowed for negligent orders given or negligen t acts committed in the course of military duty the supreme court reaffirmed the feres doctrine in united states v shearer 473 us 52 1985 and again addresse d the reasons for its adoption feres seems best explained the court wrote by the peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors the effects of the maintenance of such its on discipline and the extreme results that might obtain if suits under the tort claims act were allowed for negligent orders given or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty the feres doctrine cannot be reduced to few brightline rules each case must be examined in light of the statute as it has been construed in feres and subsequent cases 473 us at 57 citations omitted the court emphasized that significant factors in determining whether the feres doctrine bars suit are whether the suit requires the civilian c ourt to secondguess military decisions and whether the suit might impair military discipline id at 57 it noted that other factors mentione d in feres are longer controlling id at 58 n4 these other factors apparently were the distinctively fe deral nature of the relationship between the government and military personnel nd the alternative compensation system available to military personnel subseque ntly however in united states v johnson 481 us 681 1987 discu ssed below the court reaffirmed these factors in atkinson v united states 23 panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit relying primarily on shearer allowed medical malpractice suit to be brought under the ftca by servi cewoman who suffered injuries incident tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs7 service in an army hospital the gove rnment sought rehearing and in the interim the supreme court decided united states v johnson supra which caused the ninth circuits panel to grant th rehearing and issue new opinion in atkinson reversing itself the supreme court subsequently declined to review the case these three decisions the panels first decision in atkinson johnson and the panels second decision in atkinson are now examined in turn the plaintiff in atkinson alleged that negligence on the part of army hospital personnel had caused her to deliver s tillborn child and to suffer physical and emotional injuries the panel in its first decision wrote the feres doctrine bars suit only where civilian court would be called upon to secondguess military decisions or where the plaintiffs admitted activities are of the sort that would directly implicat the need to safeguard military discipline in shearer the supreme court also confir med that courts should take casebycase rather than per approach to claims by the government of immunity 804 f2d at 563 taking such an approach the court wrote at the time atkinson sought treatment sh was not subject in any real way to the compulsion of military orders or performing any sort of military mission command relationship exists between atkinson and her attending physician military considerations govern the treatment in nonfield hospital of woman who seeks to have healthy baby military discipline applies to the care conscientious physician will provide in this situation there is simply connection between atkinsons medi cal treatment and the decisional or disciplinary interest protected by the feres doctrine id at 564565 note that this decision did not hold that all military malpractice suits are exempt from the feres doctrine in taking casebycas approach the court allowed for the possibility of situation in which there is connection between serviceman or servicewomans medical treatment and the decisional or disciplinary interest protected by the feres doctrine in 1987 in united states v johnson supra the supreme court in 5to4 decision held that the feres doctrine bars suits on be half of military personnel injured incident to service even in cases of torts committed by employees of civilian agencies the plaintiff in johnson was the widow of serviceman killed incident to service in helicopter crash allegedly caused by the negligence of the federal aviation administration reexamining the reasons for the feres doctrine the court concluded that whether the tortfeasor was civilian or military employee was not significant the reasons for the feres doctrine that it reexamined and reaffirmed were the three cited in stencel set forth on page 5 of this report thus it removed any doubts that it had cast in shearer upon the significance of those factors justice scalia joined by three other justices in dissent noted that the feres doctrine is not in the ftca as enacted by congress and found the reasons offered by the court for adopting the doctrine to be unsatisfactoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs8 24 the three original reasons justice scalia refe rred to were that the parallel private liability required by the ftca was absent and the first two reasons mentioned in stencel the military discipline rationale was the third reason mentioned in stencel 25 the three rationales referred to are those cited in stencel and by the majority in johnson 26 833 f2d at 286 citing shearer 473 us at 56 and adding emphasisneither the three original feres reasons nor the post hoc rationalization of military discipline justifies our failure to apply the ftca as written feres was wrongly decided and heartily deserves the widespread almost universal criticism it has received 481 us at 70024 citing johnson the ninth circuits panel s ubsequently reversed itself in atkinson significant for our purposes the panel wrote is the courts articulation with apparent approval of all three rationales associated with feres simply put johnson appears to breathe new life into the first two feres rationales which until that time had been largely discredited and abandoned although we believe that the military discipline rationale does not support application of the feres doctrine in this case the first two rationales support its application we are reluctant to carve out an exception to feres after five members of the court appear to have emphatically endorsed feres and all three of its rationales that task if it is to be undertaken at ll is properly left to the supreme court or to congress 825 f2d at 20520625 in rio v united states 833 f2d 282 11th cir 1987 servicewoman who had given birth to twins brought medical malpractice suit under the ftca alleging that as result of negligent prenatal care at military hospital one of her twins suffered bodily injury and the other died the eleventh circuit held that the feres doctrine as interpreted in johnson barred her claim it agreed with the ninth circuits second decision in atkinson that the first two feres factors operated to preclude suit but unlike the ninth circuit be lieved that even the third factor did so obviously the court wrote the suit might impair essential military discipline 26 in irvin v united states 845 f2d 126 6th cir 1988 cert denied 488 us 975 1988 another servicewoman alleged that negligent prenatal care by the military had resulted in her infants death and anot her court of appeals held that the feres doctrine barred suit under the ftca in bowers v united states 904 f2d 450 8th cir 1990 the court held that the feres doctrine precludes an individual from recovering for medical malpractice allegedly committed at his pr einduction physical althoug h the plaintiff was not service member at the time of the alleged negligence and was not eligible for either veterans benefits or treatment in military hospital the court found that two of the three feres rationales spelled out in johnson were applicable the relationshiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs9 27 see eg medical malpractice suits for armed services personnel hearings on s 2490 and hr 1054 before the subcomm on courts and administrative practice of the senate comm on the judiciary 100th cong 2nd sess 1988 28 congress has provided that the discretiona ry function exception does not apply in any action based upon the act or omission of participant in the swine flu immunization program pl 94380 see also note 7 supra congress has also provided that the exception does not apply to certain claims ba sed upon gross negligence by employees of the consumer product safety commission 15 usc 2053h1b between bowers and the armed forces is distinctively federal and decision for bowers would have direct effect upon military judgments and decisions id at 452 thus the feres doctrine stands and contains exception for medical malpractice cases because the first two stencel factors the federal nature of the relationship between the government and military personnel and the alternative compensation scheme would seem to apply in every case there may not even be occasion for courts to use the casebycase approach of shearer this could change however as result of action by ither the supreme court or congress as for the supreme court it is not bey ond the realm of possibility that it could completely overrule feres in johnson as noted the four dissenting justices said that feres had been wrongly decided and even downplayed the significance of the fact that congress since 1950 has not overturned feres 481 us at 702 scalia j dissenting as for congress some memb ers in the past have shown interest in amending the feres doctrine to the extent of aut horizing medical malpractice suits27 although feres was an interpretation of the ftca it has been applied to bar suits against the united states under othe r statutes including the privacy act cummings v department of navy 116 f supp 2d 76 ddc 2000 the application of the feres doctrine to spouses and children of military personnel is discussed below at the beginning of the section on suits by victims of atomic testing the discretionary function exception the discretionary function exception is the most significant exception to government liability that is explicitly provided for in the ftca this exception immunizes the united states from claims based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform discretionary function 28 usc 2680a it precludes liability even if federal employee acted negligently in the performance or nonperformance of his discretionary duty28 in dalehite v united states 346 us 15 1953 the supreme court said that th discretion protected by the exception is the discretion of the executive or ad ministrator to act according to ones judgment of the best course it includes more than the initiation of programs and activities it also includes determinations made by executives orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs10 29 more generally the court noted as in dalehite it is unnecessary and indeed impossible to define with precision every contour of the discre tionary function exception from the legislative and judicial materials however it is possible to isolate several factors useful in determining when the acts of government employee are protected from liability by 2680a first it is the nature of the conduct rather than the status of the actor that governs whet her the discretionary function exception applies in given case second whatever else the discretionary function exception may include it plainly was intended to encompass the discretionary acts of the government acting in its role as regulator of the conduct of private individuals 467 us at 813814administrators in establishing plans specifications or schedules of operations where there is room for policy judgment and decision there is discretion it necessarily follows that acts of subordinates in carrying out the operations of government in accordance with offici directions cannot be actionable id at 34 3536 footnotes omitted in united states v varig airlines 467 us 797 1984 victims of airplane accidents alleged that the federal aviation administration faa had acted negligently in certifying certain airplane s for operation the faa had established program of spotchecking manufactur ers compliance with minimum safety standards and had certified the airplanes involved in th accidents without inspecting them the supreme court applying the principles it had set forth in dalehite held here the faa has determined that pr ogram of spotchecking manufacturers compliance with minimum safety standards best accommodates the goal of air transportation safety and the reality of finite agency resources judicial intervention in such decisionmaking throug h private tort suits would require the courts to secondguess the political social and economic judgments of an agency exercising its regulatory function it follows that the acts of faa employees in executing the spotcheck program in accordance with agency directives are protected by the discretiona ry function exception as well the faa employees who conducted compliance re views of the aircraft involved in this case were specifically empowered to make policy judgments id at 82029 in berkovitz v united states 486 us 531 1988 the supreme court held that the united states could be held liable unde r the ftca because the plaintiffs had proved that federal employ ees had failed to follow regulations that specifically prescribed course of action the plainti ffs were an infant who had contracted severe case of polio from dose of orimune an oral polio vaccine and his parents they claimed that the division of biologic standards then part of the national institutes of health had violated fede ral statute and accompanying regulations in issuing license to vaccine manufacturer to produce orimune and that the bureau of biologics of the food and drug adminis tration had violated federal regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs11 30 more generally the court held that in termining the applicability of the discretionary function exception court must first consider whether the action is matter of choice for the acting employee conduct cannot be discretionary unless it involves an element of judgment or choice thus the discretionary function exception will not apply when federal statute regulation or policy specifically prescribes course of action for an employee to follow in this event the employee has rightful option but to adhere to the directive the discretionary function exception protects only governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy 486 us at 536537in approving the release of the particular lot that contained the dose that injured the infant the regulatory scheme governing licensing in berkovitz unlike the one challenged in varig did not permit spotchecking it required the agency prior to issuing product license to receive all da ta the manufacturer is required to submit examine the product and make determination that the product complies with safety standards id at 542 the regulatory scheme governing release of vaccine lots apparently would have given the agency the power to establish spotchecking program as was used in varig however the plaintiffs alleged that the agency had adopted policy of testing all vaccine ts for compliance with safety standards and preventing the distribution to the pub lic of any lots that fail to comply plaintiffs further allege that notwithsta nding this policy which allegedly leaves room for implementing officials to exercise independent policy judgment employees of the bureau knowingly appr oved lot that did not comply with safety standards id at 547 the court sent the case back for trial holding that if these allegations were proved then the discretionary functi on

atomic testing from 1946 to 1962 approximately 235 tests of atomic weapons were performed by federal government contractors many military and ci vilian personnel who participated in these tests claim to have suffered cancer and other longterm medical injuries as result current federal law generally precludes either military or civilian personnel from recovering in tort against either the federal government or the contractors in these cases military personnel are barred from recovering against the united states because of the feres doctrine the doctrine of the feres case does not apply to the spouse or child of serviceman insofar as their own injuries or death are concerned conversely the feres doctrine clearly bars suit by servicemans next of kin for damages resulting from the death or of

have held that the feres doctrine bars recovery by children born with birth defects that resulted from genetic changes in their fathers that occurred when they were exposed to radiation while on military duty34 however the feres doctrine does not bar an action against the united states for servicerelated injury suffered by veteran as result of independent postservice negligence such as failure of the governme nt to warn or monitor veteran who had been exposed to radiation35 district court has held that the feres doctrine does not bar suit by the daughter and grandson of soldier who

exception to the ftca this exception applies to all plaintiffs so even if the feres doctrine were overtur ned military personnel would be ba rred from recovering to the same extent as civilians in

already quoted in footnote 29 of this report which the court in in re consolidated had itself quoted earlier in its opinion 820 f2d at 995 it is the nature of the conduct rath er than the status of the actor that governs whether the discretionary function exception applies in given caseprotective clothing and gear had resulte d in the overexposure of many hundreds or thousands of test participan ts the ninth circuit held the safety plan incorporated into the operation plan contemplated that judgments and decisions concerning expos ure to radiological hazards and the degree of protection to be afforded would be made in light of the objectives and the needs of the test program safety cisions therefore were part of the policy decisions made in the conduct of the w eapons tests and they fall squarely within the articulation in dalehite that where there is room for policy judgment and decision there is discretion id at 995 citing 346 us at 36 the plaintiffs also argued that the government had been negligent in failing to warn the plaintiffs of the dangers to whic h they had been exposed or to monitor test participants for health problems resultin g from radiation exposure 820 f2d at 996 the court held this is not case of failing to warn river users of hidden obstructions beneath the surface or park users of the risk of fl ash floods or treating physician of his patients dangerous propensities the kind of warning that these atomic testing cases involve entailed commitment of substantial resources including the assignment of large number of employees and the expenditure of large sums of money the program required difficult judgments balancing the magnitude of the risk from radiation exposure of which there was only fragmentary knowledge against the risks and burdens of public program those risks included the potential consequences of creating public anxiety and the health hazards inherent in the medical responses to the warning thus any decision whether to issue warnings to thousands of test participants calls for the exercise of judgment and discretion at the highest levels of government the conclusion is inescapable that every aspect of warning program is matter

40 the reason for the warner amendment wa s that the government contractors provided scientific engineering and technical support for nuclear tests carried out by the government and for the government in the exercise of governmental function ie providing for the national defense these organizations did not order the tests to be performed they did not set the times or places for the tests nor did they direct military or civilian government personnel to participate in them it should appear without questi on that these contractors were acting as the facto instruments of the united states government in carrying out continuedjudgments protected by the discretionary function exception 816 f2d at 1421 the court disagreed in the case before us as in varig the government actors had general statutory duty to promote safety this duty was broad and discretionary in the case before us it was left to the aec as in varig it was left to the secretary of transportation and the faa to decide exactly how to protect public safety in the instant case evidence was pres ented of any act or omission of the aec or its employees that clearly contrave ned specific statutory or regulatory authority there was evidence for example that the test information officer failed to give out or that the radsafe officer failed to take specific radiation measurement that had been decided upon plaintiffs entire case rests on the fact that the government could have made better plans this is probably correct but it is insufficient for ftca liability id at 1421 1424 the warner amendment and the radiation exposure compensation act military and civilian victims of atomic testing have also sought to sue the government contractors involve d in the testing under state tort law company engaged in atomic testing would likely be subject to strict liability liability even in the absence of negligence for injuries resulting from such testing as atomic testing is an abnormally dangerous activity38 federal law however bars victims of atomic testing from suing fe deral government contractor s section 1631 of pl 98 525 42 usc 2212 known as the warner amendment39 provides that an action against the united states under the ft ca shall be the exclusive remedy for injuries due to exposure to radiation ba sed on acts or omissions by contractor in carrying out an atomic weapons testing program under

governmental purpose in the litigious atmosphere that now pervades the united states especially where atomic energy matters are concerned literally thousands of plaintiffs have filed suits against the operators of the govern ment laboratories that have participated in the governments nuclear weapons tests plaintiffs are seeking tens of billions of dollars in damages because the contractors are fully indemnified by the government under the terms of their contracts the taxpayer will ultimately bear this burden srept 98500 98th cong 2nd sess 376 1984 although the contractors were indemnified congress has nevertheless perceived these lawsuits to constitute threat to the continued participation of the private c ontractors in the nuclear weapons program because the contractors fear the bad publicity generated by the suits hammond v united states 786 f2d 8 14 1st cir 1986 41 hrept 99567 99th cong 2nd sess 3 1986 states that t he real effect of the warner amendment is to leave the harmed

doctrine precludes recovery by military personnel and the di scretionary function excep tion precludes recovery by anyone41 the constitutionality of the warner amendment has been upheld by two federal courts of appeals42 repeal of the warner amendment it should be noted would not necessarily result in liability on th part of contractors there would still be the possibility that they could raise the government contractor defense on the government contractor defense see the final section of this report in 1990 congress enacted the radiation exposure compensation act 42 usc 2210 note compensation

three naval corpsmen found naval enlisted man name d carr unconscious from alcohol consumption and attempted to take him to hospital emergency room before they reached the emergency room carr regained consciousne ss broke away from the corpsmen and displayed the barrel of his rifle to them the corpsmen fled and did not alert any authority that carr was inebriated and armed carr ended up near public street and began shooting at passing vehicles hitting one of the plaintiffs because of the intentional tort exception the plaintiffs in sheridan could not sue the government based on carrs shooting therefore they sued the government based on the three corpsmens negligence in failing to alert authorities as to the threat posed by carr the government argued that the intentional tort exception barred this claim because even though it was based on negligence it was claim arising out of assault or battery within the meaning of 28 usc 2680h the supreme court did not rule on the governments argument because it decided for the plaintiff on another ground that the intentional tort exception should be construed to apply only to claims that would otherwise be author ized by the basic waiver of sovereign immunity the tortious conduct of an offduty serviceman not acting within the scope of his office or employment does not itself give rise to government liability whether that conduct is intenti onal or merely negligent id at 400401 this is because the ftca makes the governme nt liable only for torts committed by an employee while acting within the scope of his office or employment 28 usc 1346b thus since the government c ould not be liable for carrs acts the intentional tort exception did not apply to bar suit based on the negligence of others that led to carrs acts even if as the g overnment argued the suit arose out of carrs intentional tort had carr not been fede ral employee at all the result would have been the same since the government could not be liable for carrs acts whether such acts were negligent or intentional the intentional tort exception would not apply to bar suit based on the negligen ce of federal employees that led to carrs intentional tort the court

new nonstatutory damages remedy for federal employees whose first amendment rights are violated by their superiors the courts reason was that such claims arise out of an employment relationship that is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful re medies against the united states 61 the principle behind the feres doctrine however should be distinguished from the doctrine itself which applies only to suits against the united states in cross v fiscus 830 f2d 755 756 7th cir 1987 the court of appe als wrote the doctrine of stanley and chappell tracks feres but its source is different feres is construction of statute continuedit would be inappropriate to provide enlisted military personnel bivens type remedy against their superior officers id at 30460 in united states v stanley 483 us 669 1987 the army had given serviceman lsd without his knowledge which caused him to suffer severe personality changes that led to his discharge and the dissolution of his marriage the supreme court indicated that feres barred his claim against the government and that chappell barred his claim against the officers involved the plaintiff had sought to distinguish his case from chappell on the grounds that unlike in chappell the defendants in this case were not st anleys superior military officers and indeed may well have been civilian personnel and that the chainofcommand concerns at the heart of chappell are thus not implicated second stanley argues that there is evidence that th is injury was incident to service id at 679 680 the cour t found that the second argument was not available to stanley because the issue of service inci dence had been decided adversely to him previously as for his first argument stanley and the lower courts may well be correct that chappell implicated military chainof command concerns more directly than do the facts alleged here it is therefore true that chappell is not strictly controlling in the sense that holding ca n be broader than the facts before the court id at 680 however the court added since feres did not consider the officers ubordinate relationship crucial but established instead an incident to servic test it is plain that our reasoning in chappell does not support the distinction stan ley would rely on today more than when we wrote chappell do we see any reason why our judgment in the bivens context should be any less protective of military concerns than it has been with respect to ftca suits where we adopted an incident to service rule id at 680681 thus with respect to injuries incurred incident to service as result of constitutional torts the principle behind the feres doctrine applies equally to preclude military personnel fro m suing either the government under the ftca or federal officials under bivens 61httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs24 61 continued stanley and chappell are constructions of the constitution based on considerations similar to those that the court believes influenced congress when enacting the ftca if congress amended the ftca the principles of stanley and chappell would be unaffected though congress could create federal remedy against service personnel by passing separate statute 62 in carlson v green the court spoke of special factors counselling hesitation and the availability of an alternative remedy which is explicitly declared to be substitute as distinct situations in which bivens actions are unavailable in schweiker v chilicky 487 us 412 423 1988 the court said that the concept of special factors counselling hesitation has proved to include an appropr iate judicial deference to indications that congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms in mccarthy v madigan 503 us 140 1992 the court held th at where congress had not required exhaustion of remedies prisoner could bring bivens action solely for money damages without resorting to an internal grievance procedure 63 in castaneda v united states cv 0707241 ddd jcx cd cal march 11 2008 the district court after quoting the statement from carlson that congress views the ftca and bivens as parallel complementary causes of action added that although 42 usc 233a cited in note 46 supra precludes state tort action against public health services employees it does not preclude bivens action against them this is because 233a provides that the remedy against the united states provided by sections 1346b and 2672 of title 28 shall be exclusive of any other civil action section 1346b1 provides subject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this title emphasis supplied by the court the district courts shall have ex clusive jurisdiction of tort claims against the united states and chapter 171 the ftca includes 28 usc 2679b2 enacted by the westfall act which is discussed beginning at page 18 of this report which provides that federal employees immunity fro m tort liability does not extend to suits for constitutional violations ie to bivens actionsin addition to situations with s pecial factors counselling hesitation bivens type actions are not permitted when defendants show that congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be substitute for recovery directly under the constitution and viewed as equally effective carlson v green 446 us 14 1819 1980 emphasis in original62 the court in carlson v green allowed bivens type action against federal prison official for violating the cruel and unusual punish ment clause of the eighth amendment the defendant argued that congress had intended suit against the united states under the ftca as an alternative reme dy but the court held when congress amended the ftca in 1974 to create cause of action against the united states for intentional torts committed by federal law enforcement officers 28 usc 2680h the congressional comments accompanying that amendment made it crystal clear that congress views ftca and bivens as parallel complementary causes of action63 id at 20 in subsequent cases the supreme court has continued to limit the availability of bivens actions in fdic v meyer 510 us 471 1994 the court declined to extend bivens to permit suit against federal agency even though the agency because congress had waived sovereign immunity was otherwise amenable tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs25 64 correctional services corporati

regulations at 28 cfr 5015a provide under the procedures set forth below federal employee may be provided representa tion in civil criminal and congressional proceedings in which he is sued subpoenaed or charged in his individual capacity when the actions for which representation is requested reasonably appear to have been performed with the scope of the employees employment and the attorney general or his designee determines that providing representation would otherwise be in the interests of the united statessuit64 in correctional services corporation v malesko 534 us 61 2001 the court held that bivens actions may not be brought against private entities acting under color of federal law id at 66 in this case against private corporation operating halfway house under contract with the bureau of prisons id at 63 explaining its decisions in both meyer and malesko the court in malesko said that the purpose of bivens is to deter individual officers not policymaking entities from committing uncons titutional acts does this mean that an individual officer of private entity acting under color of fe deral law would be subject to bivens action the court in malesko did not decide the question in wilkie v robbins 127 s ct 2588 2598 2007 the supreme court explained that the decision whether to recognize bivens remedy may require two steps in the first place there is the question whethe r any alternative existing process for protecting constitutionally recognized interest amounts to convincing reason for the judicial branch to refrain from providing new and freestanding remedy in damages but even in the absence of an alternative bivens remedy is subject of judgment the federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for commonlaw tribunal

declined to allow bivens action finding th at judicial standard to identify illegitima pressure going beyond gitimately hard bargaining would be endlessly knotty to work out and would invite an onslaught of bivens actions id at 2604 the practical side of bivens actions according to one commentator individual liability under bivens is fictional because the federal government in practi ce functions as the real party in interest paying for representation and reimbursing the sued individuals when they settle or pay judgments65 bivens has however the commentator

constitutional violations its application has rarely led to damages recoveries government figures reflect that out of approximately 12000 bivens claims filed between 1971 and 1985 bivens plaintiffs actually obtained judgment th at was not reversed on appeal in only four cases while similar figures have not been systematically kept since 1985 recoveries from both settlements and litigated judgments continue to be extraordinarily rare according to one estimate plaintiffs obtain judgment awarding them damages in fraction of one percent of bivens cases and obtain monetary settlement in less than one percent of such cases66 qualified immunity to bivens actions having summarized the law governing federal employees liability for constitutional torts we return to the question of their common law immunity from liability for such torts the ftca it will be recalled gives them immunity only from state tort law such immunity is generally qualified yet qualified immunity is undoubtedly the most significant bar to constitutional tort actions67 in butz v economou 438 us 478 507 1978 the supreme court held that in suit for damages arising fro m unconstitutional action federal executive officials exercising discretion are entitled only to the qualified immunity specified in scheuer subject to those exceptional situations where it is demonstrated that absolute immunity is essential for the conduct of public business in scheuer v rhodes 416 us 232 247248 1974 referred to in this quotation the supreme court held that state executive officers are immune from liability under 42 usc 1983 in varying scope the variation being dependent upon the scope of discretion and responsibilities of the office and all the circumstances as they reasonably appeared at the time of the action on which liability is sought to be based it is the existence of reasonable grounds for th belief formed at the time and in light of the circumstances coupled with good faith belief that affords basis for qualified immunity of executive officers for acts performed in the course of official conduct because under butz the scheuer standard applies to federal as well as to state officials if federal official in the exer cise of discretionary function violates persons constitutional rights he may be subject to liability even though the discretionary function exception of the ftca would preclude liability on the part ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs27 68 in anderson v creighton 483 us 635 641 1987 the supreme court applying the butz qualified immunity standard held that federal law enforcement officer is not liable for participating in search that violates the f ourth amendment if he could as matter of law reasonably have believed that the search was lawful in nixon v fitzgerald 457 us 731 750 754 1982 the court held that t he presidents unique status under the constitution entitles him to abso lute immunity from private suits for damages based on his official acts he is not immune howev er for actions allegedly taken before his term began clinton v jones 520 us 681 1997 in harlow v fitzgerald 457 us 800 1982 the court held that presidential ai des are entitled only to qualified immunity specifically they are immune unless their ac tions violate clearly established law in mitchell v forsyth 472 us 511 1985 the court held that the holding in harlow applied even for acts performed by the attorney gene ral in the interest of national security additional discussion of the immunity of fe deral officials for constitutional torts may be found in cook and sobieski 1 c ivil rights actions 211 2006 69 the court noted that few areas involvin g uniquely federal interests are so committed by the constitution and laws of the unite d states to federal control that state law is preempted and replaced where necessary by federal law of content prescribed absent explicit statutory directive by the courts socalled federal common law id at 504 justice brennan in his dissent in boyle objected that just as there is federal pre emption in vacuo without constitutional text or federa l statute to assert it federal common law cannot supersede state law in vacuo out of more than an idiosyncratic determination by five justices that particular area is uniquely federal id at 517the government68 congress however has the power to grant additional immunity to federal officials see butz 438 us at 500 the government contractor defense in boyle v united technologies corp 487 us 500 504 1988 the supreme court held that uniquely federal intere sts in the governments procurement of equipment require that government cont ractor defense be available in certain cases this is defense that manuf acturers may assert in products liabi lity cases alleging design defects these are cas brought under state law in which the plaintiff alleges that his in juries were caused by produc t that was defective in that the manufacturer failed to use the safest feasible design for the product in its defense the manufacturer may assert that it manufactured the product pursuant to government contract and that the sign it used was required by contract specifications in boyle the supreme court held that notwithstanding state law federal common law requires that the gove rnment contractor fense be available in certain cases69 this is because the imposition of liab ility on government contractors will directly affect the term s of government contracts either the contractor will decline to manufacture the sign specified by the government or it will raise its price either way the interests of the united states will be directly affected id at 507 the court found that displacement of state law will occur only where significant conflict exists between an identifiable federal policy or interest and the operation of state law or the app lication of state law w ould frustrate specific objectives of federal legislation id significant conflict may exist the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs28 70 the supreme court has held that in cases in which the united states is immune under feres government contractor that is held lia ble may not recover indemnification from the united states because to allow indemnifica tion would make the united states indirectly liable to the injured party stencel aero engineering corp v united states 431 us 666 1977 the federal employees compensati on act precludes federal civilian employees from suing under the ftca for workrelated injuries 5 usc 8116c the supreme court has held that if federal civilian employee recovers damages from government contractor for workrelated injury the gove rnment contractor may recover indemnification from the united states the court did not follow its reasoning in stencel because unlike in the military context of stencel it is clear that the government has waived its sovereign immunity here lockheed aircraft co rp v united states 460 us 190 197 n8 1983found where the stateimposed duty of car that is the asserted basis of the contractors liability is precisely contrary to the duty imposed by the government contract id at 509 in some cases however th stateimposed duty of care will not conflict with the federal contract or even if it does will not be significant as where federal procurement officer orders by model number quantity of stock items that happen to have design defect id in such cases the government contractor defense would not be available boyle was suit by the father of marine who had been killed incident to service in helicopter accident allegedly caused by the helicopters having been defectively designed th lower court had allowed the government contractor defense on the basis of the reasoning behind the feres doctrine as the supreme court explained military contractor liability would conflict with this doctrine the fourth circuit reasoned since the increased cost of the contractors tort liability would be added to the price of the contract and such passthrough costs would defeat the purpose of the immunity for military accidents conferred upon the government itself id at 51070 the supreme court did not adopt the feres doctrine as the basis for the g overnment contractor defense since that doctrine covers only servicerelated injuries and not injuries caused by the military to civilians it could not be invoked to prevent for example civilians suit against the manufacturer of fighter planes based on state tort theory claiming harm from what is alleged to be needlessly high levels of noise produced by jet engines yet we think th at the character of the jet engines the government orders for its fighter planes cannot be regulated by state tort law more in suits by civilians than in suits by members of the armed services id at 510511 rather the court found that the reasoning behind the discretionary function exception furnished better basis for the government contractor defense we think that the selection of the appr opriate design for military equipment to be used by our armed forces is assure dly discretionary function within the meaning of this provision the fi nancial burden of judgments against the contractors would ultimately be passed thr ough substantially if not totally to the united states itself since defense ctors will predictably raise their prices to cover or to insure against tingent liability for the governmentordered designs in sum we are of the view that state law which holds government contractors liable for design defects in military equipment does in somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs29 71 see sean watts boyle v united technologies corp and the government contractor defense an analysis based on the current circuit split regarding the scope of the defense 40 william and mary law review 687 1999circumstances present significant conf lict with federal policy and must be displaced id at 511512 delineating these ci rcumstances the court ruled liability for design defects in military equipment cannot be imposed pursuant to state law when 1 the united states approved reasonably precise specifications 2 the equipment conforme d to those specifications and 3 the supplier warned the united states about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the united states the first two of these conditions assure that the suit is within the area where the policy of the discretionary function would be frustrated ie they assure that the design feature in question was considered by government officer and not merely by the contractor itself the third condition is necessary because in its absence the displacement of state tort law would cr eate some incentive for the manufacturer to withhold knowledge of risks thereby cutting off information highly relevant to the discretionary decision id at 512 although the defendant in boyle was military contractor and the court throughout its opinion refers to military equi pment the fact that it based its opinion on the discretionary function exception and not on the feres doctrine seems to indicate that the government contractor defense is available to both civilian and military contractors in nielson v george diamond vogel paint co 892 f2d 1450 9th cir 1990 the court acknowledged th at the supreme courts reliance on the discretionary function exception meant that the government contractor defense can in principle apply to civilian equipment yet it added the policy behind the defense remains rooted in considerations peculiar to the military id at 1455 in the case before it which involved civilian equi pment it found reason to hold that the application of state law would create significant conflict with federal policy requiring displacement of state law id there is currently split in the circuits over the applicability of the governme nt contractor defense to nonmilitary contractors71 in hercules inc v united states 516 us 417 1996 the supreme court rejected claim by agent orange manufacturers that they were entitled to reimbursement from the government for the costs of defending and settling tort claims brought against them by vietnam ve terans who were injured by the chemical the government had prescribed the fo rmula and detailed specifications for manufacture id at 419 but the settlement with the veterans occurred before boyle established the governme nt contractor defense the manufacturers sued the united stat under the tucker act 28 usc 1346a 1491a which authorizes suits against the united states founded upon any express or implied contract they alleged an implied agreement by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95717crs30 government to reimburse them for tort liability and breach of the contractual warranty of specifications as to the first the court held that there was contract either express or implied in fact as to the second the c ourt held that the government warrants that the contractor will be able to perform the contract satisfactorily if it follows the specifications id at 425 but that this warranty does not extend to thirdparty claims against the contractor
