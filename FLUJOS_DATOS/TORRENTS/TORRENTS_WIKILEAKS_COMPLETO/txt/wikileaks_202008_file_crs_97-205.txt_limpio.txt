the fy1998 defense authorization bill into law pl 10585 the senate had approved the conference agreement on the bill on november 6 by vote of 9010 and the house approved the conference report on

white house announced that the president had exercised his line item veto authority to delete funding for 13 projects totaling 144 million background content of defense authorization and appropriations bills the annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the department of defense dod including pay and benefits of military personnel operation and maintenance of weapons and facilities weapons procurement and research and development and for other purposes most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the department of defense though the bill also provides 1 relatively small unclassified amounts for the central intelligence agency retirement fund and intelligence community management and 2 classified amounts for national foreign intelligence activities administered by the cia and by other agencies as well as by dod several other appropriations bills also provide funds for national defense activities of dod and other agencies including the military construction appropriations bill which finances construction of military facilities and construction and operation of military family housing all administered by dod the energy and water development appropriations bill which funds atomic energy defense activities administered by the department of energy the vahudindependent agencies appropriations bill which finances civil defense activities administered by the federal emergency management agency and activities of the selective service system and crs2 the commercejusticestate appropriations bill which funds defenserelated activities of the fbi the defense appropriations bill is by far the largest of the appropriations measures that provide funding for national defense in its february budget the administration requested 2653 billion in new budget authority for the national defense budget function of which 2433 billion was requested in the defense appropriations bill 84 billion in military construction 136 billion in energy and water and the remainder in other appropriations bills along with annual defenserelated appropriations congress also acts every year on national defense authorization bill in recent years the defense authorization has been an omnibus bill that considers funding in all of the appropriations measures discussed above the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely the same level of line item detail as the defenserelated appropriations bills differences between the authorization and appropriations measures within each house generally concern only few programs as result congressional debate over major defense policy and funding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization bill because the defense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related this report discusses congressional action on both measures though it focuses on the progress of the appropriations process status the status of congressional action on fy1998 defense authorization and appropriations bills is as follows house authorization on june 11 the house national security committee completed markup of its version of the fy1998 defense authorization bill hr 1119 and floor consideration began on june 19 on june 19 the house bill was amended to include parts of hr 1778 the defense reform act that impose reductions in defense overhead activities and make changes in acquisition regulations the house passed hr 1119 on june 25 senate authorization the senate armed services committee completed markup of its initial version of the authorization bill s 924 on june 12 later on june 18 the committee reported renumbered bill s 936 which eliminated provisions regarding workloads at aircraft maintenance depots see below for discussion this version of the bill was taken up on the floor on june 19 and 20 and action resumed on july 7 the senate passed the bill on july 11 on july 11 the senate also formally took up the housepassed bill deleted all after the enacting clause and inserted its own version so the conference proceeded on the bill with the house number housesenate authorization

june 12 both the house and the senate approved hr 1871 bill making supplemental appropriations and rescissions for fy1997 this bill was passed in place of an earlier measure hr 1469 that the white house had vetoed because of two policy provisions one to prevent government shutdown at the end of the fiscal year and another to prohibit the use of sampling in the 2000 census the new bill was signed into law later on june 12 along with funding for domestic disaster relief the bill provides 19 billion for the department of defense mainly to cover costs of contingency operations in bosnia and southwest asia the bill also rescinds 19 billion of defense funds to offset the supplemental amounts for full discussion of supplemental funding see crs issue brief 97029 supplemental

defense budget function for the five years from fy1998 through fy2002 see below for discussion of the relationship between budget authority and outlays under the agreement budget authority for national defense will increase slightly in nominal terms but when adjusted for inflation will decline modestly through fy2000 and then essentially level off by fy2002 budget authority for national defense will be about 38 below its peak in fy1985 table 1 shows the trend in current year dollars and in constant fy1998 prices table 1 national defense budget projections under the white housecongressional budget agreement current and constant fy1998 dollars in billions fiscal year 1985 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 budget authority current year dollars 2947 2649 2682 2708 2748 2813

defense budget over the past several years have been achieved mainly by reducing the size of the military force and by slowing the pace of weapons modernization active duty military endstrength will decline from about 22 million in fy1987 to about 145 million by the end of fy1997 under administration plans reduction of about 33 the number of divisions in the army and marine corps ships in the navy and air wings in the air force have fallen accordingly under plans established by the quadrennial defense review released on may 19 the active duty crs5 force will decline to about 136 million over the next few years 36 below the fy1987 level funding for weapons acquisition has declined even more steeply than the force structure the initial fy1998 budget requested 426 billion for weapons procurement and 359 billion for research development test and evaluation rdte adjusted for inflation proposed procurement funding is 69 below the level in fy1985 and the total for procurement plus rd is down by 57 the level of procurement funding is matter of ongoing debate key goal of the quadrennial defense review is to increase procurement funding over the next several years mainly by reducing defense civilian personnel levels and transferring the savings to weapons acquisition by fy2001 the administration projects 60 billion for procurement and by fy2002 68 billion see table a2 in the appendix to reach these levels however depends on 1 achieving projected savings through reforms in defense business practices and 2 controlling the growth of operation and maintenance expenses see below for further discussion key budget and policy issues debate over the level of defense spending has been resolved at least for the present by the white housecongressional budget agreement reached in may the budget agreement also resolves troubling technical issue concerning the balance between defense budget authority and outlays in fy1998 substantial imbalance between budget authority and outlays appears to remain in fy2002 however with the budget battle at least temporarily in abeyance the major issues now concern tradeoffs within the defense budget and implementation of longer term administration defense priorities in action on the fy1996 and fy1997 budgets congress added substantial amounts to administration defense requests the money went mainly to increase purchases of major weapons requested by each of the military services congress had much less room to add to the fy1998 request however as result increased funding for some programs had to be offset by reductions in others this led to disputes both within congress and between congress and the administration over defense priorities missile defense b2 bomber procurement tactical aircraft procurement navy shipbuilding and department of energy nuclear weapons activities were among the programs that were the focus of debate related issue remains unresolved how congress will respond to proposals the administration made in the quadrennial defense review qdr review of defense strategy and force planning that the defense department released on may 19 the qdr proposed additional rounds of base closures and other reductions in defense infrastructure substantial reductions in civilian personnel levels through outsourcing and other measures smaller reductions in active duty and reserve troop levels and adjustments in number of weapons programs without these changes the defense department says sufficient funding will not be available to finance needed weapons modernization over the next several years congress has not been receptive to new round of base closures however in addition in the past congress has rejected proposals to privatize some support activities and cuts in force levels have also been crs6 contentious congressional action on these issues is critical test of the fate of the qdr finally number of other matters also arise every year in debate over defense legislation social issues such as abortions in military hospitals gays in the military and sales of obscene materials on military bases have been contentious in recent years this year debate focused on the role of women in the military combined sex training sexual harassment and the application of rules against adultery the use of military force abroad is often matter of contention and this year congress debated whether to set date for withdrawing us ground forces from bosnia defense burdensharing is often an issue and this year the debate was compounded by the issue of nato expansion finally matters affecting the quality of life in the military and benefits for military retirees and dependents often arise this year retirees and military dependents were greatly concerned about trends in military health care and congress addressed the issue the following discussion 1 reviews action on overall funding levels for defense in the annual congressional budget resolution 2 discusses debate over major weapons programs and other defense priorities 3 highlights congressional action on aspects of the qdr and 4 identifies other issues that have been matters of debate budget resolution funding levels for defense the first stage in the congressional budget process each year is action on the annual congressional budget resolution the budget resolution sets ceilings on budget authority and outlays for each major functional category of the budget including national defense budget function number 050 the budget resolution includes projections of funding for each budget function for the budget year and at least four more years this years resolution extends through fy2002 the target year for balancing the budget for the past two years annual budget resolutions have provided for substantial congressional additions to the administrations defense budget request including an increase of about 7 billion in budget authority for defense in the fy1996 budget and 112 billion in the fy1997 budget final congressional appropriations each year added about as much as the budget resolution recommended last years congressional budget resolution passed in june of 1996 projected that congress would add another 94 billion in budget authority to the amount that the administration was then projecting for fy1998 in preparing its fy1998 budget request however the administration added substantially to the amount it had planned for national defense specifically the administration added 1 26 billion to the department of defense budget mainly to protect weapons procurement accounts 2 36 billion for department of energy defenserelated activities partly to provide advance funding for major capital projects and partly to privatize cleanup activities and 3 300 million for defenserelated activities of other agencies as result the difference between congress and the administration over the fy1998 defense budget was reduced to 29 billion in budget authority congressional budget office scoring of the administration request further eroded the difference to about 26 billion for future years the june 1996 congressional budget crs7 resolution proposed funding levels that were below those the administration was projecting in fy20002002 negotiations between the white house and congressional leaders over plan to balance the budget by fy2002 ultimately resolved the issue essentially by providing the higher of either congressional or administration budget authority numbers for defense for each year from fy1998 through fy2002 table 2 compares the may 1997 budget agreement with earlier administration and congressional budget plans the budget agreement also resolves troubling technical issue that had concerned congressional defense committees as table 2 notes the budget compromise provides 66 billion more in outlays for fy1998 than the administration had projected and 30 billion more than congress estimated last year this eliminates severe mismatch between budget authority and outlays that arose when the congressional budget office cbo provided its estimates of outlays likely to result from the administrations request to explain when congress appropriates funds for defense or other discretionary programs it provides budget authority which allows agencies to hire personnel or sign contracts for goods and services outlays however occur only when checks are actually issued for salaries or for progress payments on contracts outlays in any given year resulting from new budget authority and from budget authority provided in prior years must be estimated based on historical experience table 2 administration and congressional national defense budget projections current year dollars in billions total 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 9802

outlays 30 05 16 11 36 56 source congressional research service calculations based on omb data the fy1997 congressional budget resolution and data from the house and senate budget committees does not reflect cbo scoring of the administration request the office of management and budget omb estimated that defense outlays in fy1998 would total 2594 billion if congress were to approve the administration crs8 request for 2653 billion in new budget authority for national defense in its assessment of the administration plan initially reported on march 4 cbo estimated that approval of the administration program would entail defense outlays in fy1998 of 2650 billion 56 billion higher the budget compromise resolved the issue by providing 2660 billion in national defense outlays enough to accommodate cbo scoring with room for an additional 26 billion in budget authority the outlay problem has not disappeared however both cbo and the defense department now calculate that the budget compromise will lead to an imbalance between budget authority and outlays in fy2002 cbo estimates outlays 49 billion above the level in the budget resolution for fy2002 and dod has calculated gap of 56 billion this issue will have to be resolved in the future priorities within the defense budget for the past two years congress added substantial amounts to administration defense budget requests mainly to finance additional weapons purchases under the budget compromise however congress had only 26 billion to add to the request using cbo scoring in action on the defense authorization and appropriations bills this led the congressional defense committees to reorder priorities within the defense budget substantially one source of funding for congressionally supported programs was an administration request to increase funding for department of energy doe weaponsrelated activities in its fy1998 request the administration proposed two major initiatives that substantially increased the amount of budget authority though not of outlays that it wanted for doe defense programs first the administration requested 15 billion to provide full funding in advance for major doe construction projects in the past doe had paid for construction incrementally asking congress only to provide funds for progress payments on contracts full funding would follow the method used to finance most department of defense projects second the administration requested 1 billion to provide advance funding for environmental cleanup projects for which it wants bids from private industry advance funding officials say would make the bids more attractive neither of these requests had any outlay implications in fy1998 hnsc turned down both requests freeing up budget authority for other defense programs this increased the amount available for congressional addons to more than 5 billion sasc also rejected the administrations new initiatives except for 215 million for cleanup privatization similar priorities were implied by the house appropriations committee allocations to the subcommittees under sections 302b602b of the congressional budget act the house allocated 2483 billion to the defense subcommittee which was 44 billion above the amount the administration had requested the senate appropriations committee in contrast allocated 2472 billion to the defense subcommittee the compromise reached in the conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill provides 2477 billion for defense 38 billion above the administration request crs9 with the additional money the congressional defense committees have been able to finance wide range of highpriority programs highlights of congressional action include pay raises all of the defense bills provide for 28 military pay raise as the administration requested this is equal to the increase in the employment cost index eci hnsc also added requirement that future pay raises equal the eci current policy calls for federal pay raises to be onehalf percent below the eci the administration opposes the hnsc proposal to treat military service members differently from federal civilian workers military construction the house authorization bill provided 91 billion for military construction 750 million above the request much of the increase was for housing improvements the housepassed version of the military construction appropriations bill hr 2016 approved on july 8 followed the authorization the senate authorization added 700 million to the request also with focus on housing and the senate military construction appropriations bill passed on july 22 followed the senate authorization the conference agreement on the appropriations bill passed in the house on september 16 and in the senate on september 17 provides 92 billion and the authorization conference agreement provides the same amount in the first use of his lineitem veto authority on october 6 the president vetoed 187 million of projects in the bill see below for further discussion ballistic missile defense in february the administration requested 30 billion for ballistic missile defense bmd programs including 504 million for national missile defense nmd development the quadrennial defense review determined that increased funding for nmd was required and in may secretary of defense cohen sent letter to congressional defense committees requesting an increase of 474 million in fy1998 for nmd programs the housepassed authorization bill provided 38 billion for bmd programs about 750 million more than the initial administration request and 343 million above the revised request the total included 978 million for national missile defense nmd programs 474 million above the initial request as cohen had asked in may the house bill also added selectively to theater missile defense tmd programs the largest increase was for the navy theater wide program which congress has long favored the senate authorization provided the same amount for nmd and also increased navy theater wide funding major difference between the house and the senate concerned the theater highaltitude area defense thaad program the house authorization added money to thaad which the administration had proposed slowing due to technical problems the senate authorization reduced thaad funding by 200 million below the administration request while cutting the fy1998 thaad budget sasc instructed dod to add 340 million to the program in fy19992000 thus sasc and hnsc both supported thaad but differed on the timing of funds in view of the programs technical difficulties the house appropriations bill differed from the authorization it reduced thaad funding by 56 million while the senate appropriation followed the authorization the conference agreement on the appropriations bill reduced thaad funding for fy1998 by crs10 150 million and the authorization conference agreement follows suit see table a6 below for summary of congressional action on bmd programs the authorization bills also took some action on bmd policy issues the house and senate bills both prohibit the transfer of bmd procurement funding to the military services the house bill revises dates that were established in the fy1996 defense authorization bill for deployment of tmd systems the senate bill requires 1999 test of national missile defense system the conference agreement includes the senate provisions to establish date for testing an nmd system but does not include the house provisions to set dates for tmd deployment in the house rep weldon has recently proposed freestanding bill hr 2786 to authorize additional money to accelerate tmd programs tactical aircraft three major new tactical aircraft programs are in different stages of the acquisition process the navy fa18ef multirole fighter the air force f22 air superiority fighter and the multiservice joint strike fighter jsf development program the house and senate are substantially at odds on fighter aircraft programs though both have continued to support all three programs for the present hnsc reduced requested funding for the f18 and reallocated funding for the jsf to accelerate development of the navy version of the aircraft sasc in contrast approved the requested f18 amount but cut f22 funding substantially citing concerns about development costs the senate appropriations bill also cut f22 funding the house appropriations bill did not go along with the hnsc cut in the f18 but otherwise followed the authorization in significant action on the floor the senate rejected an amendment to the authorization bill by senator feingold to require dod to report on which of the programs it would cancel if funds are not sufficient for all three the senate approved an amendment by senator bumpers however to cap the total cost of the f22 program at 43 billion and similar provision is included in the authorization conference report the house and senate also differed on procurement of current generation aircraft the house bills added funding for 3 unrequested f16 aircraft while the senate bills added funds for 3 additional f15s the appropriations conference report resolved the issues as follows it provides full funding as requested for 20 fa18ef aircraft which hnsc would cut it supported continued development of the f22 though as the house proposed 6 million is shifted from advance procurement to rd it provided funding for 5 f15s one fewer than the senate wanted and also for 3 f16s as the house proposed and it provided about 15 million more than requested for jsf development splitting the difference between the house and the senate the authorization bill follows the appropriations on all of these issues b2 bomber the housepassed authorization and appropriations bills added 331 million to the administration request to resume production of b2 bombers this was intended as first step toward buying 9 more aircraft over the next several years in key floor vote on the authorization bill the house rejected an amendment by representatives kasich and dellums to eliminate the additional b2 funds later the house rejected similar amendment to the appropriations bill by representative obey in contrast the senate provided additional funds for the b2 and the senate armed services committee crs11 explicitly rejected procurement of new bombers the administration vigorously opposed resuming b2 production arguing that the 2127 billion cost of 9 more aircraft is not available in future budgets and the white house threatened veto over the issue in the end the appropriations conference agreement essentially abandoned the cause of new b2 procurement it provides total of 331 million for b2 procurement 157 million more than the administration had requested but 174 million less than the total the house provided and it permits the administration to spend the additional funds either on advance procurement of new aircraft or on repairs and upgrades to existing bombers the appropriations conference agreement also establishes panel to review bomber requirements the authorization conference followed the appropriations measure adding requirement that the administration keep open the option of resuming b2 production until after the panel report is delivered army helicopters in the past congress has consistently added money to defense requests to keep number of helicopter production lines going the house authorization and appropriations bills provided unrequested funding for 21 oh58d kiowa scout helicopters and funding for 12 additional blackhawk utility helicopters for total of 30 the senate authorization and appropriations bills provided funding for 36 blackhawks 6 more than the house the house authorization also added funds to accelerate rah66 comanche helicopter development though the appropriations bill did not the appropriations conference agreement does not provide additional funds for the kiowa program for the first time in several years it also provides for 28 blackhawks fewer than either house and does not add to comanche the authorization conference agreement follows the appropriations new aircraft carrier procurement the senate authorization and appropriations bills provided 345 million in advance procurement funding for cvn77 the next aircraft carrier for which the administration plans to request full funding in fy2001 this supports contractor proposal called the smart buy plan to reduce total program costs by providing early funding the house bills did not provide additional funds the appropriations and authorization conference agreements provide 50 million down payment ddg51 destroyer the house bills approved the request for 28 billion for three ships the senate authorization and appropriations bills added 720 million for an additional ship the appropriations and authorization conference agreements provide funding for the fourth destroyer amphibious ships the house bills provided 185 million in partial funding for lpd18 the second of new class of amphibious ships the senate authorization and appropriations bills did not provide funds the appropriations and authorization conference agreements provide 100 million new attack submarine nas house and senate bills all provided requested funding for one boat in fy1998 but the house and senate authorizing committees differed substantially on the longterm plan for acquiring the nas hnsc denied the administrations request for multiyear procurement of new crs12 submarines under plan that would allow newport news shipbuilding of virginia and general dynamics electric boat division of connecticut to team together on the project hnsc instead reaffirmed its desire for competitive prototyping strategy sasc explicitly endorsed the teaming approach though neither appropriations committee had addressed the issue the appropriations conference report permits the teaming and also allows the navy to sign multiyear procurement contract as requested the authorization conference agreement follows the appropriations arsenal shipmaritime fire support demonstrator the maritime fire support demonstrator mfsd previously known as the arsenal ship demonstrator is large surface ship that the administration wants to build to conduct atsea demonstrations of technologies intended for use in the planned surface combatant for the 21st century sc21 for fy1998 the administration requested 150 million in funding to complete the mfsds design and begin building it the house authorization and appropriation bills rejected the proposal to build the mfsd and included funding for it the senatepassed versions supported building the ship though at differing funding levels the sasc report on the authorization bill recommended 175 million 25million increase over the request while the sac report on the appropriation bill recommended 67 million an 83million decrease following committee markups the navy and darpa reportedly asked congress to approve at least 85 million in fy1998 funding for the ship the appropriations and authorization conference reports however provide only 35 million on october 24 navy officials announced the secretary of defense cohen had signed of on the navys decision to terminate the program national guard and reserve equipment the house authorization added 700 million for guard and reserve equipment the house appropriations bill added 800 million and the senate authorization and appropriations bills added 653 million the appropriations conference report provides 653 million and the authorization conference report provides 643 million additional funding for equipment designated for the guard and reserve is provided in other appropriations accounts the house national security committee reported that total of about 22 billion is provided for guard and reserve equipment from all sources in the defense authorization conference agreement implementing the quadrennial defense review as in the past couple of years most of the funding that congress has added to the administrations request for fy1998 is for weapons procurement and development the defense appropriations conference report adds about 3 billion to the administration request for new weapons and 500 million for rd note these figures take account of an acrosstheboard reduction of 15 in procurement and rd required by section 8043 of the conference agreement and an additional reduction of 474 million in rd required by section 8048 and the authorization bill provides comparable increases in the past the administration has often criticized congressional additions 1 for adding programs that will have substantial costs in the future when budgets will be tighter and 2 for continuing procurement of current generation weapons when the critical task is to develop the next generation at the crs13 same time however the defense department has agreed that funding for weapons procurement especially should turn up substantially over the next few years in order to finance needed weapons modernization the official goal has been to increase procurement to about 60 billion by the turn of the century the current administration program calls for 60 billion procurement budget in fy2001 it has however proved difficult to increase procurement spending as planned when it submitted the fy1998 budget request in february for example the administration requested 426 billion for procurement just year earlier however dod had projected budget of 455 billion for procurement in fy1998 the reason for the decline was that the operation and maintenance budget had grown by 51 billion partly to finance military operations abroad and partly because weapons maintenance costs had climbed the cut in procurement was limited to 29 billion only because the president agreed to add 26 billion to the overall dod budget such migration of funds from om to procurement accounts has occurred in each of the past four years and the problem of protecting planned increases in procurement was major focus of attention in the pentagons quadrennial defense review in order to allow spending for weapons modernization to turn up adequately in the future the qdr proposed number of steps including modest reductions in the size of the active duty force significant cuts in army guard and reserve force levels substantial cuts in civilian personnel levels another round of base closures authority to outsource defense support activities and other measures to reduce defense overhead implementation of the qdr recommendations depends on congressional action judging by house and senate action to date the congressional reaction is at best mixed the house and senate specifically and pointedly rejected the administration request to enact legislation implementing another two rounds of military base closures indeed the senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill by senator dorgan requiring improved accounting for base closure costs and savings before another round is proposed hnsc also rejected an administration request to repeal rule that reserves 60 percent of weapons depot maintenance work for publicly owned facilities sasc in contrast endorsed shift to 5050 split between public and private facilities though it broadened the definition of the depot work to include logistics activities that were earlier open to private industry perhaps most importantly hnsc rejected proposed cuts in active and reserve troop levels and instead reaffirmed floor on active duty troop levels that had been included in the fy1997 defense authorization bill the house appropriations bill however endorsed cuts in active duty troop levels sasc agreed to cuts in both active and reserve troop levels the funding provided in the appropriations conference report implies reduced troop levels the authorization conference agreement accepts most of the cuts in active and reserve force levels that the administration has proposed though it maintains floor of 495000 on army active duty endstrength which is higher than the qdr proposed instead of following the qdr recommendations hnsc approved number of quite different measures to improve defense efficiency including some that dod has found difficult to accept the efficiency measures in the housepassed authorization bill and final conference action are as follows crs14 hnsc imposed 20 cut in funding for operations of the office of the secretary of defense and requirement that dod provide previously mandated reports on the functions of osd this cut is not included in the authorization conference agreement hnsc required cut of 25 over five years in military service headquarters and management staffs the authorization conference agreement imposes 25 cut over five years in management headquarters and headquarters support personnel hnsc required 42 reduction over five years in the defense acquisition work force the authorization conference report requires cut of 25000 positions in fy1998 but allows the secretary of defense to waive part of the reduction hnsc mandated publicprivate competition for defense financial services computer and telecommunications services printing services and number of other activities the authorization conference agreement mandates competition for somewhat smaller list of activities hnsc also made series of other reforms in acquisition rules and regulations some of which are included in the authorization conference agreement in testimony before hnsc on june 17 dod comptroller john hamre complained that the civilian personnel reductions that hnsc was proposing could not be implemented under civil service regulations and that the cuts are too deep in any event the authorization conference agreement appears more acceptable to the defense department the overall policy issue is remains unresolved however the qdr has focused attention on efforts to improve efficiency in the department of defense as the one means available to finance increased weapons purchases the administration and congress appear substantially at odds however over means to achieve savings other issues other issues range across broad spectrum from us policy in bosnia to combined sex training to environmental cleanup of defense facilities this year matters of debate included bosnia policy in action on supplemental funding and rescissions earlier this year the senate approved measure that would have cut off funds for us ground forces in bosnia after june 30 1998 the date the administration had tentatively set for ending the current mission this provision was dropped from the conference agreement however hnsc did not include measure cutting off funds for bosnia in its version of the fy1998 defense authorization bill but instead required various reports on bosnia costs and policy on the floor however the house approved an amendment by representative buyer cutting off funds for us ground forces in bosnia after of june 30 1998 the house rejected substitute by representative hilleary to require withdrawal by december 31 1997 on july 11 the senate adopted an crs15 amendment by senator levin and others to the authorization bill expressing the sense of the congress that us ground forces should be withdrawn by june 30 1998 the amendment would not cut off funds the administration warned that rigid cutoff of funds will prompt veto the housepassed defense appropriations bill included cutoff of funds identical to the provision in the authorization bill the issue was resolved in the defense appropriations conference report in fashion that appears to give the administration some flexibility to extend the mission in bosnia though congress may have an opportunity to address the issue in debate over supplemental funding section 8132 of the bill cuts off funds for troops in bosnia after june 30 1998 unless by may 15 1998 the president certifies that continued presence is needed to meet us national security interests the certification must include statement of the expected duration of the mission and describe an exit strategy along with the certification the administration is also required to submit request for supplemental funding to cover costs of the extended mission this request could be come vehicle for congressional opposition the authorization conference agreement included the same requirements aircraft maintenance depot work loads the most difficult issue to resolve in this years defense debate concerns workloads at air force aircraft maintenance depots this issue has important implications for the ongoing debate over base closures in 1995 the base closure commission recommended shutting down two of five air force air logistics centers alcs alcs are large industrial facilities that perform overhauls of aircraft although the administration did not propose eliminating any alcs the commission found that there was not enough work for all of the facilities and recommended closing the alcs at mcclellan air force base in sacramento california and kelly air force base in san antonio texas this would concentrate work at remaining alcs in utah oklahoma and georgia instead of closing the mcclellan and kelly facilities however the clinton administration devised privatization in place strategy which would allow the facilities to operate under private ownership this plan came under increasingly vocal criticism among other things for allegedly politicizing the base closure process both hnsc and sasc versions of the authorization bill initially included provisions to protect work loads at the remaining public alcs before work could go to the privatized facilities because of his objections to the sasc provision senator gramm held up senate action on the bill until the relevant provisions were removed the house however rejected floor amendment by representative everett to remove similar provisions from the hnsc version of the bill the administration threatened to veto the final authorization bill if it included provision that would restrict competition for work by the privatized alcs the authorization conference agreement includes measure that will allow competition between the public facilities and the privatized depots but requires that core work defined as that essential to carry out primary military missions be reserved for the public facilities senators from texas and california continued to object to the compromise language however and in an october 28 letter to senate leaders omb director franklyn raines said that the presidents senior advisors would recommend veto unless there are changes in the depot provisions in the end however the president decided not to veto the bill over the depot issue crs16 and signed the bill into law on november 18 for further discussion see david lockwood military base closures time for another round crs report 97674 combined sex training earlier in the year representative roscoe bartlett r md member of the house national security committee personnel subcommittee proposed measure that would limit same sex training in the military during subcommittee markup however he relented and instead proposed study of the issue the senate authorization also establishes commission to review genderintegrated training and other practices governing personal relationships within dod the authorization conference agreement establishes panel to study the issue abortions in military hospitals on june 19 the house rejected floor amendment to the defense authorization bill by representative harman to allow privately funded abortions in us military hospitals abroad on july 10 the senate rejected an amendment to the authorization by senator murray to repeal the prohibition on abortions at dod facilities the issue was not therefore matter of dispute in conference negotiations environmental cleanup hnsc proposed very broad series of reforms of environmental regulations governing the defense department as part of the committeepassed version of hr 1778 some of these are provisions dod has supported including measure to allow consideration of future land use in establishing cleanup remedies so that an industrial site need not meet criteria for day care center for example such steps have been under consideration in superfund legislation that has been under review in the commerce committee for time as result commerce committee chairman bliley and others strongly objected to consideration of the environmental measures as part of the defense authorization bill and the environmental provisions were stripped from the amendment that was added to hr 1119 military medical programs the house and senate versions of the authorization and appropriations bills all agreed to an increase of 274 million to the administrations fy1998 initial request for military health care to cover shortfall which the dod comptroller identified only after the budget was submitted military medical costs have frequently exceeded dod estimates however and longterm efforts to control costs are matter of increasing controversy earlier this year military retirees objected vigorously to reported plan to require fee for access to defense medical facilities which now will treat retirees on space available basis such changes in dod medical care programs were proposed in the qdr however though commission appointed to study additional costcutting measures may address health care issues on july 8 the senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill by senator cleland that calls for the administration to protect military retiree access to quality health care other military medical care issues abound dod plans for relatively low rates of growth in health care costs over time due to shift to competitive managed care system known as tricare the general accounting office has projected that if cost growth does not slow as projected then shortfall of 8 billion or more over crs17 the next six years could develop1 also some military dependents have complained about the quality of service being provided under tricare another health care issue also has to do with provisions for treatment of military retirees the defense department has supported proposals for military medical care subvention in which medicare would pay dod facilities for care provided to medicareeligible retirees congress established medicare subvention test program in the balanced budget act of 1997 hr 2015 pl 10533 burdensharing and nato expansion the house and senate approved identical amendments to the authorization bill urging increased allied burdensharing contributions the cost of nato expansion promises to be major issue in congress in coming months and the house approved an amendment by representative frank to the authorization bill to limit us expenditures to more than 2 billion or 10 percent of the total the house also approved an amendment to the defense appropriations bill by representative traficant requiring that all funds for nato expansion be authorized by law the senate approved an amendment to the appropriations bill requiring another dod report on expansion costs the appropriations conference agreement includes several provisions that would limit us expenditures for nato expansion and require allies to share the cost cooperative threat reduction hnsc and sasc both reduced funding for the cooperative threat reduction program also known as the nunnlugar program which provides demilitarization assistance to former soviet states the senate however approved an amendment to the authorization bill by senator lugar to restore funds the house initially approved but later eliminated an amendment by representative rohrbacher that would cut off all funds for russia if russia transfers ssn22 cruise missiles to china the administration and nunnlugar supporters strongly opposed trying to use the program as leverage over russian policy on issues not directly related to the purposes of the program the senate however agreed to kyl amendment to the authorization bill limiting the use of funds for chemical weapons demilitarization if russia fails to meet certain standards regarding chemical weapons programs the appropriations conference agreement provides the full amount requested 3822 million for the dod program the authorization conference agreement also provides the full 3822 million requested and revises the kyl amendment to prohibit this years funds from being used to construct chemical demilitarization facility in russia presumably this will provide time to review russian compliance with chemical weapons agreements national guard representation on the joint chiefs of staff on july 11 the senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill by senator stevens to establish the position of senior representative of the national guard bureau on the joint chiefs of staff this would be four star level position the 1 gao warns of potential 84 billion gap in defense health funding inside the pentagon february 27 1997 p 16 crs18 defense department opposed this provision arguing that it would disrupt established lines of authority the authorization conference agreement establishes two advisors to the chairman of the joint chiefs at the twostar level one for the guard and another for reserve forces the line item veto and defense beginning this year the president has the authority to cancel particular amounts of spending within appropriations reconciliation and tax bills without vetoing the entire bill the supreme court turned down congressional effort to prevent the use of this authority in advance though the authority may later be challenged in the courts after it is exercised on august 11 the president exercised the line item veto to delete one funding measure in the balanced budget act hr 2015 pl 10533 and two taxrelated provisions in revenue reconciliation act hr 2014 pl 10534 congress passed both bills on july 31 on october 6 the president again used the lineitem veto authority to delete funding for 38 projects totaling 287 million in the 92 billion fy1998 military construction appropriations act hr 2016 pl 105 45 the exercise of the lineitem veto authority on the military construction bill was greeted unhappily by many members of congress though few praised the president for his substantial cuts in funding the white house explained that it had applied several criteria in deciding which projects to cancel including whether planning for the projects was far enough along to allow funds to be obligated in fy1998 at hearing before the senate appropriations committee on october 9 however several senators complained that many of the items that were eliminated had approved plans that senior officials in the defense department and the office of management and budget apparently were not aware of on october 22 the senate appropriations committee reported bill s 1292 to reverse most of the military construction vetoes and the senate approved the measure on october 30 for further discussion see crs report 97210 appropriations for fy1998 military construction by mary tyszkiewicz the firestorm over the military construction vetoes led the administration to take more cautious approach in considering lineitem vetoes in the defense appropriations bill deputy secretary of defense john hamre reportedly made an effort to discuss potential veto candidates extensively with house and senate appropriations committee members on october 14 the president announced vetoes of 13 items totaling 144 million in the defense appropriations act relatively modest amount given the size of the bill see table a8 below for list of the items vetoed though several members of congress were critical of some of the particular cuts the strongest criticism came from proponents of the lineitem veto authority who complained that the president had not used his authority aggressively enough to weed out unnecessary spending crs19 legislation hr 1119 spence bill to authorize appropriations for
