1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31446reorganizing the executive branch in the 20th century landmark commissions introduction the 20th century was rich in changes to the institutions and processes that together comprise the american administrative state this very richness of subject matterhowever calls for some generalizations to help explain the events and trends thatoccupied the attention of successive congresses scholars and generations ofpractitioners in its effort to develop such statements of generality this report will study the work and results of number of commissions and other similar bodies that have had executive organization and reorganization as part of their mandate forpurposes of this report these reorganizati on exercises are referred to collectively as landmark commissions viewing landmark commissions sequentially and exploring the philosophical norms and values guiding their work is onl one of several possible approaches to the extensive subject of executive branch organization in the recently completed century the landmark commission approach clearly emphasizes institutional issuesand will concentrate on structural changes resulting from the commissionsrecommendations and subsequent implementation it is recognized however thatthe term reorganization covers much more than structural changes laws may bepassed to achieve policy or enforcement objectives and indirectly reorganize internaldepartment and agency structure in the process this was certainly the case whencongress passed the inspectors general act of 1978 an act that altered the internalstructure of agencies and the behavior of agency officials this broad definition of the term reorganization however will be larg ely avoided to facilitate attention to the successive landmark commissions as guideposts through this century ofadministrative management context for discussion of landmark commissions in the 20 th century is provided by review and analysis of six crucial periods in the evolution of the organization of the executive branch of government the founders and the political theory that informed theirorganizational decisions in 1789 the interplay of the president and congress in executiveorganizational management during the 19 th century the progressive movement of the 20th centurys first decades and its continuing legacy the rise and decline of orthodoxy in organizational managementof the executive branch httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31446crs2 1 two definitional caveats are necessary at the outset the term landmark commission is intended to be generic in application th at is many of the comprehensive efforts to reorganize the executive branch have not b een proposed or implemented by commissions per in some instances the president has si mply appointed committee to advise him as with the brownlow committee in 1937 and in other instances official commission orcommittee was appointed as with the recent national performance review npr headed by vice president gore that rejected th commission option nonetheless in the absence of more comprehensive and understandable term landmark commissions will be used to generalize about the behavior of successive comp rehensive efforts to reorganize part or all of the executive branch second the term reform will be used sparingly in scholarlycontext the term has little value as it imme diately evokes normative interpretative and evaluative meaning presumably reforms are good and opposition to these reforms is badsuch normative judgments contribute to the difficulties encountered in generalizing about major trends in governmental administrationthe interregnum period 19721992 with its doctrinal heterodoxy and the emergence of new public management paradigm and itscritics the selected landmark commissions of the recently completed century beginning with the keep commission in 1905 are described and analyzed inchronological order 1 in tracing the history of these commissions the interplay of conflicting values appear with regularity should the principal supervisor of the administrative agencies be the president or congress or should the president and congress be comanagers should commission recommendations serve to encourageadministrative integration and centralization or the values of agency particularity and decentralization should commission recommendations seek to give greater orlesser role for government in the social and economic life of the nation successive commission reports and recommendations provide evidence of the recurring natureof these and other related value issues with the advent of the 21 st century the question reasonably arises has the age of reorganizational commissions passed or is there continuing need for periodic reviews and realignments of the basic organizational structure of government in nearly every congress legislation is introduced to establish commission with broad mandate the 106th congress the last congress of the 20st century proved to be exception in this respect senator fred thompson then chairmanof the senate governmental affairs committee introduced the government for the21 st century act s 2306 the legisla tion which did not receive congressional action sought to establish ninemember commission on government restructuringand reform appointed jointly by the pres ident and congressional leadership the purpose of the commission was to study the entire government and makerecommendations to reduce the cost and in crease the effectiveness of the executive branch the commission was to submit its recommendations on restructuring bydecember 1 2002 period of public co mment was to follow then the commission was to prepare final report to congress in form that would permitits recommendations to have been included in single implementation bill andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31446crs3 referred to the appropriate committees for consideration an expedited procedures process for floor consideration and mandatory voting was included as indicatedcongress chose not to act on the proposal are reorganization panels now passé or is the time approaching when new comprehensive commission will be viewed as essential have the events sinceseptember 11 2001 changed the playing field for government organization andmanagement is organizational management separate field of study and endeavor or should it be viewed as properly tied and subordinate to the budgetary process assome argue is presently the case to what degree should departments and agencies be able to initiate organizational changes on their own authority or take the lead with their oversight committees in congress should organizational management beultimately placed under the purview of cen tral management agency which applies certain principles and general manageme nt laws across the board with the burden of proof for exception resting on the appeali ng agency in short what political legal and administrative values should prevail in the 21 st century what can the experience of the landmark commissions of the 20th century tell us about what to expect as the nation continues down the path of democratic governance in the newcentury httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31446crs4 2 martin diamond the founding of the democratic republic itasca il fe peacock publishers 1981 3 ralph clark

chapter 3 5 there are only two indirect references to the question of administrative organization in the constitution namely that the president may require the opinion in writing of theprincipal

think proper in the president alone in the courts of law or in the heads of departments article ii sec 2 cl 1 and 2evolving theoretical foundations of the executive branch the commissions studied in this report contributed to the evolution of the executive branch of the federal government each was concerned principally if not exclusively with the organization and management of the executive branch thecommissions were temporary bodies normally unassociated with the legislativeinstitutions of government they did not conduct their proceedings in an apoliticalenvironment however nor were they able to ignore the work and ideas of those who had trod this path before most especia lly these commissions were beholden to the framers of the constitution and to an early 20 th century political movement progressivism it is therefore necessary to begin by studying the evolving theoretical foundations of the executive branch to fully understand the role of landmarkcommissions the federalist creation while the classical works on political theo ry and government were useful to the framers in developing coherent politi cal philosophy upon which to construct democratic republic2 the reading of montesquieu locke and blackstone was of little assistance or guidance in the weighty matters of organizing and administering the executive powers of new government the founders turned away from thebooks for guidance in organizational matte rs and reflected instead upon their own experience in trying to wage the revolu tionary war against global power and in attempting to manage the national confedera tion of states after the close of hostilities in 1781 3 their personal experiences became the crucible for political thought this was particularly true for alexander hamilton who had found his administrativeexperiences during the confederational period to be extremely frustrating 4 it should be noted that while questions regarding how best to organize the executive branch were raised at th constitutional convention in 1787 the constitution itself is nearly silent on organizational matters5 the paucity of language in the constitution respecting organizational matters should not behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31446crs5 6 jennings b sanders evolution of executive departments of the continental congress 17741789 gloucester ma peter smith 1971 c 1935 p 97 7 leonard d white the federalists study in administrative history new york macmillan 1948 pp 51315interpreted however as either lack of inte rest or concern quite the contrary there was lively concern for organizational matters there was recognition that the newgovernment would fail if it was unable to generate energy in the executive branch in federalist 70 hamilton asserted energy in the executive is leading character of good government feeble executive implies feeble execu tion of government feeble execution is but another phrase for bad execution all men of sense will agree in thenecessity of an energetic executive the framers in defending the constitution emphasized both its innovative character and its institutional continuity preeminent among the many innovativeprovisions of the constitution was the crea tion of an independent presidency the term independent meaning in this instance not being dependent for selection ormaintenance upon the legislature the president was given different electoral basefrom congress and also several specific powers such as the power to vetolegislation to protect itself from an overbear ing congress it should not be forgotten that their fear was less about too powerful president than about toodependentpresident one who would be dominated by congress which controlled the money as for continuity not only were the stat kept intact geographically but their authorities remained in large part unaltered even most laws of the confederation such as the northwest ordinance of 1787 were retained as one student of earlyadministrative history observed the tinuity between the old and new systems was made plain by the fact both john jay and henry knox secretaries of foreign affairs and war respectively continued in their offices with modifications under the new government 6 reflecting upon the writings and decisions of the framers with respect to the administrative elements of the new government one is struck by their willingness tobreak new ground 7 rarely in their discourse is there reference to the prevailing administrative systems in great britain or france the two major nationstates of the period this is explained in part becau the new government of the united states was created before although just before the french revolution and thus tended to reflect the values of the 18th century enlightenment rather than the values of the 19th century social revolutionaries more to the point however neither great britain nor france had modern administrative systems at the time for the most part theiradministrative systems

ins titution of courts composed of judges holding their office during good behavior the representation of the people in thelegislature by deputies of their election these are wholly new discoveries or havemade their principal progress toward perfection during modern times the important point to recognize is that the framers believed that it was possible to create rational and democratically

federalists tocomplement their more comprehensive theory of government leonard d whitean administrative historian commented on this theory the federalists did not fear administrative power to the contrary they had deadly fear of governmental impotence the interests which they cherished had suffered deeply from lack of government which could govern and the need forpower was in their minds not subject to debate the federalists were not however in favor of irresponsible power they did not propose an american copyof an arbitrary kind from whose control they had recently won independence 12 the first potential challenge to the federalist theory of organization management arose from the election of thomas jefferson man suspicious ofenergetic government jeffersons theory of organization began at the local levelwith emphasis on the citizen as participant in governmental affairs there was aromantic element in jeffersons political thought that tended to view goodgovernment as utilitarian and minimalist he believed in rotationinoffice to guard against the degeneracy of public servants and that governmental service should be drudgery and for subsistence only for hamilton on the other hand government should be catalyst for great things freedom required strength and nationalpurpose as lynton k caldwell would obs erve hamilton is our great teacher of the organization and

the interstate commercecommission in 1887 15 this break from departmentalism was associated in many respects with the newly triumphant civil service reform movement which sought to cleanse administration of partisan politics by introducing the merit personnelsystem 16 the final two decades of the nineteen th century were years when rapid industrialization was straining the capacity of

public administration 17 congress was able to exercise levera ge over administrative affairs through its control of the purse strings and through its authority to initiate investigations with respect to the latter authority congress had made official inquiries into events and activities since 1789 in the final third of the 19th century however congress expanded its investigatory activities to

altering the business methods of agencies were enacted as directresult of the commissions work the principal significance for administrative history of these two late 19 th century commissions however lies not in th eir substantive results but rather in their attitudes towards the institutionalized presidency and its relationship to the departments and agencies neither inquiry discussed the presidential office norwhat role that office might be expected to play in the improvement of the conduct of the executive branch while the new governmental reform moveme nt enjoyed its first major victories at the municipal level its ideals had an impact upon the national government as well in part because congress was finding it mo re difficult and less rewarding to manage federal agencies directly as peri arnold suggests congressional leaders assumed that only the legislature could im pose changes in administrative practices but congress was too unfocused for the task of administrative reform there werealways more pressing issues for the members and congress interests inadministration are necessarily episodic 19 thus congress was increasingly sympathetic to the idea of delegating some of its managerial and regulatory authority to the president and executive agencies the problem however was that the ins titutionalized presidency was unable to substantially enhance either its political or managerial leverage over the executiveestablishment the president had virtually staff budgetary authority overagencies and few general management laws through which the agencies could

administration 1900 with bringing the purported distinction to scholarly consciousness goodnowargued politics has to do with the policie s and expressions of state will whereas administration has to do with the execution of these policies 22 this dichotomy led to the proposition that it is th function of the legislative branch to form policy will of the state and of the executive branch to implement the policy the executive branch properly organized and managed would administer the policies in animpartial and apolitical manner 23 the second capstone principle distinguish ing the progressive era was the belief that the administration of government agencies and programs was subject toprinciples of scientific management the idea that public sector administration could be made scientific was first and most notably promoted by frederick wtaylor who wrote on the one best way to manage manufacturing activity in his 1911 book the principles of scientific management 24 although he was specifically concerned with managing the work process in private factory he was convinced as were his followers that the principles of scientific management were applicable to public administration as well25 under the banner of progressivism the doctrines of scientific management were promoted for application in the executive branch with respect toorganizational management

and the limited space we can discuss only elemen ts 1 and 2 of the general progressive philosophy the need for functionally base d integrated executive branch structure and the evolution of the managerial presidency26 scientific management was influential not so much because of its specialized procedures as for the fundamental idea it fostered namely the perfectibility ofhuman institutions 27 properly constructed and managed institutions it was believed could overcome many of the structural inadequacies of congressionally mandatedprograms there was selfassurance among reformers and public administrationiststhat they could administer anything managers could and would ultimately triumphover the alleged ineptness and venality of politicians managers were to be the elitein this scientifically ordered world of the future and the president would be thechief manager of revitalized national government the chief manager must basehis overall managerial strategy on comprehensive plan and for this plan to beimplemented there must be an integrated executive branch organization with strict lines of responsibility and accountability to him thus the struggle to increase thepresidents managerial capacity began reorganization of executive agencies nd functions as systematic tool of governance was major component of the multifaceted progressive philosophythe first president to espouse the reorganization strategy for progressivism wastheodore roosevelt president theodore roosevelt unlike mckinley herbertemmerich averred had firm views on presidential management he was theundoubted originator of the concept of reorganization as continuing need foradministrative management and as an executive responsibility 28 theodore roosevelt the embodiment of progressivism believed that corollary of scientific management was the view that there was one best way to organizethe executive branch and that the prerogative to reorganize should rest with thepresident and his departmental secretaries he was able to put this view into law with the passage of the 1903 act creati ng the department of commerce and labor which authorized the president by order in writing to

commissions became popular during the progressive era and remains so to this day progressives wanted the american political system and their government to become both efficient and politically accountable the leaders of americancommerce wanted government that could support the emerging business cultureand thus good government alliance was formed consisting of business leaderstop academics and social reformers it was fragile alliance at best which enjoyedascendency for less than two decades ending with americas entry into world wari 30 but much was accomplished by this alliance and 80 years later its influence is still felt in the field of organizational design and management the progressive values emphasized presidential administrative leadership hierarchical structure and anintegrated executive branch these values still have appeal as philosophical norm even though the administrative history of the post world war ii period is largely chronicle of rejection of these values in practice whereas presidents once viewed organizational management as the key to administrative leadership today thetendency by presidents is arguably to view the design and organizational structures as simply minor and negotiable element in the larger political equation theabsence of consensus as to the principles or doctrines that should guide the process of organizational design and

aspect of management was subject to certain theoretical premises applicablethroughout the federal government and government in general writing at midcentury wallace sayre described the prevailing premises of organizational management organization theory was stated in scientific management terms that is it was seen largely as problem in organization technologythe necessities ofhierarchy the

rationality of coordination planning and control neutral or impartial career service was required toinsure competence expertise rationality 33 these principles acquired the status of received truth

theory of organization which was an edited work thataccompanied the report of the presidents committee on administrativemanagement brownlow committee submitted to president franklin roosevelt onjanuary 1 1937 34 the brownlow committee report was described by sayre as the high noon of orthodoxy in public administration theory in the united states35 criticism of the orthodox principles of organization was heard from academicians even during the period when the principles enjoyed their widestsupport among political and governmental leaders as early as 1946 behavioristswere labeling the principles of organizati on as mere proverbs the problem they alleged was not so much that these proverbs were devoid of wisdom but that theprevailing doctrine was inadequate to help one pick the

titutionalists challenged the fundamental philosophical basis of the entrepreneurial management paradigm arguing amongother things that it tends to subvert the intentions of the constitution and is anti democratic in thrust if not intention constitutionalists view the government and private sectors as distinct in character w ith the distinctions founded in law the distinguishing characteristic of governmental management contrasted to privatemanagement is that government actions must have their basis in public law not in the financial interests of private entrepreneurs or in the fiduciary concerns ofcorporate managers 54 the frequently criticized hierarchical structure found in the executive branch is designed more to ensure accountability for managerial actionpromoting control over employee is secondary in this view the value ofaccountability to political leadership and the importance of due process indecisionmaking trumps the premium placed on performance and results however it is less question of pursuing one value at the expense of the other than it is amatter of precedence in the event of conflict according to the constitutionalists the fundamental purpose of governmental management is to implement the laws passed by congress laws that may be wise orlesswise not necessarily to maximize performance however it is defined andmeasured or to satisfy customers while political accountability and effectiveperformance are generally compatible obj ectives when these values come into conflict the democratic values of legal process and political accountability

valuesthis study covers the period through 1999 but it is already clear in this new century that new institutional questions and challenges are facing the president and congressfor instance how best to reorganize the executive branch to pursue effective counterterrorist measures without eroding democratic accountability and the properadministration of other agencies and pr ograms should congress realign committee jurisdictions to best oversee and comanage the national counterterrorism strategyall of which leads to the question what contribution if any might another landmark commission provide

structure generally with the intent to realign authorities organizations and personnel toward the endof increasing rationality and accountability 2 megacommission intended to examine the existing status of national life and offer recommendations for its betterment 3 crisisinduced in the turbulent 1960s the practice began of establishing high visibility commissions to make investigations into socalled nationalcrises eg the national advisory commission on civil disorders 1968 generally referred to as the kerner commission 4 technical the great majority of advi sory commissions perform technical functions and give advice to agencies most such commissions arepermanent staffed by technical expert s and form basic method for the inclusion of diverse views in the agencys policies and management 5 major policy these commissions have been appointed to study and make recommendations on policy issues in the past such commissions havestudied civil rights elements of u s foreign policy and more recently provided study on the future of social security 56 in this study our attention will center on one of the subcategories of advisory committees the reorganization commissions those

efficiency 1910 1913 context when william howard taft assumed the presidency in 1909 it was generally agreed that the budgetary and fiscal practi ces of the executive branch were longer adequate and that the situation was rapidly deteriorating deficits were becomingchronic and congress found the ministerial book of estimates submitted each year by the treasury department an inadequate tool for comprehending the financialstatus of the entire government and for making informed decisions among competing claims for limited resources authority in 1909 congress specified that the president and the secretary of the treasury were to compare expected revenues and th appropriations requested by the agencies and then make recommendations as to both the priority of appropriations and where expenditures might be reduced 35 stat 1027 in effect congress was calling for an executive budget to be submitted by the president practice in use in manystates president taft and his treasury secretary franklin macveigh quickly found that they did not have the resources to m eet this requirement as result of the tawney amendment passed during the keep commission days taft was not ableto

consists wholly of small number of personal secretaries and clerks the time of this staff is takenup with the consideration of legislativ business the preparation of commissions appointment matters

eventually savemoney the plan submitted by the joint committee to the full congress was essentially the harding plan minus the provision to merge war and navy neither hardings plan or the specific proposals provided firm statistics on savings to be achieved by the reorganization as it turned out the attractiveness of reorganization was waning and none of the joint committees large scale recommendations were given serious consideration 93 the methodology for developing an overall executive branch reorganization plan was to have the departments themselves take the first shot each was to submita plan to walter brown in browns view such an approach which was the opposite of the armslength approach of tafts commission on economy and efficiency was more likely to produce informed analysis by those most clearly affected thisapproach however left most of the department secretaries nonplused or highlydefensive unlike his cabinet colleagues secretar herbert hoover saw this approach as an opportunity to recast his department as the centerpiece of completely redesigned government under his reorga nization plan subm itted to br own and also the president in 1921 the commerce department would become superdepartment responsible for governments activities in industry trade andtransportation to achieve this objective many agencies would be taken from theircurrent departments and placed in whole or in part in the new department ofcommerce typical transfer proposed by hoover was to move the bureau ofpublic roads from the agriculture depa rtment to commerce not surprisingly hoovers proposals and those of other departmental secretaries provided the gristfor controversy within the administration rather than presiding over rationalscientific debate on the alternatives of organizational design brown found that hewas referee in an amazingly intense political struggle as if the individual reports of departmental secretaries were not nough brown was the recipient of two major reports from outside organizations the national budget committee and thebrookings institution 94 the plans submitted by the departments generally called for the aggrandizement

administrative philosophy of the brownlow committee was that of the ascendent public administration disc ipline the committee and its staff built on the intellectual developments of the progressive era and the 1920s in government management national state and local political accountability to the president for implementing the laws was the highest valu to the committee its immediate goal was to strengthen the president as chief manager of the executive branch the essence of the committees distinctiv approach to reorganization was the view that the president must be made the central actor in the vast reorganizationproject the concept of the presidency as uniquely american institution was their touchstone everything seemed to follow from this basic premise the problems affecting contemporary government were to their minds largely administrative incharacter the solution lay in the provision of tools to the president so he couldmanage the entire executive branch through

were willing to concede that it might be reorganized to perform these functions better commissioners critical of the trum an and earlier roosevelt administrations however tended to see the mandate of the commission as the retrenchment and reorientation of the federal government the terms of this philosophical debate progressively changed and were ultimately influenced by the results of the 1948 presidential elections mr hoovers concerns and emphases however had begun to change even prior to the electionas time passed his primary goal had shifted from retrenchments to the enhancement of the managerial authority of the presiden t and his departmental secretaries this shift in emphasis evident before the elec tion was reinforced by the results of the election president truman although protective of the residuals of the new deal was also sympathetic to the scientific management ideals of traditional publicadministration therefore he and herbert hoover were not far apart in

it was their objective to establish clear line of control from the president to those department and agency heads and from them to their subordinates with correlative responsibility from these officials to the president cutting through the barriers which have inmany cases made bureaus and agencies partially independent of the chiefexecutive permit the operating departments and agencies to administer for themselves larger share of the routine administra tive services under strict supervision and in conformity with high standards 147 the doctrine underlying most of the recommendations was that responsibility for making policy and setting standards ought to be centralized in the presidentcentral management agencies and department secretaries rather than being devolved to the agency level the commission criticized the tendency towards dispersingfunctions to independent agencies and called for renewed hierarchical administrative structure the section titled departmental management was short the commission believed that the departmental system had deteriorated because congress andsometimes the president had departed from the norm of the integrated administrativesystem they

afterward to critics all these figures were sheer guesswork that misled the public objec tions to the use of savings estimates in substantial way reduced their appeal or utility to the citizens committee compromise was not considered virtue by the cchr in this instance like many successor commissions supporters relied on horror stories of alleged governmentincompetence and downplayed serious

had undergone sieges by the very persons whom the great society programs had beenintended to benefit literally hundreds of programs had been initiated and run fromwashington with little apparent

policy centralization and administrativedecentralization as presidentelect nixon created number of task forces to give him advice tops on his priority list was reorganizing the white

problems facing government could be solved by reorganizing the federal establishment along soundpolitical management principles he did not view the purpose of reorganization as being the implementation of neutral princi ples of economy and efficiency rather the principal purpose of reorganization to his mind was to alter the terms of politicalpower in nixons case the objective was to reorganize to enhance the power and capacity of the president paradoxically his goals was not to make the president powerful for the institutions sake but to create the leverage to ultimately decentralize the government he believed you had to centralize before you coulddecentralize nixons overall longrange goa l was to move much of the power away from washington and towards the states nd localities or what he called the new federalism 196 the mission of the ash council was to suggest ways and means to the president on how policymaking could be centralized while administration was decentralized from the outset the ash council relie d heavily upon the work and philosophy of the earlier pacgo and the heineman ta sk force the memorandums and reports of these earlier bodies emphasized among other points the need for super departments and additional institutional s upport for the president secondly there was belief that the president and the departments would be

apresident burdened by rigid and curiously moralistic conception of administration these reorganizers generated large bulk of recommendations but little that theydid enhanced the capacity of president carter to govern effectively 241 reorganization act of 1977 president carter had been convinced during his presidential transition period that renewal of the presidents reorganization plan authority was key to success ofhis larger strategy to restructure the executive branch hence one of his firstlegislative proposals to congress on february 4 1977 was bill to renew thepresidents authority to submit reorganizati ons plans an authority which had expired on april 1 1973 and had not been renewed 242 bit of history provides some background on the situation that accompanied the presidents proposal in the three decades since the passage of the reorganization act of 1949 there had been gradual yet persistent erosion in the presidents reorganization authority the erosion reflected the ambivalence felt by congress regarding its delegation ofpower to the president and the ways presidents in recent years had used thisauthority 243 the original 1949 act was noteworthy for the broad scope of authority delegated to the president in th is respect congress was heeding the recommendation of the first hoover commi ssion that few limitations be placed on the presidents authority to submit plans and that agencies be exempted oncethe limiting and exempting process is begun hoover warned it will end thepossibility of achieving really substantial results 244 in subsequent years however congress chose to place limits on this author ity and exempted certain agencies from coverage congress is sometimes described as an institution rendered virtually helpless by the presence of roadblocks in the normal legislative process and the dispersion of power and authority one of the justifi cations traditionally given for the executive reorganization plan process was that it permitted the president and congressionalleadership to overcome these hurdles in 1961 for instance the kennedyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31446crs79 245 us congress senate congressional record 87th cong

introduced prior to theexpiration of the normal period for consideration the extraordinary haste in thiseffort to take the plan from the committee coupled with political reservations on the substance of the proposal led the senate to reject the motion to discharge by voteof 58 to 42 on the day following the sena action the house disapproved the plan 264 to 150 245 rather than deemphasize politics this episode illustrated how the reorganization plan method can escalate politics to high intensity details of thedepartmental structure were relegated to the background the primary issue became whether the president would be politically embarrassed by congress congress in this instance chose to embarrass the presid ent and defeat the plan when congress renewed the reorganization authority in 1964 it reacted to what it considered apresidential endrun by prohibiting the president from submitting reorganization plans that established an executive departme nt 78 stat 240 ot her restrictions on the reorganization plan authority followed congress in 1964 denied the president authority to submit plans proposing new executive departments when the law was renewed in 1971 there was aprovision inserted that plan must be limited in effect to dealing with morethan one logically consistent subject ma tter this limitation had been inspired by an presidential attempt to have number of subjects covered in one plan thereby increasing the congressional oversight burden the reorganization act of 1977 as introduced for the president sought to soften or eliminate five of the restrictions then operative in the reorganizationprocess 1 the president would be allowed to amend plan within 30 days after sending it to congress unless resolution of disapproval had beenordered reported in either house or the appropriate committee in eitherhouse had otherwise reported its recommendations 2 the requirement that only one plan be submitted within 30day period would be eliminated 3 the requirement that each reorganization plan deal with single logically consistent subject matter be eliminatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31446crs80 246 it is worth noting that at the time congress favored the legislative veto as means of overseeing the administration of policies programs and agencies yet expressedconstitutional uneasiness when using it in the reorganization process presidents on theother

also the elimination or merging ofindependent regulatory agencies further provision was inserted that permitted thepresident to submit reorganization plan abo lishing all or part of the functions of

should require an affirmativevote of some sort for approval of pla n the chairman of the house operations committee representative jack brooks dtx had long opposed the legislativeveto approach to approval of plans he favored passage of joint resolution within 60day period as meeting the constitutional test of approval by congress forstatutory enactment 246 although majority of the house co

situation we are facing in this instance 248 administration officials had been quite candid in their belief that the proposal for new department of natural resour ces could not be passed using the regular legislative process the only chance for success in their view lay in areorganization plan 249 when the white house recognized that the senate leadership adamantly opposed the use of reorganization plan to establish department itwithdrew the proposal president carter however did pay price in response tohis request for an extension of the reor ganization authority members of congress gave him only one year extension and served notice that they would use the timeto review the authority and its procedures the administration also had to promise that it had plans to propose the creation of department of natural resources or anything resembling it 250 what was revealed especially during the carter years was that the reorganization plan authority was of dubious value congressional ambivalence over the delegation of reorganization authority to the president resulted inmisunderstanding confusion and recriminati on between the two branches on the one hand congress gave the president authority to skirt the regular legislativeprocess yet when the president invoked the power he risked being accused ofviolating the established system after each presidential misuse

are of equal value and utility reorganizations are instrumental in character and have value except as th ey assist in achieving an agreed upon political or policy objective reorganiza tions cannot

implementation may be costly and result in unanticipated and undesired consequences even if one assumes that the motives of the reorganizersare worthy how is one to know good from bad reorganization is there any theory or set of principles available to us as guideposts in evaluation is there some tribal wisdom available that expresses the collective experience of those who have wrestled with executive management issues before or are we intentionally to avoidthis collective wisdom of the past and si nglemindedly seek out new truths and new organizations reflecting upon the organizational state of the executive branch during the 20th century it is evident that the motivating force for comprehensive reorganizationcommissions has changed from the turn of the century to the mid1970scomprehensive commissions were viewed as instruments to promote executivebranch political accountability to the pr esident and through the president to congress the proposal for bureau of the budget for instance was stronglyfavored by congress as means to hold th president responsible for agency budget submissions and for subsequent agency oversight to be sure the budget bureaustrengthened the institutional presidency but this strengthening was not part of azero sum game where one institutions gain must necessarily be at the expense ofanother institution rather the centralizing element inherent in the establishment of the budget bureau worked to the benefit of both the president and the congress in their relations with the departments and agencies of the executive branch beginning in the 1970s and reaching its peak at the end of the century different motivating force for reorganization emerged the entrepreneurial valuesof the national performance review n pr for instance were

that recent presidents have been ambivalent towards management generally and organizational management inparticular whereas once through the mid1970s there was consensus that thepresident was the chief manager of the executive branch and should haveinstitutional capacity to perform these responsibilities such consensus exists today recent presidents beginning with john f kennedy have been warned by scholars and aides to avoid management issues stephen hess writing in 1976 and read by presidentelect jimmy carter argued that the president ought to limit himself to political leadership presidents have made serious mistake starting withroosevelt in asserting that they are chief managers of the federal government rather than chief manager the president is the chief political officer of the unitedstates 307 this argument was repeated in various forms for the remainder of the century these scholarly warnings reinforced the inclination of contemporarypresidents to shy away from management responsibilities one consequence of this retreat was an erosion in the will and cap acity of the office of management and budget omb to perform management functi ons in bit of historical
