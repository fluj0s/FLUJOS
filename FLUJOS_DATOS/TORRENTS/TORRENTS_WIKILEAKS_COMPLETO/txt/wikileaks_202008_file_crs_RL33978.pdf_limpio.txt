by multilateral agreements reached at the world trade organization but comparable rules exist for investment in its place the bilateral investment treaty bit has emerged over the past several decades as the primary means for promoting and regulating foreign direct investment flows bit is treaty of international law which establishes contract of mutual protection to private persons or firms in each others territories incentives to sign bits include the desire to protect overseas capital investment and to increase the opportunities for additional investments in addition foreign direct investment fdi host countries sign bits primarily to promote inward fdi and signal to foreign investors that they will respect foreign property rights investors sometimes express concerns however that developing countries where the quality of domestic institutions is weak will make promises of pr otection to foreign investors prior to investment only to change various terms such as raising taxes introducing various export quotas or expropriation of assets following the investment the united states established its bit program in 1981 largely modeled on european bits with developing countries that had been in place since the late 1950s since 1981 the us bit program has established international agreements with 47 countries the us government has also increasingly included investment chapters in its free trade agreements that mirror existing us bits us bits establish reciprocal requirements of mutual protection of foreign investments furthermore the agreements guarantee an investor the right to seek international arbitration of investment disputes without requiring them to first pursue settlement through the local court system as the second session of the 110 th congress pursues its oversight of us foreign investment the us bit program may come under additional scrutiny some observers argue that the united states has not pursued an aggressive enough strategy in facilitating foreign protection for us direct investment abroad and that us companies may be at competitive disadvantage with european firms whose home countries have pursued bits more aggressively than the united states others however raise concerns that since us bits are reciprocal agreements they may limit the ability of the united states to impose certain regulations without the threat of liability before an international arbitration moreover congress has raised concerns that foreign investors should not be granted protections for their investments in the united states that are not available to us domestic investors this report provides an overview of the us bit program and highlights two issues that may be of additional congressional interest the impact of bits on us direct investment abroad

issues have come under increasing us and international scrutiny in recent years following the september 11th attacks many americans raised concerns about the potential security and economic impact of foreign investment in industries that may be sensitive to us national security in 2005 the china national offshore oil company cnooc dropped its proposed acquisition of unocal oil company in light of such concerns1 in 2006 dubai ports world sold its recently acquired us port operati ons in six us cities due to congressional and broader us concerns2 regarding us direct investment abroad concerns are often raised by members of congress about potential negative domestic economic effects including job loss and decreased us production3 as the second session of the 110th congress pursues oversight

telecommunications and energy companies in early 2007 unlike european companies such as parisbased totalsa or london based british petroleum who are covered by european bits with venezuela venezuela is party to over two dozen bits american investors have little to recourse several usbased companies including exxon mobil chevron corp and conocophillips have substantial energy investments in venezuela according to one us lawyer who is involved in bit arbitration i wouldnt be optimistic that the us investors would be as fairly treated as they should be6 others however raise concerns that since us bits are reciprocal agreements they may limit the ability of the united states to impose certain regulations without the threat of liability before an international arbitration moreover congress has raised concerns that foreign investors should not be granted protections for their investments in the united states that are greater than those available to us domestic investors thus many observers argue that us bilateral investment treaties need to strike delicate balance between increasing protections for us investment abroad and maintaining the ability of the us government to regulate in the national interest this report provides background information on the us bit program and the international proliferation of such agreements two issues that congress may wish to consider as it evaluates future bits currently under negotiation are whether us bits promote investment abro ad and whether us bits promote governance reforms in developing countries

they are combination of the substantive obligations of the investment treaty agreement and provisions allowing for international arbitration of commercial investment disputes the former typically include national treatment and mostfavored nation mfn treatment of foreign investors in the host country8 the right to transfer profits in hard currency to the home country prohibition on the use of performance requirements9 and protection against direct and indirect expropriation bits first emerged at the end of the 1950s during period of increasing developing country resistence to foreign investment prior to world war ii many of the worlds major nations agreed that foreign investment should be protected by international law and that any taking of foreign property by host country required appropriate compensation known as the hull rule after former us secretary of state cordell hull th is policy evolved out of an investment dispute between mexico and the united states regarding expropriation of various foreign agrarian and oil assets by the mexican government between 1915 and 1940 in resolving the dispute secretary of state hull put forth what would become the classi c statement of full investment protection government is entitled to expropriate private property for whatever purpose without provision for prompt adequate and effective payment therefor10 many analysts contend that this policy remained customary international law until the end of world war ii decolonialization and the rise of group of soviet states led to the collapse of any international consensus on the treatment of foreign investment many developing countries regarded foreign investment warily since it gave foreign companies control over the means of production foreign investment was neocolonialist and through it they argued the developed countries could interfere in the domestic policies of the host nation many countries turned inward shunning foreign investment expropriating foreign assets and establishing import substitution policies that placed high tariffs on foreign goods in an attempt to stimulate local production of needed goods and services according to one analyst in the period after world war ii as foreign investment gained momentum as an increasingly important international economic activity foreign investors who sought the protection of international investment law encountered an ephemeral structure consisting largely of scattered treaty provis ions few questionable customs and contested general principles of law 11

republic respectively other western european countries quickly followed germanys lead by the mid1960s several european countries including france the netherlands denmark and norway had initiated bit programs asian nations began to sign bits in the 1970s japan signed its first bit in 1977 with egypt they were followed by the united states which initiated its bit program in 1977 following the fall of the soviet union central and eastern european countries began signing bits in the late 1980s and 1990s and latin american countries entered the arena in the 1990s the bit network grew slowly over the first three decades by the end of the 1980s 385 bits had been signed 12 this changed by the end of the 1980s from the late 1980s through the present bits have proliferated rapidly both between developed and developing countries and between developing countries figure 1 by the end of the 1990s 1857 bits were in place involving 173 countries as of the end of 2005 there were 2495 such

developing countries has steadily grown over the past several years amounting to 117 billion or about 15 of world outflows in 2005 at the same time there are very few bits between developed countries with the notable exception of the north american fr ee trade agreement nafta whose investment chapter closely mirrors bit the general understanding for the lack of bits between developed countries is the lack of investment risk as we ll as the possible exposure to frivolous dispute claims these issues were among the obstacles that prevented the creation of multilateral agreement on investments at the oecd in the late 1990s13 the explosion of bilateral investment treaties is fundamentally consequence of the rapid growth of fdi to developing countries figure 2 in response to increased capital flows to developing countries developed country capital exporters sought increased protection for the investments while developing countries contradicting their earlier opposition to foreign investment competed with each other to host the growing levels of fd i which is now the largest form of resource transfer to developing countries in 2005 fdi to developing countries reached record level of 2375 billion about 28 of developing countries aggregate gdp 14

that the hull rule remained customary international law and that any expropriation must receive full compensation in addition to creating an international standard that would protect the investment of its nationals the united states seeks to use the bit program to facilitate investment by prompting market liberalizing reforms in its treaty partners this is in contrast to many european bits which are less demanding than the united states on several bit provisions including restrictions on performance requirements protection against expropriation and monetary transfers15 although us bits differ slightly among themselves they broadly provide six basic benefits the better of national treatment or most favored nation treatment for the full life cycle of investment from its establishment or acquisition through its management operation and expansion to its disposition clear limits on the expropriation of investments and provisions for payment of prompt adequate and effective compensation when expropriation takes place quick transfer of funds into and out of the host country without delay using market rate of exchange limited use of tradedistorting performance requirements such as local content rules or export quotas the right to submit an investment dispute with the treaty partners government to international arbitration and the right to engage the top managerial personnel of the investors choice regardless of nationality many bits including those of the united states include national security escape clause for example article 18 of the us uruguay bit states that each party to the treaty has the right to restrict access to any information the disclosure of which it determines to be contrary to its essential security interests and to apply measures that it considers necessary for the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security or the protection of its own essential security interests 16

binding international dispute arbitration17 in the decade since nafta s passage concerns emerged in both canada and the united states about the extent of investor coverage especially in cases of indirect expropriation or government regulation that under the agreement might be subject to dispute settlement unlike other us bits where the united states is the primary foreign investor nafta guaranteed investor protection between two developed countries canad and the united states with significant amounts of crossborder investment subsequently several major cases have been brought before the nafta tribunals some of which have led to monetary damage awards against canada and mexico damages have yet been levied against the united states nonetheless responding to us concerns that the types of protection granted to foreign investors by nafta may have been written too broadly and that foreign investors may receive more favorable treatment for their nafta investorstate dispute claims than americans would under us law congress directed the executive branch in the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 to revise various provisions in its investment agreement negotiations to reach better balance allowing us sovereignty to legislate in its national interest according to one analyst if there is right to compensation for all government action that may decrease the value of foreign investment the result could have chilling effect on the willingness of governments to take regulatory actions necessary for the health and welfare of their citizens including environmental regulatory actions 18 there is also concern about this ability to regulate on the part of developing countries in the trade act of 2002 congress mandated several negotiating objectives to narrow the scope of investment protection the act stated that the principal us negotiating objective on foreign investment is to reduce or eliminate barriers to investment while ensuring that foreign investors in the united states are not accorded greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than united states investors in the ited states and to secure for investors important rights comparable to those that would be available under united states legal principles and practice some observers raise concerns however that since the majority of existing us bitsand likely future bitswill be with developi ng countries where the overwhelming amount of investment flows will be unidirectional narrowing the protections offered to us investors abroad may be problematic if change in developing country attitudes toward foreign investment spurs new round of nationalization of key sectors in developing countries the rights of us citizens to seek redress may be curtailed incorporating congressional objectives the 2004 model bit contains several additions including narrowing the definition of investment covered under the agreement minimum standard of treatment detailed provisions on investorstate dispute settlement and transparency of national laws and proceedings as well as articles addressing environmental and labor standards 19 17 see crs report rl31638 foreign investor

weaken investor protections environmental nongovernmental orga nizations and labor groups on the other hand raised concerns that it did not go far enough in promoting good international standards of conduct the department of states advisory committee on international economic policy released report in march 2004 that summarized many of the diverging views on the bit program and the new model bit generally speaking members who represent companies with investments abroad principally want to ensure that the model bit provides ef fective protection for us investors and their investments from arbitrary discriminatory or unreasonable government measures that undermine the value of their companies investments members who represent environmental and labor organizations believe that the model bit should include obligations to change domes tic laws to raise standards when necessary for environmental protection and the protection of workers rights further these members believe that the draft model bit should obligate investors to meet those standards members who represent labor groups object to any treaty that would facilitate outbound investment that would cause jobs or production to be transferred out of the united states 20 the draft model bit was introduced in november 2004 despite these concerns and was used as the basis for the usuruguay bit the bush administration is currently

framework agreements tifas which require congressional action bits as international legal treaties require senate ratification 21 congress may opt to consider several policy issues as it considers new bilateral investment treaties in addition to the pakistan and rwanda bits the administration has suggested that it may consider concluding bit with china as part of the treasury departments strategic economic dialogue sed furthermore the us government is increasingly including investment chapters that closely model us bits in its bilateral free trade agreements recently concluded ftas with singapore chile australia the central american countries and the dominican republic drcaft panama morocco bahrain and oman all include investment chapters the united states had begun bit negotiations with south korea however these discussions were folded into broader fta negotiations in february 2006 two particular issues that may be of significant congressional interest are the impact of us bits

treaty is one of many factors that might contribute to companys decision to pursue direct investment abroad exchange rate effects taxes the level of trade protection the quality of foreign institutions availability of skilled labor and the availability of infrastructure all contribute to both whether companys decision to become multinational enterprise and where it decides to invest some members of congress and americans more br oadly raise concerns that direct investment abroad may hurt overall us economic welfare by shifting us jobs to developing countries which may have weaker labor and environmental standards then the united states such losses may be exacerbated by the presence of bilateral investment treaty they argue if such treaties promote investment abroad at the expense of domestic investment several economic studies have looked at the impact of bits by comparing changes in foreign direct investment flows against variety of independent variables including market size political and economic institutions the overall country environment for investment per capita income the presence of natural resources total population and the presence of bit many early studies found significant connection between the presence of bit and increased fdi flows22 however more recent research suggests that under certain circumstances signing and ratifying bit does leads to increased investment tobin and roseackerman find in their 2006 study of oecd country bits with developing countries th at bits do have positive impact on fdi flows to developing countries but the impact is highly dependent on the political and economic environment of the host country23 the positive impact of signing bit is strengthened as countrys economy or political environment for in vestment improves neumayer and spess in study looking at bits between 119 countries ov er the period 1970 and 2001 find that developing countries that sign bits with developed countries receive more fdi than countries that do not pursue these treaties24 contradicting tobin and roseackerman however they find that bits may substitute for good domestic institutional policies while recent studies suggest that bits may promot us direct investment abroad data has not supported the argument that direct investment abroad replaces domestic investment25 this 22 for example mary hallwarddreimeier do

is fixed and thus any overseas production must be compensated for by decrease in the amount of production at home however while economywide evidence has not supported this argument economists have observed its impact on various sectors of the us economy26

distinct goal of us bits is to promote the adoption in developing countries of marketoriented policies that treat private investment both foreign and domestic in nondiscriminatory transparent and open way bit proponents argue that signing bit will spur countries to improve domestic courts and create an environment that is more enticing for foreign investment it is unclear however to what extent pursuing bit has this effect some analysts raise concerns that bits may substitute for local institutions and rather than improve host country governance may lead to reductions in the quality of local institutions rather than create an incentive for further reform bit may actually decrease incentives for developing countries to improve their local courts preliminary evidence appears to support this assertion since foreign investors in country with which the united states has signed bit can bypass domestic courts and seek international arbitration of investment disputes key lobbying constituent for local institutional reform is removed this can lead to system where foreign investors have access to effective and efficient dispute settlement while local investors are required to use potentially corrupt local courts according to one analyst the proliferation of bits inflicts double whammy on law reform efforts in developing states first by dulling the interest of foreign investors in building good domestic rule of law institutions and then by encouraging foreign investors to devise alternative institutional arrangements that are inimical to the development of sound regulatory institutions and policies27 alternatives to bits proposed by some analysts include increased reliance on alternative multilateral investment protection mechanisms existing investor protection mechanisms include the world trade organizations general agreement on trade and services gats trade related investment measures trims or the trade related aspects of intellectual property trips28 26
