divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32125tax exemption for repatriated foreign earnings proposals and analysis summary an important feature of several broad business and international tax bills in the 108th congress has been their different propos als to reduce the tax us firms pay on dividends they receive from their overseas subsidiaries most prominent were s 1637 as passed by the senate the housepa ssed version of hr 4520 and the broad business tax bill that was pproved in october 2004 the american jobs creation act pl 108357 the proposals fit into the us tax structure as follows while the united states taxes corporations that are chartered in the united states on their worldwide income it does not tax foreign chartered corporations on their foreign source income thus with some excepti ons if us firm conducts its foreign business through foreignch artered subsidiary corpora tion its overseas earnings are not subject to us tax as long as the income remains in the hands of the foreign subsidiary and is reinvested abroad the income is subject to us tax only when it is ultimately repatriated to the us parent corporation as dividends or other intra firm payments at that point us taxe s ordinarily apply although credits may be claimed for foreign taxes paid it is th us taxes due upon repatriation that would be reduced under the proposals the feature of the us tax code that llows us firms to postpone taxes on their overseas earnings is known as deferral although the tax code in some cases denies deferral to passive i nvestment income the benefit is generally available for active business income earned through fore ign subsidiaries in general deferral poses tax incentive for us firms to invest in foreign countries with low tax rates this is because postponed tax matters less to firm than tax that is paid currently as long as payment is postponed firm can invest and earn return on what would otherwise be spent on taxes supporters of tax cut for repatr iated dividends argue that the tax that applies to repatriated dividends is part of deferrals tax incentive to employ capital abroad they argue that the tax on repatriations discourages us firms from repatriating their foreign earning s in some cases they point out us firms confront the choice of reinvesting given amount of foreign profits in low tax foreign country without immediately paying us tax or of triggering us tax by paying dividends to the us parent the us tax it is argued discourages repatriation and has induced some us firms to accumulate large stocks of reinvested earnings abroad reducing the tax it is argued will stimulate flow of earnings back to the united states and will increase investment in the united states according to economic theory temporar tax cut for repatr iations may induce nearterm increase in dividend remittances to us parent firms permanent rather than temporary tax cut however may have impact on repatriations while at the same time inducing firms to increase new capital outflows from the united states to locations abroad if repatriations occur it is not clear whether us firms would use the repatriated funds to finance investment or put them to other uses for example the payment of dividends to stockholders in the area of economic stimulus some or all of the stimulative impact of repatriations may be offset by exchange rate adjustments that would reduce net exports this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32125contents d f r r l 2 proposals in the 108th c n g r s s 3 the conference agreement pl 108357 4 c n m i c f f c t

has considered several bills containing variety of provisions that affect international bus iness and investment its deliberations culminated in the enactment of broad business and internationaltax bill in october 2004 as the american jobs cr eation act hr 4520 pl 108357 principal impetus for the bills was the controversy between the united states and the european union over the us extraterritorial income eti tax benefit for exports each of the bills addressed the dispute by repealing eti however the bills also contained numerous tax benefits and investme nt incentives designed in part to offset the economic effects of etis repeal in the international area one of the most prominent proposals was plan to reduce the us tax that us firms pay when their overseas operations remit repatriate their foreign earnings as dividends to their us parent corporations proposal th at was included in pl 108357 different variations on this concept were contained in several of the eti bills that preceded pl 108357 the initially introduced vers ion of hr 2896 thomas the provision was not included in later version of h r 2896 s 1475 hatch s 1637 grassley approved by the full senate in may 2004 and hr 4520 revised version of hr 2896 that was approved by the full house in j une earlier versions of the plan were contained in the senatepa ssed version of the may 2003 tax cut bill pl 10827 the jobs and growth tax relief and reconciliation act or jgtrra and in hr 767 english hr 1162 smith and s 596 ensign proponents of the tax cut fo r repatriations argue that the provisions will result in increased repatriations of funds us firms would otherwise reinvest abroad thus boosting us domestic investment as tailed below however economic analysis suggests that the impact of the tax cut depends heavily on whether it is temporary or permanent most of the legislative propos als would provide temporary rather than permanent reduction temporary ta x cut may indeed trigger increased repatriations although whether us firms would use the funds to finance increased investment is uncertain permanent ta x cut on repatriations would likely have impact on repatriations and may encourage us firms to increase their level of new investment abroad but whether the tax cut will or will not stimulate repatriations may not be the key to the proposals effect on us econo mic growth first even if sizeable repatriations occur the rate of return available from us investment will not be altered by the repatriations it is thus possible that the bulk of the repatriations will be remitted to stockholders or used to pay down corporate debt second when the repatriations occur those that are denominated in foreign currencies will be converted to dollars which may drive up th price of the dollar in world currency markets as result us net exports may decline from levels that would otherwise occur and the stimulative impact of the repatriations on the us economy may be mutedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32125crs2 before discussing this analysis in detail however we look first at the us international tax structure and how each of the repatriation pr oposals would alter it deferral the united states bases its jurisdiction to tax international income on residence it thus taxes us chartered corporations on their worldwide income but does not tax foreign corporations on their foreignsource income accordingly us firm with overseas operations can indefinitely postpone its us tax on its foreign income by conducting its foreign operations through fo reignchartered subs idiary corporation as long as its foreign earnings remain in the hand of the subsidiary and are reinvested abroad us taxes do not apply the fi rm pays taxes on its overseas earnings only when they are remitted from the foreign subsidiary to the domestic us parent as intrafirm dividends or other income another prominent feature of the us ta x system that deserves mention here is the foreign tax credit provision design ed to alleviate double taxation where us and foreign governments tax jurisdictions overlap under its terms us taxpayers can generally credit foreign taxes they pay against us taxes they would otherwise owe foreign taxes however can only be credited against the portion of us tax that falls on foreign rather than domes ticsource income when firms foreign taxes exceed us tax on foreign income th excess cannot be credited in the current year accordingly firm pays total taxes us plus foreign on its foreign income taxes at an average rate that is equal to either the us tax rate or the foreign tax rate whichever is higher with respect to repatriate d dividends us firms can claim indirect foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid by thei r subsidiaries on the earnings out of which the repatriated dividends are paid thus for investment that uses the deferral principle us firm pays taxes at the higher of the us or foreign rate the us component however is paid on deferred basis as descri bed more fully below this ability to defer us tax poses an incentive for us firms to invest abroad in countries with low tax rates the proposal s to cut taxes on repa triation are based on the premise that even this deferre d tax on remitted dividends discourages repatriations and encourages firms to reinvest foreign earnings abroad and that cut in the tax would stimulate repatriations an exception to the deferral principle is provided by the tax codes subpart f provisions which were first enacted in 1962 as means of discouraging us firms from accumulating taxdeferred income in subsidiaries located in offshore tax havens under subpart f cer tain types of income are s ubject to us tax whether they are repatriated or not subpart f income generally includes income from passive investment eg interest rents royalties and dividends from unrelated corporations as well as several other types of income whose geographic source is thought to be easily manipulated in general however income from active business operations is outside the scope of subpart f and can benefit from deferralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32125crs3 proposals in the 108th congress early in 2003 three bills were introduced that proposed reduced taxes on repatriations hr 767 english h r 1162 smith and s 596 ensign subsequently the senate ve rsion of jgtrra would also have reduced taxes on repatriations but the measur was dropped in conference subsequently tax cut for repatriations was included in several bills that address the eti controversy while also proposing number of domestic and fo reign investment incentives the most prominent of these were s 1637 senator grassley approved by the full senate on may 11 2004 and hr 4520 representa tive thomas passed by the house in june the tax cut for repatriations woul d be temporary in the case of each bill as was the tax cut that was included in th conference agreement on hr 4520 and that was signed into law an additional propos that was prominent in the legislative debate on eti did not propose to cut taxe s on repatriations hr 1769s 970 crane and rangel in the house and hollings in the senate s 1637 proposed to temporarily reduce th tax rate on repatr iated dividends as passed by the house hr 4520 proposed to provide deduction delivering tax cut of similar magnitude specifically hr 4520 would have provided an 85 deduction generally the equiva lent of 525 tax rate for firm paying the top corporate rate of 35 under current w 35 x 100 85 525 s 1637 proposed to replace the regular corporate income tax normally applicable to repatriations with 525 excise tax both bills applied their reduced rate or deduction to the excess of some measure of repatriated dividends over average re patriations during base period s 1637 applied its reduced rate only to repatriations in excess of average repatriations in three of the five most recent taxable years ending before january 1 2003 with the highest and lowest repatr iation years disregarded hr 4520 limited its deduction to dividends in excess of re patriations over the same base period but with an ending date of march 31 2003 both proposals so required firms to adopt domestic investment plans for repatria tions that qualify for the reduced tax hr 4520 added an additional cap limiting its deduction to the greater of 500 million or the amount of earnings shown to be permanently reinve sted in outside the united states in firms books of account each of the bills generally denied foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid on repatriations that qualify for the reduced rate or the deduction s 1637 also reduced the foreign tax credit limitation of firms using its reduced rate thereby ruling out the possibility of double benefit in add ition both hr 4520 and s 1637 contained mechanism that was apparently intended to reduce the possibility of firms foreign tax credits reducing the benefit of the bills repatriation rate reduction or deduction the mechanisms generally work ed by permitting taxpayer to select which dividends qualify for the benefit and which are not included because they do not exceed the base period computation since only dividends exceeding the base period amount qualifed for the bills reduced rate or deduction taxminimizing firm would choose dividends subject to high foreign taxes and that are thus shielded from us tax by foreign tax credits as be ing less than the base period amount and dividends subject to low foreign taxes as exceeding the base amount these latterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32125crs4 1 us congress conference committees 2004 american jobs creation act of 2004 conference report to accompany hr 4520 hrept 108755 108th cong 2nd sess washington gp 2004 p 314dividends would be unshielded by foreign ta x credits and could thus benefit from the bills rate reduction the pr oposals would not apply to re tained earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are subject to subpart f as noted in the analysis below an im portant dimension of the proposals is the time frame over which they would apply and whether their reduction for repatriated dividends would be permanent or temporar this design feature could have an important impact on whether firms respond to the tax cut with increased repatriations one line of ec onomic reasoning suggests temporary reduction is more likely to stimulate increas ed repatriations as not ed above the repatriations provisions under both s 1637 and hr 4520 and also pl 108357 would be temporary s 1637s reduced tax rate would apply only to repatriations occurring over the course of single year the first tax year ending 120 days or more after the bills enactment hr 4520 would apply to repatriations over sixmonth period elected by the taxpayer subject to certain conditions the conference agreement pl 108357 the repatriation taxcut that was dopted with pl 108357 provides an 85 deduction as in the house bill as with the house b ill this would deliver the equivalent of tax rate of 525 for fi rm paying taxes on other income at the generallyapplicable 35 cor porate rate the deduction would be available for one tax year at the taxpayers option the year would be the first tax year beginning on or after pl 108357s date of enactment or the last tax year beginning before that date as with both the house and senate bills the conference agreement limits eligible dividends to repatriations in excess of thr eeyear base period but with the base period ending june 30 2003 and as w ith the house and senate bills pl 108 357 requires firms to adopt domestic inves tment plans for qualif ying repatriations as with the house bill the conference agreement limits the maximum deduction to the greater of 500 million or the amount of earnings shown to be permanently reinvested outside the united states in firms books of accounts certified before june 30 2003 the house bill however specified march 31 2003 as with the house bill foreign tax credits are denied with respect to the deductible part of dividends although taxpayers are permitted to choose whic h dividends comprise the baseperiod amount and which ar eligible for the deduction the conference report states the conferees emphasize that this is temporary economic stimulus measure and that there is intent to make this measure permanent or to extend or enact it again in the future1

debate supporters of tax cut for repatriated divide nds have argued that the imposition of us tax on repatriations discourages us firms from remitting their foreign earnings to the united states and encourages them to reinvest the earnings abroad cutting the tax on remitted dividends they have argued will trigger stream of repatriations according to one study c ited by proponents oneyear tax reduction such as that in the proposals at hand and th at contained in the enacted measure will encourage firms to repatriate an add itional 300 billion from overseas the inflow it has been argued will in turn result in an increase in domestic investment and economic growth it will also permit firm s to pay down their debt thus reducing their risk of bankruptcy2 other analyses have been sk eptical of the amount of re patriations the tax cut will stimulate and even if repatriations do increase question whether the repatriations will trigger an increase in investment within the united states critics have also suggested that the proposals will provide windfall gain to stoc kholders of eligible corporations since firms with existing foreign investments embarked on their projects with the full expectation that the remitted profits would be subject to the full us dividend taxation and foreign tax credit system3 impact on repatriations the analysis here focuses on two questions first would either temporary or permanent tax reduction for repatriated fo reign earnings result in an appreciable increase in repatriations second if such an increase does indeed occur what would be its impact on the domestic economy we begin by looking at the incentive eff ects of the current us international system with the deferral system and indi rect foreign tax cr edit described above economic theory is relatively clear on the basic incentive impact of the system ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32125crs6 4 david g hartman tax policy nd foreign direct investment journal of public economics vol 26 feb 1985 pp 107121encourages us firms to invest more capital than they otherwise would in overseas locations where local taxes are low the reason is that by using deferral us firms can postpone payment of us tax indefin itely and because of discounting called deferral principle or simply deferral receive tax benefit because taxes that are postponed matter less to firm than an equal amount of taxes paid currently postponed taxes can be invested by the fi rm and earn return until they are actually paid accordingly deferral poses an incen tive for us firms to invest abroad in countries with low tax rate s over investment in the united states according to traditional economic theory deferral thus reduces economic welfare by encouraging firms to undertake overseas investments th at are less productive before taxes are considered than alternative investments in the united states an expansion in the scope of deferral for example sca ling back of subpart f would likely increase net us investment abroad in general repeal of deferral would likely reduce overseas investment but the proposals at hand would not repeal deferral or alter its scope they would chan ge just one element of the taxdeferral structure the magnitude of taxes due on re patriation further most of the proposals would do so only temporarily thus the anal ysis needs to be more detailed than one that simply looks at the overall general impact of deferral it needs to isolate the impact of the repatriation taxes in particular in recent decades economists analyzin g the impact of repatriations have increasingly drawn an analogy between the decision of whether to repatriate earnings and the decision domestic corporation ma kes in whether to pay dividends to its individual stoc kholders an anal ogy developed by hartman in 19854 i n t h domestic setting the new view or trapped equity of dividends holds that taxes on dividends have bearing on the payout decision because once equity enters corporation taxes must inev itably be paid when the funds earnings are paid to stockholders in the intern ational setting the new view similarly notes that once firm makes an initial infusion of equity capital in foreign subsidiary homecountry taxes must inevitably be paid when the investments earnings are repatriated that is as long as the firm does not have sufficient foreign tax credits to offset us taxes due on repatriated dividends given this inevitability once the capital is abroad repatriation taxes have impact on the firms decision whether to repatriate foreign earnings in the present or to instead reinve st them abroad this irrelevance holds as long as the investing firm does not expect the tax laws or its circumstances for example its foreign tax credit position to change given that repatriation taxes are inevitable once capital is infused in foreign subsidiary the new view holds that it ma kes sense for firm to simultaneously send new equity capital abroad while repatriating earnings that are already overseas firms foreign operations will instead tend to follow life cycle with initial infusions of capital that occur as long as there are sufficiently profitable foreign investment opportunities followed by peri od when retained earnings are sufficient to fund the firms declining investment re quirements and repatr iations occur the new view thus distinguishes between young foreign operations where us firms arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32125crs7 5 harry grubert and john mutti taxing international business income dividend exemption versus the current system

10 2000 pp 255268making new capital infusions from the unite d states abroad and mature operations who retain earnings to finance their foreig n investments and who make repatriations the new view here produces its first conc lusion regarding the impact of change in repatriation taxes permanent reductions in taxes on repatriated dividends will likely lead to increased overseas investment by young firms it will likely lead to change in repatriations by mature foreign operations in the latter case the reduction in taxes will simply be manifest in windfa ll gains to the firms stockholders the result is different for temporary tax cut at least in the short run the irrelevance of repatriation taxes depends on the taxes be ing the same whether the earnings are repatriated in the present or the future if taxes are temporarily reduced this condition longer holds and firm with mature foreign operations may gain by advancing repatria tions for young operations temporary tax cut may have impact as long as the reduction expires befo re the firm plans to begin repatriating profits note that this result is similar to the impact of repatriation taxes on firms whose foreign tax credit status changes from year to year in one year such firm might have foreign tax credits sufficient to avoid any repatriation taxes in subsequent year firm might not have nough foreign tax credits to offset all us tax that would be due on repatriations such firms are thought to adopt an intermittent pattern of repatriations sending funds home from abroad in years when foreign tax credits are plentiful and reinvesting funds when they are not it is possible however that this temporary increase in repatriations might reverse after the tax cut expires with repatriations declining below levels that otherwise would have occurred as result of the temporarily increased repatriations the repatriating firms investment stock may decline thus increasing the pretax return that stands to be earned by additional retained earnings it may thus be profitable to follow an increase in repatriations with an increase in retained earnings in effect the temporary increas in repatriations will have accelerated or borrowed repatriations from future time periods in its international setting the results of the new view of dividends has been supported by an increasing body of theore tical and empirical work for example studies have identified seve ral means by which overseas subsidiaries can repatriate earnings while avoiding repatr iation taxes thus making repatriation taxes irrelevant as in the new view parent firms for example can borrow against their subsidiaries investments5 however in the traditional view firms simultaneously send new capital abroad and repatriate earnings means perhaps of signaling profitability to its homecountry managers and owners th ere is also distinction between young and mature foreign operati ons under this analysis permanent reduction of dividend taxes might cause earnings to be re patriated but would so result in new increase in us firms overseas investment temporary tax cut might likewise temporarily increase repatr iations but as under the ne w view the increase wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32125crs8 6 american sharehol ders association apa repatriation scorecard 217 billion repatriated back to americ at least another 100 bi llion on

investment from foreign locations to the united states in short then temporary cut in taxes on repatriation may stimulate temporary increase in repatriations but acco rding to prominent strain of economic theory permanent tax cut or tax cut th at is perceived by investors as one that will ultimately become permanent will have impact if however the enacted tax cut were to be temporary what might be the magnitude of repatriations it would trigger as noted above supporters of the tax cut have cite d smithbarney study that indicates pool of 300 billion in ear nings has been reinvested abroad that would potentially benefit from the tax cut if it were enacted data compiled by the department of commerce bureau of ec onomic analysis suggests the stock of unrepatriated earnings is at least that large at yearend 1999 the stock was 403 billion rough estimates suggest the stoc k grew to around 639 billion by yearend 2002 given that approximately 75 of foreign income is earned by firms without sufficient foreign tax credits to offset u s tax these figures suggest that around 479 billion of earnings have been retained abroad that would be subject to us tax on repatriation again however this figure re presents simply the pool of funds in position to take advantage of the tax cut and not the volume of funds that would be repatriated supporters of the repatriation tax holiday have argued that the provision did indeed stimulate repatriati ons in 2005 one group has argued that in response to lower tax rates us increased repatria tions to 217 billion in 2005 compared to 36 billion in 20046 these amounts however are pparently those reported by the federal reserve system for all repatria tions not just the increased amount that occurred because of the tax cut impact on the domestic economy if the tax cut were to indeed stimulate increased repatriations what would be its likely impact on the domestic economy first traditional economic theory is skeptical of the ability of repatriations to stimulate domestic investment the reasoning is as follows firms undertake investments based on the prospective attractiveness of i nvestment opportunities on the one hand and the return savers ie stockholders require of their corporatesector inve stments on the other an increase in cash flow in the form of larger repatriations would change neither the return that can be generated by domes tic investment opport unities nor the return required by savers thus th repatriation is thought unlik ely to stimulate an increase in domestic investment rath er the repatriated dividends are more likely to be put to other uses for example the payment of dividends to existing stockholders or paying down of debt httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32125crs9 as noted above several of the bills including the enacted version make the availability of the tax cut contingent on the repatriating firm adopting plan for investing the repatria ted funds however even the presence of such plan may not induce firm to increase its investment or in effect to use its repatriated funds to finance domestic investments the reas on is the fungibility of corporate funds resources repatriated from abroad can fi nance domestic investment more or less effectively than funds whose origin is the united states thus for example firm could adopt plan that dedicates the repatriated funds to investment but at the same time it could switch dom esticsource funds to other uses for example the payment of dividends fungibility and re lated concepts also question the efficacy of several other mechanisms designed to augment their effect for example the limitation of qualified dividends to an excess over past base period and the linking of the tax cut to the presence of funds characterized as pe rmanently reinvested abroad economic theory is also skeptical of the impact of an increase in repatriations as an economic stimulus because of the lik ely effect of repatriations on exchange rates and in consequence on trade th adjustments work as follows when the earnings of foreign subsidiaries are repa triated they are converted from foreign currencies to us dollars the increased demand for dollars drives up the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets as consequence of the dollars appreciation us exports become more expensive for foreign buyers and imports become cheaper for us buyers us exports w ould thus temporarily decline which would place drag on the economy that would fully or partly offset any stimulative effect from the injection of repatr iated funds into the economy the repatriation proposals would also likely have an impact on us tax revenues the joint committee on taxation has estimated that the rate reduction in s 1637 would reduce revenues by 38 b illion over 10 years fy2004fy2013 the deduction in the housepasse d version of hr 4520 would reduce revenue by 35 billion over 11 years fy2004fy2014 and the enacted measure in pl 108357 is expected to reduce revenue by 33 billion over 10 years fy2005fy2014 the estimates each of the bills show s imilar pattern over time each are timated to actually increase tax revenues in their fi rst year probably reflecting an underlying assumption in the estimates that repatriations would initially increase in subsequent years the proposals are predicted to reduce revenues by gradually d iminishing amounts which likely reflects an assumption th at at least part of the initial increase in repatriations would be drawn from repatriations that would have been made in subsequent years in the case of each bill the longrun estimated revenue loss from the repatriation measure alone makes up only small portion of the bills revenue loss from all the bills revenuelosing items for example larger revenuelosing items in s 1637 include deduction fo r income from domestic production and an extension of the carryforward period for fore ign tax credits larger items in both the housepassed bill are its ra reduction for domestic pr oduction and consolidation of foreign tax credit limitations larger ite ms in pl 108357 are deduction for domestic production and c onsolidation of foreig n tax credit limitations
