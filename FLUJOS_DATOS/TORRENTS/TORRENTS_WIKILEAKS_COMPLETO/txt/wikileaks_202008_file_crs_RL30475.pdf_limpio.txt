states 2 mexicos efforts to control drug trafficking seizures arrests eradication and 3 mexicos cooperati on with the united states in counternarcotics efforts share of traffic mexico continued to be the transit point for about 5560 of the cocaine entering the united states from south america last year although estimates vary and more cocaine may be coming through other areas as result of enhanced mexican interdiction efforts in recent years mexico also continued to be major source country for heroin marijuana and methamphetamine control efforts mexican seizures of opium methamphetamine and heroin in 1999 were up dramatically from the previous years and seizures of cocaine and marijuana in 1999 were also up significantly compared to most recent years although comparison to the highly criticized performance in 1998 alone would be misleading total arrests were up in 1999 compared to 1998 and from 19941995 but down from 19961997 several major traffickers were arrested in 1999 including juan quintero payan founder and leader of the amado carillo fuentes or juarez cartel and two key associates some important suspects remain in custody pending extradition to the united states after mexican courts dismissed charges in some cases eradication of opium declined in 1999 but with declining areas of cultivation the potential yield declined to nearrecord low eradication of marijuana nearly doubled in 1999 and with declining cultivation the potential yield was down to the lowest level in recent years cooperative efforts usmexico counternarcotics cooperation continued at unprecedented levels in 1999 with the full range of law enforcement military border and drug control agencies being involved however mexico asked the united states to retrieve 72 huey helicopters donated for counterdrug missions after determining that they were not adequate for the intended missions when president clinton visited mexico in midfebruary 1999 the countries signed agreements on procedures to coordinate law enforcement efforts and on measures to gauge the effectiveness of the joint antidrug strategy in november 1999 the two governments established new interdiction working group under the high level contact group the countries have been cooperating on and oas antidrug activities including the agreement of the interamerican drug control commission cicad in october 1999

counternarcotics efforts beginning with legislation originally enacted in the mid1980s congress has required the president to certify annually subject to congressional review that drug producing or drugtransit countries had cooperated fully with the united states in drug control efforts during the previous year to avoid suspension of us aid1 mexico has been fully certified each year but congress has closely monitored these certifications and resolutions of disapproval were introduced in 1996 1997 1998 and 1999 in 1996 floor action was taken in 1997 each house passed separate resolutions in 1998 senate version was defeated in floor action and in 1999 action was taken on house resolutions2 president clintons march 1 2000 certification of mexico as fully cooperative in drug control efforts has been criticized by several members including the chairmen of the house international relations committee and the senate foreign relations committee estimates of mexicos share of drug trafficking activity according to estimates by the department of states bureau for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs mexico is the primary transit point for cocaine entering the united states

role of mexican criminal organizations on the production and distribution of heroin as well as cocaine methamphetamine and marijuanamexicos share of illicit traffic in the various areas has remained high over the years although there are variations in the estimates the methodology for making the estimates whether derived from seizures or some other means is not regarded as entirely adequate and the estimates may be affected by changing trafficking patterns as much as enforcement efforts the state departments reports covering 1996 and 1997 estimated that mexico was the transshipment point for 5060 of usbound cocaine shipments and up to 80 of methamphetamine precursor chemicals like ephedrine although the report on 1997 stated that precise figures concerning illegal trade flows are not available with endof1998 estimates dea administrator thomas constantine testified in early 1999 that approximately twothirds of the cocaine available in the united states comes over the usmexi co border while the state departments international narcotics control strategy report incsr covering 1998 stated that us agencies estimate that almost 60 of colombian cocaine passed through mexico the incsr report covering 1999 states that mexico is the principal transit route to the united states for up to 60 percent of the south american cocaine sold in the uswhile deas chief of international operations william ledwith testifying before the house committee on government reforms subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources on february 29 2000 stated that approximately 55 of the cocaine available in the united states is transported across the usmexico border with respect to heroin while the incsr report covering 1995 estimated that 20 30 of the heroin consumed in the united states was produced in mexico subsequent years reports have not included estimates in this area dea spokesmen stated in february 1999 and february 2000 hearings that heroin produced in mexico represented 14 of heroin seized in the united states according to one study and that as much as 29 of heroin being used in the united states is being smuggled in by mexican crime syndicates according to another study4 mexican criminal organizations are major sources for methamphetamine precursor chemicals like ephedrine and for the distribution of methamphetamine in the united states although the incsr reports on 1998 and 1999 do not include estimate s the dominant trafficking group for these substances the amezcua contreras or colima cartel was hindered by the arrest of two key leaders in 1998 mexico remains major source of foreignproduced marijuana dominating the us import market according to dea seizures of mexican marijuana increased from 102 metric tons in 1991 to 836 metric tons

illicit drug activities table 1 shows estimates of mexican drug control efforts in three areas seizures arrests and eradication from 1993 to 1999 caution should be exercised in considering the changes in the various areas as an indication of mexicos seriousness in controlling drug trafficking the trends may also be affected by the demand for the drugs the amount of drugs produced or available the sophistication of the drug traffickers the intelligence and capabilities of mexican counterdrug agencies the effectiveness of reporting and monitoring methods the effect of weather conditions on

embassy of mexico press bulletin 0009 mexicos new counternarcotics strategy produces record interdiction and eradication results february 1 2000seizures of drugs with regard to mexican seizures of drugs in 1999 there were dramatic increases in the seizures of opium up 435 heroin up 114 and methamphetamine up 273 and significant increases in the seizures of cocaine up 48 and marijuana up 37 compared to 1998 but the comparison is to year in which mexicos performance was criticized looking at the figures from broader perspective it becomes clear that seizure results in 1999 were generally much improved in the case of opium the seizures were four times the average seizures for the previous six years and in the case of methamphetamine more than three times the average seizures in the last three years but less than the seizures in 1995 in the case of heroin the seizures were more than double the seizures in 1997 and 1998 but less than amounts seized in 1994 and 1996 in the case of marijuana the seizures were nearly 50 higher than the three previous years and double or triple the seizures in the earlier years shown on the chart in the case of ephedrine the seizures were less remarkable with seizures in 1999 being higher than in 1998 but less than in 1997 and considerably less than in 1995 and 1996 with regard to cocaine which many consider to be key test the seizures were larger than in most of the previous years but they were largely the result of several successful maritime operations involving cooperation between the mexican navy and the us coast guard these netted over six metric tons each while cocaine seizures were up in 1999 it should be pointed out that seizures in 1993 and 1997 were larger mexicos success in the seizure of drugs could be attributed to the fact that the government has been devoting more and more resources to interdiction in recent years in midfebruary 1999 the government announced plan to commit 400 500 million over the next few years for the purchase of planes speed boats and mobile search xray systems to enhance its capability to seal the borders against the transit of drugs in february 2000 the government announced that it had spent over 165 million on counternarcot ics equipment personnel and training in 1999 and that it was allocating almost 440 million for equipment acquisition personnel training and antidrug operations in 2000 this constituted 167 increase in the counterdrug budget including expenses for the new federal preventive police the secretariats of national defense and navy and the attorney generals office5 arrests of drug traffickers with regard to arrests of drug trafficke rs arrests of foreigners in 1999 were down from an unusually high level in 1998 but were still higher than all previous years except 1996 total arrests and arrests of mexicans in 1999 were up from 1998 and from 19941995 but down from 19961997 and way down from 1993 leaving pattern that is not entirely

called operation impunity with us interagency and usmexico binational cooperation that culminated in the arrest of over 106 individuals linked to the carillo fuentes organization according to some accounts crippling the organization6 following important arrests in 1998 while the amezcuacontreras brothers also arrested in 1998 on methamphetamine trafficking charges were cleared of charges by mexican courts they are still being held in mexico on us charges pending extradition proceedings in february 2000 the mexican attorney generals office arrested jesus chuck norris chavez leader of the juarez cartel and in march 2000 the mexican military arrested jesus labra high ranking figure in the arellano felix or tijuana cartel7 mexican authorities argue that some of the most wanted drug lords are dead or in prison at this time and that the juarez and colima organizations have been seriously weakened in recent years the mexican government extradited 14 persons to the united states in 1999 compared to 16 from the united states to mexico including two mexican nationals wanted on murder and drug trafficking charges this pattern is similar to the number of extraditions from mexico since 1995 during the zedillo administration and is considerably greater than the number of extraditions during previous mexican administrations mexican courts continue to be reluctant to approve extradition of mexican nationals even when recommended by the mexican foreign ministry and have raised questions about the constitutionality and appropriateness of extraditions especially where capital punishment or life sentences might be applied8 critics argue that mexican authorities have failed to make adequate efforts to weed out corruption to arrest and dismantle the major drug cartels to extradite mexican citizens to the united states on drugrelated charges and to enforce the countrys antimoneylaundering legislation 9 among the recent cases of alleged corruption and suspected drug trafficke rs influence mentioned in the press are the disappearance to avoid prosecution in march 1999 of quintana roo governor mario villanueva who was reported to be protecting the transit of drugs

senior official in mexicos federal attorney generals office on the eve of investigation of unexplained funds in his safe deposit boxes10 eradication of illicit crops with respect to eradication of illicit crops the results are complicated by differing levels of overall cultivation of opium poppies and marijuana and by the fact that mexican data show raw estimates of areas sprayed while the united states data show effective eradication estimates of the crop destroyed factoring in replanting of crops repeated spraying in the same area and other variables while the us estimate of effective eradication of opium poppy cultivation in 1999 was down from recent years except for 1994 and 1996 with the continuing decline in area under cultivation the estimated net opium drug crop yield in 1999 was also down falling to 43 metric tons of opium gum this is nearrecord low and is below any of the previous years on the chart the us estimate of effective eradication of mexican marijuana was about double recent years given the continuing steady decline in the area cultivated the estimated potential yield of marijuana was down to 6700 metric tons the lowest level in recent years except 1993 and 1994 based on new potential yield methodology11 with an eradication program and results rivaled only by colombia mexico has reduced cultivation of marijuana drastically in recent years mexicos counternarcotics cooperation with the united states usmexico counternarcotics cooperation has increased substantially since the inauguration of president zedillo in december 1994 with the full range of law enforcement military and border and drug control agencies being involved while the flow of drugs from mexico remains high and incidences of corruption persist the clinton administration seems confident that president zedillo is committed to rooting out corruption and establishing close working relationship with the united states in this area at the highest diplomatic level there is the binational commission established in 1977 which brings cabinetlevel officials together once year to discuss the full range of usmexico relations including legal and antinarcotics affairs with specific focus on counternarcotics issues the high level contact group hlcg established in 1996 provides for cabinetlevel coordination twice yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30475crs7 subordinate hlcg working groups on money laundering chemical control demand reduction prisoner transfer extradition and mutual legal assistance meet four times per year to coordinate policies the plenary group on law enforcement coordinated by the two attorneys general also meets four or five times year on law enforcement issues acting through these groups the two countries agreed in may 1997 upon an antidrug alliance during visit to mexico by president clinton the leaders developed draft joint strategy in november 1997 when president zedillo visited washington and the two presidents signed protocol to permit temporary extradition of crossborder criminals for trial and hemispheric convention against illegal firearms trafficking more recently the two leaders issued the joint antidrug strategy in early february 1998 and they agreed on methods for coordinating activities in june 1998 despite mexican displeasure with operation casablanca us undercover operation aimed at money laundering operations the presidents signed agreements on law enforcement cooperation and implementation of performance measures of effectiveness for the joint strategy when president clinton visited mexico in mid february 1999 and the two governments decided in november 1999 to establish new interdiction working group under the high level contact group in addition in recent years mexico and the united states have cooperated extensively on united nations and organization of american states oas antidrug activities they worked together with other governments on the agreement of the interamerican drug control commission cicad in october 1999 to adopt multilateral evaluation mechanism mem to assess all member countries counter narcotics performance the united states has been involved in the training and screening of mexicans involved in several important new law enforcement agencies these include the new mexican antidrug agency called the special prosecutor for crimes against health feads which replaced the discredited national counternarcotics institute incd the organized crime unit which implements the new organized crime law the antidrug bilateral border task forces btfs and financial intelligence unit which implements new antimoney laundering legislation in addition the two countries have been conducting exchanges of judges and prosecutors in recent years in 1999 to strengthen law enforcement efforts the mexican congress passed legislation codifying the use of assets seized in counternarcotics operations and created new office in the ministry of the treasury to manage these assets the mexican government also issued regulations that specified reporting requirements for the importation of precursor chemicals and shared information regularly with other governments the united states has provided extensive counternarcotics training to mexican military personnel beginning in 1996 it provided 73 huey helicopters and military training for mexican antidrug special forces gafe units as well as two knox class frigates and training for maritime interdiction units the helicopters were of limited utility however and were grounded in 1998 when two mexican crew members were killed in crash which suggested possible faulty gearboxes in september 1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30475crs8 12 see molly moore mexico sends junk choppers back to us aircraft donated to aid drug war

arrested because of corruption and inefficiency that none of the major drug lords have been extradited to the united states even when captured that there has been only one conviction under the new antimoneylaundering laws in mexico and that corruption is still rampant in mexico even in the elite units specially trained and screened by us agencies which severely hampers intelligence sharing between the two countries13 they note that us ambassador to mexico jeffrey davidow was even quoted as saying that one of the headquarters of the drug trafficking world is mexico14
