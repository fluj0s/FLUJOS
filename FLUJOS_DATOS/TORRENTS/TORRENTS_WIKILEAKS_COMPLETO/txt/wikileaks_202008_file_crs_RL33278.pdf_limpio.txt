implementation of basel ii the new international capital standards for the us banking system uncertainty still remains about how us bank regulators will activate these more efficient capital standards that the european union eu is already implementing on september 30 2005 us bank regulators announced they we re revising plans for implementing the basel ii framework for small number of large banks at around the same time and more important due to its potential impact on the vast majority of us banks us regulators published for comments an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr that would amend the existing basel i regulatory capital rules one of the purposes of these modifications to basel i is to address the competitive inequalities that could have emerged from the impleme ntation of basel ii rules for large banks while smaller banks were operating under basel i the anpr addresses some research findings that suggest that basel ii could significantly lower the riskbased regulatory capital requirements of the 10 20 larger basel ii banks whereas smaller banks would be operating under the high er capital requireme nts of basel i the basel ii npr and the basel i anpr are of interest to congress for several reasons they would change the safety and soundness standards for us banks and they may be the subject of legislation as well as require new regulatory oversight moreover they may have rious implications for the worlds financial system in ways that could affect the us econom for such reasons the united states financial policy committee for fair ca pital standards act hr 1226 was introduced in congress on march 10 2005 it would establish mechanism for developing us positions on basel committee issues us banking regulators are now reviewing comments on the anpr it remains undetermined as to whether basel ii or basel i changes will precede the other or occur simultaneously these developments remain subject to public comment and future agency

terms are used to refer to these federal regulatorsthe basel accords the implementation of ii and the modification of i introduction after more than five years of consid eration some uncerta inties remain about how the basel ii capital accord will be imple mented in the united states concerns about the costs and complexity of basel ii appear to have led us regulators to propose that only 1020 of the largest banks would be required to adopt basel ii other banks would be allowed to adopt basel ii on voluntary basis1 the rest of the us banking industry would be subject to modified version of the existing basel i or basel i itself us regulators plan to change the methods used to determine the amount of regulatory capital banking ins titutions must hold to this end us regulators have issued rule making proposals in the pro cess of implementing the new basel ii capital accord and modifications of the basel i capital accord under which all federally regulated banks are currently operating the basel capital accords are international regulato ry safety and soundness2 agreements that provide framework for determining the minimum capital depository institutions must hold as cushion against insolvency without financia l institution holding this minimum amount of capital backing the regulators would not permit it to c onduct normal banking business for risk of bankruptcy and the possible need for government financial rescue for this reason this minimum capital is called regulatory capital in addition these accords are riskbased sta ndards that require banks to hold more capital as their asset profiles become more risky on september 30 2005 us bank regulators the agency3 announced in notice of proposed rulemaking npr that th ey were revising plans for implementing the basel ii

expected benefit of these modifications is that they will reduce regulatory capital held on certain assets the anpr addresses research findings that suggest that basel ii could lower the capital standards on the larg banks adopting basel ii4 the basel ii npr and the basel i anpr are of interest to congress for several reasons they would change the safety and soundness standards for us banks and these regulatory changes may be the subject of legislation as well as require new regulatory oversight moreover these ch anges might have serious implications for the worlds financial system in ways that would affect the us economy for these reasons the united states financial policy committee for fair capital standards act hr 1226 was introduced in congress on march 10 2005 it would establish mechanism for developing us positions on basel committee issues the agency is now reviewing comments on the anpr regarding modification to basel i5 the name basel accord comes from ba sel switzerland the home of the bank for international ttlements bis in 1974 bis established the basel committee on banking supervision made up of repres entatives from the monetary authorities of 13 countries belgium canada france germany italy japan luxembourg the netherlands spain sweden switzerland the united kingdom and the united states to consider capital adequacy issues and find practical ways to determine and mitigate bank risk given different national systems of supervision and deposit insurance the first accord basel i was adopted in 1988 and is credited with improving stability of the international banking system both through defining consistent safety and s oundness standards and by pr omoting better coordination among financial regulato rs and supervisors in participating nations financial regulators in the united stat and other industrial countries have recognized that basel i is insufficiently sensitive in measuring the risks and determining the minimum regulatory capital needs of todays increasingly complex and dynamic banking operations conseque ntly new accord basel ii has been negotiated prior to the actions of the agency on september 30 2005 the federal bank regulatory agencies set forth in 2004 the following implementation schedule for basel ii midyear 2005 the npr and updated guidance are to be published midyear 2006 the final rule and updated guidance we re to be published and in january 2007 the parallel runs of the basel i nd ii frameworks are to begin given the results the final regulations for basel ii in the united states are to be published in january 2008httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs3 6 board of governors of the federal reserv system banking agencies announce revised plan for implementation of basel ii framework nr 200599 sept 30 2005 p 2 7 r christian bruce implement basel i rewrite first aba says urging bank agencies to speed up revision bna banking report june 6 2005 p 995 8 the value of the capital is only realized when assets are written off 9 capital requirements are not to be confused with reserve requirements minimum reserve requirements pertain to the amount of cash depository institution must hold in relationship to deposits in the form of loans outstanding to assure liquidity and for monetary policy purposes minimum capital requirements pertain to owners investment in the firm and are relevant to solvency 10 by the same token sudden large drop in the owners capital in the institution often reduces the creditworthiness of the bank and t hus raises the borrowing costs to the bank in acquiring new assetsalthough there is still schedule for imp lementation of the modified basel i on september 30 2005 the agency announced revised schedule for implementing basel ii delaying the impleme ntation at least one year in this announcement the regulators proposed to subject all institu tions adopting basel ii to minimum three year transition from basel i to basel ii moreover adopting institutions are subject to an annual floor below which they cannot reduce their regulatory capital the parallel runs of the base l i and basel ii frameworks ar to begin in january 2008 in january 2009 the most by which ba sel iiadopting institution may lower its minimum regulatory capital is 5 of what the same bank would be required to hold if it did not adopt basel ii in 2010 th maximum reduction is 10 finally in 2011 the maximum reduction is 156 thus in this transition period the maximum advantage basel ii banks may have over basel i banks is 15 less regulatory capital according to this schedule7 capital in general capital is the owners inves tment in an institu tion and it rises and falls with the book value of an institutions assets8 the more capital bank has the greater the cushion it has against insolvency thus regulators who guard the financial systems of their c ountries have an interest in the amount of risk the banks take on and require the owners to hold some minimum level of capital their own resources at risk to avoid fa ilures or taxpay erfunded rescues9 capital is costly however in part because it restricts the amount of profitable activities in which bank may engage thus owners often have an interest in maintaining low amount of capital and in the absence of supervisor disincentives that amount could be lower and the risk taken higher than the level the government regulators mandate for safety and soundness10 the basel accords are attempts to base capital requirements on risks taken and thereby align institutions profit incentives with their own safety and soundness apart from any national s upports insurance or guarantees whether or not regulatory minimum capital requirements actually affect banking institutions investment decision making depends on whether or not the minimum regulatory capital requirements are binding that is investment decisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs4 11 in this example lets assume the project is equally likely to pay either 120000 or 150000 at the end of the year that means the return on the investment is either 20 or 50 so the expected return is 35 the sta ndard error of the return measure of risk is 15 the unbiased estimate is 212 if on the other hand the bank decides to finance the investment with 200 of its ow n money and with 800 borrowed at 10 interest leverage then expected return and its risk are altered the banks return after paying off the debt is now either 1200880 320 or 1500880 620 the expected return on the banks 200 is either 60 or 210 for an expected re turn of 135 the standard error of the return is 75 unbiased estimate is 1061 both the expected return and the risk increased dramatically with leverage the leve rage ratio is 5 the risks of this investment went from 15 to 75 by borrowing 80 of the cost of funding at 10rest on the capital charge for that inves tment economic capital on the other hand is the capital that bank would maintain in the absence of any regulatory capital to cover losses in extreme or unlikely situations in order for the bank to survive if the regulatory capital requirement is lower than the economic capital held by the institution then the regulatory capital requirement is not binding the institution could make portfolio inves tment decisions independently of the regulatory capital requirement on the other hand if the re gulatory capital standards are above the economic capital then the institutions portfo lio asset selections will be constrained by the regulatory capital requirements the regulatory capital requirement is binding regulators and institutions prefer to ve the economic capital higher than the regulatory capital requirement allowing investment decisions to be made without regulatory capital requirement playing constraining role the leverage ratio in the post1988 us banking history the leverage ratio has been key regulatory tool and is expected to conti nue to be key behindthescenes tool when basel ii and the modified basel i are implemented the leverage ratio plays significant role in limiting institutions ability to acquire assets because it restricts the amount of assets achievable given the amount of capital available us regulators require banks to maintain minimum leverage ratio the leverage ratio is the amount the owners have invested in the bank equity divided by the value of banks total assets for example at the margin if the bank invests in 1000 project using 200 of its own money and borrows 800 the leverage ratio is 20 the lower the leverage ratio the greater the returns on the investment but also the greater the risk11 in this case if the bank regulator sets minimum leverage ratio at 50 this project might not be undertaken becau the leverage ratio increases the amount of capital that must be held against the portfolio in reality the minimum leverage ratios are much lower than in this example prompt corrective action pca under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 fdicia pl 102242 congress mandated th at regulators require prompt corrective action when banks minimum leverage ratio falls below 3 or 4 depending on the type of banking institution that is banks must maintain the equivalent of at least 3 of their financing in the form of core capital equity institutions that are below this ratio are to be ordered by their primary regulator to take mandatory actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs5 12 tradeoffs between capital adequacy and deposit insurance in financial terms are examined in alex j pollock cheap

are not restored to standard it could lead to regulators taking punitive action and even placing the bank in conservatorship to avoid fa ilure or lower the rescue costs in the event of failure even though basel ii and the proposed modifications of basel i are far more sophisticated tools than the leverage ra tio and its enforcement through pca us regulators do not plan to remove the leve rage ratio from their toolbox used as trigger for intervention the leverage ratio limits the opportunity for bank supervisors to practice forbearance toward undercapitalized banks capital requirements before riskbased capital in the united states prior to the 1980s there was formal numerical standard or acrosstheboard capital regulation in effect instead regulators assessed capital asset ratios on casebycase basis in those times the bank regulators judgments on the quality of management based on observing decisionmaking processes and results the nature of investment portf olios and the economic environment were critical to determining the level of capital bank was required to maintain the regulatory determination was essential becau the advent of deposit insurance in the 1930s lowered the need for bank capital12 that is because depositors were insured they did not need to closely monitor the safety and soundne ss of ba nk knowing that most depositors had reason to worry about getting their funds returned to them in the event of bank failure the bank owners could take greater risks and reap greater rewards with concern that depositors would withdraw funds the somewhat ironic result of deposit insurance was that capitalasset ratios for all banks experienced long historical decline until the end of world war ii and then moved in narrow range until the mid1980s as shown in figure 1 bank examiners strict enforcement of capital requirements in the 19501970 period played major role in maintaining bank safety however in the late 1970s even as bank failures began to grow ong with discussions of interest rate deregulation13 regulators allowed bank capital ratios to remain steady at near historically low levels wh ile economic conditions dete riorated by 1981 declining bank capital raised the specter of multiple bank failures since one way to lower the risk of failure is to raise capital two regulators the federal reserve board and the office of the comptroller of the currency announced that they were raising capital requirements they raised them still higher in 1983 in view of congressional recognition of the problem large us banks had with nonperforming third world loans pl 98181 title ix14 the federal deposit insu rance corporation adoptedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs6 14 continued time bank capital requirements were being raised regulators for the distressed savings and loan industry were lowering them to avoid having to close failures and pay off depositors practice known as forbearance the ultimate losses were much higher as result 15 see

standards but it was not until after full implementation of basel i in the early 1990s and the failures and shutdowns of undercapitalized banks in the 1980s and early 1990s that capital ratios rose rapidly by the nd of 2002 bank equity capital was up to 92 of total assets or almost 780 billion capital for fdicinsured banks reached 103 or 11 trillion by 200515 source fdic 2005 nnual report

implemented in the united states by the end of 1992 even though us banking regulators began implemen ting basel i in 1988 basel i did not become recognized in us banking law until 1991 when the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 fdicia16 was adopted under basel i the capital that is held against banks assets can be of two components core tier 1 capital and supplementary tier 2 capital core capital consists of common shareholdersfigure 1 fdicinsured bank equity capital 19342004 percentagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs7 17 goodwill an accounting construct measuring the market value of banks reputation and major point of contention in the savings and loan failures is not included in any capital equity issued and fully paid most retained earnings and certain perpetual noncumulative preferred stoc ks supplementary capital includes subordinated debt limitedlife preferred stocks nd loan loss reserves up to 125 of the riskweighted asset17 these two components must sum to the overall minimum capital requirement of 8 of banks ri skweighted assets basel i standards are also roughly risk based banks must hold more core and supplementary capital against assets deemed riskier and may hol d less against assets deemed safer the accord divides bank assets into categories or buckets and applies risk weights to each bucket table 1 lists the main buckets an asset with 100 weight requires 8 capital for example unsecured co rporate and consumer loans have weight of 100 meaning th at the bank must hold capital equivalent to 8 of their value at the low extreme cash and debt due from or guaranteed by an organization for economic cooperati on and development oecd member government carries bucket weight of ze ro meaning that capital is required for such investments in short basel i transformed capital regulation into system of weighted risk categories or buckets app lied to all us banks this framework for riskbased capital adequacy is currently used by 110 countries it strengthened the stability of the international banking system because it required most banks to raise their level of capital at the time it was introduce d most importantly for purposes of international trade and investment flows it helped to remove source of competitive inequality among banks that varied dramatically from nation to nation major problems with basel i most arguments for switching from base l i are based on the observation that basel is bucket system is overly simple leads to inefficient uses of capital and does not necessarily lower the costs of ba nk failures technological advances in communications and finance combined w ith geographical and financial instrument diversification and global market integration have made banking systems too dynamic and complex for the 1980sstyle basel i to be efficient large internationally active banks now use fa r more complex risk models and have developed advanced reserve and capital management techni ques in this rapidly changing environment the basel i framework is said to be unable to yield accurate or timely information on major banks safety and soundness three specific problems have effectively undermined basel i insufficient recognition of risk mitigation techniques regulatory arbitrage and perceived increase of operational risk none is adequately accounted for in basel i consequen tly banks tend to hold inappropriate levels of regulatory capital given the riskiness of their assets in some cases regulatory capital is insufficient in others it is excessivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs8 table 1 basel i assetweighting percentages percentage of the regulatory capital requirement 100 weight 8 capitalpercentage of asset required to be financed

for an nrsro source crs summary of the regulations set forth in 12 cfr part 3 the actual categories are very detailed and have been modified over time regulatory arbitrage the idea behind riskweighted capital rules is to link capital to riskiness and thus enable institutions to price assets according to their riskiness economically the higher the quality of loan or investment the lower the return if riskweighting is accurate there is an incentive to invest in highquality lowrisk assets on the other hand because of the higher cap ital requirements for undertaking risky investments the banks must raise their price to justify such investments under the basel i framework however because of th limited number of categories banks have an incentive to take on higher risk asse ts within each very broad bucket without shifting into higher capitalconsuming bucket this is called regulatory arbitrage or gaming the system for example usually investors distinguish among commercial loans by demanding higher yiel ds for higher risks basel is bucket approach does not it places capital charge of 8 on all commercial loans even though triple arated commercial loan ca rries lower yield than brated onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs9 18 this is the approach of the secur ities and exchange commission for example particularly in implementing the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 pl 107204 19 this is the approach taken by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight with respect to the large housing governmentsponsored enterprisessince both loans carry the same capital charge basel i gives the bank an incentive to carry more brated than triple arated commercial loans because they have higher yields with the same capital charge for greater profits banks are likely to sell triple arated loans to acquire higheryieldin g brated or even lowerrated loans risk mitigation risk mitigation is an internal step banks can take to control their risks many prudently managed banks take credit and interest rate and other risk mitigating measures by investing in offsetting assets such as loan insurance derivative hedges collateral liens and ot her protections from losses unde r basel i acquiring an asset whose risk of default decreases as anot her assets default ri sk increases would increase banks capital requirement even though the bank is sounder as result of having assets with these offsetting characteristics in its portfolio risk mitigation is more easily accomplished in todays markets because smaller portion of large banks portfolios consists of loans and growing portion is now tradable instruments related to interest rates equities commodities currencies and government and corporate securities risk mitigating techniques are much more effective using these tradable instruments than adjusting loan portfolios operational risk operational risks can produce losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or fro m external events including legal and compliancerelated risks operational risks include poor accounting lapses of governance controls settleme nt failures poor or fraudul ent managers and traders and security and process failures despite the fact that some of these risks are captured under credit risk operational risks ve historically played major roles in depleting capital from failed banks which have met the minimum creditriskbased requirements operational risk is major cau of bank failures it is not however explicitly taken into account in basel i fraud contributed to eight of the 11 us bank failures in 2002 and was the direct cause of failure in several of these cases there is considerable controversy over how to assess capital charge for operational risk because it is not clear how such charge would be quantified the general approach for most corporations is to require sufficient riskreducing activity so that fraud has better chance of being detected18 for other regulated us financial corporations explicit capital charges are re quired as an addon to all other capital charges19 the lack of such charges in basel i is considered to be serious omissionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs10 20 since its original implementation the basel i rules have been modified 26 times in recognition of some of its shortcommings 21 remarks by susan schmidt bies recent development in regulatory capital at the sps north american financial instituti on conference new york nov 30 2005 p 2 httpwwwfederalreservegovboarddocsspeeches200520051130defaulthtm the proposed modifications of basel i even though the problems with basel i were well known to the agency it was willing to keep most banks operating under the basel i framework because of recognition that the costs would likely outweigh the benefits of basel ii for all but the largest most complex banks20 nevertheless to mitigate any potential competitive effects of basel ii and to improve the risk sensitivity of the current basel ibased capital rules the agency issued the anpr to seek comment on possible changes to the basel i rules as federal reserve governor bies said the anpr reflects our attempt to mitigate some of the consequences arising from differences between basel i and basel ii while acknowledging that s impler capital rules are still appropriate for nearly all us banking organizations to be quite clear the federal reserve will not look upon institutions as having deficient riskmanagement systems simply because they choose to stay under the basel i framework21 moreover the anpr proposes change in the leverage ratio or pr ompt corrective action nor does it propose introducing operational risk provisions for basel i banks arguing that operational risk is implicitly covered by the basel i riskbased framework the proposed basel i modifications taking care of risk arbitrage to address the problem of regulatory arbitrage the anpr would increase the number of riskweight categories table 1 shows that basel i now has five riskweight categories zero 20 50 100 and 200 which limit the di fferentiation of credit qua lity the anpr suggests four additional categories 35 75 150 and 350 the increased number of categories should improve risk sensitivity banks will have more categories in which to place assets based on their risk iness thereby reducing the possibility of placing risky asset in category which requires less capital than should be prudently held against the asset even though the additional categories increase the accuracy of assigning the appropriate regulatory capital to the riskiness of asset default this method is not likely to be as accurate as the basel ii framework and therefore is not expected to give the same result as basel ii the anpr would allow banks to use external credit ratings in determining the riskiness of certain assets such as revenue bonds based on the rating of nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro such as standard and poors corporation sp or moodys investment services moodys bank ma assign weight of 20 35 or 50 to revenue bond if the nrsro gives the securities rating of aaa or bbb respectively see table 2 under basel i this same bond would have to be given 50 risk weight see table i to encourage risk mitigation the anpr would expand the agencys recognition of financial collateral and guarantors under the existing basel i thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs11 agency recognizes as collateral 1 cash on deposit at banking institutions and 2 securities issued or guaranteed by centr governments of oecd countries us government agencies us governments ponsored enterprises and multilateral lending institutions the anpr would recognize more forms of assets used as collateral including short or longterm debt securities that are externally rated as at least investment grade by an nrsro the nrsrorated debt securities would be assigned to riskweight category as shown below in tables 2 and 3 for example collateralized asset with bbb rating would be assigned to the 50 riskweight category table 2 illustrative risk weights based on external ratings longterm

6180 60100 50 35 20 source the agencies october 6 2005 anpr p 14 this approach would be using data that is already used in the loan approval process however the banking institution would have to consider assigning the risk weight after taking into account the pr ivate mortgage insurance pmi that is provided by an insurer with an nrsroissu ed longterm debt rating of single or higher because the agency argued that blanket acceptance of pmi may overstate its ability to effectively mitigate risk especially on higherrisk loans and novel products the agency could place riskweigh t floors on mortgages with pmi that would limit the risklowering ability of private mortgage insurance on multifamily residential mortgages the agency plans to maintain the 100 risk weight currently assigned to thes mortgages under basel i many multifamily mortgages currently get 50 risk weight however the agency is considering modifying the riskbased rules to lower the capital requirement for multifamily residential mortgages one consideration is to be sensitive to the loan size relative to the value of the collateral position and the history of the loan performance the more favorable these factors are the more likely the mortgages will be permitted to carry risk weight lower than 100 retail loans retail exposures such as consumer loans credit card and automobile loans currently get risk weig ht of 100 under basel i the agency ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs13 considering allowing banks to use more risksensitive approach to determining the required capital for these assets banks would determine the amount of capital they have to hold by using the borrowers credit scores or the borrowers ability to service these types of debt banks would be allo wed to hold less regulatory capital against consumer loans and credit card debt extende d to borrowers with higher credit scores and collateral other assets the anpr suggests ways to improve the risk sensitivity used in determining the regulatory capital for the following types of assets commercial real estate small business loans shor tterm commitments such as assetbacked commercial paper abcp nd early amortization under the current basel i framework all these other types of assets are assigned fixed risk weight or fixed credit conversion factor ccf to take them from offb alancesheet receivables to onbalancesheet receivables the agency seeks comment on whether to remove these assets from the onesizefitsall measurement to system where the characteristics of the asset determine the risk weight assigned to it for example small business loan that is now assigned risk weight of 100 under basel i could be assigned risk weight of 75 if its credit risk is mitigated by acceptable collateral and if the loan would fully amortize within seven years on the other hand short term commitments such as ssetbacked commercia l paper now has credit conversion factor of zero that m eans that banks can extend this shortterm credit commitment without holding any riskb ased capital against the inherent risk exposure the agency is considering whether to apply 10 ccf to shortterm commitments in sum with the exception of operationa l risk the proposed modifications of basel i explicitly address the key problems with this framework by increasing the sensitivity of the framework to changes in risk the agencys omission of provisions to incorporate operational risk in this anpr suggests that regulators believe the regulatory capital required for operational risk is implicitly captured in the provisions for credit risk the anpr relies heavily on external ratings of borrowers creditworthiness nrsros play critical role in assigning risk weight to bank assets such as corporate and municipal bonds for mortgages loantovalue ratios are expected to play dominant role in determining the risk weight assigned to mortgages as the anpr stands the basel ii capital framework before discussing the version of basel ii that the united states plans to implement it may be helpful to briefly outline the overall basel ii capital framework that is being implemented in other i ndustrialized countries between 1992 and 2001 numerous new and old riskbased capital ques tions related to risk management and supervision were put to the basel co mmittee on bank supervision the committees cumulative responses are presented in the fo rm of basel ii the expectation is that for some banks basel ii will replace the cu rrent basel i capital accord beginning in january 2007 the basel ii capital accord is to improve safety and soundness by being more comprehensive framework wh ich is more accurately sensitive to risk and therefore able to adjust measures of capital adequacy to risk more accuratelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs14 23 this is the risk that borrower fails to make the contractual payments on timely basis or fails to fully discharge the terms of the contract than the current framework it also repres ents shift in regulatory philosophy toward greater use of market signals in determin ing the adequacy of capital basel ii has three reinforcing principles known as pillars for measurement basel ii has three methods to calculate capital adequacy the standardized f oundation and advanced approaches which are discussed after its three pillars pillar one the first pillar is the minimum capital requirement which may be seen as essentially an improved basel i it is the rule bank uses to calculate its perloan minimum riskbased required capital taki ng explicitly into account each loans unique credit risk23 for example unlike the bucket approach of basel i where all assets in bucket such as commercial loans are assigned the same specific risk weights in basel ii commercial loan with triple rating is assigned lower risk weight than brated commercial loan other types of loans are also differentiated according to their perceived risk the specific risk of the loan or exposure is estimated by the bank and is validated by its regulators thus the pillar one refinements specifically take into acc ount and correct for the basel i problems with regulatory arbitrage basel ii also takes into account risk mitigation measures taken in bank assets while the capital require ment is determined for each asset risk offset relationships that can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the regulators will reduce riskbased capital requirements in addition to credit risk pillar one explicitly accounts for operational risk banks using the basic indicator approach must hold capital for ope rational risk equal to the average over the previous three year s of fixed percentage of positive annual gross income figures for any years of ze ro or negative annual gross income should be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator in this calculation basel ii also includes advanced measurement pproaches to operational risk under which bank uses an internal model to determine its riskbased capital requirement for operational risk some have argued that operational ri sk is already included in the creditriskbased calculations others have argued that the capital charge for operational risk should be at the discretion of bank supe rvisors and therefore not an explicit universal requirement furthermor other analysts argued that capital charge for operational risk does not necessarily mitigate operational risk itself because it is not directly linked to operati onally risky behavior operationally risky behavior may be only indir ectly countered by the supervisory review process and market disclosure of bank operations pillar two the second pillar focuses on bank supervisor judgments it is the supervisory review process which is less tangible than pillar one but somewhat more determinable than in the prebasel era pillar two requires banks to maintain internal assessments of risks relative to capital this is process rather than static quantitative assessment as in pillar one pillar two is dynamic requirement thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs15 24 business cycle stresses are shocks for example that can be attributed to fluctuations in the economy while noncyclical stresses which may be correlated with the cyclical components are those that are not attributable to such fluctuations such as interest rate risk and other exogenous changes 25 bank for international settlements basel committee on bank supervision international convergence of capital measurement and capital st andard revised framework june 2004 p 158risk and capital selfevaluations must take place over the business cycle as well as in period of noncyclical stress24 this is also component of pillar one the bank supervisory agencies have key role to play under this pillar the agencies must assess the institutions validation of the methodology and processes used in these bank selfexaminations t he supervisory review process of the framework is intended not only to ensure that banks have adequate capital to support all the risks in their business but also to encourag banks to develop and use better risk management techniques in mon itoring and managing risk25 under pillar two the supervisory review provides the opportunity to consider risk management in more detail for example credit risk concentration the treatment of interest rate risk in the banking book and business and strategic risk which are not covered under p illar one are transparently examined in supervisory controlled environment under pillar tw validation of risk management mechanisms and accountability of determina tions concerning stress testing and residual risk take place under pillar two pillar three the third pillar represents change from previous safety and soundness rules bank supervisory use of market signals and market discipline pillar three is set of public information disclosure requirements that bank must make about itself these disclosures are said to enable creditors and investors in financial markets to assess banks risk posture accurately and adjust borrowing and capital costs accordingly the idea behind this requirement is to bring market discipline to bear so that bank management and their regulators have an incentive to adopt strong safety and soundness practices comparison across banki ng institutions could be more easily made by depositors and invest ors as well as regulators this knowledge in turn would affect the willingness of investors to invest the degree of disclosure is constrained by the enforcement powers of the regulatory agency which varies from country to country basel ii suggests that the supervisory agencies use moral suasion for reprimands and financial penalties to bring about necessary disclosures wh ile the disclosure requirement does not conflict with requirements regarding accounting standards the basel ii requirements are more narrowly focused banks and thei r supervisors must decide to disclose information upon which users can rely to make economic decisions regarding these institutions yet basel ii does not set benchmark for achieving sufficient disclosure disclosure of credit risk is of two types qualitative and quantitative the qualitative disclosures are informa tion concerning the condition of the establishment such as the top corporate entities to which basel ii applieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs16 26 bank for international settlements international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards june 2004 pp 1547qualitative disclosure would include the ro of the entities within the group and the type of restrictions on transferring capita l within the group description of the capital structure addresses specific risk issues such as credit market and interest rate risks pillar three would also seek disclosure of the banks risk exposure and assessment quantitative disclosures such as the banks tier one and total capital adequacy ratio and their components must be made public on periodic basis if risk exposure or other critical factors change in the interim the bank should disclose such information as soon as practicable nd not later than the deadlines set measuring capital adequacy for credit risk in the united states the agency has ready proposed to implement only one of the three approaches basel ii offers to measure bank capital adequacy described below the advanced internal ratingsbased airb approaches to the extent that basel ii is more risk sensitive than basel i the modifications the agency plans to make to basel i are expected to bring th two methods of termining regulatory capital closer together in terms of competitive impact on banks in the united states however the anpr seeks comment on whethe r to allow banks that are not subject to basel ii on mandatory basis to conti nue to use the current basel i other countries sticking to the original basel ii framework are offered three approaches as well the three approaches to calculating the minimum allowable regulatory capital under basel ii are the standardized appro ach the foundation internal ratingsbased approach firb and the advanced internal ratingsbased approach airb the basel ii approaches are all more risk sensitive than basel i the standardized approach the standard approach is very close to the calculus under basel i under this appro ach to calculate the capital requirement of banks asset the total exposure to losses from an asset is multiplied by the supervisorydetermined risk weight compared to basel i the major differences are that capital required for credit risk is longer capped at 8 when the risk weighting equals 100 and the standard moves away from the uniform 100 risk weights for all corporate credits corporate claim could receive risk weight of 20 40 100 or 150 depending on its external credit rating there are at least five other modifications in the weighting structur including retail lending residential properties and commercial real estate26 the general notion is that degree of riskiness can be more finely differentia ted under basel ii in many aspects the national supervisory agency is given some latitude in applying the standardized approach to its banks however in other aspects basel ii specifies clear limits for example risk mitigation efforts cannot redu ce capital requirements to less than 20 the modifications of basel i proposed by the regulators are almost identical to the standardized approach however it is not known if the modified basel i will be implemented simultaneously with basel ii furthermore established nrsros have played critical role in assigning risk weights to bank assets such as corporate and municipal bonds there are questions about the existence of similar organizations in many other countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs17 the foundation internal rati ngsbased firb approach us bank regulators have also not proposed to dopt the foundation internal ratingsbased approach however foreign competitors to us banks may be allowed to use this method for this approach banks must m eet stringent qualifying criteria national supervisors would use quantitative as well as qualitative measures to determine which banks may apply the firb approac h the evaluative process would include rating system design riskrating system operation corporate governance and most critically validation of internal estimates in this approach regulatory capital is determined by banks own assessment of the risk of default on each of its assets based on its own data and thodology and certain supe rvisorily determined risk parameters the first is the probability of default pd of each asset next the bank must estimate the loss severity this estimate is also called the loss given default lgd the third measure is the amount at risk in the event of default exposure at default or ead this represents the nominal value of the assets at the time of default the fourth element is the maturity m which is considered an explicit risk component banks will make their own estimate of pd but the lgd and ead would be provided by their supervisors th risk parameters are inserted into supervisory formula the output of which is the banks riskbased capital requirement for the asset under firb approach the riskbased capital requirement for an asset is measurement of the unexpected losses on the asset the banks must categorize bankingbook exposures into br oad classes of ssets with different underlying risk characteristics corporate sovereign bank retail and equity within some of the classes there are subcategories under corporate there are five subclasses project financing ie power plant object fina ncing ie aircraft ship commodities financing ie crude oil tals or crops incomeproduc ing real estate ie office buildings warehouse space and highvola tility commercial real estate ie land acquisition for development under re tail there are three subclasses as well the advanced internal ratingsbased airb approach us bank supervisors have selected the advanced inte rnal ratingbased approach for us basel ii banks because it would allow the selected banks to use more of their existing internal assessments and mana gement technology to calcula their regulatory capital requirements more recently questions have been raised as to the readiness of international banks for the airb approach consequently the basel committee is now engaged in the fifth quantitative impact study qis5 to determine the abilities of these institutions to carry out the basel ii requirements in europe and asia like the foundation approach first the bank must determine its pd for all assets the bank must also estimate its lgd and its ead plus its m for each asset for each exposure the risk weights would be function of these parameters securitization and equity exposures are different and retail exposures do not use m to calculate the capital charge the ba nks portfolio would be broken down into five categories corporate retail bank sovereign and equity supervisory approval is needed before bank can use its own inte rnal ratingsbased approach for these five categories after the bank determines the pds lgds and eads for all exposures these parameters are mapped into riskbased capital requirements for the portfolio these riskbased capital requirements include unexpected deviation measure losses onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs18 27 operational risk consultative document basel committee on banking supervision jan 2001 httpwwwbisorgpublbcbsca07pdfmeasuring capital adequacy for operational risk for basel ii banks operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people systems or external events27 basel ii offers three methods for calculating the minimum regulatory capital for operational risk they incl ude the basic indicator approach the standardized approach and the advanced measurement approach ama banks are expected to use the approach or approaches most suited to their operations however the banks must qualify to use the standardized approach and the ama furthermore once bank has been appr oved for more advanced method of calculation it may not revert to simpler pproach without prior approval on the other hand the primary supervisor of the bank may force bank to use less advanced method to calculate its operational risk if the banks operation warrants such change as previously mentioned the agency proposed to make only one of the approaches described below the dvanced management approach ama applicable to us basel ii banks the basic indicator approach the minimum regulatory capital bank must hold for operational risk is equal to 15 of its positive annual gross income averaged over the previous three years any year that gross income was negative or zero should be excluded from the calculation the standardized approach the standardized approach first divides the banks activities into eight lines of busine ss corporate finance trading and sales retail banking commercial banking payment and settlement agency services asset management and retail brokerage gross in come within each line of business serves as proxy for the scale of business operati on and therefore is used as the weight of risk exposure within the lines of business the minimum capital for each line of business is calculated by multiplying the gross income from that line by fixed percentage the total minimum regulatory capital requirement is calculated as threeyear average of the sum of the minimum regulatory capital across each business line annually in any year nega tive changes due to negative gross income may offset positive changes in other lines of business without limits on the other hand if the aggregate capital charge for all the business lines is negative for given year the input in the numerator will be zero the advanced measurement approach ama in order for bank to use the advanced measurement approach to calculate its minimum regulatory capital for operational risk under the basel ii frame work the bank must be approved by its primary supervisor to qualify for ama the banks board of directors and senior management must demonstrate that they ar actively involved in the oversight of the operational risk mana gement of the bank the bank s operational ri sk management system must be proven conceptually so und and implemented w ith integrity with sufficient resources controls and audits in the major lines of business in addition the bank must meet long list of qualitative and quantitative standards set by the framework and needs the approval of the banks primary supervisorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs19 28 testimony of donald powell and john d hawke jr before the us congress house financial services committee subcommittee on domestic and international

bank of chicago economic perspectives first quarter 2004 p 18although the ama does not specify the pproach or the assumptions the bank uses it requires the bank to demonstrate th at its operational risk measures meet soundness standard comparable to that of the internal ratingsbased approach for credit risk the bank needs to have credible transparent well documented and verifiable approach for weighting thes fundamental elements in its overall operational risk measurement system for example there may be cases where the internal and external estimates of event data would be unreliable for business lines because of small number of observed losses in such cases scenario analysis business environment and othe r control factors may play more dominant role in the risk measurement system as mentione d previously only the ama approach to operational risk will be used by the us banks subject to basel ii is procyclicality longer concern some us bank supervisors and academic s have expressed c oncerns about the procyclical characteristics of basel ii28 procyclicality means that banks would be able to disproportionately expand lending when economic activity is expanding and would be required to dispr oportionately contract lending when economic activity is contracting this is so because in economic expansions lending is less risky and the framework would require less regulatory capital fueling the credit expansion in economic contractions when lending tends to be more risky the framework would require higher levels of capital slowing or possibly preventing banks from lending while there is logic to the pattern it could also be contrary to the intent of monetary policy to ease credit and expand lending to re verse contraction or to tighten credit and slow lending when the economy is overh eated and likely to become inflationary too much procyclicality in other words has destabilizing tendency on the economy29 the june 2004 version of basel ii compensa tes for this procyclical bias through the supervisory review process pillar two supervisory review could make capital adjustments called cyclical buffers th amount of supervisory adjustments made would be determined by stre ss test data among other cons iderations the stress tests are simulations of sharply adverse conditi ons for each bank the stress tests supply information such as how long the bank s current level of cap ital would last under adverse conditions that is used as i nput to supervisory decisions to modify required capital supervisory review places critical responsibility on bank supervisors in times of reces sion the fact is that the more accurately regulatory capital is tied to risk the greater the regulatory incentive for appropriately priced risk taking supervisory calming of risktaking fears in adverse climates is critical to the efficient use of capital the issue rema ins about the accuracy of any pillar two supervisory adjustments over the busine ss cycle and whether or not these supervisory adjustments would be applied correctly across institutionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs20 how the accords compare table 5 compares the capital charges that bank would be

loans would have been determined by the judgment of the bank examiners and supervisory agency under basel i more rigid system would have required fixed 8 of the loan regardless of the actual and varying risk of default under basel ii range of possible capita l amounts would result the exact amount would rest on the judgment of the bank nd its examiners and supervisory agencies and would vary according to general econo mic conditions for any given credit rating consequently for the brated 10000 commerc ial loan capital requirement could range from 397 to 4165 wi range that implies

the cost of implementation may impact adopting basel ii and modified basel i however because many larger banks have already inve sted in riskmanagement processes including personnel software and hardware in order to conduct their daytoday operations the costs of implementing basel ii are expected to be relatively lower than for the smaller banks adopting the modified basel i because the modi fications in basel i may not require totally new investments remaining concerns about basel ii basel ii is in some ways work in pr ogress some specific requirements of banks within nations that subscribe to the accord are left up to national regulators the broader framework requires bank management and bank supervisory authorities to be more involved than before in determining minimum bank capital the expected outcome is much more risksensitive risk management system as mentioned previously the agency expects bout 20 large us banks will be operating under basel ii by the implement ation date of january 2009 the agency assumes that most of these institutions are already operationally disposed meaning they are technologically capable to operate under basel ii to th is system running complex riskassessment models and handling risk thr ough wide variety of hedges and other insurance however one of the most im portant acknowledgments not reported in the findings of the fourth quantitative impact study qis4 is that the selected banking institutions were not as operationally dispos ed as they said they were for adopting basel ii qis4 showed that the capital savings for particular institutions was larger than expected for this reason the agency revised its basel ii implementation plans capping the allowable capital savings during the transition period the works in progress basel ii and the modifications to basel i have some remaining concerns including the cost and complexity and the market competitive changes they are likely to bring about to the pa rticipating institutions cost and complexity the agency has sought comment on re vised capital standard framework for us banks basel ii for 10 to 20 large intern ational banks and modified basel i for the remaining 8000 or so smaller banks th agency has also asked for comment on whether remaining on the existing base l i standards should be an option consequently the agency has opened the possibility of trifurcated capital standard framework for us banks basel ii for 10 to 20 large international banks modified basel i and the existing basel i standard s for the 8000 or so smaller banks the regulatory burdens of these proposed new cap ital standards are yet to be determined however if the capital savings that basel ii and the modified basel i promise are realized the new frameworks w ould be beneficial to the adopters and basel i could be abandoned on another aspect the resu lts of the quantitative studies suggest that the large banks are incurring some cost in making themselves operationally disposed30 to basel ii at the same time the studies also indicate that the capital savings for adopting banks could exceed 20 capital savings of such magnitudes would make it easier for banks to absorb th additional cost of compliance at the same time these savings would place nona dopting banks at si gnificant competitive disadvantage which would induce them to embrace the newer standards on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33278crs22 31 these requirements could be as stringent if not more so than those already required under the sarbanesoxley act other hand the initial caps the agency placed on the allowable capital savings could slow the migration to the newer standards the regulatory capital requirements for u s banks would be far more complex under the agencys new basel ii proposals for mandatory basel ii banks and those banks opting for basel ii as stated in the npr senior executives would be required to sign off and be accountable for the inte grity of the internal management systems and processes that generate the data for determining bank capital these executives must ensure that their internal systems can stand up to regulatory scrutiny and will be held liable liab ility and penalties are not yet clea r if they are found negligent in these duties covered banks must have already made or be willing to make major investments to upgrade their core da ta processing systems and information technology architectures in addition inte rnal audit and control functions must be able to collect extensive internal data and be operational in time to meet the january 2012 implementation in shor t before 2012 these banks must already have taken on the cost of reengineering their management governance structure and their operations in the context of basel ii31 market competitiveness while there might be significant market competitive issues to be addressed between banks selection of basel i the modified basel i and basel ii it is premature to have meaningful discussion of what those issues are at this time in contrast the international competitive issues are more clear the european union eu for example is implementing basel ii in all member countries the delay in implementing basel ii in the united states may place us banks at disadvantage in the eu because basel ii institutions are likely to be required to hold less regulatory capital to support the same vel of assets furthermor foreign banks under basel ii with subsidiaries in the united states could be forced to use the most costly basel ii methods to calculate their regulatory capital in these subsidiaries which may put the united states at disadvantage in attracting these banks in short the lack of synchronisation of the implementation and the lack of uniformity of frameworks could make it difficult to achieve level competitive playing field for international banking congress and basel ii implementation although congress may choose to act on the basel accords the accords are not international treaties needing congressional approval they are international banking regulation recommendations which us bank regulators helped to develop the federal reserve has taken the lead as the nations central bank for example basel i was originally proposal of the federa l reserve bank of new york to the basel committee in 1986 its standards were adopted by the monetary authorities in the g 10 countries as guidelines in 1987 the agreement to use basel i as common approach to evaluate bank capital adequacy came in 1988 with an effective date

end of 1992 congress did not make the agreement formal part of us banking law in 1991 instead congress mandated that us regulators adopt riskbased standard in determining cap ital requirements however by 1991 the regulators had already required banks under their supervis ion to use basel i to calculate their regulatory capital the leverage ratio re quirements coupled with prompt corrective action were major modifications that were applicable to us banks and not other basel i adopting countries similarly in th case of basel ii us regulators have been both instigators and participants william j mcdonough retired president of the federal reserve bank of new york was also chairman of the basel committee on bank supervision at the bis when base l ii was first announced however it is important to note that to successfully implement capital standards in the united states all federal regulators must agree to the changes in the existing standards because of the us functional nd competitive regulatory structure32 the purpose of the united states financial policy committee for fair capital standards act hr 1226 is to set up mechanism for developing uniform united states positions on issues before the basel committee on banking supervision at the bank for international settlements to require review on the most recent recommendation of the basel committee for an accord on capital standards and for other purposes such committee does not exist today however the members of the committee would consist of all the members of the agency the bill was introduced partly in response to disagreem ents among the members of the agency in congressional hearings33 if the agency fails to overcome the problems that basel ii implementation has encountered since th consultative document was published in 2003 congress might move to enact h r 1226 the review committee it would establish would be headed by the secretary of the treasury the bill would have the review committee undertake many things that the agency currently does such as report the accord to congress however the report to congress would come prior to agreement to any future basel accord the evaluation of new accords would
