convictions the lautenberg amendment summary the lautenberg amendment to the gun control act of 1968 establishes comprehensive regulatory scheme designed to prevent the use of firearms in domestic violence offenses to this end the amendment prohibits the possession of firearms by persons convicted of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and relatedly prohibits the knowing sale or disposition of any firearm or ammunition to domestic violence misdemeanant furthermore the lautenberg amendment alters the traditional public interest exception to the possession of firearms under the gun control act by making the prohibition applicable to any individual convicted of domestic violence misdemeanor including federal state and local law enforcement officers the provisions of the lautenberg amendment have been challenged on three primary grounds first opponents of the law maintain that it violates the commerce clause by classifying as federal offense activity that does not have an effect on interstate commerce as required by the supreme courts decision in united states v lopez it has also been argued that the law violates the equal protection clause by punishing domestic violence misdemeanors more harshly than other misdemeanor offenses by punishing misdemeanor but not felony offenses and by excluding law enforcement officers convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence offenses from the public interest exception of 18 usc 925a1 furthermore the law has been attacked as violation of the ex post facto clause on the basis that it prohibits the possession of firearm by domestic violence misdemeanant even if the predicate offense occurred prior to its enactment reviewing courts have rejected these challenges to the lautenberg amendment determini ng that its provisions fall within acceptable constitutional parameters regarding the commerce clause courts have held that the law contains an express jurisdictional element requiring finding that the firearm in question was possessed in or affecting commerce or was received after having been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce obviating the concerns at issue in united states v lopez equal protection clause challenges have been rejected upon the determination that congres s rationally concluded that misdemeanor domestic violence offenders should not possess firearms finally the courts have held that the law does not violate the ex post facto clause in that it prohibits postenactment possession and does not criminalize conduct occurring before its enactment

amendment introduction this report provides an overview of the provisions of the lautenberg amendment to the gun control act of 1968 which establishes scheme prohibiting the possession of firearms by individuals who have been convicted of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in addition to outlining the elements of the prohibition on firearm possessi on and statutory defenses available to such charge this report discusses the disposition of legal challenges to the constitutional validity of the amendments proscriptions the gun control act of 1968 the gun control act of 1968 gca established comprehensive scheme regulating the manufacture sale transfer and possession of firearms and ammunition1 section 922g of the gca delineates nine classes of individuals who are prohibited from shipping transporting possessing or receiving firearms or ammunition in interstate commerce the individuals targeted by this provision include 1 persons convicted of crime punishable by term of imprisonment exceeding one year 2 fugitives from justice 3 individuals who are unlawful users or addicts of any controlled substance 4 persons legally determined to be mentally defective or who have been committed to mental institution 5 aliens illegally or unlawfully in the united states as well as those who have been admitted pursuant to nonimmigrant visa 6 individuals who have been discharged dishonorably from the armed forces 7 persons who have renounced united states citizenship 8 individuals subject to pertinent court order and finally 9 persons who have been convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence offense2 the gca as enacted and amended contains public interest exception for all but one of the aforementioned disqualification categories specifically except for 18 usc 922g9 18 usc 925a1 exempts from prohibition any firearm or ammunition imported for sold or shipped to or issued for the use of the united states or any department or agency thereof or any state or any department agency or political subdivision thereof the practical effect of this exception is to allow for the possession of firearms in an official capacity irrespective of criminal record as is discussed in greater detail below this provision provided blanket exception to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31143crs2 318 usc 922g9 418 usc 922d9 518 usc 925a1 618 usc 921a33ai 718 usc 921a33aii in full the definition is as follows the term misdem eanor crime of domestic violence means an offense that i is misdemeanor under federal or state law and ii has as an element the use or attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of deadly weapon committed by current or former spouse parent or guardian of the victim by person with whom the victim shares child in common by person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as spouse parent or guardian or by person similarly situated to spouse parent or guardian of the victimdisqualification provisions of the gca prior to enactment of the lautenberg amendment the lautenberg amendment in september 1996 as part of the omnibus consolidated appropriations act of 1997 congress amended the criminal provisions of the gca adding ninth disqualification category commonly referred to as the lautenberg amendment this provision makes it unlawful for any personwh has been convicted of misdemea nor crime of domestic violence to ship transport possess or receive firearms or ammunition in or affecting commerce3 relatedly the lautenberg amendment prohibits the knowing sale or other disposition of any firearm or ammunition to domestic violence misdemeanant4 furthermore the lautenb erg amendment alters the traditional public interest exception to the firearms disqualification provisions of the gca in that it applies to any individual who has been convicted of domestic violence misdemeanor including federal state and local law enforcement officers5 elements of the offense pursuant to the amendment misdemeanor conviction triggers the firearm possession prohibition only if the underlying offense includes an element requiring proof of the use or attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of deadly weapon against the victim6 the offender must be current or former spouse parent or guardian of the victim person with whom the victim shares child person with whom the victim has cohabitated or is cohabitating as spouse parent or guardian or person similarly situated to spouse parent or guardian of the victim7 this provision appears to cover an exhaustive range of domestic relationships except that the text prevents children from being classified as offenders in the event that they commit misdemeanor offense against parent or guardian the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms batf has clarified the language of the statute stating that it covers common law marriages irrespective of whether the relationship is recognized under state law and situations where two persons share domicile

terroristic threats were not convictions of crime of domestic violence as they did not contain the aforementioned required elements precluding their use as predicate convictions for violation of 922g9intimate relationship8 specifically the atf has stated that the similarly situated to spouse language does not require the establishment of common law marriage relationship rather such individuals must simply be involved in more than dating relationship9 as with the other classifications of domestic relationships individuals in relationship similarly situated to spouse fall under the purview of the prohibition if they were domiciled in an intimate relationship with the victim of the offense either at the time of or at any time prior to the offense10 it is important to note that predicate offense is not required to contain an explicit element referring to domestic violence according to the batf the term misdemeanor crime of domestic violence refers to all misdemeanors that involve the use or attempted use of physical force eg simple assault assault and battery if the offense is committed by one of the defined parties this is true whether or not the state statute or local ordinance specifically defines the offense as domestic violence misdemeanor11 similar conclusion was reached by the court of appeals for the eight circuit which held that while 921a33 requires proof of domestic relationship it requires the predicate misdemeanor to have only one element the use or attempted use of physical force or its alternative the threatened use of deadly weapon12 b statutory defenses 18 usc 921a33 establishes two statutory defenses to the application of the possession prohibition extending procedural protections that are generally only available to individuals charged with felonies to those charged with misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence specifically 921a33b provides that the underlying misdemea nor offense may not be used as predicate to violation of 922g9 unless 1 the individual in question was represented by counsel in the case or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel and 2 in the instance that the individual was entitled to trial by jury the case was indeed tried by jury or the individual in question made knowing and intelligent waiver of the right given that few misdemeanor offenses imbue defendants with the right to trial by jury the second of the aforementioned statutory defenses has had discernible impact on court decisions regarding convictions pursuant to 922g9 it doeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31143crs4 13see crs report 9768 gun ban for persons convicted of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence ex post facto clause and other constitutional issues by dorothy schrader additionally it is important to note that while the supreme courts decision in gideon v wainwright 372 us 335 1963 established that persons charged with felony are entitled to counsel the court has also established that convicted felon cannot challenge the validity of predicate conviction as defense to firearms charge under 18 usc 922g even if the individual in question was not represented by counsel lewis v united states 445 us 55 1980 rather felon must challenge the validity of such conviction in collateral proceeding thus by allowing statutory challenge to predicate misdemeanor violence conviction during proceeding pursuant to violation of the lautenberg amendment 921a33b grants misdemeanants defense not available to felons charged with the possession of firearms id 14united states v akins 243 f3d 1199 9th cir 2001 15id at 1203 16id at 12031204 17id at 1205appear however that the requirement concerning legal representation could serve to limit the application of 922g9 specifically given that there is constitutional right to counsel in misdemeanor cases it has been surmised that many domestic violence misdemeanants appeared without representation and likely did not make knowing and intelligent waiver of that right thereby significantly limiting the universe of individuals against whom the possession ban may be enforced13 the court of appeals for the ninth circuit addressed just such situation in united states v akins holding that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the defendant had validly waived his right to counsel prior to pleading guilty to an underlying state misdemeanor domestic violence charge as required to establish violation of 922g14 at issue in akins was the defendants contention that the indictment charging him with violating 922g9 was faulty in that it failed to allege an underlying misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as defined in 921a33 given that he had not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel prior to 1989 misdemeanor conviction addressing this argument the court explained that in order to make knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel defendant must be made aware of 1 the nature of the charges against him 2 the possible penalties and 3 the dangers and disadvantages of self representation15 the court went on to stress that this standard applies to both misdemeanor and felony charges16 analyzing the facts of the case the court determined that the defendants original waiver consisting of written statement was insufficient as it merely recited some of the possible consequences of guilty plea and did not at any point apprise the defendant of the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding without council17 additionally the court found it significant that there was evidence to indicate that the trial court provided the defendant with any warnings apart from those contained within the waiver the court also determined that there was evidence as to the defendants background and conduct that would allow conclusion that his waiver of counsel was knowing and intelligent irrespective of the noted deficiencies accordingly the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31143crs5 18id at 12051206 it should be noted that the court of appeals for the eighth circuit has also ruled on the waiver requirement holding that evidence of written waiver coupled with prior invocation of the right to counsel is sufficient for court to conclude as matter of law that defendant has made knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel united states v smith 171 f3d 617 622 8th cir 1999 19see national assn of

precluding prosecution under 922g918 constitutional challenges the lautenberg amendment has been attacked as impinging upon several different constitutional provisions while arguments that 922g9 violates the second and tenth amendments and operates as bill of attainder have been dismissed readily arguments relating to the commerce clause the equal protection clause and the ex post facto clause have received more measured consideration19 commerce clause the validity of 922g9 has been challenged on the basis that it violates the tenets of the commerce clause as delineated in the supreme courts decision in united states v lopez 20 specifically at issue in lopez was whether federal statute prohibiting the mere possession of firearm on school grounds exceeded congressional authority 21 in explaining the judicially enforceable limits of the commerce clause the court delineated three categories of activity that come within its ambit22 first congress possesses the authority to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce23 second congress may regulate the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in interstate commerce24 finally congress may also regulate activities which have substantial relation to and effect on interstate commerce25 in applying these standards to the case before it the supreme court determined that the statute at issue 18 usc 922q was neither regulation of the instrumentalities or channels of interstate commerce making the determination of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31143crs6 26id at 559 27id at 561 28id at 561562 in lopez the supreme court adjusted the judiciarys traditional approach to commerce clause analysis maintaining that while the history of commerce clause jurisprudence represented an expansive interpretation of federal commerce clause power the judiciary maintained the ability to enforce limits on that power in addition to its consideration of the issues discussed above the court also rejected the argument that possession of gun in the school environment impacted the economy by contributing to the costs associated with violent crime curtailing the willingness of individuals to travel to areas seen as unsafe or by posing threat to the education of the citizenry thus comprising the quality of the nations workforce id at 563564 the court went on to note that if such remote connections to economic effects were accepted as relevant it would be almost impossible to identify any activity by an individual that congress is without authority to regulate id at 565

922q was criminal statute which by its terms had connection with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise and did not play an essential role in larger regulatory scheme27 the supreme court also found it significant that there was jurisdictional element in the statute which would ensure that firearm possession affected interstate commerce in particular case28 to date every court applying this standard has readily determined that 922g9 meets minimum constitutional requirements under the commerce clause specifically reviewing courts have determined that 922g9 contains jurisdictional element that requires the government to establish that the firearm at issue was possessed in or affecting commerce or was received after having been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce29 thus unlike the statute at issue in lopez the structure of 922g9 requires the establishment of nexus between the illegal firearm and interstate commerce limiting the statutes application to discrete set of firearm possessions that have an explicit connection to interstate commerce thereby obviating commerce clause concerns30 b equal protection it has also been argued that 922g9 violates the equal protection clause by punishing domestic violence misdemeanor s more harshly than other misdemeanor offenses by punishing misdemeanor but not felony offenses and by excludin g law enforcement officers convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence offenses from the public interest exception of 18 usc 925a1 determining the level of scrutiny to be applied under the equal protection clause hinges upon an analysis of whether law negatively impacts suspect class or fundamental right if there is such an impact the law is subjected to strict scrutinyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31143crs7 31see eg city of

compelling governmental interest31 in instances where law does not affect suspect class or fundamental right the court engages in rational basis review requiring only that the law be rationally related to the asserted governmental interest32 applying these standards reviewing courts have held that the lautenberg amendment does not violate the equal protection clause in hiley v barrett for instance the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit adopting the opinion of the district court found that the lautenberg amendment passed constitutional muster33 the barrett court began its equal protection analysis by noting that the appropriate level of review was the rational basis test as none of the claims involved suspect class or fundamental right34 addressing the argument that the lautenberg amendment irrationally categorizes misdemeanor domestic violence offenses more harshly than other misdemeanors the court first noted that the right to equal protection under the law does not strip congres s of the authority to to treat different classes of persons in different ways35 as such the court determined that in light of the amendments goal of reducing the likelihood that domestic violence will escalate into murder congress had rationally concluded that misdemeanor domestic violence offenders should not possess firearms36 the court next turned to the assertion that the amendment unjustifiably discriminates between misdemeanor domestic offenders and convicted felons this argument centers on the fact that while convicted felons may regain the right to possess firearm if they receive pardon have their conviction expunged or otherwise have their civil rights restored many jurisdictions do not deprive misdemeanants of their civil rights as such the amendment creates an anomaly whereby certain felons may be able to possess firearms but domestic violence misdemeanants will not37 while acknowledging that such an anomaly may indeed come to pass the court deemed it irrelevant noting that courts have rejected equal protectio n challenges to the gun control laws that rest on anomalies resulting from differing state regimens38 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31143crs8

committed misdemeanor domestic violence offenses the court rejected this argument noting that while the ultimate effect 922g9 may be to bar certain domestic violence misdemeanants of career that requires the ability to possess firearm equal protection concerns are not implicated by the uneven effects of rational classification absent evidence of discriminatory intent39 applying this rationale to the case at hand the court determined that there was evidence of any discriminatory intent towards police officers by congress obviating any equal protection concerns40 the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has also rejected equal protection challenges to the lautenberg amendment employing the same reasoning as the district court in barrett 41 the court of appeals for the district of columbia also upheld the lautenberg amendment on equal protection grounds in fraternal order of police v united states42 fop ii however it is important to note that the court originally determined that the amendment failed rational basis review under the equal protection clause fop i43 in fop i the court focused on the lack of public interest exception for law enforcement officers and held that there was in fact rational basis for the distinction between domestic violence misdemeanants and felons in this context44 the court maintained that the amendment could not be permitted to enable the government to prohibit domestic violence misdemeanants from possessing firearms pursuant to the public interest exception while it imposes lesser restriction on those convicted of crimes that differ only in being more serious45 in fop ii the united states was granted rehearing by the court resulting in reversal of the decision in fop i the court began its analysis in fop ii by noting the factors that led to its initial decision determining that the lautenberg amendment failed the rational basis test specifically the court stated that treating misdemeanants more harshly than felons seems irrational in the conventional sense of that term and that the imposition of lesser duty on felons raised questions regarding the applicability of the general maxim that congress is entitled to address problem one step at time46 upon further review however the court qualified this statement determining that it was not unreasonable for congress to believe that existing laws and practices

interest exception mitigating the apparent disparity created by the lautenberg amendment48 the courts reversal in fop ii prevented split among the circuits regarding the validity of the lautenberg amendment in the equal protection context it should be noted however that the fop cases represent differing but tenable interpretations regarding the effect of the amendment leaving open the possibility that future courts may again differ on the proper application of the equal protection clause to the lautenberg amendment c ex post facto clause finally the lautenberg amendment has also been challenged as violation of the ex post facto clause given that it prohibits domestic violence misdemeanant from possessing firearm even if the predicate offense occurred prior to its enactment49 the district court decision in national assn of government employees inc v barrett as affirmed and adopted by the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit in hiley v barrett rejected this argument stating that the prohibited activity is the postenactment possession of firearm as opposed to preenactment domestic violence misdemeanor50 clarifying this point the court explained that the lautenb erg amendment by prohibiting postenactment possession did not criminalize conduct that occurred prior to its effective date51 as such the court held that the amendment was not retrospective and therefore not violative of the ex post facto clause52 this reasoning has also been employed by the court of appeals for the fourth circuit and various district courts in rejecting ex post facto challenges to the lautenberg amendment53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31143crs10 conclusion as has been shown the lautenberg amendment establishes comprehensive federal scheme that is designed to prevent the use of firearms in domestic violence offenses by prohibiting the possession of firearms by persons convicted of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as well as the knowing sale or disposition of any firearm or ammunition to domestic violence misdemeanant furthermore by altering the traditional public interest exception of the gca the lautenberg amendment has been made applicable to state and federal law enforcement officials while these provisions have been significant source of legal controversy reviewing courts have rejected all challenges to the validity of the amendment determining that its provisions comport with minimum constitutional requirements furthermore while it is important to remember that there are tenable constitutional arguments that may be raised against the lautenberg amendment the breadth of the decisions discussed above would appear to minimize the possibility of any future rulings invalidating its provisions
