appropriations bills sandy streeter analyst in american national government government division earmarks and limitations are two devices regularly used in annual appropriations acts to direct and restrict respectively the availability of funds for specified activities sometimes an earmark or limitation may generate more interest or controversy than the appropriations act see

observers of the appropriations process nor is there standard earmark practice across all 13 regular appropriations bills according to the congressional quarterlys american congressional dictionary under the broadest definition virtually every appropriation is earmarked1 in practice however earmarks are generally defined more narrowly often reflecting procedures established over time that may differ from one appropriation bill to another for one bill an earmark may refer to certain level of specificity within an account2 for other bills an earmark may refer to funds set aside within an account for individual projects locations or institutions3 regarding the latter use of the term some of these earmarks are included in the text of appropriations measures floor amendments and
