in this area detailed discussion of procedural practices and options has been prepared by elizabeth rybicki analyst on the congress and the legislative process government and finance division crs under article i section 5 clause 1 of the cons titution each house of congress is granted the express authority to judge the elections the returns and the qualifications of its own members this

age citizenship and inhabitancy in the state from which chosen but also the legitimacy and validity of the election or selection process of those presenting credentials the official return from the state to the senate when judging qualifications the supreme court in the 1969 decision of powell v mccormack 395 us 486 1969 found that the house and the senate is limited to an examination of the three standing qualifications to office and any potential disqualifications such as under the fourteenth amendment the court there noted that anyone meeting those qualifications would have to be seated and not excluded if such person were duly elected selected or chosen 395 us at 522 under the powell decision and rationale and under the express constitutional grant of authority the senate and house may in addition to examining qualifications of memberselect examine the elections and returns of their own members that is whether an individual presenting valid credentials has been duly chosen few years after the powell decision the supreme court in roudebush v hartke 405 us 15 1972 clearly affirmed the right of the senate to make the final and conclusive determination concerning the election process and seating of its own members in the case of contests or challenges properly raised concerning the election or selection of senator the court affirmed the constitutional authority for an independent evaluation by the senate of the selection of those presenting themselves for membership 405 us at 2526 the various internal examinations and inquiries by the senate of the selection of an individual who has been appointed by governor of state have been considered and treated as elections cases and on numerous occasions in the past the senate has considered the legality or validity of gubernatorial selection additionally the senate has from timetotime examined the election or selection process prior to the adoption of the seventeenth amendment in 1913 senators were selected by state legislatures to see if corruption or bribery has so tainted the process as to call into question its validity

constitution expressly grants to each house of congress the authority to be the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members1 this express constitutional delegation gives the senate broad authority to judge and to make the final determination concerning not only the narrow constitutional qualifications of memberelect or member designate but also the legitimacy of the election or selection process of those presenting credentials to the senate 2 as stated by noted parliamentary authority the final and exclusive right to determine membership in democratically elected legislature is so essential to the free election and independent existence of legislative assembly that it may be regarded as necessary incident to every body of that description which emanates directly from the people3 in his historic work commentaries on the constitution justice joseph story analyzed the placing of the power and final authority to determine membership within each house of congress it is obvious that power must be lodged somewhere to judge of the elections returns and qualifications of the members of each house composing the legislature for otherwise there could be certainty as to who were legitimately chosen members and any intruder or usurper might claim seat and thus trample upon the rights and privileges and liberties of the people if lodged in any other than the legislative body itself its independence its purity and even its existence and action may be destroyed or put into imminent danger 4 the process of examination and inquiry within the senate is generally initiated at the occasion of the swearingin of the senatorelect or senatordesignate by an objection or question to the seating of that individual raised by another senator or from petition submitted to the senate often in the case of contested election by the opposing candidate 5 the presentation of credentials or certificate of election from governor and secretary of state that is the official return6 is considered to be prima facie evidence that the person holding those credentials is entitled to the seat subject to the final determination of the senate7 memberelect or

congress until that person is sworn in and seated by the relevant house8 upon challenge petition or express request from committee objecting to the swearingin and seating of particular individual the matter of the election and credentials of senatorelect or senatordesignate may be referred to the committee of jurisdiction which in the recent past has been the senate committee on rules and administration9 although it has been noted that it has been the more common practice in recent years in the case of certified senatorelect or senatordesignate who is challenged to swear such person in without prejudice during the pendency of committee and senate consideration of the matter10 the senate has in the past also refused to swear in and seat individuals pending senate resolution of the matter even though credentials were presented11 g19g158g138g149g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 one of the inquiries and judgments that the senate may make concerning an individual presenting himself or herself for membership is an examination of that persons qualifications for office although there had been precedent in the past for the senate to look at senatorelects or senatordesignates fitness for office or moral character in judging the qualifications of such individual to be seated in the senate the ex tent of the authority of the senate to judge qualifications under article i section 5 clause 1 was expressly and narrowly delineated by the supreme court in the case of powell v mccormack in 1969 12 the supreme court in that case stated that in judging the qualifications of its members congress is limited to the standing qualifications prescribed in the constitution13 that is the memberelects age citizenship and inhabitancy in the state from which elected14 as explained in deschler s precedents the powell decision apparently precludes the practice of the house or senate followed on numerous occasions during the 19th and 20th centuries of excluding memberselect for prior criminal immoral or disloyal conduct15 8 riddick and fruman riddicks senate procedure precedents and practices credentials and oath of office sdoc 10128 at 704 708710

exclusion based on judging qualifications of memberelect as noted by th court the central question of that case meant that the court must determine the meaning of the phrase to be the judge of the qualifications of its own members 16 g7g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g156g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g157g158g155g151g156g561 the limitations on judging the qualifications of memberselect in an exclusion procedure set out in the powell decision do not however necessarily prohibit the senate from looking into the election or selection of an individual who presents credentials to be seated in the senate under the authority of article i section 5 clause 1 to judge the elections and returns of its own members the senate has clear constitutional authority and has in the past exercised such authority to look behind the certification or credentials of memberelect or memberdesignate to determine if the person presenting himself or herself for seating has been duly chosen elected or selected 17 in supreme court decision subsequent to powell v mccormack the court clearly affirmed the senates authority to be the final judge of the elections and returns of its own members the court in roudebush v hartke ruled that states own contest procedures for senatorial election could not usurp or deprive the senate of its constitutional duties and authority to exercise an unconditional and final judgment over the seating of its own members18 in so holding the court expressly recognized the constitutional authority for an independent evaluation by the senate of the selection of person to be united states senator19 finding that the senates determination of the right to seat in congress in an elections case is not reviewable by the courts because it is nonjusticiable political question20 earlier the supreme court in barry v united states ex rel cunningham 21 had acknowledged the senates authority to secure information it needed in determining an election contest where corruption and fraud in the election had been alleged the court noted that the jurisdiction of the senate to determine the rightfulness of the claim to senate seat was invoked and its power to continued arthur r gould of maine in 1926 concerning allegations of bribery of foreign official in 1910 in business deal senate election cases supra case 111 16 395 us at 521 17 the court in powell expressly found that the house may not exclude by majority vote one who possesses the three constitutional qualifications to office and is duly elected by his constituency 39 5 us at 522 since the house and senate are authorized to judge not only the three qualifications but also the elections and returns of their members justifiable inquiry may pro ceed under the powell rationale as to whether senatorelect was duly elected or selected it should be remembered and emphasized that the powell decision concerned house proceeding and memberelect of the house may be appointed or chosen other than by popular election by the people article i section 2 clause 1 prior to the seventeenth amendment in 1913 however senators were chosen by the state legislators and governors could and may still fill senate vacancies by ppointments and thus the selection of senators has always involved more than popular elections the same rationale would apply even if one semantically were to consider lawful or proper election or selection as one of the constitutional qualifications for office see roudebush v hartke 405 us 15 at 26 n 23 18 405 us 15 19 1972 19 405 us at 2526 20 405 us at 19 21 279 us 597 1929

article i of the constitution when memberelect who had received certificate from the governor of the state presented himself to the senate claiming all rights of membership22 the court found that the senate acts as judicial tribunal with many of the powers inherent in the court system in rendering in such election cases judgment which is beyond the authority of any other tribunal to review23

or return of senatorelect or senatordesignate to determine if the person presenting credentials was lawfully or properly chosen or elected the cases instances and precedents in which the propriety or legality of the appointment of memberdesignate to the senate is questioned in the senate have generally been characterized by parliamentarians and historians as elections challenges contests or cases 24 that is within the rubric of elections cases and elections challenges is the senates examination of the validity legality and propriety of memberdesignates selection or appointment prior to the adoption of the seventeenth amendment in 1913 requiring the popular election of senators senators were chosen by the various state legislatures although the governor of state could fill vacancy when the legislature was in recess25 numerous election contests or elections cases were presented in the senate during this time challenging the credentials and seating of memberdesignate based upon the questioning of the legality or propriety of governors appointment 26 or allegations of bribery and corruption in obtaining the selection of the state legislature27 in some of the cases concerning

senatordesignate appeared with the official certification from the state and eventually excluded the individuals from the senate such as in the case of kensey johns appointed by the governor of delaware to fill vacancy in 178428 the case of henry w corbett appointed by the governor of oregon in 189829 and the case of matthew quay appointed by the governor of pennsylvania in 189830 after the adoption of the seventeenth amendment the popular elections of senators were also challenged in various cases in which there were allegations of corruption or bribery in the selection of memberelect such that the validity of the entire election process was called into doubt for example in 1929 in the case of william s vare the senate eventually agreed to resolution which found that the expenditure of such large sums of money to secure the nomination together with the charges of corruption and fraud prima facie taints with fraud and corruption the credentials of the said william s vare for seat in the united states senate and refused to seat senatorelect vare 31 the senate legal counsel has observed that on three occasions the senate has determined that an election was so tainted with corruption that its results were invalid each time the senate declared the seat vacant32 with respect to the similar factors to consider in the house of representatives elections cases it has been noted in deschlers precedents congress is the sole judge of the elections of its members and regulation of elections is subject of various federal statutes if the house found that member had conducted such corrupt and fraudulent campaign as to render the election invalid the house could deny seat to such memberelect not for disqualifi cations but for failure to be duly elected 33 it would thus appear from congressional precedents that corruption and fraud in the election or selection process would be and have been valid and relevant considerations for the senate to examine in determining the legitimacy of the selection of senatorelect or senatordesignate who presents credentials to be seated

chosen or failure to meet the constitutional qualifications for office must be distinguished from an expulsion by the senate an expulsion unlike an exclusion is generally recognized as disciplinary measure to punish member as well as measure to protect the integrity and dignity of the institution from those who have proven unworthy of continued continued election should be nullified or whether caldwell should be expelled and was eventually concluded by caldwells resignation 28 senate election cases supra case 2 at 67 29 senate election cases supra case 85 at 253255 s rept 505 55th cong 2d
