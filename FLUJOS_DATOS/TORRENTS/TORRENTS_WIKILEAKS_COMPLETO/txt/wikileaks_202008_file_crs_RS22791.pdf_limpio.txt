an amendment to the republic of chinas taiwans constitution under the old elector rules voters had only one ballot to cast in multimember districts where as many as 12 candidates competed against one another even if they were from the same party this system functioned at cost to party discipline and was thought to encourage ra dicalism with candidates able to be elected with as little as five percent of the vote in given distri ct the 2005 electoral ch anges halved the size of the legislature to 113 members from its fo rmer size of 225 and increased the term of office from three years to four the new rules also instituted new singlemember district system employing two ballots for voters similar to systems used in germany and japan one to be cast for candidate and one to be cast for political party as expected the new system has appeared to favor larger well organized parties and to put smaller parties and fringe elements at disadvantage in the previous legislature the opposition

so failed to pass tw referendum measures one dpp measure asking whether the g overnment should attempt to seize assets the kmt is alleged to have embezzled dur ing its unbroken rule on the island from 1949 2000 and one kmt measure asking whethe r the legislature should be given power to investigate official corrupti on the two referenda which needed to reach threshold of 50 of the participating electorate for passage were seen as litmus tests for more controversial referendum pr oposed by president chen for the upcoming march 22 presidential election asking whether taiwan should apply to the united nations for full membership under the name tai wan rather than its form name of the republic of china1 beijing considers the referendum to be tantamount to public poll on taiwan independence prospect china has vowed to prevent by force if necessary the united states has called taiwan s proposal provocative the kmt historically is party of mainlanders who fled to taiwan from mainland china in 1949 it is politically conservative and strongly anticommunist although it is credited with engineering taiwans vibran t economic growth and transformation during its more than 50year rule on the island the kmts inability to offer clear and creative vision for taiwans future ultimately made it vulnerable to the proindependence dpp party which was able to elect its candidate chen shuibian to the presidency in elections in 20002 since then the kmt has portrayed itself as more responsible steward than the dpp for taiwans future it has soundly cr iticized the dpps posture toward beijing as unnecessarily confrontational nd has promised to replace it with policy of engagement and cooperation the party so has gotten political mileage out of portraying president chen as insufficiently attentive to th needs of taiwans economy and business community as in the economic disadvantages taiwan business interests continue to face due to taiwans restrictions on contacts with mainland china3

2008executive in the hands of one party ending the legislativeexecutive split in taiwans government that has created political grid lock throughout the chen administration optimists suggest that this would lead to the kind of policy achievements that have eluded president chen more pessimistic observers allege that this development could return taiwan to quasi oneparty state leaving the dpp too weakened to function as the kind of robust opposition voice that vibrant democracy requires others have warned against the temptation to see geostrategic outcome in what they say is the very local and tactical nature of taiwans legislative elections4 they say that the islandwide contest that will elect taiwans next president will be very different process and that the electorate may seek to balance the overwhelming kmt legislative victory by seeking to hand the presidency to the dpp still even if the dpp is the winning party in marchs presidential electi on and divided governme nt continues the kmts substantial legislative margin enough to veto legi slative proposals or recall the president would appear to put the kmt in the drivers seat of taiwan policy implications for the united states while carefully stating they have prefer ences in taiwans po litical races officials in the bush administration have been vexed by president chen shuibians unpredictable political style his confronta tional tactics with the people s republic of china prc and by the difficulty of getting substantive action out of taiwans former gridlocked legislature as result us policy may seem to be wellserved by any developments that could tend to calm taiwans political waters and facilitate mature policy discourse such developments would appear to include more effective legislative process but more skeptical observers point out that while the kmts new legislative super majority will give it stronger voice taiwans gridlocked legislature also had kmt coalition majority mere numbers according to this view do not necessarily translate into compromise political unity or an active policy agenda even while the dpps new chairman frank hsieh has promised to pur sue less confrontati onal approach toward china if the dpp is victorious in the marc h presidential election it is likely to continue to embrace the proindependence views that its radical base supports therefore confrontational politics and stalemate still could continue in the event of dpp victory in marchs presidential contest others have suggested that there may be different potential complications should the kmt win the presidency in march 2008 and gain full control of the taiwan government they point out that the kmt has long pledge d to improve taiwans relations with the prc supporting closer cultural and ec onomic ties and that
