habeas corpus jurisdiction over removalrelated matters such review was still available after the 1996 changes furthermore the court also found that elimin ating any judicial review including habeas review without any substitute for review of stions of law including constitutional issues would raise serious constitutional questions therefore it chose statutory construction habeas review was not

beginning with the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 aedpa1 and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira2 legislation and administrative

the us court of appeals for the federal circuit it would increase the authorized number of j udges on the federal circuit from 12 to 15 and would authorize sums necessary to implement these changes and the increased case load of the federal circuit for fis cal years 2007 to 2011 the effective date of these changes would be the date of enac tment and they would apply to any final agency order or district c ourt decision entered on or af ter the date of enactment this consolidation of appeals would remove pressure on the other federal appellate circuits from the dramatic increase in their caseload largely resulting from immigration appeals9 it would basically add the equiva lent of another 3judge panel to the federal circuit this provision would also eliminate future inconsistency among appellate circuits in interpretations of immigration law which in the past may have increased litigation as different circuits considered an issue for the first time and as the us supreme court may have had to resolve circuit diffe rences differences among circuits also may have necessitated congressional action to clarify or establish statutory standards in response to incons istent

the prior order at any time after the reen try ina 241a5 current law does not contain provisions specifically limiting judicial review of reinstatement of orders of removal deportation or exclusion ina 242 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that reinstatement of previous order of removal against an alien who illegally reenters the united states necessitates hearing before an immigration judge21 proposed changes in response to the case law in the ninth circuit 505 of s 2454 and 705 of the chairmans ma rk would amend the current statute to clarify that if the secretary of homeland security finds that an alien has illegally reentered the united states after prior removal or voluntary departure then the order of removal portation or exclusion may be reinstated without hearing before an immigration judge there would be judicial review of the original removal order but there could be limited review of certain factual determinations that an alien had illegally

aliens life or freedom would be threatened in the country for re moval and that race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion would be at least one central reason for such threat the clarifying amendment would take effect as if enacted on may 11 2005 the effective date of the real id act amendments for withholding of removal hr 4437 contai ns similar

prescreening process exists in the current provision governing judicial review of removal orders ina 242 proposed changes section 507 of s 2454 and 707 of the chairmans mark would amend the current statute to provide for screening process under which an alien would submit brief concerning petition for judicial review within 40 days after the date on which the administrative record is available or face dismissal of the appeal after the aliens brief is filed the appeal would be assigned to one judge on the us court of appeals for the federa l circuit who would review case within 60 days of assignment and petition for review would be denied absent the issuance of certificate of reviewability by the federal appellate judge or circuit justice the certificate would only be granted if the petitioner establishes prima facie case that petition should be granted the denial of certificate would not be subject to further review hr 4437 contains similar provision 805 but the standard for issuance of certificate would be that the petitioner must make substantial showing that the petition for review is likely to be gr anted samdt 3192 and s 2611s 2612 do not contain such provision this

issued on or after the date of enactment of this act regardless of the date that such fees or expenses were incurred hr 4437 contains similar provisi on 808 but it would only refer to determinations
