bilderberg group garmischpartenkirc hen conference 2325 september 1955 introduction the third bilderberg conference was held at garmischparte nkirchen in germany from 23 to 25 september 1955 under the chairmanship of hrh the prince of the netherlands it will be recalled that previous conferences of the same kind were held at bild erberg in holland in may 1954 and at barbizon in france in march 1955 the purpose of this series of conferences is to reach the highest possible denominator of mutual understanding between the countries of wester n europe and north america and so to work for the removal of causes of friction to study those fields where action may be n ecessary to prevent friction from arising in the future and to examine the general reas in which agreement may be sought to this end it was thought sirable to bring together group of men of experience outstanding qualities and influence from diffe rent countries of the western world in an atmosphere of mutual confidence and personal friendship which would admit of free and frank discussion it is not the purpos of the bilderberg series of conferenc to construct policy participants include st atesmen and diplomatists trades unionists intellectuals business and professional m they speak as individuals and not as repr esentatives of their respective countries or the political parties associations or organizations to which they may belong all however share high purpose and clear recognition of the urgency of the situation it was conclusion of the first bilderberg conference that for historical reasons together with many factors which were the ingredients of the present political economic and social situati on there would always be diffe rences of opinion between the countries of western europe and those of north america and in fact between any two countries in the world divergencies of view are not in themselves deplorable and indeed they are the quintessence of democr atic life nevertheless it is matter f the utmost urgency that the will and the means should exist fo r finding common basis on which to build our future at the second conference held in barbizon this year s ubjects were chosen for the agenda which were bound to be controversial to certain extent but the discussion of which could clarify the situation and in some cases could be followed up in the future the problem of the uncommitted peoples was discussed and the general question of communist infiltration and propaganda together with the approach of th western european and north american countries to this question it was felt that there must grow up not only better understanding betw een the countries of the western alliance but closer contact and better understanding with the asian and african countries to many of which belong the socalled uncommitted peoples of the world there was strong current of opinion also that there might be great value in arranging subsequent meeting between leaders of the mind and spirit of the east and west in an atmosphere similar to that of the bilderberg series of conferences it was also generally agreed that too little was being done to counteract the unceasing and insidious encroachment of communist propaganda the participants agreed that whenever they had the opportunity they would try to further those ideas and suggestions which had found general agreement at the two previous meetings by making whatever use might be possible of the press and other contacts with public opinion it is believed also that in the wide nd important field presented by the europea n american associations much could be done towards creating the friendly atmosphere need ed for the growth of the highest degree of cooperation it will be seen from the list of partic ipants that the garmisch conference was attended by men from thirteen different countries the subjects discussed were i review of events since the barbizon conference ii article 2 of the north atla ntic treaty organization iii the political and strategic aspects of atomic energy iv the reunification of germany v european unity vi the industrial aspects of atomic energy vii economic problems eastwest trade b the political aspects of convertibility c expansion of international trade in order to allow participants to speak with perfect frankness and in the knowle dge that their words would not be read outside the conference circle the chairman asked fo r the utmost discretion the press as at the previous conferences was not admitte d and this document should be treated as strictly confiden tial and for the personal use of the recipient only press statement released at garmischpartenkirchen on 26 sept ember 1955 is reproduced in the appendix to this report summary of consensus of opinion at the conference the changes in internal characteristics and external behaviour of the soviet regime the group noted that during the last year or two there have b een significant changes both in th internal characteristics and t he external behaviour of the soviet regime th changes are such as to deserve the c onsidered attention of the western peoples and give some grounds for hope that the problem of soviet russi an power and ideology will not be necessarily over the long term what we have known it to be in the past nevertheless they ve not yet led to any alterations in the soviet position on major issues that could warrant in the slightest degree any modificati ons in the military posture of the western countries as embodie d in the policies and arrangements of nato or in their efforts to strengthen the free world politically and economically nor can t here be any relaxation of vigilance in the face of other devices dir ected against the unity and the inner strength of the free world on the contrary it is obvious that if the western powers should permit themselves to be led into premature relaxation of the ir defence effort or into slack ened pursuit of their political and economic goals this might very well give rise to renewed fa lse hopes and miscalculations on the soviet side which could undo even those slender elem ents of hope and encouragement implicit in the present situation on the other hand there is also the opposite danger of needle ssly rebuffing soviet moves whic h may offer an opportunity for the establishment of better atmosphere in internal relations and of inflicting on the peoples of the free world discouragem ent greater than circumstances would warrant it must be made clea r to the russians that every positive move on their part towards an improvement of relations with the free world will meet with an appropriate response in the coming period western policy will have to bear in mind constantly these two preoccupations an undue emphasis on either of them can be distinctly dangerous carefully select ed blend of unshakeable firmness and willingness to put forward nd seriously to examine suggestions affords prospects that warrant reasonable optimism as to the possibility of preserving peace without jeopardy to the security of the free nations b the north atlantic treaty organization during broad discussion the different asp ects of the role of nato were examined 1 the need for maintaining and even increas ing the effectiveness of the atlantic pact on all levels was recognized for on the vigour of the atlantic pact depend larg ely the chances of negotiation and peace 2 the military effort must be continued and maintained to th point necessary to prevent all temptation to resort to violence 3 emphasis was laid upon the importance of the atlantic comm unity strengthening itself by making use of all facilities including those offered by the pact for economi c social and psychological cooperation c the political and strategic aspects of atomic energy the group discussed the impact of atomic energy on the political and defence f the free countries of the west agreement was reac hed as to any method by which at omic warfare could be limited without surrendering the freedom of action of the western countries to defend themselves but it was generally felt that their defensive arrangements are already based on the use of the minimum atomic or nuclear force necessary if the devastating effect of nuclear war acted as deterrent to aggressive action and made war less likely it followed that th struggle on the ideological front would become more intense the west must prepare itself for this development by increasing in every way the vitality of its society d the reunification of germany there was general agreement within the group as to the urgency of this problem as expressed by many speakers there could be real security in europe until the reunification of germany had been achieved on basis of real freedom in discussing the soviets interest in german reunification there was general feeling that the soviet was not so much interes ted in the reunification of germany as in the terms which she could get for it it appeared that her object was still to use reunif ication as central device to detach western germany from the western security organization and eventu ally to absorb her into the soviet satellite system some participants expressed the view th at the soviet had fear of wh at she called capitalist encircle ment and eventual attack by the western powers whether this fear was real or false the west should not abandon the hope of possible successful approach by means of security arrangement which would not endanger nato or impair german freedom there was general consensus of opinion that in these circumstances great caution and great patience were needed in any approach to the solution of this important problem european unity the discussion on this subject revealed general support for the idea of european integration and unification among the participants from the six countries of th european coal and steel community and recognition of the urgency of the problem while members of the group held different views as to the thod by which common market could be set up there was general recognition of the dangers inherent in the present divided markets of europe and the pressing need to bring the german people together with the other peoples of europe into comm on market that the six countries of the coal and steel community had definitely decided to establish common market and that experts were now working this out was felt to be most encouraging step forward and it was hoped that other countries would subsequently join it the need was generally accepted to press forward with functi onal integration in the economic domain particularly with regard to the industrial utilization of atom ic energy it was generally recognized that it is our common responsibility to arrive in the shortest possible time at the highest degree of integrati on beginning with common european market it was also generally agreed that the tariff walls surrounding this comm on market should certainly not be higher and should possibly be lower than the averag of the existing tariffs now app lied by the individual countries concerned f the industrial aspects of atomic energy during this discussion consensus of opini on manifested itself in certain points 1 the future of the human race is bound up w ith the development of nuclear energy 2 the cost of research development installation and the trai ning of large numbers of specialists is very high thus the developmental expense which must be put into what might be called the first and second generations of reactors meant that economic justification would come after this nevertheless in the next few years this problem can be expected to be solved 3 as result of the high cost it is of vital importance th at europe should combine her resources since the cost per capita in any single country would be far greater than that in the united states with its larger population and resources 4 the opportunity to initiate joint action in europe should be seized before atom ic development has been crystallized along national lines and at time when vested interests have not yet established the obstacles which may make cooperative act ion more difficult if not impossible in few years time 5 the opportunity to develop this new source of energy is an opportunity to increase productive output and is directly connected with the establishmen t of common european market around it can be built if the opportunity is not lost new aspect and new hope for the unification of europe 6 the quickest possible steps should be taken towards the integra tion of europe in respect to the industrial use of atomic energy and joint planning training and research should be started as soon as possi ble the possibility of extending this part icular form of integration to other than eu ropean countries was also emphasized i review of events since the barbizon conference european rapporteur surveyed the international events of the past six mont hs there had been political evolution which might be called sensational the conclusion of the austrian treat the visit of bulganin and khrushchev to yugoslavia the summit conference in geneva and lastly the atomic conference in geneva the stion was whether this was illusion or reality there seemed to be serious reason to believe that the co mmunist leaders had become less communist and therefore the changes in soviet foreign policy were only tactical changes perhaps we were entering into new litvinov period there seemed to be parallel in the situation today according to what the soviet leaders had themselves told us their statements indicated that there was serious crisis in soviet agriculture and in the productivity of soviet industry and there was an undoubted political crisis as result of the adjustments made afte r stalins death there was tendency in the west to say i n spite of threats and soviet actions we have set up the western european union and this has brought the russians to the negotiating table was this really true or was it that russia having been unable to prevent th ratification of the western european uni on was trying to prevent its implementation an d aiming at neutralizing nato russia could be likened to malaria it was wrong to believe oneself dead when the fever was hi gh and even more wrong to believe oneself cured when the attack was over it was necessary to use the period when the fever s ubsided to take cure and build up resist ance against the next attack and this sho uld indicate the action which we should take to meet the new turn in soviet policy the cold war as we had known it had been trench war whereas the new conflict called coexistence was war of movement the change over from trench war to war of move ment had often resulted in seri ous military disasters and we should be very careful lest this transiti on also caused disasters in the political fiel d there were serious dangers in the new diplomacy by television rather than by negotiation and it was of great importance that we should not lower our guard while we all sincerely hoped that the russians really wanted peace we must never forget that they may only wish to disrupt the military and political organization of the western world and that they will try to exploit all the difficulties which may arise between euro pe and america it was significant that khruschev himself speaking recently in moscow had said that the russians always spoke the truth to their friends as well as to their adversaries they were in fav our of the relaxation of tension but if anyone thought that to achieve it they were going to forget about marx lenin and engels he would be wrong this was as likely to happen as it was for easte r to fall on tuesday they were for coe xistence because both capitalism and socialism ex ist in the world but they would alway s stand for the construction of socialism th ey did not believe that war was necessary for that since peaceful emulation would suffice an american participant next described the current trend of ited states affairs and policies affecting europe since barbizon the united states had gone thro ugh period of relative tranquillity in its public opinion which had been remarkably quiet on foreign policy matters and mood of modera tion prevailed the austrian settlement nd the geneva talks on atomic energy had been well received and the misgivings with which the summit conference had first been viewed had given way in the end to satisfaction that some good might have been achieved the speaker agreed however th at great caution was necessary the united states was also entering its quadrennial fever of presidential ections fact which could not but complicate to some extent united states foreign policy arrangements w ith regard to diplomacy by television whic h had been mentioned by the first speaker he felt that we should note that united states foreign policy w ould continue to be subject to vigorous and interested public discussion since government in his country could not expect to follow an importan t policy over considerable period of time without full discussion full unde rstanding and support by large proportion of the population the speaker mentioned two longrange issues of great importance the first was the meaning of the new soviet diplomacy and its effect upon the solidarity of the free world radically different assumptions about soviet policy might lead us into dangerousl divergent paths we must seek the proper balance between vi gilance and strength on the one hand and willingness to negotiate and settle specific issues as steps towards reducing tension on the other would our essential western unity melt under the new soviet sun and our inevitable differences om larger what would our attitude now be towards the fate of our friends in the soviet satellites would we be wise and so phisticated in the more difficult competiti on in nonmilitary fiel ds and determined in sustaining the economic and other burdens of this competiti on we need common view common strategy and common determination since communism would become more seductive if it were to modify its two most repelling aspects of ruthless totalitarianism and armed aggression and would present us with an even more serious problem than in the past the second issue or set of issues which might divide and weaken us arose in the pacific the united states was orientated towards two oceans and concerned about pacific security only sligh tly less than atlantic security this was why americans were exercised about the problem of japan earning living in the world in which she finds herself and were disappointed at the reservations which accompanied the admission of japan to the gatt agreements and then there was the problem of china here we were confronted by problem which was far more than technical question of credentials and recognition and the china question could seriously affect our to tal relationship unless we could find basis of agreement among ourselves canadian speaker could not find very much in canadian opinion which differed from th at described by his american colleague technically and diplomatically the united st ates and canada were in the same positi on but opinion in the latter country had bee n increasingly worried about the realism and wisdom of nonrecognition of china and that was an anxiety shared by all political parties another united states speaker felt that it was important to recognize that the major differences that had existed betw een russia and the western countries since the recent war did not arise basically from the ideological disparity between the two systems although that was important or even from the personality and methods of stalin himself but rather from the fact that the destruction temporarily of the power of ge rmany and japan left great political and m ilitary voids in the world and there was agreement in 1945 between the major powers on the western side on the one hand and russia on the other as to how these voids should be filled internal conditions in russia could change there could be strong subjective reaction as the speaker thoug ht there had been among soviet officialdom against the many manife stations of stalinism and th ere could be changed outward direction of approach to the western world all this did not alter the nature of soviet political interests visavis europe as they had emerged from world war ii there were more encouraging long term factors parallel had been drawn between the present period and the litvinov period of the late twenties and early t hirties and in many respects it had been well drawn but there was something that was significantly different firstly in the late twenties and early thirties russia was only entering upon the period of extreme nightmarish terrorism that endured for twenty years from 1933 to 1953 today she is emerging from that period and from the speakers own observations there had been feeling of acute horror and revulsion in almost all ranks of the soviet sy stem of officialdom right up to the very top even the soviet olympus today seemed to be united prim arily by the slogan return t the extremities and horrors of stalinism this of course implies transition to so mething else and what that something else is we do not yet know perhaps the russians themselves do not know and for that reason they might be facing something in the nature of new constitutional crisis secondly there was the state of mind of wh at might be called the soviet cultural and scientific elements body of people far more numerous and important today than they were in the late t wenties at that time there was great stir of real ideological enthusiasm among these people while today their minds were dominated by something which might be described as political apathy and burning desire for world cont acts appreciation and the opening of window to the western world these forces were the more powerful for the reason that they began to grow up under stalin but were repre ssed under him and had now come out with redoubled force that might affect both the internal na ture of the soviet system and the entire tenor of its relations with the outside world it might be said that nothing had changed but the manners of sovi et diplomacy but we should not underrate th importance of manners on the fina l results achieved in life they might be faced in the near future nato had imposed upon itself the rule th at it would not use forces greater than were necessary to accomplish its tasks european participant commented on the f act that the western world had largely been occupied during the last few years with defensive measures while this might be true as far as military questions were concerned it was not true that the initiative h ad been surrendered since nato itself and the development of its institutional strength amounted to seizing the initiative but n ow the russians by launching their campaign of charm had again seized the initiative th ey had been forced to launch their new campaign as result of nato and of western cooperation and we were moving from the cold war to the hot peace article 2 might provide method by which we could regain the initiative and this was matter which might well be discussed here there was body of opinion which held that nato could not unde rtake the kind of development on the spiritual side that was required in europe and that the member countries themselves must do this nato had in any case most inadequate budget for this purpose one of the functions of the bilderberg group ther efore might be to help to cr eate realization through member s in their own countries that nato has mission which is mission of peace as well as of defence much good had been done in this direction by the references to nato by queen juliana of the netherlands when she opened her parliament recently it had to be remembered that the russians were spending billion dollars at least on propaganda and in fact spent more money in jamming our propaganda programmes than the free world spends on its own propaganda it was felt that mo st effective propaganda could be developed from the human experience of nato which could be used to familiarize people with the kind of cooperation that nato represented there was for instance monthly magazi ne published by nato but more than this was required british participant felt that the recent nat meeting of parliamentarians of its member countries had not been as strikingly successful as it should have been and that nato had not identified itself sufficiently w ith the conference he felt that more t han this was required possibly some parliamentary group might be conceived in connection with th nato organization which could meet each year and serve as means of education and propaganda for the nato effort another speaker felt that the question was not so much one of propaganda but one of what nato itself could do to inspire people and prepare them psychologically for the use of nuclear weapons should this b ecome necessary for their defence while the united states had done so much to pool its military res ources through the nato mechanism little had been done to pool its political and economic resources in the same manner and the ques tion was asked how far would the united states be willing to go in this direction the more that atomic w eapons were developed the more it might be possible that th ey would not be used and th is gave even greater emphasis to the importan ce of conventional weapons and of the spirit of the western people it would be of great use if nato officials could bring pr essure on their governments to prepare young people in their respective countries for the task which they would have to face as members of the armed forces of nato other participants were more concerned with the hard core of military reality whic h was the real respons ibility of nato than with the economic and political aspects provi ded by article 2 some nations were di splaying tendencies to reduce the military resources which they were making available through nato and it was essential that these tendencies should be checked it might be regarded as military duty for the fr ee nations to engage in mutual discussions before taking unilateral action it was also pointed out as an objection to the further implemen tation of article 2 that there was not an identity of membersh ip between nato and other european organizations in the economic field it was further contende d that for nato to attempt to consider controversial economic matters might endanger that complete agreement among its members which existed in the military field iii the political and strategic aspects of atomic energy the conference discussed the issues which arose from papers on this subject prepared by united states and european participants the trends in recent years towards the increase in the power of atomic weapons their speed and range of delivery were emphasized by most speakers together with the fact that the west had now lost its atomic monopoly doubts were expressed however as to whether there could be such thing as an atomic stalemate since as both sides developed the means of deliverin g an atomic attack the emphasis shifted to geographical considera tions of target location and disp ersal base location and dispe rsal and factors such as the maintenance and turnround of aircraft and other weapons moreover if the countries of the west maintained their unity of allian ce they had definite advantage over the communist world and might be able to look forward to longterm maintenance of superiority in the atomic field it should be possible therefore to build up defensive system givi ng some degree of protection against the po ssibilities of decisive surprise attack and making atomic aggression extremely expensive to the aggressor in any ca it would be necessary to build up ch defence and to preserve it another speaker recalled the previous discussion in which it had been pointed out that we were now entering into period of hot peace and that as the fronts were moving closer the ideol ogical war would become more tense in all nonmilitary and particularly in the social and economic fields he feared that we were not sufficiently prepared for this new trend of events it was equally dangerous to replace the argument of military strength by the argument that communism as shown by recent changes in soviet policy would change the important point would now be to get vitality into our society strong argument was put forward by british participant in favour of policy of graduated deterrence by whic h the west would make declaration that in the event of its being attacked it would not use the hydrogen bomb at all unless it were first used by the enemy nor would it attack centres of civilian population outside specific battle area unless again the enemy did so first it was claimed that such policy would make total thermonuclear war very much less lik ely since it was in the interests of both sides to avoid the destruction of their cities this would beco particularly relevant as the soviet b ecame able to strike the cities of the unit ed states massive retaliation therefore had become far too drastic to be justified and was in f act longer necessary on the ther hand the clear warning that atomic wea pons would be used to repel any aggression would decrease the possibilities of war breaking out and enhance the security of the grey areas in wh ich the soviet might think that the united states or her allies would not be prepared to commit themselv at the same time providing the necessary counterbalance to communist superiority in manpower since the west would be dependent on the use of its large ports in the case of soviet aggression great advantag should be gained from the adoption of such policy it was real ized that the chief difficulty would be that of establishing distinctions in nuclear weapons and target s which would not break down in war but th at this disadvantage was outweighed by the moral political military and economic advantages it was not possible to reach any basis of agreement on this proposal there was howev er general feeling that the west had already adopted policy which was close to that of graduated deterrence in that it wa s unlikely to use more atomic force than was absolutely necessary many speakers emphasi zed the danger of limiting freedom of action in the face of aggression by making any previous announcement or promise which in the event of dire em ergency it might not be possible to fulfil and which might in fact prove to be an invitation to aggressi on it was not in the interests of the west that there should be general atomic war and if war did come atomic weapons should be rest ricted to the minimum use in the minimu m geographic area wherever possible while still achieving the objectives for which we would be fighting meanwhile it was absolutely n ecessary that the west should maintain and increase its strength that nato should be given all the assistance possible to this end and that the free insti tutions of the west should be strengthened and made more vital in order to meet changing conditions iv the reunification of germany discussion of this subject was marked by very understandable sense of urgency expressed by the german speakers in particular for some solution which would br ing about unification apart from the natu ral feelings of the german people there was feeling clearly expressed on the german side that there c ould be lasting peace in europe while this problem remained unsolved and that the time factor in solv ing it was one of very considerable importa nce meanwhile the to talitarian upbringing of the younger generation in the eastern zone would seem to be going forward and communi st ideas were gradually permeating the lives of the people to this must be added the reaction of the german people them selves and the feeling that divided germany could not be allowed to crystallize into pe rmanent conception against the background of the evaluation of the problem there was the question of what the russians might gain fr om reunification russia had considerable interest in obtaining economic help and recent visitors to russia had emphasized that this was particul arly true in connection with the responsibilities which the sovi et union had assumed towards the industrializati on of china in order to avoid being faced on the east by an eventually inimical china and on the west by the enemy represented by the free world there was also the desire of the russians to effect some kind of security arrangement arising from fear which may or may not be real one that there might some day be an attack ag ainst her by the western capitalist powers german speakers made it clear that the soviet would hope to use reunification as central device to detach western germany from the western security arrangements which already exist then there was the russian interest in maintaining an eastern german government which would recognize the oderneisse line ther was the marxist belief in the ultimate collaps of the west and that certainly affected t he russian timetable the discussion brought ou t the interest of russias longterm polic in the maintenance of the oderneisse line and the retention of part of german territory within the polish border from th communist viewpoint moreover the turnov er to the west of former communist state would have most unfortunate effect on the other satellites in evaluating the possibi lities of reunification the main differences were di fferences of emphasis there was feeling on the part of some participants that i t might be possible to work out pattern fo r reunification not within the framework of the paris agreemen ts but within the framework of germany closely tied to the west if the west were willing to pay the price of an overall security arrangement an d were willing to provide economic assistance an american par ticipant discussed the probable course of soviet policy and indicated that in his judgement the greatest diplomatic thrust would be directed by the soviet towards bonn and not towards the western powers and that they would doubt use their position in berlin to give them additi onal bargaining power another american speaker suggested that the united states attitude up to the present had been to avoid confusing the reunification iss ue with the security problem and to keep reunification well to the forefront french speaker held the view that his countrys po licy would certainly although not altogether happily support proposals on reunification ma by the western powers and though it would be unlikely to give active support to policy of negotiation for reunification it would offer active resistance there was some support for the suggestion emphasized by unite d states speaker that the possibilities of reunification would be greatly enhanced if they could be thought out in terms of some larger perhaps global settle ment british speaker raised the question as to whether this global settlement might have as one of its elements the possibility of mutual disengagement of the opposing forces in europe this would have to include not only th liberation of the soviet zone of germany but also the genera l detachment of the satellite countries from their present depe ndence on the soviet secured by free elections before it could b accepted by the west german speaker and indeed almost ev ery german speaker on this question emphasized the need of reunification and the fact that peace in europe could not be achie ved without it he gave very st rong assurances to his partner s in the western alliance that whatever would be done by germany w ould be done not merely in consultation but in agreement he stressed again the importance of the time element and the problem which arose from the need to blend patience with initiative whilst satisfying an impatient public opinion finally he made it clear that the question of reunification was based on the assumption that price could be found which the russians might be willing to accept at some point in the future and under som conditions so that reunification would become possibility he underlined the very important fact that bonn would take ste p to recognize the east german government and that the presen t german government would not take any action which would amount to giving up the paris agreements and the arrangements made with nato the implication that western germanys connection with nato could be used as ca rd for bargaining purposes caused some cern but the speaker cleared up this point by giving further assurances that it was certainly not the intention of bonn to sever the nato connection french speaker threw in to relief the relation of european integration to the problem of german reunification and another german speaker stated his conviction that the greatest matter of interest to the soviet union would be some effective security arrangement since he agreed with earlier speakers that there wa s genuine fear in the soviet union of capitalist encirclement which was constant topic of conversation in moscow the significance of the discussion however lay in the fact that there were very clear areas of disagreement while some were im plied and some perhaps not wholly cleared up all speakers had shown their awareness of the urgent n eed to achieve the reunification of germ any on terms which would not endanger the freedom of the western world v european unity the discussion affirmed complete support for the idea of integra tion and unification from the representatives of all the six nations of the coal and steel community present at the conferen ce there was an assurance that the failure of the edc while perhaps interrupting the momentum of the movement towards in tegration had by means stopped it and an expression of determination to carry out integration as representing the best means of assuring peace and permanent prosperity for europe and the world there were differing views as to the steps which s hould be taken and the forms through which integration should be achieved and some expression by certain european participants of the view that in the economic field it might be better to proceed through the development of common market by treaty rather than by the cr eation of new high authorities which would exercise jurisdiction over specific economic sectors on the other hand some speakers took the other view indicating that the creation of some form of high authority wa s essential to achieve common market european speaker expressed concern about the need to achie ve common currency and indicated that in his view this necessarily implied the creation of centr political authority participant speak ing as german industrialist said that having fought for integration before german indus try was still determined to pursue the same purpose but he expr essed considerable doubt as to the functional approach to integration by moving fr om one economic sector to another in his view the common problems of differences in labour standard s and currencies and the various elements entering into the common market must be brought nearer to parity as condition of further progress another speaker urged that the various stat which were to constitute the future eu rope should henceforth encourage by all possible means the setting up of medium sized european societies where individuals of different nations could pool their ideas work together and learn from their mistak from the general discussion on this s ubject it was evident that there was linge ring anxiety in some quarters as to the possible german attitude in the next generation or in so many years there were also econom ic reasons behind this anxiety the prosperity of today could not be counted upon to continue indefinitely and without crises the position of 50 million people in germany in the world market must therefore be considered the united states had high tariffs the commonwealth had preferential rights l union francaise had the same thing and there was japanese competition stimulated by lower social conditions thus it was necessary to bring the german people into common eu ropean market as quickly as possible and it was here that the great danger of the future lay if there were united europe german speakers pointed out that there was large communist party in western germany and extreme right wing these things had been eliminated not by police measures but by th vote there was far less nationalism in the schools and universiti than ever before germans were certainly aw are of the fact that they could not even preserve the freedom of western germany without the assistance and cooperation of the western powers and would therefore voluntarily join ny alliance or organization of the west designed to strengthen the freedom of western germany nd which at the same time held out the hope of extending that freedom to the whole of germany united states participant confirmed that the united states had not weakened in its enthusiastic support for the idea of integration although there was considerable diffidence in america as to how this enthusiasm should be manifested another united states participant urged his european friends to go ahead with the unification of europe with less emphasis upon ideological considerations and above ll to be practical and work fast throughout the discussion there was considerable emphasis on atom ic energy as forming perhaps the most hopeful area in which integration could proceed the point being made that the peaceful industrial development of atomic energy requires resources of manpower scientific know how and materials which may be beyond the resources of the individual european countries while united kingdom speaker had expressed the inclina tion of britain not to particip ate in general integration h suggested that the british too might be w illing to see some form of division of effo rt in the area of atomic research one of the reasons for the application of the principle of unification and inte gration to atomic energy was th fact that in the atomic fi eld there were not the same vested interests that affect attempts to integrate other economic activities vi the industrial aspects of atomic energy this subject was introduced by united states rapporteur on the basis of paper previously circulated the speaker discussed the matter of sources of ener gy and the methods by which they are utilized for the generation of electric power and other energy requirements recalling that the progress of the human race had been largely dependent upon the utilization of energy the great conventional sources of energy upon which modern civili zation was dependent were not evenly distributed throughout the world in accord ance with the distribution of populations and their use was greater in industrially highly developed countries than in th underdeveloped countries nor were th resources of conventional fuel inexhaustible on the other hand requirements particularly of electric power were expanding at rate which was doubling itself every ten years hydraulic resources in europe would ll be fully developed in few years conventional sources of fuel were having to be supplemented by shipments oi fuel from other parts of th world and power plants which had been using solid fuels were being converted back to the use of liquid fuels the problem was how to develop the use of the new type of fuel with its vastly superior potential of energy in way that would make it competitive and economic and how it could be fitted into the economy not only of developed c ountry but of an underdeveloped one the speaker discussed various types of reactor and the four main channels of deve lopment which had to be kept in focus first there was the technical and engineering accomplishment by which energy was released and tran sformed into electric or other power secondly there was the commercial and economic aspect by which the engineering achievement was accomplished on sound economic basis thirdly the legal and governmental asp ects covering such problems as liability health and safety security and intergovernmental relations and fourthly came the management of the overall accomplishment the extent to which the government moves forward and the extent to which priv ate capital moves into the fiel d in the united states the atomic energy commission had recently accepted an offer by pr ivate industry to organize nonprofit maki ng corporation to finance and construct own and operate fast neutr on breeder reactor under licence from the com mission this corporation would be dedicated to resear ch and development in the use of nuclear fuels and the results made known to the commission and to others as directed by the commission discussion brought out the heavy developmen tal expense that went into what might be called the first generation of reactors and probably into the second economic success had to be looked for in subsequent generations economic reactors at this stage were likely to be large reactors and therefore those countries which were the mo st highly developed woul d benefit from atomic energy earliest and to the greatest extent transmission lines c ould however be used to brin g about better balance between sources of energy and the areas of its u tilization the matter of educated and expe rienced manpower was extremely important and in the usa during the next ten ye ars it would probably be necessary for 10000 or 20000 new people to be educated and given experience during the next ten or fifteen years it was be lieved that the answer would be found to the problem of the economic production of atomic energy and that development would come more quickly than might be thought because every where the human mind was being focused on it united states speaker emphasized the influence of energy on productivity or output per man hour in 1948 the output per man hour in the usa was about twoand ahalf times that of europe and the am ount of nonhuman energy available to the industrial worker of europe was 40 per cent of that behind the work er in the usa the european nations should therefore tak every step necessary to dvance as rapidly in the use of this spectacular form of nonhuman energy as the united states here nd now was the specific opportunity for the european nations to pool their resources if nationalism wrere allowed to creep into this situation and each country were to work on its own europe w ould lag far behind the united states if on the other hand it wo uld pool its brain power and resources it could over the next fifty years write history entirely different from the history of europe during the past half century europe must not only work toge ther but must not fail to put nonhuman energy behind human energy the implications of the use of at omic energy in the development of the underd eveloped areas were discussed particular ly where other fuel sources were inaccessible but where atomic fu might provide an economic source of energy because the transport element of cost was insignificant this was felt to be matter of the economics of each case it might be justifiabl to use conventional fuels transporting them to the point of utilization rather than to use atomic fuels to the cost of atomic f uel must be added other expenses such as the rem oval of the byproducts and reprocessing wh ich would render it less economic than the conventional sources of energy in the u tilization of electric energy moreover fa r greater investment in its utilization is needed than in its production netherlands speaker voiced what was clearly strong current of opinion when he urged the n eed to initiate international european action without delay two basic ements had evolved from the problem before the group firstly that the future of th human race was bound up with the development of nuclear energy and secondly the high cost of research development and installation together with the necessary tr aining of numerous specialists in any eur opean country this cost would be infinite ly greater per head than in the ited states with its much larger population nor would the manpower be available for training t he larger number of technicians needed the only attitude which europe with all her native genius could profitably adopt was to pool her resources and to join together to produce results in field where there had not yet arisen the vested interests which made cooperative schemes far more difficult to put into practice wh at may be possible now in the way of launching european co operation in the development of atomic energy might be much more difficult if not impossible in three four or five years fr om now vii economic problems the political aspects of convertibility and the expansion of international trade the papers which had been circulated to the group on these two subjects which have certain bearing on each other were discussed together united states rapporteur defining conver tibility as state of affairs in which there is minimum of restriction on international trade believed that good deal of progress had b een made in that direction since the war but it was highly unl ikely that the world would ever return to the theoretical perfection of the gold sta ndard because the experience of the 1930s showed us that in period of declining income the free flow of tr ade could accentuate unemployment therefore convertibility was politically acceptable only in terms of prospe rity and growth the increase in trade nd prosperity both in europe and the unit ed states however was due in small part to the steps which had been taken to reduce restrictions on trade and the dollar gap had become manageable problem inflation seemed to be the prin cipal economic problem which coul d interfere with convertibility in the light of the existing prosperity it would be serious mistake not to do everything possible to further the removal of restrictions on the free flow of goods and capital the speaker then dealt with the related pr oblem of investment in under developed countries where the pres ent annual rate of 3 billion generated an increas of about 1 to 15 per cent per year in th standard of living this was clearly not enough to satisfy growing political needs and ambitions there was room for both governmental and private capital the first to develop ports roads and utilities the second in the field of raw material sou rces and industry both our moral responsibility and our selfinterest were involved and at time when political tensions had been redu ced we should increasingly turn to investment in these countries french rapporteur stressed the importance of not dramatiz ing the economic problems with which the western world was now faced these were normal problems and we could only lose by gi ving them the kind of moral undertone which they should not have thus recent american decisions regarding the tender for equipment for the chief joseph dam the tariffs on watches and bicycles and the recent warning to countries to cut their imports in oil might be unfortunate but should not become moral issues on the european side we could not have clear consci ence in the field of protection and many european countries maintained restrictions which were not ju stified by balance of payments considera tions our american friends had to bear pressures from groups of interests which were ve ry much the same on both sides of the atlantic on the other hand the united states had put into force reducti on of tariffs on japanese goods which was vital thing for the equilibrium of the whole free world this was particularly courage ous action since it had resulted in flood of cheap japane textiles the speaker entered plea for more understanding on the part of european countries visavis japan and felt that the decision of several european countries not to give japan the benefit of the mostf avoured nation clause was mistake which invited japan not only to look for other ma rkets but possibly also for other political connections it was important also not t dramatize british economic difficulties thes were serious enough but probably not more than normal swing on the payments cycle the british government was dealing with its present diff iculties without resorting to new trade restrictions which was important for the whole free world and esp ecially for other european countries british speaker dealing with currency and convertibility believed that convertibility had been very greatly overdramatized in the long run trade and finance went hand in hand and there could not be expansion of one w ithout expansion of the other bu t in the short run they could be alternatives and could come into conflict where large volume of trade came into conflict with currency arrangements he would prefer to have trade maintained rath er than the currency arrangements maintained economic considerations were now at the centre of the politics of every country and it would not be poss ible to recreate the conditions of the world when it was an economic unit theref ore he urged that we should not attempt to recreate hard orthodoxy in currency matters of which the word convertibility d become current symbol in shifting complex world we needed to seek flexibility in our arrangements united states participant reviewed the broad field of econo mic affairs in his country since the group met at barbizon during that six months the economists he believed had not caused much trouble for the diplomatists and the economies of the western world had been strong the corrosive pessimism whic h for so many years had hung over the west and its economics was receding more and more success was validating the claim th at economic systems driven increasingly by the accumulated decisions of individuals and businesses could achieve selfregenerative economic activity at high and acceptable levels to populations we have had to consider what were the realistic levels of employment and unemplo yment in the full employment doctrine and to think again about the adequacy of monetary and credit controls of general type and of subsidiary selective types as they had been evolved in our various countries fo r dealing with fully employed economies there was greater contribution that the united states could make to the economic strength of the free wo rld for the period ahead than to achieve sustainable relativ stability the american economic system was now fully engaged there were few evidences of w eaknesses in it largely in the area of deterioration in the quality of cr edit here and there in the field of construc tion and consumer credit certain actions had be taken with productive results in the first area in the s econd where the government was not now in possession of specific weapons to deal with the problem public attention not only of bankers investment companies and finance companies but of citizens themselves had been focused upon it there was every pros pect in the united states of continuing to achieve reasonably steady growth in real income widely distributed among the popul ation with considerable degr ee of stability in price averages as regards the long run he thought that president eisenhowers expectation of oct ober 1954 of 500 billion economy within ten years at stable prices now seemed to be somewhat on the modest side the problem for america now seemed to be shortage rather than surp lus of labour the value of goods and services imported into the united states in 1954 was more than 60 per cent above the 19479 level and in 1955 it was still higher the overall supply of dollars to foreign countries from imports of goods and services capital exp orts remittances and us government transactions had been running at 20 billion for several years for the last six years the sup ply had exceeded the expenditure of dollars by foreign countri permitting them to build up dollar and gold assets by n billion continuing united states expenditure abroad the growing activ ity of the economy providing rising demand for foreign goods and services and growing capital exports gave the prospect of dollars being available as basis for continued growth of trade there had been largescale redistribution of the build up of united states gold resources accumulated in the 1930s and during and immediately after the war large part of this redi stribution of reserves had gone to western europe and would serve its purpose better if its growth led to action to reduce di scriminating trade restrictions because of this redistributio n the united states had to look more frequently at its own figures for example at the end of 1954 united states gold holdings stood at 218 billion at that time the amount of gold cover requi red by law against federal rese rve notes and deposits was n8 billion that left the united states with free gold socalled in an amount about equal to 10 billion shortterm us bankin g liabilities to foreign countries stood at 11 2 billion while us shortterm banking claims on foreign countries stood at 1 4 billion roughly speaking the difference be tween these two figures was about the same as the value of the us free gold during the five years ending with 1954 gold and shortterm do llar holdings of foreign countries of the free world had increased by about 96 billion of which about 8 billion was derived fr om gold and dollar transactions of these countries with the united states and about 16 billion from other sources principally new gold production thus th policies which the united states had pursued had to substantial degree resulted in re distributing gold and dollar reserv in the direction of americas friends the speaker then reviewed the extent to which the presid ents policy announced in march 1954 had been implemented there was the trade agreements extension act of 1954 which had extend ed the old law for one year the united states had undertaken the negotiations with japan and their results were put into effect on 10 september in the face of considerable protest from cer tain sectors of american industry in those negotiations the usa d been joined by some but not all of its friends the genera l agreement on tariffs and trade had been revised and improved and it was hoped that after vere struggle congress would approve the organization for trade goopera tion although the action of fourteen nations in invoking article 35 of gatt against the japanese would make this more difficult the customs simplif ication acts of 1953 and 1954 were already proving useful to foreign suppliers of the american market and the bureau of the customs had proceeded to make significant reforms in its operation there had been two revisions of the tax laws designed to stimulate private capital investment abroad and action by t he board of governors of the federal reserve system modifying the regulations relating to banking organizations authorized to do foreign banking business an executive order establishing unif orm procedures and regulations under the buy american act had been put into effect and the percentages pplicable to the differentials sharply cut while there had been great deal of atte ntion paid to the action taken regarding the generators for the chief joseph dam in the west there had not been much publicity given to the contracts that had gone to foreign suppliers because of the reduction from 25 per cent to 6 and 10 per cent in the discrimination in favour of american companies the president had set up council on foreign economic policy the trade agreement act of 1955 had been passed by congress this year giving the longest extension since 1948 nd negotiations were now under way for new round of tariff reductions early next year technical cooperation programmes had been advanced the intern ational finance corporation approved and the philippine trade treaty renegotiated it was perhaps believed that nation capable of conceiving and executing the marshall plan could conceive and execute trade policy which would somehow be able to avoid every specific case of domestic selfinterest which arose in fact the general reco rd of the socalled escape clause under which the bicycle action had been taken was not bad one when the bicycle case came to the white house from the tariff commission four out of five of the sitting commissioners had found that within the meaning of the law injury had been done to american industry after very careful consideration of the case the president modified severel the remedy recommended by the commission six years ago eur ope was sending 1500020000 bicycle units year to the usa last year they sent nearly million and it could be expected that sale s would continue on that leve l and better in the futur the action taken was not restrictive import control but at the most checking of the rate at wh ich the market was being entere d as to the psychological aspects of this ma tter the speaker believed that with the possible exception of the canadian market there was more stable market market which europeans could enter with greater assurance than the american there would always be the risk of infrequent cases like the bicycle case wh the market was penetrated at rate to bring into operation section 7 of the united states law but this should not disrupt european plans for earning dollars on the american market the decision with respect to the chief joseph dam had been cl ose one and rested on an excep tion in the presidents executive order regarding an instance where the american product was pr oduced in labour surplus area the executive order was not limited purely to the question whether the area had 6 per cent unemployment rate or not such decisions involving the buy american act were taken only when absolutely necessary the oil import problem was also controversial the committee on fuel resources had recommended in order adequately to spur domestic development that it was necessary to have polic for the sharing of the market this was now in the process of discussion and it had been hoped that it would be possible to main tain flexible situation in the industry itself to deal with the problem steel scrap had pr ovided another problem recently and the rate at wh ich scrap was being sucked out of the american market had led to request by domestic industry to limit shipments out of the country so far the government had declined to t ake action but it was important to realize that the matter had reached stage of serious discussion in all these matters the uni ted states would seek the maximum consultation with her friends abroad in the discussion arising from the foregoing survey european participant expressed the view that although there had indeed been redistribution of reserves the re serves of european countries were s till dangerously small some people were therefore afraid that after period of dramatic change the united states might adopt business as usual attitude towards these matters the united states had passed the displaced persons act and the ref ugees act and thus corrected to some extent the restrictive immigration quota but this had been done by exceptional acts rrounded by exceptional conditions and provisos they were an important contribution in the right directi on but grudging recognition of immediate need s rather than change of policy bot h europe and the usa were in dangerous position not only milita rily but from an economic point of view and could at given moment be facing hostile world there was still an unbalance between europe and the usa and further large and rapid correction of the unbalance seem ed absolutely necessary canadian speaker referred to the appro ach to common market and in welcoming it felt some concern as to what kind offences might be put round it it was to be hoped that as the m ovement towards common market in europe gathered strength i t would be the preoccupation of everybody that it should not perpet uate or increase protectionist and restrictionist measures ag ainst trade with other parts of the world but that emphasis should be exclusively on freeing trade within the countries of europe netherlands participant agreed that any increased protectionist tendency would be most undesirable and was certainly not the intention of the europeans in support of this there was the be nelux example where it was agreed that the average tariffs for t he outside world protecting the be nelux countries jointly were never allowed to be higher on an average than existing tariffs d been in holland and belgium that had led to belgian tariffs be ing decreased in some cases some in holland had been increased but the result for the outside world was that they remained the same or were lower for the six countries it would probably be carried out in the same way there was some discussion on point raised by german speak er regarding invisible trade which seemed to be becoming more important between centres of economic gravity like the usa and europe it might be that measures such as raising the tourist allowance for free entry of goods might be more effectiv than concentrating on the difficult problem of reducing tarif fs united states speaker explained that this had been part of the presidents programme of march 1954 but had languished in the face of opposition from certain sections of industry which feared th at considerable amounts of some commodities might be brought in on an organized basis it remained however part of the programme and it might be possible to get it agreed in summing up the discussions on the subject of convertibility eu ropean participant felt that whereas the problem of trade had been discussed at great length and with little or disagreement convertibility d been buried little too quickly when we used to talk about convertibility we talked about trade liberalization and the impression shoul d not be allowed to gain weight that this objective had been given up full employment should be maintained and trade developed as fast as possible but besides full employment and trade there was productivity vitally important factor for the world and there was other way of increasing productivity in the kind of world in which we lived except through producers meeting competition convertibility was precisely the way of enlarging the area of competiti on and of bringing pr ogressively american competition to bear on european producers we did not want to do this in such conditions that it would br ing about unemployment and trade restrictions but we should move towards nondiscrimination visavis the usa in manner which would not endanger the results achieved it was possible that contradiction would develop between the movement towards european market and movement towards convertibility if common market were created with moderate tariff american goods might be still more difficult to get int that market than they were be fore because producers within the community would benefit from th preference which would exist therefore the movement towards common market should pr oceed under the conditions of as low tariff as possible visavis the outside world customs union complete in certain number of years and simultaneous movement towards multilateral system covering the free world by the progressive reduction of tariffs on ce resistance to the creation of common market in europe h ad been overcome we should be in strong position to overcome the resistance to reduction of tariffs visavis the outside world and should be very close to convertibility eastwest trade on this subject there was general agreemen t as to the difficult and seemingly small re turns of trade with the soviet bloc and particularly with china there was little disagreement among the western powers regard ing strategic items the fact that 90 to 95 per cent of trade between the free world countries amounting to some 152 billion in 1954 was clearly in the nonstrategic ar ea at time when military defence programmes required large shipme nts of strategical material within the western alliance showed that the bulk of trade was free in so far as strategic controls were concerned behind the vague generalities about increasing trade therefore it was apparent that the soviet government was really interested in the strategic items and in getting the strategic list cut down it seemed probable also that the communist countries might be hoping to obtain industrial equipment on credit basis from the west we should have illusions that there is much to gain and we should certainly not wish to become dependent on eastern trade the orientation of the export trade of the western countries had built up system which made it of little interest even to purely economic interests to undertake the more complicated quasibar ter eastern trade nor should we seriously think that we could make the eastern world dependent upon us british speaker said that the peking government had tried to canalize trade with china through organizations that were really intended for communist propaganda when commercial organizati ons insisted on avoiding this arrangement they obtained the consent of the peking government to communicate with them di rect and arrange for missions to go to china the chinese government would only give facilities for large parties and not to individuals who wished to go to china to tr ansact trade when large parties of businessmen arrived in china the first offers made were for goods on the embargo list in order to induce firms in the united kingdom to press for the removal of th items from the list and the chinese would allege that others were not as strict as the united kingdom in enforci ng the embargo list agreements were made to appear very important and received much publicity but in fact they generally had escape clauses and often came to nothing in which case there was publicity the impression was that the chinese could not pay for imports from the west their traditional exports went largely to the soviet union and the satellites when the ch inese have offered exports to pa rties of businessmen in china these have been for tungsten bristles and other traditional chinese exports above the world market prices if united kingdom firm saw the possibility of making purchases in china and communicated with chinese organization and if the chinese could not provide the goods even though they were trad itional chinese exports they did not answer the letters since they did not wish to say that they had not got the goods th trade outlook in the foreseeable future was therefore poor the soviet union and her european satellites again gave the impr ession that they could not find sufficient exports to pay for imports other than raw materials such as rubber and tin which they needed the soviet and sa tellites preferred large parties f businessmen because of the propaganda value but would give visas to individuals representing single firms the soviet union also tried to make advantageous offers for goods believed to be on the embargo list at times to create demand for the relaxation of the list the speaker did not be lieve that there was much money to be made out of trade with china or the soviet union and her european satellites while th ere were some political and psychological advantages in enco uraging commercial exchanges with these countries there could be dangerous rela xation of the embargo list and large credits were not to be recommended united states speaker discussed the attractions of an offer to germany or even to other nations to participate in the industrialization of china through increased trade the soviets want ed to relax tensions so as to complete what they had to do at home and in china they needed economic assistance to do it more rapidly and they had to help with the industrialization of china if the cold war was not over but only entering new phase or taking on new aspect the real nature of which was not ye t clear we should not be willing to relieve an acknowledged adve rsary of his economic problems to increase his potential milita ry resources or to help him to assist an aggr essively disposed partner in the far east german participants expressed agreement with these views and did not wish to ch ange their attitude towards their western friends believing that if they did it w ould mean the enslavement of germany when the conference ended on the evening of 25 september it was evident that there had been very valuable exchange of views on some of the most important problems with which the l eadership of the western world is now faced the discussions which took place during the three days of the conference were remarkable for the measur of agreement expressed this was of particular value in the case of german reunification and the unity of europe disagreement was as rule largely matter of emphasis it was clear that participants would be able to retu rn to their various countries enriched by closer knowledge and understanding of the views difficulties and hopes of so many leading personalities of countries other than their own and so b etter equipped to deal with their mutual problem s participants in this conference may in the light of the consensus of opinion expressed during the discussions and to some extent summarized in this document be able to pass these views on to public opinion in their own spheres of influe nce without disclosing their source press release an unofficial conference has been held at garmischpartenkirchen from 23 to 25 september under the chairmanship of hrh prince bernhard of the netherlands previous meetings of the same so rt took place at bilderberg netherlands and barbizon france about ninety participants were present fr om various countries of europe and from the united states and canada all attending as private individuals in an atmosphere of friendly frankness made possible by the informal nature of the gathering they discussed current problems of interest to free nations the objective was to promote by free discussion closer unders tanding between individuals whose countries share deep desire for peace and for human freedom it was not the purpose to reach decisions or to establish policy many topics were considered such as the problem of europ ean integration to be achieved through the creation of common market and by other means the problem of german unification problems of eastwest trade of the expansion of international trade in general and of convertibility of cu rrencies and the problem of atomic energy as factor in peaceful industry inclu ding pooling of resources for atomic research and development the conference proceeded on the assumption that steady unity of purpose is now more vital than ever to the preservation of peace and the defence of freedom
