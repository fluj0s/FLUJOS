and d 1 u this is xxxxx reporting cable 2 s summary xxxxx met with local leader sheikh xxxxx during our lengthy discussions the sheikh shared his belief that the usg has poorly utilized its influence in iraq leaving the way open for iran to advance its agenda at usg expense he went on to describe iranian government attempts to buy his influence on recent trip he made to iran end summary new twist on what happens in vegas stays in vegas8 3 s sheikh xxxxx on january 13 to discuss his recent trip to iran he told the xxxxx that he has been courted by iranian officials in an effort to garner more support and influence among wellplaced iraqis in the middle euphrates area he noted that the handler8 for the tribal leaders in this area is xxxxx who has long family ties locally 4 s the public reason for xxxxx trip to tehran was for medical checkup he privately told xxxxx that his trip was more for pleasure than medical treatment and included one or more shortterm marriages8 ie with statesanctioned prostitutes and other entertainment xxxxx shared that other unnamed tribal leaders had enjoyed similar privileges while guests of the iranian regime recently dashed expectations 5 s the sheikh suggested that some iraqi figures are more susceptible to iranian influence because of disillusionment with the united states during the meeting with xxxxx asked repeatedly why have the americans let us down8 after he and other tribal sheikhs visited the white house and met thenpresident bush in 2008 he expected to benefit financially from the americans instead he suggested that the americans did nothing for him even after he reported on iranian activities in muthanna ref the united states did not secure their friends the sheikhs financially and has left them vulnerable to iranian temptations8 6 s xxxxx also complained that while tribal leaders in fairly stable areas used their influence to help minimize insurgent activities over the past several years they have received nothing for their efforts cooperative sheikhs in insurgent hotbeds like anbar in contrast received benefits from the americans xxxxx cited abu risha as an example noting he received money projects and other perquisites for his cooperation he finished by noting that several of the white houseinvited tribal leaders have been quietly grumbling he states that he has had conversations on this perceived inequity with parliamentarian xxxxx from diwaniyah 7 s additionally xxxxx was frustrated with the current regime in baghdad he stated that the united states support of the maliki government has only increased irans influence in iraq enabling operatives to influence political decisions and diminish national sovereignty the iraqi government has not made progress in fighting poverty it has failed to provide essential services and it is full of corruption he asked if the united states is supporting iran why because you have american troops on the ground but you are advancing iranian interests without costing them anything8 comment 8 s prt comment southern iraqi sheikhs are well known q8 s prt comment southern iraqi sheikhs are well known for shifting their loyalties based on financial considerations pm malikis isnadtribal support councils are particularly noteworthy in this regard susceptible sheikhs will trade their influence for financial support especially if the sheikh is not independently wealthy note xxxxx and does not independently enjoy large bankroll end note in turn the sheikh can mobilize supporters when needed eg ref b the influence however is rented and not bought if the financial contributions suddenly stop much of the support may also cease xxxxx considers this true for iranian influence in the region as well if iran continues to pay for support among influential sheikhs the islamic republic will likely increase its influence if and when the money dries up so will the cooperation among these rented sheikhs end comment hill
