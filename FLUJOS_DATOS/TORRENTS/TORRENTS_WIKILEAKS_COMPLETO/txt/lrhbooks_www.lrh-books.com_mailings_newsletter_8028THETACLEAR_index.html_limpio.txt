lrh congress newsletter apr 16 2008 the only aberration is denial of self now where wherever wherever man wherever man finds himself deeply instilled and engrossed and surrounded with mystery he is actually in conflict with himself and himself alone that is why processing works the only aberration is denial of self nobody else can do anything to you but you thats horrible state of affairs you can do something to you but it requires your postulate your agreement or your disagreement before anything could happen to you people have to agree to be ill they have to agree to be stupid they have to agree to be in mystery and actually early on the track did agree to being hornswoggled excerpted from the theta clear congress lecture how does one postulate into existence his own condition an article by l ron hubbard from the theta clear congress lectures now people then are the victims of their own flinch the victims of their own postulates the victims of their own belief that they are inadequate processing wouldnt work if this werent true if you believe this thing needs proof its very remarkable thing that you could take one individual all by himself and straighten him out although the mystic will tell you that you have to straighten out the whole universe before you can be straightened out thats not true at all you would simply be to be technical lousedup on the second third fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth dynamics but you could be straightened out even on those dynamics without recourse to those dynamics and the reason for that is simply this that an individual has to postulate into existence his own aberration his own flinch his own stupidity his own inadequacy his own lack of confidence and his own bad luck these things are selfevident when you process an individual you can change his position on the tone scale you can change his position on any profile graph test reaction meter you can change his basic health and so forth well you couldnt do any of these things at all if somebody else was interfering it is the feeling that somebody else has interfered that is the most deadly postulate that somebody else is making it so brings about the feeling that one is not responsible for ones own condition and we get shame blame and regret other things of that character how did an individual feel in the first place that something could be done to his own postulates or that he could be moved in on by somebody else he had to consent to it he had to consent to his postulates being wrong he had to consent to the fact that somebody could mix up his own postulates that he had to consent to he had to say well well somebody can mix up postulate somebody else can keep it from arriving he had to say that well theres very interesting mechanisms on the backtrack very very interesting very intricate by which he then says i can longer make postulate in that direction well he had to say that somebody else had right to mess up his postulates he had to say that somebody else could interfere with what he wanted to have happen and the trick is these too are ones own postulates fascinating isnt it l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture survive and succumb this lecture is available in the theta clear congress lectures success from listening to the congresses lrh just put my hat firmly on as thetan now i know exactly what i do as being and my relationship to others isnt that fantastic thing to be able to say after only the first 10 minutes of this lecture i had to walk into store for moment i was so keyed out from the lecture it felt as if my whole body were 50 lbs lighter and almost lifting off the ground i also spotted areas of introversion i didnt even know i had and blew them after listening to the rest of the lecture i find now that i am extremely keyed out and calm there is something special about knowing exactly what you do but also and perhaps more importantly how you fit in to the rest of the world out there its incredibly powerful and something everyone should know honestly i dont know how i have made it this far in life without this datahe the only aberration is denial of self how does one postulate into
