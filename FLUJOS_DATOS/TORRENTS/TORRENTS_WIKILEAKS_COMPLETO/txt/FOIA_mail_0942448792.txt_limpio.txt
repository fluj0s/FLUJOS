from mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk to wigley subject magiccscengen date fri nov 12 181952 1999 cc srapermsalmonmhulmebarrow tom sorry i couldnt say goodbye i was actually on the phone to bo lim at the time i also wanted to ask you about your views on the uk national climate change centre but this can wait until later anyway about magiccscengen workbook i think we agreed the following things for this undp version select number of emissions scenarios is92 sres98 550 and 750 stabilisation cases some kyoto variants perhaps from is92aed reference and 12 others you may recommend i would be keen to use your gas files if thats ok even though i have some of my own you may have done the so2 into regions which i havent could you send selection you would think about how to handle the ch4 adjustment to ensure sar replicability across the emissions scenarios this may require tweak in the magicc code which mike will have to recompile we should aim to reproduce the sar results as closely as possible in this version eg use 637wm2 rather than 55 and not use prathers methane concentrations an annex in the workbook will explain this the variable upwelling rate will be hardwired choices will remain for the dn80s climate sensitivity and aerosol forcing scengen will have the new ddc patterns included and we will switch off the buttons for the older 2xco2 patterns scengen will output values over land and ocean the help screens will need updating i will attempt this and then check them all with you to make sure you agree the only problem i can forsee is that the 232 version that mike and you produced in the summer corrected the aerosol calculations and also used prathers methane concentrations if we now want version with correct aerosol concentrations and ipcc sar chapter 6 ch4 concentrations plus ch4 tweak to handle the ad hoc adjustment then mike salmon will need new and unique fortran version of magicc am i right i have agreed with bo lim to get first draft of the workbook by 17 december but the final version and all the cds will not be agreed until february 2000 have i missed anything regards mike
