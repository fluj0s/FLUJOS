denniston wednesday november 25th 2009 606 pm print this post commentary eleven days after the supreme court in 2008 established constitutional right for guantanamo bay detainees to challenge their captivity in us courts the justices told the lawyer for an afghan prisoner to go ahead with such plea in an appropriate district court the attorney for abdul hamid salam alghizzawi did so but now exactly 17 months later alghizzawi still awaits district court hearing although he apparently has been cleared for release from guantanamo the justices are now scheduled to consider next friday what if anything to do about his case alghizzawi is represented by one of the feistiest of the volunteer lawyers who represent guantanamo captives chicago attorney h candace gorman whatever else she has done over the past few years she has been fervent even unrelenting advocate for this afghan shopkeeper who has now been held prisoner for more than eight years while she awaits word from the supreme court on her second original habeas plea filed there seeking hearing on his challenge her clients alreadybizarre case has grown even more so on wednesday federal district judge issued an order requiring gorman to remove from her website an article in which she claimed she had been muzzled from publicly discussing his case district judge john d bates twopage order issued at the justice departments request is here if one checks gormans website actually it is the guantanamo blog the article titled the muzzle is back on dated last saturday is longer displayed neither is one she posted four days earlier the muzzle is off both articles however are cached on the internet fact that judge bates said made difference attorney gorman the bates order said is bound by protective orders that govern all guantanamo habeas cases in district court whether or not any information shielded from public disclosure by those orders is actually available on the internet it is important to note however that what is involved is not information that is officially classified that is protected by federal laws governing national security information for the guantanamo cases the district judges have created at government request an entirely separate category protected information it is material that the government considers sensitive but does not treat as formally secret it is unclear at this point just what the protected or unprotected status of alghizzawis nowpending document in the supreme court has it is called an original habeas petition called original because it was filed directly in the supreme court not on appeal from any lower court action or order and is being treated by the court as such pleadings always are the court for example has yet to decide whether to ask the justice department to respond to it an issue that presumably the justices will consider next week gorman originally filed this petition under seal on oct 2 the case is in re alghizzawi 097290 at that time it had not been cleared for public release on nov 16 gorman received from government security officers copy of the petition with every page stamped unclassified for public release gorman then made it available to those interested in it the next day she wrote the post on her blog titled the muzzle is off then on nov 21 she posted on her blog the article titled the muzzle is back on saying that she had been told by government lawyer that the clearance of the petition had been mistake since it contained information in the protected category since then what has unfolded in judge bates court is not entirely clear since most of the documents that were filed about the protected information dispute remain under seal so far all that has become publicly available is the judges order of wednesday and brief that gorman had filed on the issue also on wednesday that document is here among other points gorman made in that filing she questioned judge bates authority to issue an order related to her filings in the supreme court she said she was unsure about that and hoped that the government would explain how district court could provide remedy to an issue that occurred in supreme court filing in his order apparently issued later wednesday the judge mentioned gormans point about the alleged lack of jurisdiction but he did not respond to it instead he focused on his conclusion that gorman was bound by the various protective orders in this case despite its apparent inadvertent disclosure the disputed information remains protected material the order added besides ordering gorman to take down the muzzle is back on posting the judge ordered her not to disclose any protected information he ordered both sides to file additional legal memos by dec 7 it is unclear whether those too will remain sealed or become publicly available note to readers this blog has copy of the original habeas petition that is now pending in the supreme court but is not linking to it at this time since its legal status is not yet clear the court on nov 2 agreed to allow the petition to be filed under seal and there has been apparent change in that judge bates clearly does consider that document to contain information in the special protected category comments comments yet sorry the comment form is closed at this time links open new windows search for coverage of all merits
