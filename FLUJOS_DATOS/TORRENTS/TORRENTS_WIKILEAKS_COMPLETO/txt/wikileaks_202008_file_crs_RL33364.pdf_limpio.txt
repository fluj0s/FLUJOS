premiums unless they qualify for lowincome assistance beneficiaries who participate in medicare part b supplementary medical insurance or part d prescription drugs must pay m onthly premiums to receive coverage part b participants have premiums automatically deducted from their social security benefit checks starting in 2007 higherincome part b beneficiaries must pay higher part b premiums an estimated 5 of part b beneficiaries must pay incomerelated premiums in 2008 part d participants may choose to have their premiums deducted from their social security checks the amount of part d premiums varies widely by pl an beneficiaries must also pay other outof pocket costs when they use part b and part d services medicare premiums are absorbing growing share of social security benefits to see the effect of growing premiums consider social security beneficiary who earned the average wage throughout his or her career called medium earner if this retiree chose to participate in part bas the vast majority of social security beneficiaries dothe standard part b premium would have absorbed about 5 of the retirees benefits in 1999 and about 8 in 2008 the proportion of benefits needed to pay the standard part b prem ium rose by almost 50 over the past decade the introduction of medicare part d adds to the premium expenses of beneficiaries who choose to participate it also substantially reduces their outofpocket prescription drug costs part d premiums vary widely among plans this report focuses on average premiums for standard coverage plans if medium earner chose to participate in both part b and part d about 11 of his or her social security benefits would be used for combined parts b and d premiums in 2008 medicares trustees project that premiums for parts b and d will grow at faster rate than social security benefits in the future thus consuming greater proportion of benefits over time by 2080 the medicare trustees project that as proportion of social security benefits premiums will more than double in 2080 medium earner is projected to need 15 of his or her benefits to pay the part b premium and 23 of his or her bene fits to pay combined parts b and d premiums the deduction of medicare premiums affects beneficiaries differently depending on their incomes and social security benefit amounts medicare premiums absorb greater fraction of lower earners social security benefits than of higher earners benefits because benefit amounts are progressive however some lowincome bene ficiaries are eligible for subsidies that cover their medicare premiums and other outofpocket costs other beneficiaries with low benefits may be protected by hold harmless provision that prevents beneficiarys social security check from declining because of increases in the standard part b premium finally it is important to note that although social security beneficiaries are affected by rising healthcare costs the benefits of participating in medicare are substantially greater than the costs this report will be updated as events warrant

medicare are large and important parts of americas safety net more than 40 million older and disabled individualsabout 1 in 7 americansare beneficiaries of both social security and medicare1 social security and medicare account for large amount of federal spending in 2007 spending on the two programs was over 1 trillion more than onethird of the federal budget and about 7 of gross domestic product gdp one measure of the size of the us economy 2 although social security and medicare both play important roles in the wellbeing of older and disabled americans the interactions between the two programs are rarely examined these interactions will become increasingly important as policymakers look for ways to slow the growth in spending on social security and medicare this report focuses on how medicare premiums affect social security beneficiaries medicare premiums are rising faster than social security benefits consequently consuming an increasing share of benefits over time rising medicare premiums could have large effect on social security beneficiaries particularly on those with low incomes and those who rely on social security as their primary source of income some beneficiaries will be able to pa for rising healthcare costs others may have limited resources for example among americans aged 65 and older about twothirds receive more than half of their income from social secu rity and more than onethird receive more than 90 of their income from social security these beneficiaries may see decline in their standard of living as their medicare premiums rise this report shows how the deduction of medicare part b and part d premiums affects social security beneficiaries 3 it describes how increases in social security benefits and medicare premiums are calculated under current law and explains the circumstances under which social security beneficiaries are held harmless for increases in the standard part b premium as well as the premium assistance available to lowincome beneficiaries it shows the growth in social security benefits and part b premiums in recent years and describes how rising part b premiums have affected social security beneficiaries comparing the effects of premium deductions on people with different levels of earnings it also provides estimates of social security benefits and medicare parts b and d premiums to 2080 using the social security and medicare trustees intermediate projections and describes how beneficiaries would be affected by projected medicare premium increases finally it outlines current legislation that would affect the relationship between social security benefits and medicare premiums 1 social security administration 2007 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal oldage

this report focuses on social security beneficiaries who pay medicare premiums however lowincome individuals including ma participants may qualify for lowincome subsidies which cover all or part of their part b and part d premiums 23 about one in five of medicare beneficiaries receive full part b subsidies to qualify for subsidies beneficiaries must have limited income and assets beneficiaries may qualify for full part b premium subsidies if they have incomes of less than 135 of poverty and assets of less than 4000 for an individual or 6000 for couple beneficiaries may qualify for full or partial part d premium subsidies if they have incomes of less than 150 of poverty and assets of less than 11990 for an individual and 23970 for couple in 2008 some beneficiaries who qualify for premium subsidies do not apply for them for example cms has estimated that more than onefourth of medicare beneficiaries roughly 11 million qualify for full part b subsidies24 in 2005 about twothirds of qualifying individuals 75 million received part b subsidies25 cms has also estimated that about third of medicare beneficiaries roughly 14 million qualify for full or partial part d subsidies in 2007 about 91 million beneficiaries received part d subsidies and an additional million lowincome beneficiaries receive comprehensive drug coverage for little or cost 26 however 33 million individuals eligible for subsidies had neither signed up for part d nor had coverage through another source 22 as of 2006 the majority 55 of ma participants total premiums were equal to the part b premium amount then 8850 per month about 42 of ma participants paid higher premiums and about 3 paid lower premiums on average ma participants total monthly premiums were about 26 more than the part b premium aarp

historically the growth in medicare part b premiums has greatly exceeded the growth in social security benefits over the past decade social securitys annual cola resulted in cumulative benefit increase of about 26 average worker benefits have increased by about 34 30 at the same time standard part b premiums have more than doubled from 4550 in 1999 to 9640 in 2008 by law all part b premiums are set as proportion of projected part b program costs part b costslike all healthcare costshave been rising dramatically this cost growth is driven by many factors including increasing life expect ancy new medical technology program expansion increases in the earnings of health professionals and other medical price growth which has been higher than overall inflation the cumulative growth in standard part b premiums has been dramatic but annual changes have been somewhat erratic during the past 10 years annual part b premium increases have ranged from 0 to more than 17 social security colas meanwhile have ranged from 13 to 41 figure 1 shows the annual rates of increase in medicare premiums and social security benefits from 1999 to 2008 27 people aged 65 and older who qualify for social security benefits and people of any age who receive disability benefits after twoyear waiting period are entitled to part and are also eligible to enroll in part b in private health insurance plan through part c andor in private prescription drug plan through part d 28 some beneficiaries do not pay medicare premiums either because they receive lowincome assistance or because they choose not to enroll in medicare part b or part d 29 42 usc 1840a1 part b premiums are also deducted from railroad retirement benefits 42 usc 1840b1 30 the cola increases the benefits paid to current beneficiaries in contrast average social security benefits those paid to new and current beneficiaries have risen at faster rate than the annual cola because the formula for calculating initial social security benefits is linked to wage growth whereas the cola is based on price growth generally wages rise faster than prices

are not sufficient to cover the standard part b premium increase31 if in given year the increase in the standard part b premium would cause beneficiarys social security check to be less than it was the year before the premium is reduced to ensure that the nominal amount of the individuals social security check stays the same 32 see the text box below for an example however high income individuals who must pay income related part b premiums are not subject to the hold harmless provision this means that for these highincome beneficiaries social security checks can be reduced from one year to the next as result of an increase in the part b premium ssa determines which beneficiaries will be held harmless each year in some cases beneficiary may be held harmless one year but not the next in other cases beneficiary will be held harmless entirely because his or her premium was reduced in previous year the cumulative effect of the hold harmless provision can produce substantial savings for individuals with low benefits beneficiary is not held harmless if the increase in his or her part d premium or the combined increase in part b and part d premiums causes his or her social security check to decline in other words persons social security check may decrease from one year to the next as result of part d premium increases whether beneficiary is held harmless depends on the amount of the standard part b premium increase relative to the amount of his or her social security cola in given year an individuals social security cola is determined by multiplying his or her benefit amount by the inflation rate ie the cpiw part b premiums are determined by projected part b program costs thus the number of people held harmless can vary widely from year to year depending on annual inflation rates and projected part b costs for example about 18 million part b 31 42 usc 1839f the hold harmless provision was first implemented in january 1987 32 to be held harmless in given year beneficiary must have had part b premiums deducted from both the december check of the prior year and the january check of the current year changes in beneficiarys benefit amount other than the cola do not affect whether the beneficiary is held harmless if beneficiarys benefit amount changes during year in which he or she is held harmless eg beneficiary starts to receive government pension

have absorbed growing fraction of beneficiaries social security benefits the deduction of part b premiums does not affect all beneficiaries equally paying the standard part b premium as most beneficiaries do requires relatively larger deduction from small social security benefits than from large benefits social security benefits are based on workers lifetime earnings consequently low earners are disproportionately affected by the deduction of medicare premiums

in 2008 the high earner is assumed to have earned 160 of the average wage during each year of his or her career about 68000 in 2008 and to receive monthly social security benefit of 1500 in 2008 all of the hypothetical workers are assumed to have been born in 1930 to have worked fulltime each year from age 22 to 65 with interruptions to have retired in 1998 at age 65 and to pay the standard part

2008 the proportion of social security benefits needed to pay the part b premium rose substantially by 2008 the part b premium absorbed about 8 of the medium earners benefits lower earners need

affected by this interaction as the number of social security and medicare beneficiaries grows over time the social security trustees project that by 2050 the proportion of americans aged 65 and oldermost of whom are eligible for both social security and medicarewill almost double 39 lowincome beneficiaries and those who rely primarily on social security may see decline in their standard of living as their medicare expenses rise premiums for parts b and d are projected to increase significantly faster than social security benefits outofpocket costs for parts b and d are projected to grow at the same rates as premiums contributing to the growing healthcare expenses of beneficiaries most beneficiaries are likely to have income apart from their social security benefits however many of tomorrows beneficiaries like todays are likely to rely mostly on social security especially as traditional pension coverage declines and many americans save little or nothing for retirement 40 these beneficiaries could struggle to cover their healthcare expenses rising healthcare costs have serious consequences not just for social security beneficiaries but for everyone who pays healthcare costs premiums for employersponsored health insurance are also rising faster than wages and inflation which contributes to the declining number of employers offering health insurance coverage from 69 in
