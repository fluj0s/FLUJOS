february 28 2006 additional issues for congress effectiveness of programs congressional debate on foreign aid issu has often focused on whether it is effective in reducing poverty and promoting us interest s abroad critics argue that aid is often wasted on countries that do not responsibly use the assistance to promote the welfare of their citizens others ar gue that programs ar often illdesigned in relation to their goals proponents of fore ign aid argue that development is long term process that must be consistently implemented to see results recent studies have noted marked lack of progress in reducing global poverty and question the correlation between levels of development assist ance and program success4 others argue that us assistance as currently structured does not contribute as much to sustainable economic growth as does trade5 one of the reasons suggested to explain this perceived lack of success is that ai d programs often have objectives other than pure development such as national s ecurity environmental or human rights considerations another reason often pointed to is the natu re and extent of corruption in societies that have little history of transparency the newly created millennium challeng account mca seeks to address some of these concerns in the view of the bush administration the mca links assistance to recipients performance on number of good governance and sound economic policy criteria see discussion be low proponents of the mca view it as way to reform foreign aid programs by rewarding good performers and by focusing on the objectives of poverty reduction with limited considerati on of strategic or political objectives critics raise concerns that by creating new aid programs including the hivaids initiative which coexist with traditional aid programs there is fragmentation of resources and poten tially lack of coordination among the various entities administering the programs6 secretary rices announcement of ne wly created position director of foreign assistance that will be held concurrently by the usaid administratorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32487crs20 was unveiled as way to bette r coordinate aid
