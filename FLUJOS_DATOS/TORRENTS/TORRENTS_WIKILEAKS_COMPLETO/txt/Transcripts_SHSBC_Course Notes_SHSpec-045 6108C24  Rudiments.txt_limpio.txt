6108c24 shspec45 rudiments valence does not respond well to rudiments processing since the rudiments are addressed to changing the conditions of the valence thats limitation of ruds thats one reason its tough to keep the rudiments in its next to impossible since the characteristics of the valence are not owned by the pc none of the valences postulates are his postulates how do you get around this the functional ruds processes are those which can shift or lighten valences the pc long ago lost faith in himself as himself and adopted other beingnesses he reposed his hopes for survival in these other beingnesses and cannot change the conditions of these other beingnesses hes unpredictable to himself because of the valence problem process or routine 1a would have prayer of handling this situation because all valences are accepted by the pc as solutions to some overwhelming problems thats why routine 1a works every rudiments process that separates valences will tend to work you can also use tr1c just to get him in comm with the environment otherwise what will you do youd have to clear him to get ruds in you have to get ruds in to clear him tr 10 would help but very slowly so good valence process for getting in ruds would be who cancant be audited in this room or what couldcouldnt be done in this room also who should you be to be audited or who should i be to audit you these processes key the valences out temporarily its an uphill action but it does shake up or remedy havingness on valences withholds caused him to pick up valences so withholds work on valences pretty directly but you should whipsaw the withhold question around in ruds in the effort to make the pc able to talk to the auditor not just willing to talk so see if the pc feels able to talk to you or unable to and why if it is sticky find ww would be able to communicate with an auditor finding the pcs havingness process can help somewhat common denominator of valences is matter energy space and time so any approach to mest eg havingness has some slight power of shifting valence the only way pc can get upset with you on sec check is to leave something incomplete by bypassing question with something still on it youll lose the pcs respect lose your altitude you should always tell the pc the question is hot so that even if you do leave it unflat the pc knows you know so theres missed withhold if you cant strip down question by the end of session let the pc know that you know its not clean if you let him go with the impression that you have let him get away with something hell be arc broken and hard to control interestingly despite the games condition the pc knows that when you lose he loses so use promptertype questions to get the pc really able to talk to the auditor on who would i have to be to audit you and what are you doing you may find the pc doing something else than following the command what you want to find out is whether the pc is willing to be pc and follow the commands or is he going to add something else to it during session you may observe the pc doing something bit odd so you should use some little rudiment like what are you doing or are you willing to be audited pc doesnt mind being nagged its all interest all havingness when it gets grindy in auditing find out what the pc is doing and what is happening you have to avoid upsetting pc who is interiorized but if hes all snarled up in something about the session youd better handle it also pcs sometimes do selfaudit so especially with an old time auditor ask which process you were auditing yourself on is unflat if its very difficult to keep the ruds in ask yourself if you are real to the pc or if he feels theres something else in the session he knows nothing about for instance let the pc know if you missed lunch and that its ok etc its up to the auditor to make himself real to the pc when the rfactor starts to break the pc will start to ask the auditor question about the auditor this shows hes out of session the fastest way to handle the rfactor is to put in the r its almost always all right with the pc when the r disappears its because the auditor is out of session the pc frequently notices it and may well comment then the auditor had better put it right at once it comes as surprise to the auditor to learn that he should be real with the pc all the rules seem to indicate that he should be unreal but there has to be person auditing the pc
