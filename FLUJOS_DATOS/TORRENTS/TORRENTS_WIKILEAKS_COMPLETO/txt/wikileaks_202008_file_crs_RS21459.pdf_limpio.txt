july 21 respectively13 while the us business community has indicated strong support for the negotiations the american agricultural community appears to be ambivale nt at best althoug h negotiations have not yet begun key interest groups have alr eady weighed in with their concerns14 t h following sections present discussion of the issues that are likely to emerge in negotiations on usaustralian fta agricultural issues consensus exists among trade policy experts that agricultural issues will be the greatest challenge in the bilateral fta negotiations15 as major agricultural exporting countries the united states and australia are for the most part allies in multilateral negotiations on agricultural issues nevertheless the movement towards tighter economic relationship under an fta exposes fault lines on government policies and practices on trade that seek to assist or protect specific agricultural productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21459crs5 16 trqs are restrictions in which

committee office of the united states trade representative january 15 2003 20 the national cattlemens beef association press release january 15 2003many of australias concerns over us trade barriers pertain to us agricultural policies primarily australian officials have argued that the farm bill that was enacted in 2002 the farm security and rural inve stment act of 2002 pl 107171 contains too much assistance to us farmers providing them with an unfair competitive advantage over australian farmers they further argue that the subsidies undermine efforts by the united states australia and other agricultu ral exporting countries to get wto members to agree to reducing agricultural supports and other trade barriers australia may attempt to seek reduction in us subsidies to us farmers australia also takes issue with us tariffrate quotas trq s on dairy products sugar and beef16 regarding dairy products one aust ralian study cites trqs on cheeses skim milk powder butter and butteroil as impediments to australian exports to the united states and likely australian targets under an fta the study also mentions australian fresh milk producers concerns w ith testing requirements under the federal milk import act of 1927 as an impediment to selling in the us market in addition the study states that the assign ed share for australia of 83 of the total quota on sugar imports heavily restricts australian sugar imports and also cites the us trq on beef the leading australian export to the united states17 australia also has identified other us barriers to its agricultural exports us trqs on cotton and peanuts and us tariffs on wool range of fruits vegetables nuts certain cut flowers wheat gluten rice vegetable oils wine margarine chocolate and cocoa preparations and bovine leathers18 although the us business community as whole has indicated strong support for an fta the american agricultural community appears to be ambivalent at best us producers of dairy sugar and beef oppose usaustralian fta that would seek to reduce us import restrictions on thei r products the national milk producers federation nmpf has argued that the be nefits of an fta would be decidedly unbalanced in favor of the au stralian dairy industry the nmpf argues that the fta would open up the us market to australian dairy producers increasing import competition for us producers however u s producers exports to australia would not be expected to increase given the small size of the australian economy19 the national cattlemens beef association opposes the ft on similar grounds of net benefit to us beef producers20 the american sugar alliance asa has argued that the elimination of restrictions on sugar imports from australia would cause major harm to the us sugar industry the asa also cited tr ade distorting practices that would prevent us exporters from gaining access to the australian market these practices includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21459crs6 21 american sugar alliance

reproduced by inside us trade single desk selling in queensland whi ch accounts for 95 of australian sugar production where all raw sugar is bought and sold by stateowned entity and australian government subsidies for the domestic sugar industry21 australian exports of wheat and rice are monopolies run by govern mentrun commodity boards which the us government has cited as trade barriers and will likely be targeted during fta negotiations sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures us exporters of agricultural products have long complained that australian government sps requirements violate australias obligations under the wto agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures they contend that australias quarantines and health measures are excessively restrictiv are not scientifi cally grounded and have restricted us exports of florida citrus stone fruit chicken pork apples pears and corn22 australian officials argue that these requirements are necessary to protect the health of its citizens and to protect australian produce from disease the australian ambassador to the united states stated th at australia would strongly defend its sps measures against change in fta negotiations arguing that they are scientifically based and fully transparent23 investment restrictions and other issues24 all foreign investments in australia are subject to government screening and approval while this proce ss has apparently not stopped u s investors from establishing successful operations in australia representatives of the us business community insist that the process does not conform to the prin ciple of national treatment that is treating foreign investors less favorably th an domestic investors the us business community has called for its elimination under an fta or at least for the australian government to make it more transparent ustr robert zoellick has stated that he would seek commitment from australia to eliminate or reduce trade distorting investment measures including the scr eening and approval process25 the australian government has indicated that changing the process might be difficult other trade issues that the united states might seek to address in fta negotiations include australias price controls on prescription drugs enforcement of intell ectual property rights and trade barriers on services and government procurement new zealand has indicated interest in participating in fta with the united states and australia or for separate fta with the united states
