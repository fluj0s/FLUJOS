225fd video streams 10 video streams the axis 225fd provides several different image and video formats the type to use depends on your requirements and on the pr operties of your network the live view page in the axis 225fd provides access to motion jpeg and mpeg4 vi deo streams as well as to single jpeg images other applications and client s can also access these video streamsimages directly without going via the live view page video stream types motion jpeg this format uses standard jpeg still images in the video stream these images are then displayed and updated at rate sufficient to crea stream that shows constantly updated motion the motion jpeg stream uses consider able amounts of bandwidth but also provides excellent image quality and access to each and every individual image contained in the stream note also that multiple clients accessing motion jpeg stre ams can use different image settings mpeg4 this is video compression standard that makes good use of bandwidth and whic h can provide highquality video streams at less than 1 mbits the mpeg4 standard provides scope fo r large range of different coding tools for use by various applications in different situations and the axis 225fd provides certain subsets of thes tools these are represented as video object types which are selected for use wi th different viewing clients the supported video object types are simple sets the coding type to h263 as used by eg quicktime ad vanced simple sets the coding type to mpeg4 part 2 as used by amc axis media control when using mpeg4 it is also possible to control the bi t rate which in turn allows the amount of bandwidth usage to be controlled cbr constant bit rate is used to achieve specific bit rate by varying the quality of the mpeg4 stream when using vbr variable bit rate the quality of the video stream is kept as constant as possible at the cost of varying bit rate notes mpeg4 is licensed technology the axis 225fd includes one viewing client license installing additional unlicensed cop ies of the viewing client is prohibited to purchase additional licenses contact your axis reseller all clients viewing the mpeg4 stream must use the same set of coding toolsaxis 225fd video streams 11 mpeg4 protocols and communication methods to deliver live streaming video over ip networks various combinations of transport protocols and broadcast methods are employed rtp realtime transport protocol is protoco l that allows programs to ma nage the realtime transmission of multimedia data via unicast or multicast rtsp real time streaming protocol serves as control protocol to ne gotiate which transport protocol to use for the stream rtsp is thus used by viewin g client to start unicast session see below udp user datagram protocol is communications prot ocol that offers limited rvice for exchanging data in network that uses the internet protocol ip udp is an alternative to the transmission control protocol tcp the advantage of udp is that it is not required to deliver all da ta and may drop network packets when there is eg network congestion this is suitable for live video as there is point in retransmitting old information that will not be displayed anyway unicasting is communication between s ingle sender and si ngle receiver over netw ork this means that the video stream goes independently to each user and ea ch user gets their own st ream benefit of unicast ing is that if one stream fa ils it onl affects one user multicast is bandwidthconserving technology that reduces bandwidth usage by simultaneously delivering single stream of information to multiple network recipients this technology is us ed primarily on delimited networks intranets as each user needs an uninterrup ted data flow and should not rely on network routers how to stream mpeg4 deciding on the combinatio n of protocols and methods to use depend s on your viewing requirements and on the properties of your network setting the preferred methods is done in the control applet for amc which is found in the windows control panel when this has been set amc will test all th selected methods in the specified order until the fi rst functioning one is found rtprtsp this method actually rtp over udp an d rtsp over tcp should be your first consideration for live video especially when it is important to always have an uptodate video stre am even if some images do get dropped this can be configured as multicast or unicast multicasting provides the most efficient usage of bandwidth especially when there are large numbers of clients viewing simultaneously note however that multicas t broadcast cannot pass ne twork router unless the router is configured to allow this it is thus not possible to multicast over eg the internet unicasting should be used for video ndemand broadcasting so that there is video traffic on the network until client connects and requests the stream however as more and more unicast clients connect the traffic on the network will increase and may cause congestion although there is maximum of 20 unicast viewers note that all multicast users comb ined count as 1 unicast viewer rtprtsp this unicast method is rtp tunneled over rt sp this can be used to exploit the fa ct that it is relatively simple to configure firewalls to allow rtsp traffic rtprtsphttp or rtprtsphttps these two methods can also be used to tr averse firewalls firewalls are co mmonly configured to allow the http protocol thus allowing rtp to be tunneled the axis media control the recommended method of accessing live video mpeg4 andor motion jpeg from the axis 225fd is to use the axis media control amc in crosoft internet explorer in windows this activex component is automatically installed on first use after which it can be configured by opening the amc control panel applet from the windows control panel alternatively rightclick the vi deo image in internet exploreraxis 225fd video streams 12 other methods of accessing the video stream videoimages from the axis 225fd can also be accessed in the following ways if supported by the client the axis 225fd can use motion jpeg server push to di splay video this option maintains an open
