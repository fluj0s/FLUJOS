legislative process november 28 2008 abstract the house and senate often create conference committees to propose the ﬁnal versions of bills that the two houses have passed in diﬀerent forms when one house amends and passes bill that the other house already has passed the two houses then must agree on the same ﬁnal version of the bill before it can be presented to the president for his approval or veto there art two ways in which this process of reaching ﬁnal agreement can take place either by the formal exchange of amendments between the house and senate or through negotiations among conferees that the two houses appointhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98381g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

can be presented to the president the house and senate often reach final agreement on major legislation through negotiations among conferees that the two houses appoint because conference committee is negotiating forum the two houses impose few rules governing its work leaving it to the conferees themselves to decide how they can conduct their negotiations most productively also the house and senate give their conferees considerable latitude regarding the content of the agreements they can reach nonetheless there are circumstances described in this report under which the house can vote to give instructions to its conferees 1 the house may vote to instruct its conferees under three circumstances first before its conferees are appointed second after they have been appointed for time specified in the rules but have not yet filed report and third when conference committee report is recommitted to conference in each case the house might instruct its conferees to insist on certain house position in conference or to accept certain senate position or to attempt to negotiate compromise position with the senate that satisfies certain conditions or requirements the house is only instructing its own conferees and not the conferees appointed by the senate under clause 7b of rule xxii motions to instruct house conferees may not include argument meaning that the motions cannot include language presenting reasons to support the instructions whenever the instructions are given and whatever form they may take there are two points to bear in mind about instructions to conferees first it is not in order to instruct house conferees to reach some agreement that is not within their authority as conferees the house requires that its conferees limit themselves to the matters on which the two houses have disagreed and that they resolve each such matter within the scope of the differences between the house and senate positions on it 2 second instructions to conferees are never binding point of order can ever be sustained against conference report on the grounds that it is not consistent with instructions that the house gave its conferees

the process of arranging conference with the senate first the house usually either disagrees to the senates amendments to bill the house has passed or the house insists on its amendments to bill the senate has passed second the house either requests conference with the senate or agrees to the conference that the senate already has requested and third the speaker then appoints the house conf erees to meet and negotiate with their senate counterparts these three stages often occur quickly routinely and one right after the other however between the second and third stagesafter the house decides to go to conference but before the speaker appoints the house confereesa motion to instruct the conferees is in order only one valid motion to instruct is in order at this time if one motion is made and point of order is sustained against it second motion is in order the house debates this motion under the onehour rule and under house rule xxii clause 7b the hour is equally divided between the majority and minority parties in practice the time is usually controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the house committee with jurisdiction over the bill however if both of those 1

claim and control onethird of the time for debating it the instructions may be amended only if the majority floor manager does not move the previous question on the motion during or at the end of the first hour of debate or if this motion is made and the house rejects it to preclude debate on the motion member can move to lay the motion on the table after it is read under wellestablished house precedents recognition to propose this motion to instruct is prerogative of the minority party the speaker is likely to give first preference in recognition to the minority leader or to the ranking minority member of the committee that originally had reported the bill to the house if neither of these members seeks recognition the speaker is likely to recognize minority party committee member before minority party member who does not serve on the committee of jurisdiction

instruct house conferees also are in order beginning 20 calendar days and 10 legislative days after conferees were appointed if the conferees have not yet filed conference report legislative day begins each time the house meets after an adjournment if the house goes out of session for several days after conference committee is appointed but before it has reported calendar days but legislative days will accumulate and count toward the requirement such motions to instruct also are in order during the last six days of session if the houses conferees have been appointed for at least 36 hours without presenting their report however this opportunity only arises after the house has fixed the date of adjournment sine die which in current practice it often does only hours before the end of the session once the time requirement has been met motions to instruct are privileged under rule xxii clause 7c more than one motion to instruct is in order and members of both parties are entitled to recognition to make such motions however the speaker temporarily defers consideration of motion to instruct that is made under clause 7 c when member announces to the house his or her intention to make such motion and presents the text of the motion the speaker designates time or place in the legislative schedule for considering the motion on the next calendar day the house meets the motion is subject to debate under the same terms as the motion to instruct offered before conferees are appointed

after the house orders the previous question on conference committee report member might move to recommit the conference report with or without instructions if the senate has not already approved the report when the senate agrees to conference report the effect of that vote is to discharge the senate conferees and there is longer conference committee to which the house might recommit the report the motion to recommit is prerogative of the minority party unless minority party member seeks recognition to offer the motion the motion to recommit with or without instructions is not debatable
