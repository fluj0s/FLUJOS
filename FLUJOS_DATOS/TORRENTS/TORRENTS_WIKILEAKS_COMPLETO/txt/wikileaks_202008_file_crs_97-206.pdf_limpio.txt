bureau of land ma nagement blm manages approximately 264 million acres of public land primarily in the west additionally the agency manages 300 million acres f minerals underlying federal and private lands throughout the country the management f public lands has been very controversial in recent ears particularly with respect to proposals to change the way it manages grazing mining and logging as well as recreation acces s across public lands and wild horses and burros the administration requested 1122 billion in fy1998 current budget authority for the blm 32 million more than enacted for fy1997 excluding 106 million of emergency fy1997 ppropriations the largest increases were for management of land and resources 15 million and wildland fire management 28 million the request also included decrease of 12 million in payments in lieu of taxes payments to local governments on july 15 1997 the house approved 1129 billion in fy1998 current budge t authority an increase of nearly 7 million over the pre sidents budget request and 67 million less than enacted for fy1997 includi ng the 106 million emergency fy1997 appropriation this provides 6 million less for management of land and resources than requested by th administration and 72 million less than enacted for fy1997 for wildland fire management however the house restored the 12 million in payments in lieu of taxes resulting in the same funding as in fy1997 the senate approved 1138 billion in fy1 998 current budget authority for the blm an increase of 10 million over the house allowance and 17 million more than requested this includes 9 million less than requested for management of lands and resources 3 million more than enacted for fy1997 and 3 million m ore than the administrations request and house

rightsofway across federal land pursuant to section 2477 of the revised statutes rs 2477 unless expressly authorized by an act of congress t he rs 2477 issue has been contentious since the current administration changes the interpretation of the statute fro m prior administrations interpretations this prohibition was included in the fy1996 an d fy1997 interior appropriations act section 110 of pl 104134 and section 108 pf pl 104208 respectively the senate struck the rs 2477 language in section 107 of th fy1998 interior appropriations bill arguing that section 108 of the fy1997 act wa s intended as permanent law this interpretation was upheld by recent opinion from th comptro ller general opinion b277719 aug 20 1997 the conference agreemen t excluded the provision with the managers noting that this was to be construed s contradicting or diminishing the permanence of section 108 of the fy1997 interio r appropriations act second the issue of whether to continue minera l patents under the mining law of 1872 and at what price title to the land may be transferred to the claimant for 250 or 500 per acre has been subject in th debate over mining law reform in recent years moratorium on acceptin g and processing patent applications for minerals was included in the fy199 6 interior appropriations act only after the house had twice recommitted the conference report because the moratorium did not cover the entire year section 314 of the fy1997 interio r appropriation act extended the moratorium enacted in the fy1996 act for all of fy1997 section 314 of the fy1998 int erior appropriations act as passed the house and senate and as agreed to by the conference continues this moratorium for further information on the blm budget from the world wide web see blm s

ove r the presidents request the house had passed 7251 million and the senate 7287 million the proposed increase falls primarily within resource management which includes the endangered species program fisheries and refuge management among other things which would go from 5250 to 5948 million offset by decreases in other programs th conference proposes signif icant decrease for construction down 142 million though not as large as the decrease proposed in the presidents budget down 147 million the committee approved 108 million the fy1997 level for the national wildlif refuge fund which provides payments to local governments in recognition of reduction of the local ta x base due to the presence of federal land both the president and the house had proposed 7 decrease the payment levels have been controversial since the smal l additions of land to the national wildlife refu ge system over the last several years mean that reduced dollars must be spread still further the si tuation has produced pressure on congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97206to increase the appropriation especially since local governments often incorrectly view the payments as entitlements even though they are actually subject to annual appropriations the endangered species act program remains the most controversial program within fws for fy1998 the committee proposes to increase candidate conservation t 570 million 21 listing to 519 million 38 consultation to 238 millio n 327 and recovery to 425 million 717 the conference committee accepted the house figure of 519 million for the listin g function which includes designation of critical habitat and included its specific cap at this figure in the bill itself the effect would be to limit the discretion of the agency to transfer funds for additional listings eg if lawsuits mandate agency action on listing certain species without cap either funding would have to be transferred away from ongoing listin g activities to meet the additional requirements of the lawsuit or from other programs within the agencys resources management function with the cap court order to carry forward listing decision on particular species will turn listing into zero sum game at least at fiscal level t he listing of some species or designation of their critical habitat would preclude the listing of others fws will welcome this change as protection of other programs whose budgets it wishes to protect the administration and the conference committee both supported 060 decrease from 14085 million to 14000 million for the grants to states

version of the bill however the conferees agreed with the house an d adjusted the fee program to provide significant supplemental revenue the administrat ion requested 520 million for heritage

acquisitions and exchanges from the land and water conservation fund lwcf of this mount 315 million would be available for the purcha of the headwaters forest 3500 acres of redwood forest in california 25 0 million an d the new world mine near yellowstone national park 65 million in fy1998 and fy1999 the balance of th 385 million would be available in fiscal years 19992001 the lwcf is special account that accumulates revenues from federal outdoo r recreation user fees the federal motorboat fuel tax surplus property sales and oil and ga s leases on the outer continental shelf the oil and gas leases provide most of the revenues httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97206 this ceiling was 200 million in fy1970 3 00 million annually for fy1971fy1977 and 9002 million annually since fy1978however the lwcf is not true trust fund in the way trust fund is generally understood in the private sector the fund is credited with revenues up to the established annual ceiling2 but congress must appropriate the money before it can be spent if appropriations are t made the revenues are spent on other federal programs deposits to the lwcf are i n effect only an authorization of expenditures that accumulates if the funds are t appropriated the current accumulated unappropriated authorized balance in the lwc f exceeds 10 billion the house d ecided not to provide funding for these priority land acquisitions an d exchanges because these proposals have not been authorized chairman regula of the interior subcommittee of the house appropriations committee indicated that he favored using any additional funding to address so of the 14 billion of identified backlogged maintenance in parks wildlife refuges and forest roads before acquiring additional federal land while the senate bill included the 700 million as provided for in the budget agreement the senat appropriations c ommittee report language questioned the need for additional funds for land acquisition given significant maintenance backlogs and operational shortfalls the senat bill included languag to acquire the headwaters forest and the new world mine but made the acquisitions subject to enactment of authorizing legislation the allocation of the balance of the 700 million would be determined through written approval by the house and senate appropriations committees from project list to be submitted by the administration the senate also allocated 100 million from the balance to the lwcf stateside grant program the conference committee provided 699 million of this amount up to 250 million will be available to acquire the headwaters forest and an additional 10 million to humboldt county to offset lost tax revenue and other costs and up to 65 million to acquire the new world mine and 12 million to maintain the nearby beartooth highway the conference committee added several condi tions such as requiring public appraisals and adherence to the national environmental policy act both acquisitions will be delayed for 180 days afte r appraisals are completed to allow for further consideration by authorizing committees the balance of these funds goes to the department of the interior 272 million and the us forest service 90 million to spend on critical repair and restoration needs based n requests submitted for approval to both appropriations committees for further discussion on the land and water conservation fund see crs report 97792 enr land and wa ter conservation fund current funding and other issues by jeff zinn 6 p title vi forest resources conservation and shortage relief the senate appropriations committee added substantial title amending the fores t resources conservation and shortage relief act of 1990 title iv of the customs and trade act of 1990 pl 101382 16 usc 620 proponents of the amendments argue that the implementing rules issued and made effective on september 8 1995 60 federal registe r 4689046934 would have allowe d the forest service to prevent domestic log transportation in certain situations and would have substantially increased the burden for identifyin g marking and branding and reporting on the origin of harvested timberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97206the amendments would alter the original act in several ways some of which are related to the concerns over the implementing regulations new subsection would be added t indicate that none of the restrictions intended to prevent substitution simultaneousl purchasing and processing federal timber while exporting private timber from the sam geographic area are intended to restrict domestic transportation and processing of timbe r from private lands including logs imported for domestic processing the secretary is also directed to impose reasonable requirements for identifying and tracking unprocessed timber if the benefits outweigh the compliance costs th timber is likely to be exported or substituted for federal t imber and the timber is smaller than 7 inches in diameter or 8 feet in length the requirements may also be waived the amendmen ts would make permanent the ban on log exports from state lands i n washington the current ban is to be replaced by an order from the secretary of commerce on january 1 199 8 requiring that 400 million board feet of timber from state lands must be processed domestically however the presidents authority to modify the secretarys order remains and s been used at least once to establish the initial ban on log exports fro m washington state lands in 1992 the amendments would also establish the northwester n private timber open market area defined as the state of washington within this area the restrictions on substitution of federal timber for private timber are eliminated for timbe r buyers and brokers ie nonlandowners without exclusive timber cutting rights also within this open market area companies are lowed to establish their sourcing areas without public comment or agency termination this contrasts with the current requirements where the agency determines sourcing areas based on timber purchasing patterns and publi c comment sourcing areas are authorized and established to allow timber exporters to buy federal timber in geographically and economically separate areas where they also bu nonfederal timber to supply their domestic mills the amendments would narrow th definition of unprocessed timb er that cannot be exported and must therefore be tracked by excluding lowgrade sawlogs to be processed into wood chips or pulp finally th amendments would define each violation and minor infraction for determining penalties if the act is violated for additional reading crs products crs report 96563 enr department of the i nterior and related agencies
