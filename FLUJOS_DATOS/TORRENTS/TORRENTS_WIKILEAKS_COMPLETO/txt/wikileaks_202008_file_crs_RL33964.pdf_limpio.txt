dominant almost half of the countrys population are muslims who live primarily in the northern half of the country divisions between ethnic groups between north and south between christian and muslim

allotted six week period for the process during which reports suggested the process had so far fallen only little short of disaster 15 but later extended the registration period although concerns over the slow start of the registration process were largely resolved criticism remained that the voter registration list was not widely posted so that voters could ensure their names were registered in

abubakars candidacy according to press reports over 60 million ballots were printed in the weeks prior to the election that did not include his name after the april 16 supreme court ruling new ballots

benue plateau and taraba the us state department has accused several stat governments of funding vigilante groups to detain and kill suspected criminals and suggests that police have done little to investigate or stop the violence 23 there is considerable concern that these groups were used for political purposes during the electoral period some election observer groups including the european union and the commonwealth did not send observers to the niger delta region because of threats of violence andor kidnapping the threat of violence and legal disputes surrounding the elections led many

abubakar from the ballot was part of complex series of legal battles between the obasanjo administration and the former vice president in june 2006 the us federal bureau of investigations fbi allegedly requested the assistance of nigerias economic and financial crimes commissi on efcc in the investigation of us congressman who had been accused of taking bribe from nigerian officials of the

federal oil funds abubakar denies the charges in august 2006 the results of the inquiry were provided to the president who turned the matter over to an administrative panel of inquiry which in turn recommended prosecution the indictment was passed to the national assembly in september in november lagos justice nullified the efcc report and set aside the panel of inquiry ruling that the report had legal foundation the efcc appealed the j udgement according to nigerias constitution presidential aspirant is ineligible to run if he has been indicted for embezzlement or fraud by judici commission of inquiry or an administrative panel of inquiry in early march 2007 federal high court ruled that inec lacked the authority to disqualify candidates unless ordered to by court of law on

inec lacked the authority to exclude abubakar from the election and ordering that the electoral body place abubakars name on the ballot although the ap peals court is the higher of the two judicial bodies according to some legal analysis neither court has jurisdiction over the case of the other leaving the issue unresolved the final decision rested with the countrys supreme court which had been

effectively postponing any ruling by the supreme court until the week of the presidential elections on april 16 five days before the elections the court ruled that inec could not disqualify candidates

explosions in southeast nigeria since the late 1990s the largest single toll from an explosion was approximately 1000 in october of 1998 these explosions are triggered when people siphon off oil from holes punched in the aboveground pipeline for personal use resulting in reported loss of up to 200000 barrels of oil per day the government established national task force on surveillance of petroleum

government announced the signing of peace agreement with the states militant groups although mend has rejected the truce declaring it will increase its attacks until okah is released most observers agree that the crisis in the delta must ultimately be solved politically rather than militarily but there is considerable disagreement on the details of such solution the current federal system provides states with 13 share of local revenues predominately from oil sales groups like mend argue that the states should receive 50 share as was stipulated in the 1960 constitution some analysts however suggest that corruption within the state governments is so high that the local populations would see little improvement even if the state share were raised some of the oilproducing states have reported revenues of up to 13 billion per year but have dismal records of development or service delivery 76 the obasanjo administration launched new development plan for the region in late march 2007
