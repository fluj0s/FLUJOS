need to upgrade or replace key electronic countermeasures such as aircraft radar warning receivers there are also other near term and longer term issues congress may wish to consider they are described in the conclusion of this report ew definition and paper focus the department of defense defines electronic warfare as any military action involving the use of electromagnetic and directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemythe three major subdivisions within electronic warfare are electronic attack electronic protection and electronic warfare support2 electronic warfare support can be considered the foundation of ew this activity includes listening to an enemys radars and communications to determine what frequencies and wavelengths he is using so that others can better attack or protect against them electronic attack activities include jammi ng or deceiving an enemys radar or radio communicati ons oftentimes by exploiting information collected by electronic warfare support assets electronic protection or electronic countermeasures ecm also jams or deceives an adversarys use of the electromagnetic spectrum ecm are usually used in the end game when an enemy missile for example has locked onto an aircraft and is homing in for kill while not subset of ew per the suppression of enemy air defenses sead is an important mission area that exploits ew techniques technologies and platforms dod defines sead as that activity which neutralizes destroys or temporarily degrades surfacebased enemy air defenses by destructive andor disruptive means3 in addition to exploiting ew techniques sead platforms also use bombs and missiles to attack enemy air defenses the three ew subelements and sead are mutually supporting and are intimately linked for example dods only active radar jamming aircraft the ea 6b prowler employs ew self protection systems the prowler also contributes to sead by jamming radar signals and by firing the high speed antiradiation harm missile finally the ea6b depends on electronic warfare support information to effectively do its job the f16cj also known as the block 50 dods primary sead aircraft also shoots the harm missil the f16cj uses advanced ecm assets to protect itself from attack like the ea6b the f16cj exploits information about enemy electronic activity collected by its own sensors or

throughout this report as needed brief background electronic warfare has been an important component of military air operations since the earliest days of radar radar ew and stealth techniques have evolved over time as engineers scientists and tacticians have struggled to create the most survivable and effective air forces possible during world war ii for instance groundbased early warning radars were used early in the conflict to detect attacking aircraft at long ranges to direct fighters to intercept them and to warn antiaircraft artillery aaa batteries of imminent attack these groundbased radars significantly increased the success of air defenses the attrition of attacking aircraft rose accordingly to negate or degrade groundbased radars the allies and germany quickly developed number of countermeasures that are still employed today chaff strips of metal that reflect radar emissions was developed and used by both the allies and germany to confuse or obscure early warning radars the allies also developed radar jamming germany used unmanned systems cruise and ballistic missiles to penet rate englands air defenses and the allies modified their aerial tactics to reduce the amount of time that aircraft spent in enemy radar coverage just as countermeasures were developed to combat radar countermeasures were developed to counter the countermeasures for example germany began using radar frequencies that were unaffected by allied chaff they also developed new techniques such as intercepting aircraft radar navigation transmissions and identifying aircraft by the unique radar return generated by the aircrafts propeller toward the end of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30841crs4 4 momyer william airpower in three wars us department of the air force washington

attrition rates 25 percent less than bombers without onboard ecm4 in the post world war ii period much research focused on using radar to guide surfacetoair missiles sams and aaa rather than just warn the missile or artillery battery of the attacking aircrafts approach radar now provided precise information to guide the missile or artillery shell to its target in response to radarguided sams the united states tried to increase aircraft survivability in number of ways some aircraft such as the u2 flew very high others such as the sr71 flew very high and very fast still others such as the f111 flew very fast and at low altitudes many if not most aircraft also carried electronic countermeasures the effectiveness of radar controlled air defenses grew as they became more redundant and better integrated therefore the united states developed many techniques to enhance aircraft survivability against systems such as north vietnams quadruplelayered integrated air defenses this era spawned for example the development of the f105 suppres sion of enemy air defense sead aircraft anti radiatio n missiles and airborne jamming platforms such as the ea6b prowler and ef111 raven also the united states began flying aircraft in large strike packages where only 2040 percent of the aircraft were bomb droppers sixty to 80 percent of the escorting aircraft were employed to ensure the bombers survivability either through jamming decoys sead or other means5 the growing reach of sams eg the russian built sa5 has range of 186 miles and maximum altitude of 23 miles6 and improvements to ground based radars spawned new approaches to improving aircraft survivability by using new materials and designs to reduce heat emanations and to deflect or absorb radar signals aircraft such as the f117 night hawk significantly reduced the probability of detection and tracking by adversaries as in the past however potential adversaries have noted this advancement and are pursuing counters to stealth technologies the downing of an f117 night hawk in the 1999 conflict in yugoslavia operation allied force by serbian sam illustrates that the struggle for control of the electromagnetic spectrum is an ongoing endeavor for us air forces recent activities kosovo ew successes and shortfalls operation allied force may be an important watershed in the debate over current and future us airborne ew it

1999credited with saving numerous us aircraft that had been targeted by serbian sams general wesley clark the operations military leader described how critical role ew played in the allies success he testified that we couldnt have fought this war successfully without the ea6b contribution we really need the electronic warfare capacity that we have there8 the value of the f16cj sead aircraft was also widely touted9 the table below suggests the impact of ew and sead on nato aircraft survivability during the kosovo campaign duration of conflict days 78 nato aircraft 900 sorties flown 38000 sams fired at nato aircraft 700 nato aircraft shot down 2 by using this metric one can assert that dods ew and sead efforts effectively protected us aircraft from serbias integrated air defenses yet despite the low number of nato aircraft destroyed during operation allied force concerns have been raised over number of ew and sead issues in the area of electronic attack the main concern raised by the kosovo conflict is that dod currently has too few jamming aircraft in its inventory to support more than one conflict simultaneously although operation allied force was considered by many to be small scale contingency us systems such as rc135 rivet joint electronic intelligence aircraft and ea6b tactical airborne electronic warfare aircraft were employed in numbers roughly equivalent to those anticipated for major theater war and even then were heavily tasked10 further the number of aircraft that could be fielded at any one time may have been unnecessarily decreased by several operations and maintenance shortfalls such as shortage of spare parts and too few aircraft trainers also the effectiveness of jamming aircraft may have been degraded by their lack of key technologies such as night vision devices and advanced communications finally experience in operation allied force suggests that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30841crs6 11 for more detailed discussion of kosovo

supporting lowobservable aircraft11 there are 235 f16cjs in the total active inventory and this number appears to have been sufficient to adequately pursue the sead mission in kosovo however operation allied force did suggest some numerical shortfalls that may have hindered sead operations according to the commander of the air forces 20th fighter wing the lack of harm targeting system hts pods key system on the f16cj in kosovo may have reduced the air forces ability to generate sead sorties in allied force there were more f16 aircraft capable of carrying the pod than there were pods to go around he also said that lack of personnel also limited sead operations12 perhaps greater sead concern emanating from kosovo was the great difficulty us forces had detecting tracking and destroying serbian sams that minimized their radar emissions or used shoot and scoot tactics13 part of the challenge is that the primary sead weapon the harm quickly loses its guidance once an adversary turns off his radar even for short period of time compounding problem is that the targeting cycle for mobile sam sites takes too long according to veteran air force general one damning shortfall is it takes matter of days perhaps longer than it did during the persian gulf war to locate the emissions from yugoslav radars controlling antiaircraft weapons and get that informatio n to aircrews flying the bombing missions id like to see radar signal come up and 20 seconds later bomb going in on the air defense site thats the way we ought to be operating i believe the respons time has gotten longer not shorter as you would have thought14 secretary of defense cohen and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen shelton stated in their kosovo after action report that the united states must reduce the time between detecting targets and attacking them the difficulty of destroying serbia sam launchers can be derived by looking at different set of operation allied force numbershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30841crs7 15 correspondence from ltgen cw fulford usmc director joint staff to mr daniel mulhollan director congressional research service october 19 1999 16 haffa

corpserbian sam batteries 22 sead sorties flown 450015 sam batteries destroyed 216 this inability to destroy serbias sam launchers is particularly worrisome because according to secretary of defense william cohen and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen hugh shelton although among the most capable that the united states has faced in combat the fry federal republic of yugoslavia air defense systems did not represent the state of the art much more capable systems are available for sale in the international arms market in the years ahead we may face an adversary armed with stateoftheart systems and we need to prepare for that possibility now17 despite these perceived shortcomings forces involved in operation allied force employed their aircraft and refined tactics in ways that may hint at future solutions to the problem of destroying elusive sams for example the air force paired different variants of the f16 aircraft together to exploit their various strengths18 like the harm the f16cjs sensors are optimized to find and attack radiating radars also like the harm the cj has difficulty finding and targeting the radar if the adversary is careful to limit its emissions the f16cd block 40 however has an all weather precision strike capability and carries laserguided bombs by using their datalink capability f16cj pilots in kosovo passed bearing information on sam radar sites from their hts to block 40 f16s the block 40 aircraft were then able to launch precis ionguided munitions pgms at the fleeting and nonemitting targets19 one operation allied force participant remarked we did have one big success when we teamed block 40 and block 50 on an early warning radar in montenegro this particular early warning radar was problem through most of the war when we got tip where it was located we had block 50 f16 go in and shoot harm at it the harm hit real close and did some damage then pilot in block 40 used his targeting pod to drop an lgb on the site to completely destroy it20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30841crs8 21 cook nick survival of the smartest janes defense weekly march 1 2000 p2226 22 conversation with department of the navy requirements

important to the success of future sead missions the primary topic of ecmrelated conversation following operation allied force was widespread praise of towed radar decoys although they did not debut in kosovo towed decoys were used more pervasively in this conflict than in the past these ecm were credited with saving several aircraft such as the b1 bomber from serbian sams some have described towed decoys as one of the key enablers of last years bombing campaign21 however there were ecm deficiencies as well as successes the ale39 countermeasures dispenser for instance was not sufficiently reliable the ale39 which is found on ea6b f14 fa18 and av8b aircraft at times did not dispense countermeasures flares or chaff when it was supposed to conversely the dispenser also ejected countermeasures without prompting leaving the pilot with none available when they were needed the alq126 self protection jammers performance was also found unsatisfactory during kosovo navy and marine corps aircraft that used this jammer f14s and fa18s were not allowed to fly over land where the most hostile threats were located only those navy and marine corps aircraft protected by more modern jammers were allowed to fly these missions22 operation allied force flight operations also suggest that passively guided sams are selfprotection concern that may merit close scrutiny shorter range sams can exploit infrared ir or electrooptical eo guidance 23 to target low flying aircraft because these missiles do not emanate radar signals they are difficult to detect when asked which

these activities often cut across bureaucratic boundaries and defy easy categorization and oversight which makes it difficult to determine and assess dodwide ew priorities in the area of sead for example the general accounting office gao recently reported that dod lacks comprehensive strategy for improving its sead capabili ties because dod has overarching ew coordination strategy the services efforts to improve ew capabilities are paramount however service level decisions are in our view much less likely to reflect the needed priority for closing the gap between the services capabilities and their needs and to be the most cost effective solutions for the department overall33 electronic attackrelated activities perhaps the most noteworthy activity related to electronic attack is the

field an ea capability in the 2010 time frame this is when the ea6b prowler is expected to be retired the aoa team has divided into various integrated product teams that are focused on cost threat technology and operational measures of effectiveness as of december 2000 the aoa had received over 170 briefings from indus try and had assessed at least 23 different ea platform options as of january 2001 the aoa was conducting modeling and simulation runs on various alternatives and expected to begin analysis of the computer output in march and april 2001 the aoa team anticipates briefing the

be the first opportunity to begin implementing the aoa recommendations toward 2010 initial operating capability ioc it is unlikely that the aoa will recommend single point solution to dods 2010

also led training activities designed to improve sead capabilities for instance the usaf hosted joint sead test and evaluation at nellis air force base in august and september 2000 designed to update and test sead tactics the air force also annually runs joint expeditionary force exercises the one held september 1114 2000 at nellis afb focused on improving time critical targeting capabilities such as destroying sams that employ shootandscoot tactics the air force is engaged in variety of programs to improve its sead capabilities perhaps the most prominent are upgrades to the harm targeting system hts the advanced targeting pod atp and the miniature air launched decoy mald since the fielding of the original hts the air force has pursued preplanned product improvement program that has resulted in fielding two hts upgrades revision 5 r5 in 1996 and revision 6 r6 in 2000 the r6 softwarehardware modification improved the hts geolocation capability hts revision 7 r7 is currently funded and under development initial operational capability ioc is expected in fy 2006 the goal of the r7 upgrade is to further improve the hts geolocation capability r7 is designed to allow faster precision harm employment and enable the targeting of jdam joint direct attack munition jsow joint stand off weapon and potentially other standoff precision guided munitions against fixed and mobile enemy air defense systems employing emission control tactics39 the dispersal of jsow submunitions would also increase the likelihood of destroying all of sam batterys assets radars missile launchers and command and control vehicles the atp is designed to give the seadcapable f16cj the same precision targeting capability as the f16cd models essentially turning the f16cj into true multim ission aircraft the exact features will probably include highresolution forwardlooking infrared sensor which displays an ir image of the target to the pilot and laser designator for precise delivery of laserguided munitions the combination of the hts r7 and atp should give single f16cj the very promising capabilities against mobile sams demonstrated in kosovo see preceding pages 7 and 8 by two different f16 models working together the mald is designed to improve both sead capabilities and contribute to aircraft selfprotection by attracting the attention of enemy sam radars this small 25 inch wing span turbojet powered decoy will employ signature augmentation system sas that will make it look like much larger manned fighter aircraft to enemy radar operators when enemy radars or sams attempt to engage the mald real fighter aircraft will be free to attack or avoid the sam the mald sead concept of operation s conops could include several strategies including 1 preemptive destruction 2 reactive suppression 3 diversion as just described or 4 saturation key program goal is to keep the cost of mald below 30000 per decoy for 3000 unit purchase the defense advanced research projects agency darpa

sead activity is darpas advanced tactical targeting technology at3 program this program will seek to demonstrate passive tactical targeting system for the lethal suppression of enemy air defenses sead41 the crux of the at3 program is to widely distribute passive radar receivers throughout the battle space and to network them together single asset will be tasked with sensing or destroying enemy sam systems they all will this program is an example of the type of sead technological innovation recently discussed by the general accounting office42 the first element of the at3 concept is advanced electronic warfare support hardware the at3 elements will exploit and be composed of global positioning system receivers precision clocks and lowcost wideband receiverprocessors although the exact size of the at3 hardware has not yet been determined the program hopes to make them small enough to fit on uav or other vehicles of opportunity the second element of at3 is advanced networking by linking the electronic warfare support modules together say with link 1643 every element on the network would function cooperatively different at3 sensors would pick up threat enemy radar signal from different points in time space and frequency darpa hopes that by rapidly calculating the difference between when and where each receiver intercepts the threat radar signal the at3 network will pinpoint and disseminate the enemys location in 10 seconds or less darpa says that the biggest technical challenge to this approach is pvtf or the ability to synchronize position velocity time and frequency among all the participants in the network synchronizing the time difference and frequency difference of arrival for all participants in the network is both computer processing and software challenge the networks accuracy increases with the number of modules involved but so does the technical complexity of pvtf in its most successful manifestation darpa hopes at3 will make dedicated sead aircraft unnecessary the at3 networks ability to identify target within 10 seconds could enable any shooter such as the army multiple launch rocket system navy fiveinch guns or air force fighter or bomber aircraft to attack non emitting or shootandscoot sams darpa plans to conduct flight tests in fy2002 in which it will geolocate radiating target in near real

priorities in fy2002 navy and air force officials have indicate that their electronic warfare priorities for fy2002 will likely be very similar to those in fy2001 for the navy this 2001to 2002 consistency is due to the fact that the navy believes its ew responsibilities are clear and the challenges well understood the air forces fy 2002 ea priorities will resemble those of fy 2001 more for reason s of momentum the fundamental organizational policy doctrinal and budgetary changes that the air force has initiated on ew are still solidifying thus for example those responsible for developing the services fy2002 budget request were not guided by xoies ew roadmap49 fy2003 will probably be the first air force budget strongly influenced by the air forces new position and policies on electronic attack electronic attack the many different parties within the navys ea community speak with one voice on 2002 requirements they want in order of priority 1 improved ea6b readiness 2 icapiii 3 improvements to jamming capabilities and 4 link16 implementation with only 124 ea6b aircraft in the inventory to support all dod combat flight operations it would appear prudent to them to keep as many of these aircraft in ready state and at the highest level of effectiveness as possible according to the navy the most significant near term challenge facing the ea6b community is the gradual decline in aircraft readiness50 the ea6b operational advisory grouphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30841crs18 50 continued september 27 2000 51 ibid 52 the shortage of usq113 v 3 jammers is both an effectiveness and also readiness issue currently the navy constantly swaps the 63 usq113 jammers they own among the 124 prowler airframes which creates an unnecessary bottleneck in the systemoag believes that readiness will be improved by addressing shortfalls in the prowler supply system including parts such as flaps rudders radomes and struts the navy has experienced continuous shortfall in om funding for alq99 pod repair and refurbishment is particularly bothersome making sure that these pods are maintained appropriately could increase the prowler fleets readiness rate by 30 percent 51 once the navy ensures that the ea6b fleet is as ready as it can be its second priority is to improve the prowlers effectiveness the best way to do that navy planners believe is by implementing the icap iii upgrade to the prowlers alq99 and usq113 jammers icap iii should improve the ea6bs capabilities against frequency hopping radars and provide better geolocation of threats the ea6b oag endorses icap iii production at the maximum rate allowable two icap iii trainers one for whidbey island wa and one for cherry point nc would help the navy sooner realize the icap iiis capabilities navy planners say making additional improvements to the ea6bs jamming pods is the navys next ea priority for fy2002 number of improvements are believed to be required to improve the prowlers capabilities over the long term and to enhance joint strike aircraft survivability in order of priority the navy would 1 continue funding the research and exploitation of enemy radar systems to improve ea6b jamming techniques 2 upgrade the ea6bs low band transmitter to increase its frequency coverage and 3 acquire an additional 61 usq113 v3 communications jammers so that all 124 ea6bs in the fleet could field this capability52 the third way the navy would improve the ea6bs capabilities and their fourth overall ea priority would be to accelerate the fielding of link 16 as the sole provider of tactical electronic attack capability on the joint battlefield it is imperative that the ea6b have uninterrupted connectivity with strike and support assets states the ea6b oag in the next year the air force will continue evolving its policy organizational and doctrinal positions on electronic attack it will continue to participate in the ea aoa it will continue to develop and coordinate new conops like countering air defenses the communications jamming ec130h compass call is the only line item in the air force s budget that legislators may have to consider the air force currently has sufficient funding to upgrade 11 of its 14 ec130h aircraft to the most capable configuration in fy2002 it is likely that the air force will request funding to upgrade the remaining three aircraft new air force radar jamming platforms will emerge prior to the ea aoa recommended ea6b follow on in the 2010 time framehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30841crs19 suppression of enemy air defenses two important sead lessons have emerged from kosovo first there is need to more quickly locate and target sam systems second there is need to more effectively target sam systems that limit their radar emissions the air force as part of its desire to move from todays reactive suppression of enemy air defenses to the ability to preemptively destroy enemy air defenses the air force is likely to emphasize programs that will also help solve these two problems perhaps the most powerful technique for shortening the sead targeting time line is sensor fusion it may be that by emphasizing programs in their fy2002 budgets that fuse airborne sensor data the air force and navy may more effectively destroy future enemy air defenses on february 5 2001 dod announced its new actds for fy2001 one of them called networkcentric collaborative targeting ncct is an example of this sort of sead approach this program will attempt to network operational isr sensors found or platforms such as rc135 rivet joint jstars awacs global hawk predator u2 and the navys ep3 in an attempt to significantly improve the capability to detect identify and locate time critical targets such as enemy air defenses these sensors have different but complementary capabilities by networking these sensors and processing the data in collaborative way dod hopes to reduce target location error and targeting time lines the us central command is the operational sponsor of this program which has planned completion date of fy2005 another high priority to more quickly attack enemy sam systems is the acceleration of the fielding and integration of link16 on as many combat aircraft as feasible this capability could facilitate the automated sharing of fused information among battle space participants and could significantly improve tactical command and control especially when coupled with plaid capability link16 capable aircraft may more quickly pass location cuing and targeting information to other aircraft that may be better positioned or better armed to prosecute that attack the acceleration of the procurement of the hts version 7 and the advanced targeting pod may also be important sead priorities the air force eventually wants enough f16cjs with atps to support all 10 aefs one way to attack an enemy sam radar that wont emit is to trick it into emitting the mal d and itald may be high air force and navy priorities in fy2002 because they should be able to use these decoys to stimulate enemy integrated air defenses once turned on the enemy radar will be more easily avoided or attacked the air force is aiming for mald production run in fy2002 the navys aargm and quick bolt programs are other approaches to destroying enemy radar that limit their emissions and these will likely be emphasized in the fy2002 budget cycle the aargm atd is expected to be complete at the end of calendar year 2001 and will include test firings at the navys china lake range in march and august critical juncture for the program say industry officials is the fy2003 budget when the navy must decide to commit 300 million to the program for systems development and demonstration industry representatives also say that the

priority actd in fy 2000 is in its first phase navy scientists and engineers hope to integrate the quick bolt receiver and transmitter with aargm to begin demonstrating improved situational awareness self protection in terms of self protection navy priorities appear very focused the fa18ef is the top aviation priority and idecm is the top self protection priority the navy considers the alq126 rfcm to be obsolete during kosovo any navy or marine corps aircraft that operated the alq126 f14s and fa18s were not allowed to fly over land where serbias most threatening sams were located idecms alq 214 rfcm will replace the alq126 and aspj idecms aste and the bol ir countermeasures dispenser are also important to the navy and may play an important role in fy2002 activities air force requirements officials indicate that they would like to replace many of the older self protection systems such as the alq131 and alq184 jamming pods but believe that the numbers involved would require funding currently beyond what is likely available it may be then that these improvements will be on the air forces fy2002 unfunded priority list54 in addition to these legacy jamming pods the air force self protection efforts will likely focus on completing the engineering manufacturing and development emd phase of the plaid system increasing ale50 production and making progress on the aste program the laircm program and long duration ir threat protection systems like the bol dispenser considerations for congress the previous sections provide snapshot of dods activities to improve its electronic attack sead and self protection capabilities and where improvements reportedly still need to be made during the research and study of these issues number of concerns related to congressional interests emerged these concerns can be divided into two groups those that could be addressed immediately and those that have longer time horizon the first and over arching congressional concern may be the ew budget considering the importance of ew are the services spending an appropriate amount on ew programs many argue that as the united states moves toward warfighting concepts that emphasize the use of information and communications technology to make better and faster decisions on the battlefield ew becomes increasinglyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30841crs21 55 moloko john let the navy do the prowling marine corps gazette december 2000 p 42important have the services and dod accepted this perspective and if so is it reflected in their spending priorities sub issue concerns the emphasis the services place on electronic attack versus sead versus self protection generally speaking the navys budgeting priorities suggest an emphasis on electronic attack the air forces budgetary priorities suggest an emphasis on sead both services appear to put less emphasis on self protection relative to the other sub components of ew this raises the issue of finding the best balance of ew resources the second immed iate concern pertains to the ea6b fleet and may be as important as any other issue raised in this paper can dod wring the most warfighting effectiveness from the 124 airframe fleet as possible over the next 10 years kosovo clearly illustrated both the importance of these radar jamming aircraft to the success of the air campaign and also how thinly stretched the fleet could become post kosovo the navy has taken steps to increase the prowlers combat capability including procuring nvds and taking steps to create new squadron yet they are still constrained to finite number of airframes it appears unlikely that the navy will acquire more radar jamming airframes before 2010 and the air force has stated that they will develop their own radar jamming capabilities based on the ea aoa recommendations to be fielded in the 2010 time frame one approach that may generate more combat effectiveness out of the prowler fleet would be to create fifth marine corps ea6b squadron from the current marine corps inventory of 20 aircraft the marine corps currently divides these 20 aircraft into four squadrons of five aircraft each all 14 navy squadrons as point of comparison are composed of four prowlers each navy requirements and operational officers say that all ea6b squadrons are deployed on an equal basis the navy tries to schedule deployments so that single squadron gets burnt out while another rests regroups and trains in the united states thus if all squadrons are deployed equally those containing five aircraft may get less work than those with four it has been sugg ested that by reducing todays marine corps squadrons to four aircraft each and creating an additional marine corps ea 6b squadron the overall ea6b fleet workload would be more equitably distributed and the fleet more able to address its farflung responsibilities if maintenance or other issues make it difficult for the marine corps to organize their aircraft into fourplane squadrons an alternative suggestion coming from recent professional journal is to surrender this mission to the navy55 the issue of which of the various schemes for best organizing the ea6b force is most viable remains unresolved in addition to getting the most bang for the buck from the ea6b fleet improving dods capability to suppress or destroy enemy air defenses is another important consideration currently the navy and air force appear to have distinctive approaches to this problem the navy is attempting to improve its missiles ability to find nonemitting enemy radars and target them and other high value sam battery assets such as the missile launcher the air force on the other hand is attempting to improve the aircrafts ability to find the adversary and will use less expensivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30841crs22 56 wall robert usaf updates plans for future air wars aviation week space technology january 29 2001 for more information on the f22 raptor see crs issue brief ib87111 57 nswac threat emitter briefing mr richard gent mr john smith january 18 2001 fallon nasweapons or weapons that dispense submunitions to attack the target in short the navy is putting the smarts on the missile while the air force is putting the smarts on the aircraft or targeting pod more broadly speaking the air force appears to favor more advanced platforms to perform tomorrows sead mission than does the navy the air force proposes that the f22 raptor is the platform best able to achieve and maintain air superiority both by clearing the skies of enemy fighters and by destroying enemy air defenses56 recent statements by the chief of staff of the air force and other air force officials on the compatibility of ew and low observable platforms and the air forces need to populate aerospace expeditionary forces aefs with ew aircraft suggest that the f22 would operate with support from these assets the navy implicitly takes more modest approach to achieving tomorrows sead goals proposing to use the more conventional fa18ef super hornet also supported by an electronic attack aircraft to attack enemy air defenses considering the importance and difficulty of suppressing or destroying enemy air defenses it may be that pursuing two different strategies is prudent overall approach but questions persist on matters of continuing congressional interest does achieving tomorrows sead goals require relatively modest upgrades to todays platforms and munitions or does the united states need significantly more advanced aircraft and targeting capabilities than it has today congress may wish to consider whether one of these approaches is superior to the other and whether cost savings could be achieved by pursuing only one strategy another sead issue pertains to training naval aviators for example develop and hone their jamming and sead skills at fallon naval air station by flying against real russian sam radars and other foreign military equipment however officials at the naval strike and air warfare center at fallon report that they suffer chronic shortage of these very useful radars not because they dont exist but because us intelligence agencies own them but these officials say apparently wont lend them to fallon57 this too is an ongoing issue fourth concern that congress may wish to address in the near term is the continuing difference of opinion between congress and dod on the effectiveness of current radar warning receivers upgrading aircraft rwrs does not appear to be high priority for dod yet congress has expressed consistent concern that older rwrs offer inadequate protection against emerging enemy sams senate appropriators for instance wrote the committee is concerned that many of the defense departments active and reserve fighter aircraft have inade quate radar warning receivers most fighter aircraft have infrared warning systems however it is clear to adversaries thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30841crs23 58

strategies defense information and electronics report april 7 2000us forces rely on the ability to achieve air dominance further these adversaries have greater access than ever to antiaircraft missile systems with advanced seeker technologies while future aircraft are being designed with protection systems we cannot afford to leave todays forces illequipped to face the threat while data links and information from other sensors can contribute to pilots situation awareness it is not clear this will be adequate for pilot to avoid an unexpected threat58 this difference of opinion remains unresolved the final near term issue for congress is the ea aoa which should conclude its study late in this calendar year many ea aoa participants have indicated that the study will probably not recommend single solution to replacing the prowler but instead will recommend menu of solutions that the different services can implement as they see fit such an approach may have merit because it affords flexibility however this approach can also risk falling prey to making recommendations based on the least common denominator and make not the best recommendation but the one that all parties can agree on congress may wish to closely monitor this activity there is another set of issues pertaining to ew and sead that dont necessarily need to be addressed immediately yet because they are complex and multifaceted their resolution may take considerable time and effort and therefore they invite scrutiny the first issue pertains to persistent reports of dods fractionated ew efforts it has been noted by several different bodies that dod does not have coherent approach to ew issues gaos january 3 2001 report comprehensive strategy needed for suppressing enemy air defenses notes that within the department of defense comprehensive crossse rvice strategy for closing the gap between the service s suppression capabilities and needs exists and coordinating entity has been tasked with preparing such strategy p3 the department of defense itself recognizes that its overall ew efforts are unsatisfactory in march 2000 under secretary of defense jacques gansler initiated study of 18 different ew programs that proved disappointing gansler wanted to determine how osd and the services may have contributed to these disappointments and to identify what processes could be developed to improve on these results59 congress may wish to consider how it could help dod approach ew challenges from the more unified perspective its leadership appears to seek the second issue pertains to the continued organizational placement of ew under information operations io in the air force bureaucracy the chief recommendation of group commissioned to independently study how to improve the air forces ew activities was that the air force should promote ew from its current position as subset of information operations and refocus it under new acquisitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30841crs24 60

has made organizationa l changes designed to elevate ew issues within budget and acquisition debates congressional ew advocates may wonder whether the booming cyberwarfare sphere will continue to overshadow ew needs in the air force requirements process the final issue pertains to expediting the transition of promising ew and sead programs to the warfighter notably innovative networkbased
