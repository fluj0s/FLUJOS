g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 land exchange popularly viewed as swap or trade is real estate transaction where the disposal sale and acquisition purchase of land are combined the bureau of land management blm in the department of the inte rior doi is authorized to exchange land or interests in land under the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma as amended by the federal land exchange facilitation act of 1988 flefa1 an interest in land is something less than full ownership such as easements or mineral timber or water rights2 blm implementing regulations are contained in 43 cfr 2200 additional information is contained in blms land exchange handbook3 and various agency instruction memoranda selected provisions of these sources are summarized below additionally congress sometimes enacts legislation authorizing and governing specific land exchanges legislated land exchanges generally follow the process and procedures outlined in this report unless the statute provides otherwise exchanges can be used to change the checkerboard pattern of federal state and privately owned lands in the west that resulted from early land grants land consolidation can increase the efficiency of land management while decreasing management costs exchanges allow for land transactions on large scale they can be used to consolidate hundreds of scattered isolated tracts that likely would have chance of sale to the same owner also exchanges may be valuable for facilitating transactions with private landowners who want land instead of cash and for reconfiguring state lands blm land exchanges have sometimes been controversial federal audits performed earlier this decade criticized exchanges for shortchanging the public and lacking in clear and consistent authorities they included audits by the doi office of the inspector general oig the government accountability office gao and th appraisal foundation taf these audits received significant attention from congress doi the media and interest groups in response blm and doi implemented changes perhaps most notably the consolidation of appraisal functions in new office discussed below blm typically completes dozens of exchanges each year under flpma and acts of congress in fy2006 for instance blm issued 58 deeds or patents for exchanged lands totaling 28397 acres in seven states with an appraised value of 144 million in the same period blm received 21 deeds for land totaling 26666 acres with value of 69 million blm also acquired and disposed of lands under other authorities 1 43 usc 17151716 these statutes apply to the forest service in the department of agriculture as well but this report relates only to blm for information on acquisition and disposal

lands in an exchange must be located in the same state4 g18g158g139g149g146g140g561g11g151g157g142g155g142g156g157g561 land exchanges must be in the public interest public land may be exchanged if the secretary of the interior determines that the public interest will be well served 43 usc 1716a blm often trades land to achieve better federal land management for instance by consolidating ownership and disposing of land that is isolated or difficult to manage under blm regulations other considerations include protection of fish and wildlife habitat cultural resources watersheds wilderness and aesthetic values enhancement of recreational opportunities and public access consolidation of lands to improve development and expansion of communities the resource values and public benefits of the federal lands to be conveyed may not be more than those of the nonfederal lands being acquired further the intended use of the conveyed federal lands should not conflict significantly with management of adjacent federal and indian trust lands 43 cfr 220006b in making an exchange blm is to reserve any rights or interests that are needed to protect the public interest and may impose restrictions on the use of lands conveyed g7g154g158g138g149g561g24g138g149g158g142g561 under law the value of the lands exchanged are to be equal or if they are not equal they are to be equalized by the payment of money up to 25 of the value of the federal lands conveyed in the exchange the parties in the exchange may agree to waive this payment within limitations including if it involves not more than 3 of the value of the federal lands or 15000 another way of equalizing value is for either party to add or remove lands further the secretary of the interior may exchange lands that are of approximately equal value under certain conditions including if the value of the federal lands does not exceed 150000 43 cfr 22016 and 22015 g5g152g156g157g156g561 typically the blm and other parties share equally in the administrative costs of an exchange for instance the cost of the appraisal of lands mineral examinations cultural resource surveys and addressing deficiencies preventing highest and best use of the land however the parties can agree that one party may bear costs and responsibilities typically assumed by the other subject to certain terms

facilitate exchanges and reduce costs for instance by consolidating many federal parcels of limited value in other cases third parties secure lands that blm wants to acquire from multiple owners to facilitate negotiations both profit and nonprofit organizations have facilitated assembled land exchanges typically functioning as brokersagents for the exchange

existing law regulations and land use plans acquired lands that are within the boundaries of an area having an administrative or congressional designation such as natural conservation area become part of that unit or area and are managed accordingly g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561g152g143g561g7g161g140g145g138g151g144g142g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561 in practice exchanges may be proposed by blm private citizens or state or local government officials blm is to consider only proposals that conform with land use plans the secretary of the interior may determine that the mining laws and other public land laws do not apply for up to five years to federal lands under consideration for exchange to the extent that such laws authorize the acquisition or possession of the public lands subject to valid existing rights blm advises that many exchanges take between 18 and 24 months but the time depends on the complexities the exchange process typically occurs in five phases 1 development of an exchange proposal 2 feasibility evaluation 3 processing and documentation 4 decision analysis and approval and 5 title transfer blm field offices take the lead in negotiating and processing exchanges but blm headquarters must ultimately concur during development of an exchange proposal the federal and nonfederal parties have preliminary discussions to share information about goals and constraints and to screen proposals they develop written exchange proposal that includes legal description of the lands to be conveyed and the responsibilities of the parties blm checks the title of the nonfederal land to ensure its acceptability for acquisition and the survey and land status of the federal land to ensure its availability for disposal feasibility report documents the preliminary information on all aspects of the exchange including the public benefits consistency with blms land use plan cost and processing responsibilities anticipated land uses analysis of value schedule for completion and alternatives exchanges involving federal lands valued at more than 500000 are subject to review by the house and senate committees on appropriations at the feasibility stage all exchanges require review and concurrence at several levels including the doi solicitor blms national land exchange evaluation and assistance team lands program managers and state directors and ultimately the deputy director of bl m if the parties agree to proceed they sign nonbinding agreement to initiate an exchange that serves as framework the agreement is to address 17 items identified in blm regulations 43 cfr 22011cg and for exchanges involving third party facilitators is to include full disclosure provision exchange processing and documentation includes title review public notice and comment identification and resolution of environmental issues under the national environmental policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21967g14g138g151g141g561g7 g161g140g145g138

decision to approve or disapprove an exchange g16g7g18g3g561g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 blm must conduct an environmental analysis in accordance with nepa the analysis documents the impact of completing the exchange on the resources taking into account the likely future uses of the lands it includes evaluations of resources on the federal and nonfederal lands ordinarily the mineral potential of the lands is evaluated wildlife and vegetation species are identified water sources locations and rights are detailed forestry resources are assessed cultural and historic resources are catalogued recreational and other land uses are listed and contaminants are inventoried and the responsibilities of the parties may be addressed g3g153g153g155g138g146g156g138g149g561 blm regulations state that an exchange of lands shall be based on the market value of the federal and nonfederal lands as determined by the secretary through appraisals bargaining based on appraisals or arbitration in estimating market value the appraiser is to determine the highest and best use of the propertythe most probable use based on market evidence factors include historic wildlife recreation wilderness scenic cultural or other resource values or amenities that are reflected in prices paid for comparable properties in the open market interests in landsuch as minerals or water rightsalso are considered to the extent consistent with highest and best use according to blm regulations in the absence of current market information the parties may use other methods to estimate market value flefa provides that disputes over the appraised values of lands can be resolved by arbitration bargaining or other methods 2006 doi manual sets forth appraisal policies 6 appraisals are to reflect nationally recognized standards appraisers are guided by the uniform appraisal standards for federal land acquisitions and the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice both federal employees and contractors may conduct appraisals the appraiser prepares report estimating market value that describes the work conducted and sets forth the information and analysis supporting the estimate each appraisal report is to be reviewed and approved by review appraiser at the decision analysis and approval stage all proposed exchanges again require review and concurrence at several

benefits to the public determinations of market value and contradictions in policies and procedures for instance gao report concluded that the blm did not follow requirements to show that the public benefits of acquiring the nonfederal land in an exchange matched or exceeded the public benefits of retaining federal land raising doubts about whether these exchanges served the public interest 7 audit reports also criticized blm for valuing its land at far less than market value or for overvaluing nonfederal land to be acquired to make deals more attractive to nonfederal landowners report by the appraisal foundation determined that there were political pressures to change or ignore qualified market value opinions to create the appearance that exchanges were conducted at market value 8 taf also concluded that inconsistencies among blms guidance and directiv resulted in inconsistent development of market value opinions improper management of appraisal efforts and lack of compliance with laws and regulations g4g14g15g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g156g561 in response blm took steps to increase oversight of exchanges demonstrate how exchanges serve the public interest ensure that land is properly valued and ensure that exchanges are completed in compliance with law regulation and policy in 2003 blm formed the appraisal and exchange workgroup composed of staff from federal and state agencies to advise the agency on changes needed to address problems with appraisals and exchanges raised in audits9 blm chose to implement many of the groups recommendations including those to strengthen management of exchanges build public confidence develop new authorities enhance training and skills facilitate exchanges with states strengthen the ability to reach agreement on value define the role of facilitators and develop guidance for processing legislated exchanges significant change involved consolidating real estate appraisal functions from several doi bureaus into new appraisal services directorate asd effective november 12 2003 an independent appraisal office to protect appraisers from possible political pressures had been recommended by audit reports for decades under the reorganization to separate the appraisal function from realty decisions appraisers report to the asd rather than to doi realty personnel 2006 gao report found that this consolidation vastly improved the objectivity of appraisers but that some problems remained for instance some of the appraisals did not appear to comply with industry standards making their accuracy uncertain the extent

some critics have suggested discontinuing exchanges on the grounds that they have been problematic and are inherently difficult gao among others has recommended that congress consider ending exchanges in favor of buying and selling land for cash the agency has observed that exchanges can be complicated because landowner must find another who is willing to trade wants to acquire what is being offered and owns desired parcel of about the same value with cash sales sellers could sell unwanted parcels and use the cash to buy parcels they prefer advocates believe that this approach takes the subjectivity out of estimating value through appraisal procures the best price and simplifies transactions because there is requirement to equalize value or act within the same state some observers assert that newer blm authority to sell or exchange land and keep the money in special accounts for subsequent acquisitions has superseded need for flpma exchanges specifically the federal land transaction facilitation act 43 usc 2301 provides for the sale or exchange of land identified for disposal under blms land use plans the proceeds are available to acquire certain lands containing exceptional resources second law is more limited the southern nevada public land management act snplma pl 105263 allows blm to sell or exchange land around vegas with proceeds available to acquire environmentally sensitive lands in nevada advocates prefer these authorities because land values can be determined through the market and agencies can purchase lands independent of annual appropriations blm among others supports exchanging land under flpma for the many uses noted above under introduction exchange supporters claim that controversies over valuing properties with unique attributes or in highgrowth areas are as likely to occur for land that is sold or acquired as for land that is exchanged further blm contends that the majority of exchanges are not controversial exchange advocates also contend that blm has had limited and steadily decreasing funding for land acquisitions over the past several years and that blm thus needs exchange authority to acquire additional valuable land finally exchange proponents assert that reforms have addressed concerns with exchanges and appraisals 10 us government accountability office interiors land appraisal services
