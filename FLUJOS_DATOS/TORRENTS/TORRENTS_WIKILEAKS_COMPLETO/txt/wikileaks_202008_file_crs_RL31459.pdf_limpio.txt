overview of the canadian financial system while the canadian and american systems are generally similar in structure and function there are significant differences in market and regulatory practices and comparison may yield useful insights for oversight of the us financial system the bank of canada like the us fede ral reserve plays pivotal role in maintaining the macroeconomic stability of the canadian economy the canadian central bank implements monetary policy primarily through regulation of the interest rate on overnight loans between banks unlike the federal reserve the bank of canada has few regulatory powers and does not provide check clearing services regulation of commercial banking is in most respects similar to the us model the industry perhaps because of the smalle r market is dominated by six large banks which account for 92 of tota l industry assets canadian banking is world leader in the provision of electronic services to both retail and institutional customers canadas securities industry although it is regulated at the provincial rather than the national level displays striking gree of harmonization among regulators and markets half dozen provincial exchange s have been transfor med into one market for bluechip stocks one for stock deriva tives and one for startup companies and penny stocks notable difference from us market structure is that six of the seven largest securities firms are owned by banks the seventh is merrill lynch canada other financial intermediaries insurers trust and loan companies and mutual funds function much as their us count erparts do although the regulatory roles of federal and provincia l governments do not always correspond to us practice canada has confronted the same mismatches between marketplace developments in financial services and traditional industry and regulatory boundaries that made enactment of glba so difficult in the united states recent legislation has imposed similar regulatory and governance requirements on financial institutions in different industries base d for example on their size rather than on the particular products and services they sell the regula tory jurisdictions of federal

all central banks m onetary policy at the bank of canada has gone through several evolutions since february 1991 th focus of canadian monetary policy has been primarily on infl ationreduction targets6 the policy was introduced through joint statement with the minister of fina nce making canada only the second country in the postworld war ii period new zealand was first to introduce inflation targets7 although the bank had been consid ering becoming more explicit about its inflation objective the timing of the policy change was in part influenced by the introduction of new federal goods and services tax gst the use of inflation targets was seen as way to mitigate the effect on inflation expectations that would follow as result of the onetime jump in prices generated by the gst in addition the government had also expressed an inte rest in having an inflation targeting agreement8 in may 2001 the government of canada and the bank of canada agreed to continue for another fiveyear period the in flationcontrol target policy the best contribution monetary policy can makeis to preserve confidence in the value of money by providing individuals and busine sses with the certainty of

policy monetary policy implementation in canada is distinctly different from the current practice used by the us federa l reserve the canadian banking system operates without reserve requi rements as result the bank of canada focuses on tools that allow it to influence the market for the use of bank surplus transaction balances the bank of canada exercises mo re direct influence on interest rates in comparison to the us federal reserves system of manipulating the size of the money supply general framework of mone tary policy implementation the overnight interest rate serves as the mechanism whereby the banks monetary policy actions ar transmitted through the ec onomy ultimately affecting total spending and inflation the overnight interest rate is defined as the rate at which major participants in the money ma rket borrow and lend oneday funds to each other12 in practice financial institutions are engaged on daily basis in the clearing and settlement of payments at the end of the day some institutions will have surplus settlements balances while others will have deficit balances the overnight interest rate is the rate that is paid on the surplus balances lent to the institutions that need funds to cover their deficit balances the bank has created framework signed around this daily system of payment clearing and settling which allows it to influence the overnight interest rate in initiating monetary policy action th bank first announces target for the overnight rate after which the bank creates an operating band this sets an upper limit interest rate above the target rate and lower limit below the target rate at the end of the payment settlement day institutions with deficit balances are allowed to borrow from the bank at the upper limit of the operating band defined as the bank rate institutions with surplus balances are eligible to receive interest from the bank at rate equal to the lower limit of the operating band since institutions with surplus balances know they can receive an interest rate equal to the lower limit of the operating ba nd they have incentive to lend their balances at rate below the operating band conversely since institutions with deficit balances know they can borrow at rate equal to the bank rate the upper limit of the operating band they have incentive to pay at rate above the operating band as consequence the banks framework encourages all market participants to clear the overnight money market at an interest rate that is within the banks operating band without direct market participation by the bank the mechanics of monetary policy implementation the two primary systems through which payments are cleared and settled in canada are the large value transfer sy stem lvts introduced in february

maintain the target rate neutralization of government and bank of canada flows presettlement trading by market participants target rate announcements the implementation process begins w ith the announcement by the bank of change in the operating band the decision to change or not change the target rate is made by the governing council the announ cements are made at 900 am eastern time on the effective date of the ch ange in december 2000 the bank of canada switched to system of eight prespecifi ed dates for announcing any changes to the operating band and thus the bank rate16 open market transactions for both the lvts and the acss the po licy target rate for overnight funds is defined as the midpoint of the opera ting band the operating band for the lvts is 50 basis points 050 thus if the upper limit of the lvts was 350 the lower limit would be 300 and the policy target rate would be 325 the operating band for the acss is 150 basis points 150 in order to maintain the overnight rate near the specified policy target rate the bank is prepared to enter into open market operations these open market ope rations involve either the purchase of special purchase and resale agreements

neutralizing government and bank of canada flows the banks operating band framework pr ovides strong cost incentives for market participants to adjust their settlement positions in the market rather than rely on the banks facilities18 thus if the banks facilities are not used the market participants should be holding roughly zero balances at the end of the settlement day in order to allow the market participants to achieve close to zero settlement balances the bank must take actions to neutralize the impact of public sector monetary flows since the bank acts as the governments banker any net disbursement or receipt by the government on given day will result in an increase or decrease in the settlement balances of the market participants19 to offset the net public sector flow the bank engages in transactions that adju st the amount of government deposits held by market participants deposits of government funds are maintained among mark et participants in the form of financial instruments called r eceiver general deposits receiver general deposits mature and are auctioned on daily basis by the bank of canada in practice the bank knows by 300 pm easte rn time what the net flow of public sector funds will be on given day as re sult the net flow is offset through the difference between the total amount of r eceiver general deposits maturing and the amount that is auctioned off back into the market that is if there is net increase in settlement balances as result of net disbursement by the government the amount of receiver general deposits aucti oned by the bank will be less than the amount of receiver general deposits maturi ng the difference will be equal to the net disbursement the reverse will occur in the case of net receipt of funds by the government20 presettlement trading period in order to assist market participants in achieving roughly zero settlement balances the bank has established half hour presettlement trading period that

was the only system in place until 1999 checks are processed electronically at regional centers and private companies are in charge of transporting the checks it takes more than two days for check to clear anywhere in canada in fact the payment system is so efficient that banks credit accounts at the time of deposit canadians have the option of paying bills and procuring other services such as buying groceries electronically employers can also pay their employees electronically the acss accounts for almost 90 of the volume of electronic payments35 large value transfer system the lvts deals with interbank transfer s and transfers between banks and other financial institutions to be part of the lvts ba nk has to meet the technical requirements of the system and keep reserve amount with the bank of canada currently 14 banks are set up on the lvts infrastructure ot her banks can offer lvts services if they have an agreement with one of the 14 banks to process their transactions36 the lvts offers transactions that are in real time and runs credit checks on institutions making transfers once transaction has been made it cannot be reversed having irrevers ible transactions that take place in real time is essential to the smooth operation of the system the builtin credit reviews help to ensure that the institutions involved in the ltvs ar sound accounts are settled at the end of

total banking s ector assets which stood at about 12 in 1990 fell to less than 10 by the end of 1998 foreign banks have indicated that existing regulatory requirements make it difficult for them to compete in order to help sustain vi able foreign bank presence in canada the options available to foreign ba nks may need to be broadened60 during the past two decades canada has encouraged the liberalization of the regulatory framework governing international financial institutions including the right to establish new entrants consistent with this canadian regulatory barriers to entry by foreign financial institutions have been largely eliminated foreign banks have been permitted to blish subsidiaries in canada since 1980 and they are now eligible to open branches in addition other important restri ctions on financial services were eliminated under the canada us free trade agreement the north american free trade agreement and the world trade organization agreement consistent with the freedom being offered to domestic financial institutions through allowing financial holding compan ies changes to foreign bank entry rules provide foreign banks with greater choice foreign

increasing competition branching regime in addition to the existing option of tablishing foreign bank subsidiary in canada bill c8 offers foreign banks the option of establishing either fullservice branch or lending branch both types of branches have essentially the same business powers as foreign bank subsidiaries and domestic banks except with respect to deposit taking fullservice branch is not permitted to take retail deposits but can take deposits above 150000 lending branch on the other hand is not permitted to take posits large or small or bo rrow from the canadian public lending branches are primarily in the business of making loans in canada the main advantage of including two type s of branches in the foreign bank entry regime is that regulatory requirements can be tailored more closely to the activities of foreign banks operations in canada for example in light of the nature of their liabilities in canada lending branches are required to deposit only 100000 in approved assets with an ffiliated canadian financial institution lending branches are also subject to less frequent examina tion by office of the superintendent of financial institutions osfi than fullservice branches the ability to reduce canadian regulatory requirements for foreign bank branches relative to subsidiaries stems from the fact that canadian retail depositors funds are at risk in addition satisfactory regulation by the home country regulator is one of the conditions for llowing individual foreign banks to set up branches in canada while foreign bank branches are exempted from many regulations it should be empha sized that they are regula ted financial institutions in canada they are for example subject to federal regulations respecting such things as the cost of borrowing and the disclosure of interest and other charges in addition certain guidelines issued by osfi apply to foreign bank branches covering such things as accounting practices and deterring and detecting mone laundering federal regulation and oversight of fo reign bank branches are esse ntial to safeguarding the interests of consumers and enhancing the stability of the canadian financial sector the branching regime is designed to give foreign banks the same opportunities to compete in the canadian financial services market as canadian financial institutions canadian banks are subject to full

are not permitted to also operate fully regulated bank subsidiary or fullservice branch foreign banks are permitted to operate both bank subsidiary and fullservice branch requirements for foreign
