nonagricultural wo rkers h2b requires that employers conduct an affirmative search for available us workers and that the dol determine that admitting alien workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed us workers under this processknown as labor ce rtificationemployers must apply to the dol for certification that unemployed domestic workers are not available and that there will not be an adverse effect on us workers from the alien workers entry into the labor market the h2a visa has additional requirements aimed at protecting the alien h2a workers from exploitive working situations and preventing the domestic work force from being supplanted by alien workers willing to work for substandard wages most notably the employer must offer the h2a workers the highest of the federal or applicable state minimum wage the prevailing wage rate or the adverse effect wage rate aewr 4

stringent than labor certification in that it is statement of intent rather than documentation of actions taken any employer wishing to bring in an h1b worker must attest in an applicati on to the dol that the employer will pay the h1b worker the greater of the actual wages paid other employees in the same job or the prevailing wages for that occupation the employer will provide working conditions for the h1b worker that do not cause the working conditions of the other employees to be adversely affected and there is strike or lockout employers defined as h1b dependent generally at least 15 of

known as the foran act which made it unlawful to import aliens for the performance of labor or service of any kind in the united states 5 that bar on employmentbased immigration lasted until 1952 when congress enacted the immigration and nationality act ina sweeping law also known as the mccarranwalters act that brought together many disparate immigration and citizenship statutes and made significant revisions in the existing laws6 the 1952 act authorized visas for aliens who would perform needed services because of their high educational attainment technical training specialized experience or exceptional ability7 prior to the admission of these employmentbased immigrants however the 1952 act required the secretary of labor to certify to the attorney general and the secretary of state that there were not sufficient us workers able willing and qualifiedto perform this work and that the employment of such aliens would not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed us workers 8 this provision in the 1952 act 4 for more complete explanation of this provision and how it works see crs report rl32861 farm labor the adverse effect wage rate aewr by

streamlining maintain it would increase the speed with which employers could hire foreign workers and reduce the governments role in delaying or blocking such employment 52 others maintain that the streamlined attestation process may be adequate for employers hiring h 1b workers because those foreign workers also must meet rigorous educational and work experience requirements but that an

benefits than the displaced us workers in some instances the displaced workers reportedly have been asked to train their foreign replacements 68 the additional requirements for h1b dependent employers are expressly aimed at discouraging subcontractors who recruit h1b workers from placing the worker with another employer who had recently laid off us workers69 some employers argue that they will not be able to stay in business without expedient access to the contingent workers supplied by subcontractors some of whom are foreign nationals with the requisite skills these contingent workers meet the need for specialized seasonal intermittent or peakload workforce that is able to adapt with the market forces they express concern that labor market tests for visas may limit the flexibility of firms that are hiring the caliber of workers necessary to stay competitive in the global marketplace70 some observers have expressed concern that intracompany transferees on l1 visas should be admitted only after determination that comparable us personnel are not adversely affected particularly in the cases of foreign nationals entering as midlevel managers and specialized personnel they argue that the l1 visa currently gives multinational firms an unfair advantage over usowned businesses by enabling multinational corporations to bring in lowercost foreign personnel 71 66 federal register vol 69 247

the option of using unemployment rates and other economic indicators to determine what occupations and sectors might import foreign workers has arisen several times over the past few decades during the legislative debate leading up to the immigration act of 1990 supporters of this alternative argued that it would be more objective basis to govern employmentbased immigration and would place the priorities of the national economy ahead of individual employer preferences at that time however leading government economists acknowledged that they did not have labor force and other economic data available to make such determinations the option of using national and regional unemployment data to regulate foreign worker admissions arose most recently during the debate over comprehensive immigration reform in the 110 th congress echoing earlier arguments proponents also maintained such triggers would afford better protections for us workers opponents asserted that adoption of such policies would prompt some firms to relocate to areas in which they had access to foreign workers further harming us workers in locations with higher unemployment g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the legal entry of foreign workers into the united states has been governed by the same basic provisions since 1952 with some policy adjustments along the way decade ago the commission on immigration reform estimated that the labor certification process costs employers in administrative paperwork and legal fees total of 10000 per immigrant 73 as is apparent in the analysis above the current set of provisions and policies are visaspecific and yield various standards and thresholds for different occupations and sectors of the economy there are however common critiques underlying the recruitment of foreign workers with specialized expertise as well as workers with skills legislation that would comprehensively reform the ina may provide an opportunity to revise and update the labor market tests on the other hand consensus on the labor market tests may also be hurdle to enacting comprehensive immigration reform 72 us congress senate
