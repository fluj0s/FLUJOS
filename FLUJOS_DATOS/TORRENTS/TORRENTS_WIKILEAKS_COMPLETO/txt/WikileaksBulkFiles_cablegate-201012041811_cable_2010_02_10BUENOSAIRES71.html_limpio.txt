this is the first in series of cables which will address the argentine reaction to hydrocarbonsrelated activities in the falklandsmalvinas islands 2 c the goa is reportedly hardening its policy on the falklandmalvinas islands in response to accelerating oil exploration efforts under british authority that lack argentine participation or consent according to local press reports the foreign ministry has created plan to press argentinas historic claim to the islands which involves expressing displeasure to the uk to any companies involved and to the governments of the companies home countries this could involve the usg since an american supplier is sending drilling rig to the islands these steps follow 2007 resolution which threatens to cut off the argentine operations of any oil company that operates in the falklands without goa permission british diplomats in argentina are not sure how far the goa will take these threats and do not rule out an irrational response at present us energy company operating in argentina appears to be considering activity in the falklands end summary keep your oil equipment away from our islands 3 sbu argentine press reports on january 27 state that the argentine foreign ministry mfa has developed plan to resist oil exploration in the falklandsmalvinas islands located to the east of southern argentina territory claimed by the argentines and the british but controlled by the british british firm desire petroleum is reportedly moving drilling rig to the area to drill exploratory wells the goa plans to assert that any hydrocarbons operation in the malvinas area linked to the uk is illegal because by authorizing it the uk government is assuming competency in areas of the continental shelf which are subject to argentine jurisdiction and sovereignty the goa has reportedly planned three courses of action formal protest to the uk sending notes of discouragement to each company involved in such activities advising them that their actions are illegal and they could therefore face legal sanctions and in the case where companies are not british sending protest notes to the corresponding governments signaling goa concern over the illegal activities and noting possible sanctions the usg could receive note under the third category because the us firm diamond drilling owns drilling rig route to the islands and expected to be in place by midfebruary 4 sbu the above goa policy would be consistent with energy secretariat resolution 407 issued in 2007 which threatens to terminate the argentine activities including the cancellation of all energy concessions of any company that operates in the falklands area without express goa permission energy analyst daniel gerold sees little chance of goa sanctions against companies while the process remains in the exploration stage however in the event of significant hydrocarbons discovery either petroleum or natural gas which he believes is more likely gerold foresees the goa making it major issue as more companies become involved in the extraction process and as the goa perceives it is missing out on significant revenue stream what next brits concerned 5 c argentina launched the first diplomatic shot across the british bow on february 2 british diplomats in argentina confirmed to econoff that the goa delivered formal protest to their chargc that afternoon uk political officers lynda st cooke and oliver moss the latter former shell oil employee previously told econoff january 28 that while such protest was expected and routine they receive numerous falklandsrelated communications from the goa each year they were still concerned over where goa actions might lead their concern is over the shape of future sanctions on companies as well as threats and protests against energy companies operating in the falklands by ngos including environmental activists 6 c on possible sanctions st cooke believes that the goa will seek to make an example of company if possible and she wondered what would happen if the first company to cross the line in the sand were one with significant activities in argentina she cited schlumberger as an example of company which could provide services for oil extraction in the falklands given its extensive global operations including within argentina she noted that stopping its argentine operations would be very detrimental to argentine hydrocarbons production while pursuing such an action would be irrational for the goa she said we cant rule it out she added that this is very onesided issue in argentina since there are virtually advocates for relinquishing argentinas claim to the islands which is taught as sacred writ to argentine children beginning in elementary school there could be significant political pressure on the goa to take action in case of an oil discovery gerold agreed and suggested that following significant hydrocarbon find the goa would quickly seek to begin operations in its undisputed exclusive economic zone eez as close as possible to the location of the find 7 sbu us companies currently operating in argentina have not indicated an interest to participate in current exploration activities near the falklands randy smith exxonmobils public and government affairs manager told econoff january 29 that his company is not interested comment 8 c although the budgetstrapped argentine military is illprepared for any course of action involving projection of power the goa would likely feel compelled by significant hydrocarbon find to press argentinas historic claims by any other possible means strategy of tough talk complaints in international fora and protest letters is likely with economic sanctions against participating companies possible even if they might damage argentinas own hydrocarbons output martinez
