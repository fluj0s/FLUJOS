from gary funkhouser garyltrrarizonaedu to kbriffaueaacuk subject kyrgyzstan and siberian data date thu 19 sep 1996 153709 0700 keith thanks for your consideration once i get draft of the central and southern siberian data and talk to stepan and eugene ill send it to you i really wish i could be more positive about the kyrgyzstan material but i swear i pulled every trick out of my sleeve trying to milk something out of that it was pretty funny though i told malcolm what you said about my possibly being too graybilllike in evaluating the response functions he laughed and said thats what he thought at first also the datas tempting but theres too much variation even within stands i dont think itd be productive to try and juggle the chronology statistics any more than i already have they just are what they are that does sound graybillian i think ill have to look for an option where i can let this little story go as it is not having seen the sites i can only speculate but id be optimistic if someone could get back there and spend more time collecting samples particularly at the upper elevations yeah i doubt ill be over your way anytime soon too bad id like to get together with you and ed for beer or two probably someday though cheers gary gary funkhouser lab of treering research the university of arizona tucson arizona 85721 usa phone 520 6212946 fax 520 6218229 email garyltrrarizonaedu
