authorities status and costs david m bearden specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division summary how to address safety h ealth and environmental ri sks from potential exposure to abandoned or discarded military munitions has been longstanding issue there has been particular concern among the public about such risks at older decommissioned military properties that have been in civilian use for many years and at closed military bases still awa iting redevelopment ma ny of these properties contain former training ranges and munitions disposal sites wher the extent of unexploded ordnance uxo and related environm ental contamination is not fu lly understood the approval of another round of military base closings in 2005 raised additional concerns about munitions risks on certain bases and whet her cleanup challenges may limit their civilian reuse this report discusses the potential hazards of military munitions and related contamination the authorities of the department of defe nse dod to address these hazards the status and costs of clea nup efforts and issues for congress potential safety health and environmental risks explosives can remain live in munitions and present safety risk for many years even decades after their military use has ceased especially if munitions are buried and thereby protected from degradation munitions used in training exercises do not always detonate upon impact and can burrow beneath the surface where they can remain buried munitions that remain on the surface also can be difficult to locate and recover especially on ranges with dense vegetation that may c onceal munitions the disposal of munitions also can present lingering safety risks if m unitions are not properly neutralized and are left intact sites where munitions were meant to be destroyed in bulk by open burning or open detonation in earthen pits frequently contain some live munitions in such cases certain munitions may not detonate nd may be buried by the explosive force of other munitions in addition to the more immediate safety risks from explosives chemical constituents in munitions can leach into the environment and present potential health risks if pathway of exposure is present through the air soil groundwater or surface water longterm exposure to contaminants can increase the risks of certain health effectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22862crs2 1 10 usc 2710 and 10 usc 2703b respectively 2 10 usc 2701k 3 40 cfr part 266 subpart m military munitions ruledepending on the nature of particular contamin ant and the duration and concentration of exposure for example pe rchlorate is common substan ce used in munitions there has been increasing attention to the potential health risks of this substance in conjunction with efforts to regulate exposure thr ough drinking water see crs report rs21961 perchlorate contamination of drinking wa ter regulatory issu and legislative actions by mary tiemann statutory cleanup authorities for many years dod addressed potential risks from munitions on former training ranges and disposal sites without consolidat ed effort in place to track progress and costs in response to concerns among states co mmunities and envir onmental organizations about the adequacy of these efforts congress included provi sions in sections 311 and 312 of the national defense au thorization act for fiscal year 2002 pl 1071071 requiring dod to establish comprehensive pr ogram to identify investigate and clean up munitions on former us military training ranges in the united states including us territories these provisions also require th cleanup of discarded m unitions that were not properly disposed of in the united states and the cleanup of contaminants leached from munitions into the environment dod tablished military munitions response program within its defense environmenta l restoration program to fulfill these requirements section 312 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 pl 1073142 later required dod to appoint si ngle official to manage these efforts in accordance with the above authorities the military munitions response program addresses the cleanup of former training ranges and munitions disposal sites on both active and closed military installations in the united states the cleanup of operational training ranges is administered separately as an operation and maintenance activity on an installationbyinstallation ba sis relatively little cleanup is performed on operational ranges as long as they remain operational dod generally clears munitions from its operational ranges to the extent necessary for the safety of military personnel to gain access to those lands for training once munitions are removed from an operational range they are subject to federal re gulations that govern their disposal3 more extensive cleanup of operational ranges can be required if contaminants leached from munitions migrate offsite and present poten tial risks to adjacent populations the authorities for the military munitions response program also do not extend to training ranges at us military installations located in other nations the status of forces agreement between the us government and the government of each nation in which us forces are stationed ie the host nati on generally governs the cleanup of munitions and other hazardous contamina tion under these agreements the extent to which the us government is held responsible for cleanup at us military installations abroad can vary widely from one nation to anotherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22862crs3 4 42 usc 9601 et seq 5 42 usc 6901 et seq 6 32 cfr part 179degree of cleanup required although the above laws authorized the investigation and cl eanup of former military training ranges and munitions disposal s ites in the united states the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla commonly referred to as superfund4 generally governs the degree of cleanup at individual sites and how cleanup is accomplished cercla also sp ecifies that requirements of the solid waste disposal act5 must be met which generally applies to disposal facilities operated with permits issued under that latter statut these laws generally require cleanup decisions to be based on potential risks and allow multiple types of actions to address those risks rather than one approach th environmental protection agency epa and the states are responsible fo r overseeing dods efforts to cl ean up munitions and related contamination to ensure that applicable requirements of the above statutes are met the degree of cleanup required can vary cons iderably from site to site depending on the pathways of exposure that would result fro m the current or anticipated land use and the means to prevent exposure for example munitions may be cleared to certain depth beneath the surface at some sites whereas rface clear ance only may be performed at others regardless of the depth of clearance removal of munition often is accomplished not by transporting it from the site but by detonating it in place referred to as blow in place bip because of the sensitivity of m unitions to disturbance detonation in place often is safer way to eliminate the explosive risk rather than unearthing munition and transporting it elsewhere for disposal in some cases restrictions on public access are used to manage potential risks allowing munitions to be left in place for example access restrictions are used at many sites where clearing vegetation to locate munitions would destroy wildlife habita t or plant species protected by federal or state law status of cleanup as indicated in table 1 dod had identified 3537 sites as of the end of fy2007 on former training ranges and munitions dispos sites in the united states that warranted investigation to determine whether munitions and related contamin ation were present nearly half of these potentially contaminated lands are located on formerly used defense sites fuds decommissioned before the first consolidated base realignment and closure brac round in 1988 many of the fuds sites are from the world war ii era and earlier installations closed under th brac rounds contained the least number of sites most of the other sites are located on active military installations in october 2005 dod promulgated regula tions for prioritizing response actions among munitions sites base d primarily on potential risks6 numerous factors determine the degree of risks at an individual site such as the type of munitions present whether munitions are located at or below the surf ace the accessibility of site the proximity of munitions to populated areas human health and environmental risks from potential exposure to munitions contaminants and whether cultural or ecological resources arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22862crs4 present of the sites identified so far pla nned response actions were complete at 920 sites as of the end of fy2007 dod deemed that response actions likely would not be needed at 470 sites because munitions were not known or suspected to be present or potential risks were thought to be low enough not to warrant response response actions were under way or planned at 1113 s ites dod had not completed or begun its evaluation of potential risks at 1034 sites

at that time the table shows amounts spent on the cleanup of munitions back to fy1997 prior to that time the costs to clean up munition sites were not broken out from the costs to clean up other hazards at nonmunitions sites the lack of breakout of costs for each type of site prior to fy1997 makes it difficult to determine the total funds dod has expended on munitions cleanup historically dod spent total of 124 billion from fy1997 through fy2007 on the cleanup of munitions and related contamination at former training ranges and munitions disposal sites it had identified dod estimated that another 1923 billion would be needed from fy2008 into the future to complete outsta nding cleanup actions planned at that time cleanup at fuds sites accounts for 68 of the estimated future costs

defense environmental programs fiscal year 2007 annual report to congress march 2008 appendix p o21 dollar amounts reflect cumulative costs of the cleanup process at individual munitions sites administered under the military munitions response program although these amounts represent the bulk of the costs they do not reflect the costs of certain activities at the program level such as management and support costs and activities that may apply to multiple installations including these additional activities the department of defense fiscal year 2007 agency financial report estimated total future costs of 209 billion for the military munitions response program from fy2008 thro ugh site completion this report did not indicate the total past costs of all related program activities for comparison munitions in underwater areas the above site status and costs focus on th cleanup of former training ranges and munitions disposal sites on land munitions so are known or suspected to be present in underwater areas adjacent to some training ra nges in some cases obsolete or damaged munitions were dumped offshore submerge d munitions generally have received less attention than munitions on land because of the perceived lower risks of human exposure locating and removing munitions underwater also presents greater challenges making it more difficult and costlier undertaking th an cleanup on land challenges arising from the cleanup of munitions can be multiplie d several times when munitions are found underwater in some cases removing mun itions from underwater areas could present greater risks than leaving the munitions in place and warning individuals to avoid them although the cleanup of munitions in underw ater areas has recei ved less attention there has been rising concern about potential risks especially in coastal areas where dod disposed of surplus or damaged munitions the us armed forces disposed of many of these weapons during the world war ii era in response to requirements in section 314 of the john warner national defense author ization act for fiscal year 2007 pl 109 364 dod has released more recent informa tion on the past disposal of chemical weapons off us shores7 congress also has funded p ilot program to identify chemical weapons at known disposal sites off the coas t of hawaii while concern about potentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22862crs6 risks has heightened locating the weapons at these and other sites would be challenging the exact coordinates of offshore disposal sites are uncertain and ocean currents could have moved the weapons over time if found removing the weapons could present other obstacles issues for congress members of congress states communities and environmental organizations have expressed concern about the adequacy and p ace of the cleanup of munitions and related contamination at the current inventory of sites and have questioned whether munitions may be present at other sites not yet identif ied the capability of current technologies to locate and neutralize munitions efficiently and effectively also has been an issue the cleanup of fuds sites has caused the greatest concern among the public many of these properties ceased to be used for military purpos decades ago and have been put to variety of civilian uses including residential use in some cases potential risks on these lands have motivated desires for greater funding to speed the pace of cleanup the challenge of cleaning up munitions on closed bases awaiting reuse has motivated interest in greater funding to speed the pace of ec onomic redevelopment to replace lost jobs there has been less concern among the public about munitions sites on active installations primarily because these sites pose little if an immediate safety risks to the general civilian population ho wever some communities adj acent to active installations have expressed concern bout health risks from potential exposure to munitions contaminants that may migrate offsite through groundwater some also have questioned whether dods estimates of fu ture costs reflect actual funding needs uncertainties about the degr ee of cleanup that will be required at many sites make it challenging to accurately estimate the outstandi ng costs to complete cleanup dod estimates cleanup costs based on its current knowledge of indivi dual site conditions and its assumptions about the response actions that will be required to close out these sites dod revises its cost estimates as more is learned about the type and extent of contamination present at each location and th actions that federal and state regulators will require to address potential risks in effect these estimates are moving targets that change as more information becomes available to project the costs of future actions considering that many sites are not eval uated and that additional sites could be identified in the future dods most recent assumptions of the resources that may be necessary to address cleanup ch allenges could differ from wh at may be required actual costs could be higher than estimated if more munitions and contamination are discovered than expected and more extensive cleanup is needed than anticipated new or more stringent cleanup standards also could cause costs to rise whether more attention is given to munitions in underwater areas is nother factor that could contribute to the possible need for greater resources to m eet cleanup needs on the other hand the development of more costeff ective technologies to locate and neutralize munitions and clean up related contamination c ould help to control costs the effect of inflation over time also could cause actual costs to differ from current estimates in carrying out its statutory authorities dod continues to work w ith federal and state regulators to determine the degree of cleanup that is warranted to protect human safety health and the environment as this process unfolds more information will become available to assess the resources needed to address potential risks both in terms of appropriations by congress and the capab ilities of munitions cleanup technologies
