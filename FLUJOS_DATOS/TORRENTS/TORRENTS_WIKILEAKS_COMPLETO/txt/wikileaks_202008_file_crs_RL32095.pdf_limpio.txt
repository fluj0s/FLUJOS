fbi is the nations premier law enforcement organization responsible for gathering and reporting facts and comp iling evidence in cases involving federal jurisdic tion it has broad ju risdiction in federal law enforcement and in national security and is statutory member of the us intelligence community from its official inception in 1908 the fbis mission jurisdiction and resources ve grown substantially in parallel with the real or perceived threats to american society culture political institutions and overall security in fy 2003 the organization has approximately 26000 employees about 12000 of whom are special agents the fb i has had many ccesses in countering criminal and hostile foreign intelligence and terrorist activity in its storied history however in its zeal to protect us na tional security the fbi occasionally exceeded its mandate and infringed upon the protected ri ghts of us citizens currently the fbi is undergoing massive re organization to shift its cu lture from reaction to crimes already committed to detection deterrence and prevention of terrorist attacks against us interests the fbi continues to be major domestic and international force in the war against terrorism the fbi one element of the us department of justice is led by director appointed by the pr esident with the advice and consent of the senate the director is appointed for single 10year term to insulate the investigative agency from tacit or perceived political pressures the fbi director is not member of the presidents cabinet although he reports to one the us attorney general the current organizational schema of the fbi has three main elements headquarters 56 field offices and 45 legal attaches overseas the degree of autonomy with which field offices have operated with respect to headquarters has osc illated over time currently h eadquarters is assuming more assertive role in directin g field activities and demandi ng accountability particularly with respect to the fbis national secur ity responsibilities while the fbi has long had counterterrorism as top tier priority the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 were catalyst for developing definitiv list of ranked prior ities on may 29 2002 counterterrorism became the fbis sole number one prio rity other major priorities include countering foreign intelligence activ ity directed against the united states countering cybercrime and working agains t public corruption the fbis priorities continue to reflect its traditional law enforcement mission but the fbis national security mission has assumed an unprecedente d degree of prominence in order to successfully implement its mission the fbi has extensive relationships with other federal executive agencies including other members of the us intelligence community it also has an important netw ork of relationships with state and local law enforcement and overseas law enfor cement agencies and security services relevant pending bills

federal bureau of investigation fbi is the lead agency in the department of justice doj which has the dual mission of protecting us national security and combating criminal activities as statutory member of the us intelligence community it is charged with maintaining domestic security by investigating foreign intelligence agentsofficers and terrorists who pose threat to us national security the bureaus criminal investigative prio rities include organized crime and drug trafficking public corruption white collar crime and civil rights violations in addition the bureau investigates signifi cant federal crimes in cluding but not limited to kidnaping extortion bank robberies child exploitation and pornography and international child abduction the fbi also provides training and operational assistance to state local and international law enforcement agencies the fbis expertise in national and international law enforcement may be taken for granted today1 because the organization had relatively little jurisdiction in its early years result of nascent federal criminal law development the organization demonstrated substantial creativity in using its existing authority to combat criminal behavior for example in its infamous i nvestigations into the organized crime and gangster activities of john dillinge r and others in the early 20th century the fbi then known as the bureau of investigati on and department of justice relied on jurisdiction in more discrete areas of crime such as fugitive status and interstate motor vehicle theft to arrest and prosecute organized crime cases more recently the fbi has developed into na tional investigative agency and established national identification system uniform crime reporting system as well as forensic science program that are heavily relied upon by st ate and local law enforcement some would argue that by instituting rigorous law enforcement training and employment qualifications the fbi ushered in an er of unprecedented prof essionalism in law enforcement moreover as the forces of globalization became prominent in the late 20th century the fbi expanded its internati onal influence by developing important relationships with overseas law enfor cement and security services these relationships continue to pay divi dends in the war against terrorism2 today thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32095crs2 2continued

bureau is considered one of the worlds premier investigative agencies and has had numerous successes implementing its criminal and national security missions in recent years it has b een criticized for its handling of number of cases these cases include the waco and ruby ridge sieges the oklahoma city bombing documents the alamos nati onal laboratory espiona ge investigation the atlanta olympic

agents in latin america as intelligence operativ as part of the fbis special intelligence service in 1939 about 360 fbi agents were st ationed in latin america during the second world war as intelligence operatives such postings however exacerbated the growing rivalry between hoover and william j donovan the founder of the wartime office of strategic services oss the forerunner of the central intelligence agency the fbi pulled out of latin america at the end of the war and foreign intelligence and espionage matters were ultimately given to the centra l intelligence agency when that agency was established in 1947 see athan g theoharis with tony g poveda susan rosenfeld and richard powers the fbi comprehensive reference guide 2000 12for an historical perspective on this era see

played an integral ro in these roundups and deportations9 as the tide of public opinion turned agai nst the federal governments antired tactics hoover successfully distanced himself from these policies incoming attorney general harlan fiske stone ppointed hoover acting and then permanent bureau director in 1924 hoover approached his new job with zeal and is largely credited with remaking the bureau by among other factors standardizing some facets of bi operations and basing appointme nts and promotions on merit rather than political connections moreover hoover promoted the bureaus public image by pursuing highprofile public enemies depression era bank r obbers and gangsters in 1933 the bureau of investigation was re named the division of investigation in 1935 it was renamed the

such operations were aimed at not only fascist organizations like the pronazi german american bund but at the communist party usa and other leftist organizations as well11 the end of the second world war did not bring about reduction in fbi domestic security investigations instead they increased as ussoviet tensions mounted with revela tions that us atom bomb secrets were betrayed to the soviets

1960s the fbi had many succe sses in countering espionage activities conducted by us citizens on be half of the soviet union some of the higher profile soviet espionage cases during this decade involved william kampiles cia employee christopher boyce an employee of defense contractor trw inc and edwin g moore ii retired cia employee17 during the 1980s foreign intelligence agencies still aggressively engaged in espionage against the united states despite the fact that much of their support in the guise of communist and socialist movements in the united states had been greatly diminished in 1985 known as the year of the spy us officials uncovered several spies most of whom were motivated by greed rather than ideology in the 1990s both the fbi and the cia again found themselves penetrated by employees working on behalf of the soviet uni on and the successor russian federation aldrich ames cia and robert hanssen f bi both of whom worked at one point in soviet

an executive assistant director for intelligence this position is responsible for the fbis office of intelligence the primary mission of which is to establish formal intelligence program within the fbis national curity and criminal programs substantial reorganizations require congressional approval particularly if there are proposed changes in how previously authorized andor appropriated resources are allocated 31there are different viewpoints on this initiative from management perspective it could be argued that the agencys second official is in essence its chief operating officer coo responsible for the daily operations of the fbi the existence of coo allows the director the time to engage and inform national level policymakers and congressional oversight committees and to develop broad strategy for the organization some may argue that burdening coo with specific programmatic responsibil ities may force the executive to focus undue time and emphasis on those programs to the potential detriment of the broader organizational mission however it could so be argued that notwithstanding the dissolution of the ead for criminal investiga tions the fbi has indeed increased its focus on these matters by elevating them to the deputy directors level 32see appendix i for list of the 56 field offices by c ity location see also testimony of fbi director robert s mueller iii

responsibilities with other issues such as deterring criminal conspiracy48 therefore the clarity and focus of fbi priorities arguably remained nebulous nor was it generally perceived within the fb i that working national security accounts counterterrorism and counterintelligence was careerenhancing endeavor the events of september 11 only made more stark the need to develop definitive and clarified list of new priorities for the fb i moreover the recent robert hanssen espionage case49 and the espionage investigation at alamos national laboratory also contributed to perceived need for reprioritizati on particularly of national securityrelated issues at the fbi as result on may 29 2002 the fbi director announced the following 10 priorities protect the united states from terrorist

committee on appropriations j une 18 2003 although the fbis number one and two priorities are national security oriente d it does not necessarily follow that these two priorities should consume majority of fbi resources the quality of the human resources targeting of these resources against greatest threats and close collaboration between these resources and other intelligence community assets as well as state and local law enforcement partners may be better indicators of success in this area than raw financial data 51the fbi treats terrorism as both federal crime and as national security issue not all terrorism is grave threat to national secur ity but all terrorism or activity in support of terrorism is criminal this reflects th reality of the issue that is some prima facie criminal activities such as fraud and other illegal fundraising techniques are engaged in domestically by those supporting terrorist activitie s at home or abroad the fact that the proceeds of these illegal activities may be used for violent or coercive activities directed against us citizens to achieve desired po litical outcome makes the activity inimical to us values and interests terrorism s

corruption and security fbi counterterrorism program51 at the most generic level there are two types of terrorism that the fbi and other us governmental agen cies seek to counter domestic terrorism and international terrorism the domestic terrorist threat can be categorized as coming from extre mists on polar opposite s of the political spectrum that is there are domestic groups that do not believe in the legitimacy of the us government including its laws cu rrency and sovereignty and others that are motivated by hatred of certain ethnic groups generally referred to as right wing extremists while others are primarily oriented toward violent activities to advance preferred social causes such as liberation of the earth or animals from perceived exploitation generally referred to as left wing extremists international terrorists and terrorist groups are generally categor ized as state sponsors of terrorism or foreign terrorist organizations52 in fy2002 the fbi worked

investigations53 an abbreviated version of the history of the fbis counterterrorism program is illustrative the wake up call the fbis organization for countering terrorism has shifted over time as the relative importance of terrorism as national security and criminal issue has changed there have been three major periods in the development of the existing counterterrorism program the first period occurred in the earlyto mid 1980s during this period the fbis counterterrorism program employed fewer than 500 people54 in the aftermath of the 1983 bombings of the us embassy april 63 dead 17 of whom were americans nd then the us marine corps october 241 marine personnel dead barracks in beirut lebanon the fbi established terrorism section within its criminal inve stigative division although the fbi has long had the authority to investigate fede ral crimes not assigned to other us law enforcement entities the passage of the hostage taking act of 1984 and the omnibus crime bill of 1986 granted it the explicit authority for extraterritorial investigation of terrorist attacks against us interests and citizens overseas55 us vulnerability the second major period includes the earlytomid 1990s during this period the united states not only was attacked overseas but perhaps more importantly there were successful and significant terrorist attacks within the united states the two most prominent attacks during this period involved the bombing of the world trade center in fe bruary 1993 an incident of international terrorism in which six americans died and the april 1995 domestic terrorism

devoted additional international terrorism and domestic terrorism experts to combating terrorism it was also during this period that the fbi tran sferred responsibility for terrorism from its criminal investigative division to its national security division catalyst for war of indeterminate duration the third period is the late 1990s to 2001 it was during this period that loosely affiliated terrorist organizations became more active and attacks became more deadly and asymmetrical the august 1998 bombings of us embassies in kenya and tanzania 224 killed 12 of whom were american ar largely attributed in part to an increasingly aggressive alqaeda in 1999 to provide enhanced focus on counterterrorism the fbi transferred its counterterrorism program from the national security division to newly establishe d counterterrorism division in october 2000 the uss cole was attacked 17 servi cemen dead by alq aeda operatives as it was in the yemens aden harbor for refueling56 then on september

place and continue to be imple mented to shift the fbi from reactive to proactive posture on may 22 2002 fbi director mueller outlined reorganization initiative at the fbi primary theme of this reorganization is program centralization and the establishment of national intelligence program which rebalances the relationship between fbi headquarters and field office s s 1520 bill to amend the national security act of 1947 short title the 9 11 memorial intellig ence reform act proposes that the fbi take number of actions to enhance its counterterrorism capabilities including clearly designating priorities for national terrorism and enforcement of adherence by fbi field offices to such priorities establishing and maintaining counterterrorism career track and formal training programs for special agents and analysts and improving its ability to penetrate terrorist organizations operating in the united states some of these changes are in process in addition to those changes already outlined above other ma jor elements of this reorganization are as follows fbi headquarters organizational changes the director established new ead for counterterrorism and counterin telligence among three other eads subsequently the fbi director has established an ead for intelligence whose primary function will be to establish and implement formal and systematic intelligence program throughout the fbi the extent to which this initiative will be successful is largely depende nt on whether the fbis strong law enforcement culture accepts and adopts this new approach to intelligence httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32095crs22 57until just recently the fbi has had two catego ries of professional support employees who engage in analysis while intelligence re search specialists are allsource intelligence analysts who engage in full range of tactical strategic and programmatic analysis intelligence operations specialists are more tac tically oriented and provide direct case and operational support the fbi is currently in the process of merging these two categories of employees into one intelligence analysts the newly created reports officers generally do not engage in traditional all source analysis their focus is reviewing raw information in timely manner and understanding to whom int ernally and externally that information must be disseminated 58see statement by

eed to have more integrated foreign and domestic counterterrorism analytical effort so observers are skeptical of the placement of an intelligence analytical fusion center within the us intelligence community some believe placement of such center within the us intelligence community will undermine intelligence sharing with state and local law enforcement moreover according to the homeland

subsequently in 1983 the fbi opened broader investigation to determine if the organization was engaged in international terrorist activity although congressional inve stigation concluded that the fbis investigation did not reflect significant fbi political or ideological bias its activities resulted in the investigation of domestic political activities protected by the first amendment that should not have come under governmental scrutiny72 library awareness program in late 1980s the new york office of the fbi counterintelligence program initiated wh at became known as the library awareness program through this program fbi agents visited certain libraries within the new york area to make librarians aware that intelligence officers of the former sovi et union may attempt to spot assess

the only executions for the crime of espionage took place in the united states the period of the late 1960s through the mid1970s can be aptly ch aracterized as relatively quiescent from counterespionage perspective during the 19661975 period there were five arrests for espionage and related charges it wa s not until the late 1970s that the justice department under former attorney ge

invigorated as counterintelligence cases can be relatively slow in pace due to their intelligence nature and relativ ely high legal thresholds for successful conviction the fbis aggressive investig

the fbi has experienced before some have argued that the fbis reactive law enforcement culture with its alleged predilection for information collecti on but not sharing may be so resistant to change that the organization may ultimately prove itself incapable of adapting to preventative counterterrori sm and intelligence mission117 others have argued that the fbis case orientation and culture is not in need of changing indeed the culture and ability to build complex cases that withstand legal and constitutional scrutiny is an unassailable asset in the war against terrorism118 while the changes that the fbi has made thus far have generally been received positively by groups which have reviewed them119 the extent to which the organization can reform itself to effectively and

foreign threat intelligence tity the ttic it is not inconceivable that cooperation in foreign and domestic intelligence activities may exceed continuedtransformation from reactive to proactive bias in the national security realm there is the issue of the extent to which the fbi should balance its national security responsibilities with its traditional criminal pursuit missi on as men tioned above there is some concern that the movement of investigative resources from the fbis traditional criminal mission to the counter terrorism and counterintelligence mission may undermine the agencys ability to aggressively counter crime121 issues for congress is the fbi the appropriate agency to fight terrorism against us interests can an organization with strong and proud law enforcement culture be retrained to engage in the more subtle discipline of gathering and exploiting foreign intelligence domestically where the end goal may not necessarily be prosecution but preemption as well as continued collection and exploitation can the relatively autonomous relations hips between fbi headquarters and the 56 field offices be successfully rebalanced so centralized priorities established at

jurisdiction that should be devolved to state and local law forcement if so should additional resources be provided to the federal state and local law enforcement agencies to support training if not does the fbi need additional criminal resources given that it may be unlikely that the reprogramming of resources from the criminal to the national security divisions of the fbi in the wake of september 11 will be reversed given the expansive mosaic of fbi jurisdiction in criminal and national security realms would legislative charter clarify and more centrally codify the organizations rolesre sponsibilities and jurisdiction if the fbis counterterrorism divisi on which has operati onal responsibilities within the united states is eventually to be colocated with the existing ttic
