defense division of pl 110116 and one funding the departments of labor health and human services and education hr 3043 the latter was vetoed on november 13 2007 and an attempt to override this veto failed by vote of 277141 the continuing resolution funds most agencies at fy2007 levels the continuing resolution generally prohibits agencies from beginning or resuming programs that did not receive appropriations in fy2007 thus new civilian research and development programs and funding increases for existing activities including the presidents centerpiece programs such as the american competitiveness initiative will be delayed until further appropriations bills have passed for many research and development programs fy2007 funding was itself provided under continuing resolution based on fy2006 appropriations therefore these programs are operating in fy2008 with budgets similar to those of fy2006 order code rs22774 december 17 2007 federal research and development funding possible impacts of operating under continuing resolution dana shea specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division daniel morgan httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22774 analyst in science and technology policy resources science and industry division summary on december 14 2007 president bush signed into law hjres 69 this law is continuing resolution and provides funding through december 21 2007 unless superceded by further congressional action for agencies and programs normally funded by the 11 regular appropriations bills the 110th congress has passed two appropriations bills one funding the department of defense division of pl 110116 and one funding the departments of labor health and human services and education hr 3043 the latter was vetoed on november 13 2007 and an attempt to override this veto failed by vote of 277141 the continuing resolution funds most agencies at fy2007 levels the continuing resolution generally prohibits agencies from beginning or resuming programs that did not receive appropriations in fy2007 thus new civilian research and development programs and funding increases for existing activities including the presidents centerpiece programs such as the american competitiveness initiative will be delayed until further appropriations bills have passed for many research and development programs fy2007 funding was itself provided under continuing resolution based on fy2006 appropriations therefore these programs are operating in fy2008 with budgets similar to those of fy2006 federal funding for research and development rd is generally supported by both congress and the administration though programmatic priorities may differ1 the bush 1 in the context of this report research and development also includes funding for research and continued crs2 administration states that it has requested 1427 billion in federal rd funding for fy20082 this request is approximately 13 higher than the fy2007 appropriated level with the bulk of the proposed change coming from increases for the department of defense dod the space vehicle development program of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the continuation of the american competitiveness initiative aci which was first announced for fy20073 the president proposed the aci in response to growing concerns about americas ability to compete technologically in the global marketplace as part of the aci the president called for doubling over 10 years the aggregate funding of the national science foundation nsf the department of energy doe office of science and the core programs of the national institute of standards and technology nist the main focus of the increases would be to support basic research in the physical sciences and engineering the fy2008 request would increase funding for nsf by 512 million for the doe office of science by 601 million and for nist core programs by 101 million relative to fy2007 appropriated levels despite the presidents continued support for the aci total federal support for basic httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22774 and applied research would decrease by 21 under the administrations request for fy2008 although some agencies would see increases these would be more than offset by decreases at other agencies while the president proposes decreasing the amount of research funding funds for development would increase by 29 this increase in support for development more than offsets the decrease in support for research thus total rd funding would increase under the presidents proposal4 the

and continued crs3 since the beginning of fy2008 on october 1 2007 funding has been provided through three continuing resolutions the first pl 11092 provided funding through november 16 2007 the second division b of pl 110116 extended the duration of pl 11092 through december 14 2007 the third hjres 69 extended the duration of pl 11092 through december 21 2007 and provides current funding for the agencies covered under the eleven regular appropriations bills still outstanding for all agencies that have not had an appropriations bill for fy2008 signed into law the continuing resolution provides funding at the same level they received in fy2007 funds are provided on prorated basis for the duration of the continuing resolution the continuing resolution also generally prohibits agencies from using these funds to initiate or resume any project or activity for which appropriations funds or other authority were not available during fiscal year 20076 according to press reports congress is considering using an omnibus bill to address appropriations for fy20087 such an approach would bypass the remaining eleven appropriations bills according to the director of the office of management and budget the president might veto such an omnibus bill depending on the contents of the bill8 if httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22774 so agency funding might need to be provided by further continuing resolutions the current status of fy2008 funding for rd is summarized in table 1 issues for congress if the federal government continues to operate under continuing resolution most existing rd programs would continue to receive funding at the fy2007 level to some extent this funding mechanism is likely to cause federal agencies to continue to support existing rd priorities rather than shifting to new ones since only existing programs retain funding in addition because of inflation even funds provided at the fy2007 level may represent reduction in actual purchasing power9 for rd programs in some agencies fy2007 funding was determined by previous continuing resolutions based on the fy2006 level for these programs the loss of purchasing power and the difficulty of adjusting policy goals and priorities may be more challenging in the case of new rd programs planned for fy2008 most would not be allowed to start even after appropriations for fy2008 become law allowing new programs to 5 continued brief overview of recent practices by sandy streeter and crs report rl32614 duration of continuing resolutions in recent years by robert keith 6 pl 11092 sec 104 7 see for example peter cohn dem strategy on omnibus designed to put onus on gop congress daily december 6 2007 8 the white house statement by white house office of management and budget director jim nussle press release december 8 2007 9 past continuing resolutions have sometimes provided increases to cover some inflation costs for example the fullyear continuing resolution for fy2007 provided increases over fy2006 levels to cover statutory pay increases for civil servants pl 1105 sec 111 crs4 begin agencies may have difficulty meeting their projected rd milestones and goals also agency plans for purchase of major instruments and equipment may be delayed or prevented under the continuing resolutions for example agency plans for new rd programs in the first quarter of fy2008 are unlikely to be achieved as the first quarter is already almost complete another issue for new programs is whether agencies will be able to obligate whatever new appropriations they receive most agency appropriations for rd expire at the end of the fiscal year for which they are appropriated because most new programs cannot be started under continuing resolution even if appropriations for them are eventually received agencies will have less time than the full fiscal year to establish them and obligate the funds for these programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22774 crs5 table 1 estimated federal rd

appropriations act and does not include research development testing and evaluation funds associated with the defense health program the chemical agents and munitions destruction program and the mine
