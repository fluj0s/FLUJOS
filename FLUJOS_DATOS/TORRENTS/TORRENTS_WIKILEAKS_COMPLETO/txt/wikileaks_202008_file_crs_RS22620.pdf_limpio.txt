resources science and industry division march 13 2007 abstract imports of motor vehicles automobiles and light trucks from japan increased by onethird in volume from 2005 to 2006 rising to more than two million units the highest yearly total since 1989 some members of congress have expressed concern that the export of cars from japan to the us market has been assisted by policy of the japanese government to reduce the exchange rate of the yen this could give producers based in japan trade advantage when they export vehicles to the us market in competition against those made in the united states alternative factors that may also explain the 2006 import increase are rising sales of imported subcompact vehicles which are not built in the united states by any manufacturer and shortage of us manufacturing capacity by two leading japaneseowned automotive manufacturers toyota and honda are now rapidly expanding their north american production development that may reduce net imports but could further increase the competitive pressure on the detroitbased big three manufacturershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22620 order code rs22620 march 13 2007 the 2006 increase in us motor vehicle imports

generation has likely been more sensitive than that of us automotive imports from japan but even though the products of japanesebased companies have continuously gained share in the us domestic market imports declined to lower level in the 1990s renewed rge of japanese imports occurred in 2006 as distinct from vehicles produced and assemble d in north america by japanese nameplate manufacturers this contributed to re newal of concerns in congress about the competitiveness of the usbased big thr ee motor vehicle manufacturers all of which have been suffering rious financial losses with the investment of automotive assembly plants in north america by japans major motor vehicle manufacturing companies the level of imports from japan declined substantially in the 1990s from peak of 36 million imported car s and trucks in 1986 the total fell to just over 125 million more th an two million fewer units ten years later see figure 1 thereafter as japanese companies continued to gain market share with wider range of products in the us market imports from japan began to increase againhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22620crs2 albeit marginally according to commerce department data imports from japan averaged little over 15 million units per year in 19962000 and close to 17 million units during the next five year period 200105 but even though the number of units rose japans share of us imports from countries other than canada and mexico continued to decline from level as hi gh as 93 in the early 1980s japans share of such imports fell through the early 2000s to less than 50 in 200305 in 2006 by contrast commerce data show that imports from japan jumped by 35 in one year to about 22 million vehicles and japans share of imports from outside the north american free trade area

between 2000 and 9000 per vehicle before single sheet of metal is stamped or single part is installed on vehicle chassis2 the allegedly undervalued yen exchange rate has been explicitly linked to the sharp increase in 2006 motor vehicle imports from japan3 four house committee and subcommittee chairs with jurisdiction over trade commerce and financial policies on february 8 2007 wrote secretary of the treas ury henry paulson and noted that from 2005 to 2006 imports of japanese cars and trucks rose by more than 30 percent we are certain that the weak yen is also boosting ja panese exports in othe r economic sectors and is having significant impact on many us producers4 they urged that he press the japanese government to reverse the policy of maintaining weak yen by raising interest rates and selling some of the massive reserves of dollars and euros japan has accumulated through its market interventions5 the yen has weakened since it reached high point against the us dollar in late 2004 and early 2005 at that time the us dollar only bought about about 103104 yen for the whole of 2004 the average value of the dollar was 108 yen compared to almost 116 yen in 2003 and 125 yen in 2002 japans st major official intervention was early in 2004 the dollar strengthened to 110 ye n in 2005 and about another 5 to 116 yen in 2006 for about an 115 overall gain above the post 2000 low in januaryfebruary 2007 the dollar did rise to more than 120 yen but though this rise may affect the policy debate today it could not have influenced 2006 trade results6 rising dollar at these levels would have an immediat windfall effect on japanese companies profits because us dollar sales translate into relatively more yen but th effect on longerterm product sourcing and planning may take longer to play out there may have been more immediate causes of the shortterm rise in japanese imported vehicle sales in 2006 than the rise in the value of the yen these notably may include capacity constraints on japanese companies in north america and sh ifts in consumer demand in 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22620crs4 capacity constraints aff ect japanese sour cing decisions as will be shown later in detail toyota and honda to gether accounted for virtually all of the net increase in us motor vehicle imports from japan figure 2 illustrates that in 200506 these two companies were operatin

in 2006 as in the case of toyota they were stretched too thin in north america to immediately meet rising demand for certain products honda has announced new assembly plant to be built in greensburg

illustrates that ford operated at about 70 of capacity for the past two years gms rate actually increased slightly from 77 to 80 in 2006 but this was mainly due to closure of plants with about 400000 units of capacity according to the source fo r the figure the chrysler groups capacity utilization fell from 99 to 91 but this was not enough to forestall large inventory buildup of some vehicles and the need to announce major production cutbacks and closures in early 2007 figure 2 north american automotive assembly capacity utilizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22620crs5 7 letter of edward b cohen automotive news feb 19 2007japanese firms meet shifting c onsumer demand with imports table 1 shows that the net increase in 2006 imports from japan was mostly due to strong us demand for higher fuel econom models that could not be delivered by japanese companies from their north american plants this is especially true of toyota an increase of 81000 imports of the rav4 crossover utility vehicle cuv that is toyotas sma llest vehicle of this type 70000 imported units of the subcompact yaris in its first year on the us market an increase of 42000 imported units of the corolla toyotas basic compact sedan to supplemen t production in california an increase of 17000 imported units of toyotas scion brand its entry level model among toyotas larger vehicles only two sa w large gain in imports one was the midsize camry sedan of which about half of the net increas was the hybrid model that was then only made in japan however the iconic prius hybrid mode l all of which are imported by comparison showed gain in sa at all also toyota introduced the fjcruiser an imported suvtype niche produc t that sold 56000 units in its first year all of toyotas other midsize and larger vehicles including the lexus brand saw much smaller increases or declines in sales whet her they were imported or produced in north america toyota plans to continue its stated strategy of increased north american sourcing besides the highly publicized new tundra pickup truck now being built in texas toyota will also bring the rav4 to its new plant in woodstock ontario the highlander suv currently imported will be built at new plant announced for mississippi imports of honda vehicles from japan in creased by 70000 mostly because of the introduction of the subcompact fit 28000 its and the increased sales of the crv cuv 39000 increased imports honda has be gun to produce this vehicle in ohio as honda official stat ed maintaining some level of imports gives honda flexibility to adjust to changing economic conditions in th united states while assuring sustainable level of local us employment7 smaller but significant import gains were also registered by fords japa nese affiliate ma zda 27000 and by suzuki 19000 the latter is japans fourthlargest motor compan and specialist in subcompact vehicles in summary subcompacts are likely to be imported in the us market from countries where they are sold in larger volumes fo r example gms subcompact chevrolet aveo is imported from korea and chrysler has negotiated deal with chery chinese company to produce subcompact for rth america otherwise the japanese companies strategies would still appear to be to increase production in north america while adding imports to supplement sales or to try out new products from japan where there is excess capacity because the market there has been stagnating since the 1990shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22620crs6 table 1 2006 changes in japanese motor vehicle imports note imports not incl vehicles
