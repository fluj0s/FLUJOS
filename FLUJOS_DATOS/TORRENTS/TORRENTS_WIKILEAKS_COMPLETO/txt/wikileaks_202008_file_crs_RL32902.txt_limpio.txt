social legislation domestic social policy division medicare prescription drug benefit lowincome provisions summary the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 established new voluntary prescription drug benefit under new part d effective january 1 2006 medicare beneficiaries are able to purchase drug coverage through private plans offered by prescription drug plan pdp sponsors or managed care organizations offering medicare advantage prescription drug ma pd plans these private plans bear some of the financial risk for drug costs federal subsidies covering the bulk of the risk are provided to encourage participation in these private plans mma required pdp sponsors and mapdp plans to offer minimum set of benefits referred to as qualified coverage qualified coverage is defined as either standard prescription drug coverage or alternative prescription drug coverage with actuarially equivalent benefits ie having at least equivalent dollar value in both cases access must be provided to negotiated prices for drugs beneficiaries are required to pay monthly premium for program coverage as well as certain costsharing charges when they obtain benefits major focus of mma is the enhanced coverage provided to lowincome individuals who enroll in part d lowincome enrollees including persons known as dual eligibles who previously received drug benefits under medicaid have their prescription drug costs paid under the new part d persons with incomes below 150 of poverty and assets below specified levels have assistance with some portion of the premium and costsharing charges persons with the lowest incomes have the highest level of assistance mma represents the first time that the level of medicare benefits is tied to income implementation of the new program particularly for the lowincome population proved challenging the main concern now is the fact that despite extensive federal state and local outreach efforts not all persons potentially eligible for lowincome subsidy lis have enrolled in the program as of january 2007 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms estimated that 33 million persons eligible for lis had neither signed up for part d nor had coverage through another source it is not immediately clear why some individuals have failed to enroll though several factors including lack of program awareness the nature of the application process itself and the assets limits presumably each play role it is hoped that the continued waiver of both the enrollment deadline and the delayed enrollment penalty for the lowincome population in 2007 will encourage more persons to enroll during the remainder of the year this report provides background information on

eligible population state medicaid spending is reduced as result of this transfer of responsibility however the law contains provision labeled by some as the 1 for an overview of mma see crs report rl31966 overview of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 by jennifer osullivan hinda chaikind sibyl tilson jennifer boulanger and paulette morgan 2 mma also provided for higher medicare part b premiums for highincome enrollees beginning in 2007 the increase was to be phased in over five years however the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra shortened the phasein to three years see crs report rl32582 medicare part b premiums by jennifer osullivan crs2 clawback provision which requires states to continue to assume portion of these costs the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the agency that administers medicare issued final regulations implementing the mma drug provisions on january 28 20053 subsequently cms has issued number of guidance documents to further clarify number of issues related to implementation of the lowincome provisions implementation of the new program particularly for the lowincome population proved challenging observers cited number of problems that arose when the dual eligible population was transferred from medicaid to medicare coverage on january 1 2006 cms took number of actions designed to address the problems that arose immediately after the shift became effective the main concern now is the fact that despite extensive outreach efforts not all persons potentially eligible for lowincome subsidy lis have enrolled in the program as of january 2007 cms estimates that 33 million persons eligible for lis are not enrolled it is not immediately clear why some individuals have failed to enroll though several factors including lack of program awareness the nature of the application process itself and the assets limits presumably each play role it is hoped that the continued waiver of both the enrollment deadline and the delayed enrollment penalty for the lowincome population in 2007 will encourage more persons to enroll during the remainder of the year this report begins by providing an overview of mma benefits including premium and costsharing liabilities for the general medicare population the overview is followed by discussion of the subsidy benefits available for lowincome individuals this is followed by review of enrollment procedures and polices applicable for this population the report then highlights some of the key implementation issues mma benefits all medicare beneficiaries are entitled to obtain qualified prescription drug coverage through enrollment in private prescription drug plan under the new medicare part d4 persons enrolled in medicare advantage ma plan providing qualified prescription drug coverage obtain coverage through that plan other individuals obtain coverage through enrollment in plan offered by pdp sponsor beneficiaries who elect to enroll in plan are responsible for monthly premium which varies by the individual plan selected in january 2007 cms estimated that 3 department of health and human services hhs centers for medicare and medicaid services cms medicare program medicare prescription drug benefit final rule 70 federal register 4193 jan 25 2005 4 see crs report rl33136 medicare enrollment in medicare drug plans by jennifer osullivan crs3 the average monthly plan premium for all plans both pdps and mapds at 225 this represents about 25 of the total cost of the benefit mma requires pdp sponsors and mapd plans to offer minimum set of benefits referred to as qualified coverage qualified coverage is defined as either standard prescription drug coverage or alternative prescription drug coverage with at least actuarially equivalent benefits ie having at least equivalent dollar value in both cases access must be provided to negotiated prices for drugs for 2007 the standard prescription drug coverage is defined as follows 265 deductible paid by the beneficiary 75 of costs paid by the program and 25 of costs paid by the beneficiary up to the initial coverage limit 2400 accounting for 79875 in total outof pocket costs and 2400 in total spending 100 of costs paid by beneficiary for drug spending falling in the coverage gap between 2400 and 545125 305125 accounting for total beneficiary outofpocket spending of 3850 and all costs paid by program over 545125 in total spending the catastrophic trigger except for nominal beneficiary costsharing defined as the greater of 1 copayment of 215 for generic drug or preferred multiple source drug and 535 for other drugs or 2 5 coinsurance each year the dollar amounts are increased by the annual percentage increase in average per capita aggregate expenditures for covered outpatient drugs for medicare beneficiaries for the 12month period ending in july of the previous year mma specifies that beneficiaries must incur certain level of outofpocket costs 3850 in 2007 before catastrophic protection begins costs are only considered incurred if they are incurred for the deductible costsharing or benefits not paid because they fall in the coverage gap sometimes referred to as the doughnut hole incurred costs do not include amounts for which benefits are provided because drug is excluded under particular plans formulary costs are treated as incurred and thus treated as true outofpocket troop costs only if they are paid by the individual or by another family member on behalf of the individual paid on behalf of lowincome individual under the subsidy provisions or under state pharmaceutical assistance program any costs for which the individual is reimbursed by insurance or otherwise do not count toward the troop amount 5 hhs cms medicare drug plans strong and growing press release january 30 2007 it should be noted that inclusion of mapd plans lowers the overall average the kaiser family foundation reports that the average 2007 premium for pdps nationwide is 3666 httpwwwkfforgmedicarehealthplantrackertopicresultsjspi33rt2 crs4 lowincome provisions mma provides assistance to certain lowincome persons to help them meet part d premium and costsharing charges specifically such assistance is provided for persons with incomes below 150 of the federal poverty level and assets below specified amounts the definitions of income and assets are linked directly or indirectly to the definitions used under current medicaid law the law specifies several lowincome coverage groups and subgroups each lowincome coverage group specified by mma receives different level of assistance the specified assistance for lowincome groups is linked to standard prescription drug coverage each lowincome group receives assistance for premium and costsharing charges otherwise applicable under standard coverage persons with the lowest incomes have the highest level of assistance6 the following specifies the requirements applicable for each lowincome eligibility group and outlines the assistance available for each group eligibility groups definition of eligible groups special premium and costsharing subsidies are available for lowincome persons this population is divided into two main groups with the first group divided into subgroups for purposes of determining cost sharing requirements the two main groups are defined as follows group 1 referred to as full subsidy eligible individuals this group includes all persons who 1 are enrolled in pdp plan or mapd plan 2 have incomes below 135 of the federal poverty level 13783 for an individual and 18481 for couple in 2007 and 3 have resources in 2007 below 6120 for an individual and 9190 for couple increased each year by the percentage increase in the consumer price index or cpi the 2007 resource limits are generally publicized as 7620 and 12190 because 1500 per person is excluded for burial expenses 6 it should be noted that the law permits plans to offer the general population either the defined standard benefit or actuarially equivalent benefits most plans offered in 2007 are not for defined standard benefits but rather for one of three alternatives some plans provide an actuarially equivalent standard benefit under this benefit plans impose tiered costsharing that is costsharing percentages that vary by whether the drug is generic or brand or preferred or not preferred some plans offer basic alternative that can include both revised costsharing and reduction in the deductible some plans are defined as enhanced alternative plans these are plans that offer coverage whose value exceeds that of standard coverage these plans typically offer some coverage in the doughnut hole however costsharing for the lowincome population can not exceed the lower of 1 the specific limits specified for the lowincome under standard coverage as discussed later in this report or 2 the amount otherwise charged to the general population crs5 the following groups of persons are also included in group 1 dual eligibles these are persons entitled to the full range of benefits under their states medicaid program prior to january 1 2006 these persons received their drug benefits under medicaid effective january 1 2006 their drug benefits are provided through part d all full benefit dual eligible individuals are deemed to be in group 1 regardless of whether they meet the other eligibility requirements recipients of supplemental security income ssi benefits or enrollees in medicare savings programs mma permitted the secretary to extend group 1 coverage to enrollees in medicare savings programs implementing regulations extended coverage to this group there are three medicare savings programs that provide medicaid assistance for medicare premiums and costsharing charges the three groups are 1 qualified medicare beneficiaries qmbs7 2 specified lowincome medicare beneficiaries slmbs8 and 3 qualifying individuals qi1s910 group 2 referred to as other subsidy eligible individuals group 2 includes all other persons who 1 are enrolled in pdp plan or mapd plan 2 have incomes below 150 of poverty 15 315 for an individual and 20 535 for couple in 2007 and 3 have resources in 2007 below 10210 for an individual and 20410 for couple increased in future years by the percentage increase in the 7 qmbs are aged or disabled persons with incomes at or below the federal poverty level in 2007 the monthly level is 871 for an individual and 1161 for couple these levels include monthly 20 disregard for unearned income assets must be below 4000 for an individual and 6000 for couple qmbs are entitled to have their medicare cost sharing charges and the medicare part b premium paid by the federalstate medicaid program medicaid protection is limited to payment of medicare costsharing charges ie the medicare beneficiary is not entitled to coverage of medicaid plan services such as long term care unless the individual is otherwise entitled to medicaid 8 slmbs meet the qmb criteria except that their income is between 100 and 120 of the federal poverty level in 2007 the monthly income limits are 1041 for an individual and 1389 for couple medicaid protection is limited to payment of the medicare part b premium ie the medicare beneficiary is not entitled to coverage of medicaid plan services unless the individual is otherwise entitled to medicaid 9 these are persons who meet the qmb criteria except that their income is between 120 and 135 of poverty further they are not otherwise eligible for medicaid in 2007 the monthly income limit for qi1 for an individual is 1169 and for couple 1561 medicaid protection for these persons is limited to payment of the monthly medicare part b premium 10 an additional medicare savings group is qualified disabled and working individuals qdwis individuals in this group may have income up to 200 of the federal poverty level unlike the other medicare savings groups this group is entitled to special treatment under the lowincome subsidy provisions of part d crs6 cpi the publicized resource limits of 11710 and 23 410 include 1500 per person burial allowance definition of income and assets the definitions of income and assets generally follows that used for determining eligibility under the qmb slimb and qi1 programs which in turn link back to the definitions used for purposes of the ssi program there are however few items which should be noted family size currently the federal poverty level fpl used for income determinations is that applicable for an individual or for couple mma specifies that the fpl is to be that for the family of the size involved therefore the regulations define the family size to include in addition to the applicant and spouse additional persons related to the applicant who live in the same residence and depend on the applicant or spouse for at least onehalf of their financial support the income of these additional persons would not however be used in the determination of eligibility resources mma provides for the development of simplified application in which applicants attest to their level of resources and submit minimal documentation only liquid resources or those that could be converted to cash within 20 days and real estate that is not the applicants primary residence are considered liquid resources include such things as checking and savings accounts stocks and bonds vehicles are excluded because they are not considered liquid assets more generous state standards the law section 1902r2 of the social security act allows states to use more generous income and assets rules for determining eligibility for the qmb slmb and qi 1 programs few states have elected this option as noted above mma permits the secretary to include all persons meeting qmb slmb and qi1 criteria in group 1 the secretary elected to do so however only persons on qmb slmb or qi1 rolls are actually included states are not permitted to use the less restrictive methodologies for other subsidy eligibility determinations the standards will be the same nationwide for these persons lowincome subsidy lis benefits mma provides subsidies for both premiums and costsharing charges under part d premium subsidies all persons in group 1 ie full subsidyeligible individuals receive premium subsidy equal to 100 of the lowincome benchmark premium amount essentially weighted average for the region but in case higher than the actual premium amount for standard coverage under the plan selected by the enrollee crs7 in addition the premium subsidy amount can not be less than the premium for the lowestcost pdp plan in the region thus all individuals in group 1 are entitled to full premium subsidy for at least one plan in their region however if beneficiary selects plan with premium higher than the benchmark the beneficiary is liable for the additional costs all persons in group 2 ie other subsidy eligible individuals have sliding scale premium subsidy ranging from 100 of the lowincome benchmark at 135 of poverty to 0 of such value at 150 of poverty specifically the subsidy is 75 for persons with incomes above 135 but at or below 140 of poverty 50 for persons with incomes above 140 but at or below 145 of poverty and 25 for persons with incomes above 145 but below 150 of poverty persons in group 1 but not group 2 also have premium subsidy for any part d late enrollment penalty equal to 80 for the first 60 months of delayed enrollment and 100 thereafter costsharing subsidies costsharing subsides are linked to standard prescription drug coverage beneficiaries in group 1 have deductible coverage gap ie nodoughnut hole and costsharing over the catastrophic threshold full benefit dual eligibles who are residents of medical institution or nursing facility have costsharing other full benefit dual eligible individuals with incomes up to 100 of poverty have costsharing for all costs up to the outof pocket threshold of 1 for generic drug prescription or preferred multiple source drug prescription and 310 for any other drug prescription all other persons in group 1 have costsharing for all costs up to the outofpocket threshold of 215 for generic drug or preferred multiple source drug and 535 for any other drug11 see table 1 beneficiaries in group 2 have 53 deductible 15 coinsurance for all costs up to the outofpocket limit and costsharing for costs above the outofpocket threshold of 215 for generic drug prescription or preferred multiple source drug prescription and 535 for any other drug prescription see table 1 each year the costsharing amounts for full benefit dual eligibles below 100 of poverty are increased by the increase in the cpi the costsharing amounts for all other persons and the deductible amount for group 2 are increased by the annual percentage increase in per capita beneficiary expenditures for part d covered drugs 11 the preamble to the final cms regulations notes that mapd plans can not choose to eliminate the copayments for dual eligible individuals except in the case of specialized ma plans under section 231 of mma offering benefits only to dual eligible

formulary subsidies are available for costs for drugs not on the formulary of the individuals plan unless such individual has successfully appealed to have coverage granted for particular drug as is the case for all such appeals for both the low income and other persons an individual can make such an appeal only if the prescribing physician determines that all covered part d drugs on any tier of the formulary for treatment of the same condition would not be as effective for the individual as the nonformulary drug would have adverse effects for the individual or both state medicaid program cannot wrap around the part d benefit unless it chooses to fund 100 of the costs federal matching is not available to cover the costs of any drug which could be included under part d but is excluded under particular plans formulary medicaid can continue to provide coverage and receive federal matching payments for drugs specifically excluded from coverage under part d included in this category are benzodiazepines and barbiturates territories the lowincome subsidies are available for persons residing in the 50 states and the district of columbia while residents of the territories12 may enroll in pdp under part d they are not entitled to the lowincome subsidies instead territory may submit plan to the secretary for providing drug coverage for its lowincome population each territory with an approved plan can receive grant based on its ratio of medicare beneficiaries in the territory compared to the number in all territories the total amount of funding available is 28125 million in the last three quarters of fy2006 375 million in fy2007 increasing in subsequent years by the percentage increase in prescription drug spending for medicare beneficiaries eligibility and enrollment procedures in order to take advantage of the lowincome subsidies an individual must be determined eligible for the assistance and be enrolled in part d plan special procedures have been established to make the process easier the procedures are different for different categories of lowincome enrollees general requirements in general persons first eligible for medicare on or before january 31 2006 had to enroll with part d plan by the close of the initial enrollment period on may 15 2006 persons first eligible in february 2006 had until the end of may 2006 to enroll 12 american samoa the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands guam puerto rico and the virgin islands crs10 persons newly eligible for medicare at later date have an initial sevenmonth enrollment period beginning three months before the month of medicare eligibility and ending seven months later failure to enroll at the first opportunity generally means that an individual can not enroll until the next annual open enrollment period november 15december 31 with coverage beginning the following january further these persons are subject to late enrollment penalty if they go for more than 63 days without creditable drug coverage namely coverage at least as good as standard part d coverage however the closing dates and application of the late enrollment penalty have been waived for both 2006 and 2007 for persons deemed eligible for lowincome subsidy eligibility for lowincome subsidies certain groups are automatically deemed full subsidyeligible individuals other persons have to apply for assistance deemed individuals persons automatically deemed full subsidyeligible individuals are full benefit dual eligibles qmbs slmbs qi1s and recipients of ssi these individuals must be notified that they are deemed eligible for full subsidy for period up to one year further they are to be informed that they do not need to apply for the subsidy persons who were enrolled in one of these programs in 2005 were to be notified prior to january 1 2006 that they qualified for the subsidy eligibility was redetermined in 2006 for 2007 persons were notified in september 2006 if their subsidy status was changing other persons other individuals or their personal representatives have to apply for subsidy assistance applicants may apply either at state medicaid offices or social security offices applicants are required to provide information from financial institutions as requested to support information in the application and to certify as to the accuracy of the information provided state medicaid programs are required to make eligibility determinations for persons applying to the state medicaid agency the commissioner of the social security administration ssa is required to make such determinations for persons applying at ssa offices specific time frame is established for these determinations redeterminations and appeals are to be handled by the same agency making the initial determination applications to ssa may be filed in person by mail by phone or over the internet cms encouraged states to use the ssa application form when assisting beneficiaries and to forward these application forms to ssa ssa processes these applications and is responsible for associated redeterminations and appeals however states are still required to have the ability to make such determinations for individuals who request them to do so crs11 plan enrollment process in general medicare beneficiaries voluntarily enroll in pdp or mapdp plan during the initial enrollment period november 15 2005may 15 2006 during an initial sevenmonth enrollment period for persons becoming eligible on or after march 1 2006 the annual open enrollment period november 15december 31 each year or

autoenrollment for dual eligible beneficiaries special provisions apply for full benefit dual eligible individuals effective january 1 2006 these persons can longer receive medicaid coverage for drugs covered under part d the law required automatic enrollment for dual eligibles who failed to enroll in pdp or mapdp plan individuals were enrolled with the plan in the region that had premium not exceeding the premium subsidy amount if more than one such plan was available enrollment among these plans was made on random basis individuals were to be informed in advance of the selected plan nothing prevented an individual from declining such enrollment or disenrolling from the plan in which he or she was enrolled and enrolling in different plan further dual eligibles could change plan enrollment at any time with enrollment in the new plan effective the following month autoenrollment was to occur in the fall of 2005 for persons on the medicaid rolls at that time enrollment was effective january 1 200613 cms randomly assigned full benefit dual eligible beneficiaries in original medicare to pdp plans with premiums at or below the lowincome premium subsidy amount special rules applied in the case of ma enrollees these persons were assigned to mapd plan with the lowest premium offered by the same ma organization even if the plans monthly prescription drug premium exceeded the lowincome premium subsidy amount beneficiaries were to be informed in advance of the assignment if the beneficiary failed to affirmatively select another plan or declined part d enrollment he or she was to be considered to be enrolled in the assigned plan the autoenrollment process is ongoing for persons newly establishing eligibility in july 2006 cms announced that it was implementing process for autoenrolling prospective full benefit dual eligibles cms requested assistance from the states in identifying persons who are about to become medicare eligible either because they will shortly turn 65 or they are disabled persons reaching the end of the twoyear waiting period for medicare other enrollees mma limited the requirement for autoenrollment to full benefit dual eligibles it did not apply to the medicare savings population or to other persons eligible for lowincome subsidies however cms established process labeled facilitated enrollment for enrollees in medicare savings programs msps ssi enrollees and persons who applied for and were approved for lowincome 13 for duals newly eligible for part d after that date enrollment is effective on the first day of the month the individual becomes eligible for part d crs12 subsidy assistance the basic features applicable to autoenrollment for dual eligibles ie random assignment assignment to plan with the lowest premium and assignment of ma enrollees to lowest cost mapd plan offered by the ma organization are extended to facilitated enrollment special enrollment periods the law and regulations establish special enrollment periods seps outside of the general enrollment periods during which an individual can disenroll from one pdp or mapd and enroll in another one in general generally an individual can only take advantage of sep under special circumstances such as moving from one part of the country to another however lowincome enrollees who have been autoenrolled or whose eligibility into plan has been facilitated can have additional seps full benefit dual eligibles as well as msp enrollees can change enrollment at any time with the coverage change effective the following month other persons whose eligibility into plan has been facilitated may change their enrollment once prior to the annual open enrollment period with enrollment effective the following month special provisions for 2006 and 2007 in 2006 cms established special enrollment period for persons eligible for lowincome subsidy1415 specifically persons deemed eligible for lowincome subsidy after the close of the initial enrollment period on may 15 2006 could still enroll in part d plan in 2006 these late enrollees were not subject to the late enrollment penalty otherwise applicable to persons who missed the 2006 enrollment deadline this policy has been extended for an additional year through 200716 2007 enrollment changes for persons enrolled in lis in 2006 policies directed at reducing the number of persons switching plans cms established two policies for 2007 that have the effect of reducing the number of persons who would be forced to switch plans from 2006 to 2007 because the plans 2007 premium exceeds the lowincome premium subsidy amount17 14 cms center for beneficiary choices instructions for 2007 contract year memorandum to medicare prescription drug plan pdp sponsors apr 3 2006 15 cms

ways and means subcommittee on health statement of mark mcclellan administrator of cms may 3 2006 16 cms medicare part d late fee for lowincome enrollees cms says press release jan 9 2007 17 cms medicare demonstration to transition enrollment of low income subsidy beneficiaries memo to plan sponsors june 8 2006 crs13 calculation of benchmark premium the law provides that the low income premium subsidy amount in region is equal to the lowincome benchmark amount for the region but in case less than the lowest beneficiary premium for pdp in the area the lowincome benchmark is defined as the weighted average premium with the weight based on plan enrollment for 2006 the programs first year all pdps were assigned an equal weight beginning in 2007 the bid amounts were to be weighted by plan enrollment in 2006 however since many beneficiaries selected lowcost plans using weighted average would have the effect of reducing the regional lowincome benchmark premium amounts instead cms decided to transition to the weighting methodology for 2007 it used the same methodology used for 20061819 in future years it will move toward actual enrollment weighting minimus policy in addition cms established minimus policy for 2007 this is intended to reduce the number of persons in group 1 who would otherwise have been reassigned because the 2007 premium exceeds the full low income subsidy amount reassignment was made if the premium is below minimus amount ie the full subsidy amount in the region plus 2 these beneficiaries pay premiums even if the plan premium is in the minimus range however the minimus policy does not apply to new auto or facilitated enrollments in 2007 pdps that qualify for the minimus policy will not receive new autofacilitated enrollments because their premiums are above the 2007 lis benchmark persons qualifying for partial premium subsidies do not qualify for the minimus policy they are required to pay in full the difference between the subsidy amount and the plan premium20 events affecting change in lis status there are however other circumstances under which lowincome subsidyeligible person experienced change from 2006 to 2007 these include cases in which an individual 1 was enrolled in plan in 2006 whose 2007 premium will longer fall below full lis coverage 2 was enrolled in plan that terminated its participation in part d 3 lost automatic eligibility for the lowincome subsidy in 2007 or 4 fell into different subsidy category 18 cms release of the 2007 part d national average monthly bid amount the medicare part d base

cms established process for reassigning these beneficiaries to different part d plan beneficiaries to be reassigned must meet all of the following criteria they were deemed eligible for subsidy in 2006 because they were dual eligibles participants in medicare savings program ssi recipients or because they applied and were found eligible for the subsidy they continue to be eligible for subsidy in 2007 they were originally autoenrolled or had their enrollment facilitated into pdp they did not elect to enroll in different plan and their 2006 plan has 2007 premium that is above the minimus amount which is the subsidy amount in the region plus 2 or is terminating at the end of 2006 beneficiaries meeting all of these criteria were reassigned to different pdp in the region as follows the beneficiaries were assigned to another plan in the same region offered by the same pdp sponsor if the sponsor had plan with premium at or below the full subsidy level if there was more than one such plan cms randomly assigned beneficiaries among these plans if such plan existed cms randomly assigned beneficiaries among pdp sponsors with at least one plan with premium at or below the benchmark cms notified beneficiaries of their plan assignment in november 2006 however beneficiaries could voluntarily elect to stay in their same plan if it was still offered or select different plan from the one assigned by cms beneficiaries who changed plans in 2006 after they were either autoassigned to plan or had their enrollment facilitated into plan did not have their selection changed by cms the beneficiary is free to change his or her selection individuals losing automatic eligibility for lowincome subsidy persons automatically qualifying for lowincome subsidy are dual eligibles persons enrolled in medicare savings programs and ssi recipients at the end of september 2006 cms began sending letters to those beneficiaries losing their automatic eligibility for lowincome subsidy in 2007 because they longer fell into one of these categories at the same time these beneficiaries were told they still might qualify for assistance and were encouraged to file lowincome subsidy application with ssa the application and postagepaid envelope were enclosed with each notice redeterminations are also made for other lowincome persons the law requires individuals who applied for and qualified for lis to reestablish their eligibility each year with the agency that made the initial determination ssa or state medicaid office most determinations have been made by ssa in august 2006 ssa sent letter to persons who had applied directly to ssa and qualified for lowincome subsidy before may 2006 if an individuals income or resources changed they had to complete new redetermination form for 2007 people who applied to ssa after april 2006 will have redetermination made later this year individuals who applied crs15 through state medicaid offices have redeterminations made according to individual state rules individuals falling into different subsidy category beneficiaries whose subsidy category was changing in 2007 received separate notice in october 2006 informing them of this change special enrollment period cms is providing onetime special enrollment period from january 1 2007 to march 31 2007 to allow any individual who longer qualifies for lowincome subsidy to make onetime part d election additionally cms also stated that plan sponsors may choose to offer up to three month grace period for the collection of premiums and costsharing charges for those persons who can demonstrate that they have applied for lowincome subsidy sponsors may recoup any uncollected amounts if after this period the individual is not eligible for the subsidy eligibility and enrollment issues initial startup dual eligibles21 on january 1 2006 more than 6 million dual eligibles were to be transitioned from medicaid to medicare drug coverage the autoenrollment process was intended to prevent any coverage gap prior to january 1 2006 many observers were concerned that the auto enrollment process might not go smoothly they noted that not all beneficiaries were correctly identified and enrolled in plan they also noted that many individuals might not be aware of the transition andor might not know which plan they were enrolled in in response to these concerns cms established backup process for any dual eligible arriving at pharmacy without necessary documentation despite the establishment of the autoenrollment and backup processes the program experienced number of problems during the initial days of operation particularly related to the transition of dual eligibles there were number of reports about individuals who were unable to fill prescriptions because eligibility could not be verified or the drug plans transition policies were not applied pharmacists also reported difficulty in getting timely and accurate information from the medicare tollfree line the pdp customer service representatives and the newly established electronic eligibility inquiry e1 system subsequently cms released additional guidance for drug plans and pharmacists and dedicated additional resources to try and resolve these issues while the initial transition issues have been addressed concerns continue to be raised regarding the accuracy and timeliness of data used to make eligibility determinations 21 see crs report rl33268 medicare prescription drug benefit an overview of implementation for dual eligibles by jennifer osullivan and karen tritz and crs report rs21837 implications of the medicare prescription drug benefit for dual eligibles and state medicaid programs by karen tritz crs16 state and federal transition funding during the first weeks of 2006 32 states stepped in temporarily to pay for drugs for dual eligibles who would otherwise have had gap in coverage due to transition problems cms announced that the federal government would reimburse states for costs incurred prior to march 8 200622 with some states receiving extensions to march 31 2006 cms extended the deadline for associated administrative costs to may 5 2006 as of that date cms reported that it was working with contractor to process claims and reconcile with plan sponsors in order to begin reimbursing states23 however letter from the national governors association in february 2007 indicated few states had yet to be reimbursed fully24 enrollment for other lowincome persons cms estimates that as of january 2007 there are approximately 33 million persons potentially eligible for lowincome subsidy who are neither enrolled in part d nor recorded as having other creditable coverage number of efforts have been made to contact potential lis individuals these have included number of outreach activities by ssa including educational activities and targeted mailings and followup phone calls to persons identified as being possibly eligible for assistance additionally variety state and local agencies and beneficiary advocacy groups have conducted extensive educational activities despite these efforts some potential eligibles have not enrolled possible reasons cited for nonenrollment include persons either not being aware of the benefit not understanding the application process or thinking they will not qualify the fact that an individual has applied for lis does not automatically mean that the individual is eligible ssa reported that as of midjanuary 2007 it had received applications from 61 million beneficiaries of these almost 1 million were unnecessary because either the applicants were automatically eligible or because they had filed more than one application the agency had made more than 59 million determinations more than 23 million of these were deemed to be subsidyeligible25 many observers contend that the relatively low percentage of eligibles reflects the programs assets limitations number of persons have therefore suggested that the assets requirements should be eliminated this would expand the pool of persons eligible for federal assistance at the time of enactment cbo estimated that 18 22 cms used section 402 demonstration authority this is section 402 of the social security act of 1967 pl 90248 as amended 23 us congress house committee on ways and means subcommittee on health statement of mark mcclellan administrator of cms may

of beatrice disman chairman medicare planning and implementation task force social security administration jan 31 2007 crs17 million otherwise eligible persons would not qualify for the subsidy because of the assets limitations report prepared for the kaiser family foundation in april 2005 estimated that 237 million persons would not be eligible due to assets tests26 of course eliminating the assets test would also increase federal costs for the low income subsidy complicating the issue is the fact that individuals in few states might be subsidyeligible if they applied through their states medicaid office rather than through ssa both the states and ssa can make subsidy eligibility determinations however cms encouraged states to both use the ssa application forms and to forward such forms to the ssa for action states and ssa are to apply the same criteria for determining eligibility for lowincome subsidies however some states use more generous methodologies for determining eligibility for medicare savings programs as noted earlier medicare savings recipients are automatically deemed eligible for full subsidy benefit in the preamble to the final regulations cms acknowledged that there might be cases where an individual applies to the ssa for lowincome subsidy is denied coverage because of excess income and assets and is unaware that he or she might qualify for full subsidy because of meeting the more generous medicare savings program requirements in the persons state the law and regulations provide that individuals can request that the state medicaid office make the determination when states make eligibility determinations they are also required to screen for eligibility for medicare savings programs separate section of the law added before passage of mma requires ssa to annually identify individuals potentially eligible for medicare savings programs and transmit the information to the states plan assignment cms assigned full benefit dual eligible beneficiaries to plans with premiums at or below the lowincome premium subsidy amount similar assignments were made for other subsidy eligible enrollees who did not select plan the assignment process had the effect of directing the lowincome population into the lower cost plans some observers contend that such plans may not in all cases be the ones the lowincome individual would prefer based on the plans formulary pharmacy network or other factors some persons have suggested that the autoenrollment and facilitated enrollment process should not be completely random since lowincome individuals often represent more medically fragile population than medicare beneficiaries as whole some persons had recommended that enrollments be targeted toward an individual beneficiarys particular circumstances however cms did not attempt to assign beneficiaries to particular plan based on the individuals particular drug needs pharmacy affiliation or on their classification as special needs population cms cited both data limitations and its inability to make individual selections given the 26 thomas rice and katherine desmond lowincome subsidies for the medicare prescription drug benefit the impact of the asset test the henry j kaiser family foundation april 2005 crs18 varied reasons for choosing plan further cms had noted that full benefit dual eligibles and msp enrollees may change plan enrollment at any time while other lowincome subsidy eligibles may change enrollment once before the end of the year other beneficiary issues drug formularies and transition coverage pds and mapds have drug formularies formularies are lists of drugs that the plans will cover within broad guidelines plans have considerable flexibility in designing their formularies mma required formularies to cover at least two drugs in each therapeutic category and class the law also requested the united states pharmacopeia usp to develop list of categories and classes which could be used by plans in developing these formularies the usp developed model guidelines though not all pds and mapds follow the model plans may also incorporate utilization management tools such as prior authorization or step therapy where lower cost drug is first tried before highercost drug may be approved any individual enrolled in plan may appeal to obtain coverage for drug not on the formulary only if the prescribing physician determines that all covered part d drugs on any tier of the formulary for the treatment of the same condition would not be as effective for the individual would have adverse effects for the individual or both the scope of plans formulary is particularly important for lowincome beneficiaries who are generally unable to afford drugs not covered by the plan key implementation issue was what would happen to dual eligibles who previously had their drugs paid for by medicaid many of these individuals were likely to be enrolled in plans that did not cover all of the drugs on their existing drug regimen in response to these concerns cms developed policies relating both to the scope of plan formularies and transition rules scope of coverage many of the dual eligibles fall into one or more population subgroups such as the mentally ill the disabled and those with hivaids the drug regimens for these individuals are often very finely tuned to meet the needs of individual patients advocates for these populations note that successful treatments are often arrived at only after trying several different kinds of medications they suggest that shifting individuals who have stabilized on one medication to another medication could have negative consequences both medical and emotional for example advocates for the mentally ill stated that psychotropic drugs are not interchangeable in addition they note that if persons are forced to change regimens some may experience increased hospitalizations and emergency room visits thereby driving up overall medical costs cms responded to this concern by requiring plan formularies to cover all or substantially all of the drugs in the following six categories antidepressant antipsychotic anticonvulsant anticancer immunosuppressant and hivaids crs19 further cms stated that its review of plan formularies includes review of actual drugs to assure discrimination against certain populations however many dual eligibles were enrolled in plans that did not cover all of the drugs on their existing drug regimen in january 2006 the office of the inspector general oig of the department of health and human services conducted review of drug plan formularies for 200627 of the top 200 drugs most commonly used by the dual eligible population in 2005 178 were eligible for pdp coverage and 22 were excluded see below the oig noted that this population group was being assigned to 409 pdps that used 37 unique formularies nineteen percent of the formularies included all 178 of the part d eligible drugs while an equal proportion included less than 85 the oig noted that under the random assignment process 18 of dual eligibles were assigned to plans that included all 178 drugs while 30 were assigned to plans that covered less than 85 of such drugs however every pdp region had at least one plan using formulary that included all 178 drugs therefore all dual eligibles had the opportunity to switch to plans including all of these drugs the oig report was based on its analysis of the random enrollment process reportedly many dual eligibles subsequently switched plan enrollment similar analysis of 2007 part d offerings for the lis population is not currently available transition policies cms has established transition policies intended to assure that new plan enrollees do not abruptly lose coverage for their drugs in april 2006 cms announced the transition process requirements for 2007 which include the minimum standards plans are required to meet specifically plans are required to provide temporary supply fill anytime within the first 90 days of beneficiarys enrollment in plan the supply must be for 30 days unless the prescription is written for less than 30 days for any nonformulary drug the requirement also applies to drugs that are on plans formulary but that require prior authorization or step therapy in longterm care facilities the transition policy provides for 31day fill with multiple fills as necessary during the first 90 days of beneficiarys enrollment in plan after the 90day period the plan must provide 31day emergency supply while an exception is being processed cms has specified 31 days because many longterm care pharmacies dispense medications in 31day increments28 in november 2006 cms sent letter to part d plan sponsors reminding them of the transition policies the letter noted that the purpose of the process was not just to provide temporary fill of nonformulary drugs but rather to provide enrollees 27 us

switch to therapeutically appropriate formulary alternative or to request an exception based on grounds of medical necessity29 formulary changes certain policies govern formulary changes midyear changes many observers had expressed concerns that plans could change their formularies during the year provided they gave 60 days notice beneficiaries might have selected an individual plan based on its coverage of particular drug which might be subsequently dropped from the list on april 26 2006 cms provided guidance document to part d plan sponsors outlining its approach to formulary plan changes during plan year30 the guidance document noted that both industry best practices and the best interests of medicare beneficiaries call for limited formulary changes during the plan year generally plans could expand formularies modify therapeutic categories and classes only to account for new therapeutic uses and newly approved drugs and make formulary maintenance changes the guidance document stated that plans could make other formulary changes such as removing drugs from the formulary moving drugs to less preferred tier status or adding utilization management requirements only in accordance with specified procedures the document further stated that plans should make such formulary changes during the year only if enrollees currently taking the affected drugs are exempted from the change for the remainder of the plan year cms stated its expectation that plans would continue to comply with this policy in 2007 and subsequent years and would include such assurances in plans future bids and contracts this policy applies to all part d enrollees not just those receiving low income subsidy yeartoyear changes as noted plans can change their formularies at the beginning of the year this will affect those beneficiaries whose drugs are either longer covered by the plan or covered under different conditions cms in its november transition letter to plan sponsors outlined the transition policies that must apply in such cases plans could either apply the transition rules applied to new enrollees as outlined above or they could effectuate the transition prior to january 1

longterm care facility ltc residents many dual eligibles are residents of longterm care ltc facilities ltc residents are on average older and frailer than nonltc residents many also have cognitive impairments these individuals do not access their prescriptions directly in the past the facility generally contracted with single pharmacy to provide prescription supplies the pharmacy dispensed drugs in special packaging to the facility nurse in the facility administered the drug to the patient ltc facilities typically provided an open formulary to prescribing physicians that allowed immediate access to variety of medications in different dosage forms and strengths part d requirements the transition to the new part d benefit resulted in significant changes longterm care residents

sure that their plan contracts with pharmacy serving the facility in the preamble to the final regulations cms outlined process that was described as balancing the special needs of ltc enrollees with the need to inject competition into the longterm care pharmacy market in march 2005 cms issued guidance document31 which outlined minimum criteria that plans must meet in four key areas performance and service convenient access formulary and exceptions and appeals the guidance document requires part d plans to offer contract to any pharmacy willing to participate in its ltc network so long as the pharmacy is capable of meeting minimum performance and service criteria and relevant state laws and other terms established by the plan for its network pharmacies the performance and service criteria are based on widely used best practices in the market today they include criteria relating to comprehensive inventory and inventory capacity requirements for dispensing pharmacist including those related to drug utilization review capacity to provide special packaging provision of 247 oncall service with qualified pharmacist and delivery services including emergency delivery services32 the part d plan must demonstrate that it has network of participating pharmacies that provide convenient access for ltc residents that are part d enrollees it must also attest that it will assure that all future part d enrollees who are institutionalized can routinely receive their benefits through the plans network of pharmacies 31 cms longterm care guidance mar 16 2005 at httpwwwcomhhsgovstates downloadslongtermcareguidancepdf 32 cms notes that these items would be legitimate costs to reflect in the dispensing fee specialized services provided in the administration of the drugs after they are dispensed and delivered from the ltc pharmacy are not covered under the part d benefit crs22 plans cannot have different formulary for ltc residents though some observers had recommended this they are required to provide coverage for all medically necessary drugs cms notes that this can be achieved through inclusion of the drugs in the formulary utilization management tools or an exceptions process finally the exceptions and appeals process established by part d sponsors is expected to consider the special circumstances of ltc enrollees sponsors are required to have procedures in place where there is disparity between part d requirements and medicare conditions of participation for longterm care facilities on may 11 2006 cms issued memo to state survey agency directors intended to clarify residents rights regarding choice of drug plan and pharmacy provider and the facilities responsibility to provide drugs to residents the document noted that residents are guaranteed the right to choose part d plan but do not have unbridled freedom to choose pharmacy the document cited number of examples of situations that would frustrate beneficiarys ability to receive drugs under his or her preferred part d plan cms noted its expectation that nursing homes work with pharmacies to make sure that residents choices are honored specifically cms expects nursing homes to work with current pharmacies to assure that they recognize the plans chosen by the facilitys beneficiaries or alternatively to add pharmacies to achieve that objective at its option the facility could contract exclusively with another pharmacy that contracts more broadly with part d plans since nursing homes are responsible for the safety and efficacy of medication delivery they have the responsibility for selecting pharmacy or pharmacies that are willing and able to accommodate the plans chosen by all the residents of the facility nursing homes may not coach steer or otherwise encourage resident to select or change plan state surveyors are to continue to monitor compliance with regulations and guidelines33 impact on beneficiaries many observers have stated that nursing homes and other caregivers should be allowed to help beneficiaries select plan however this runs counter to cms policy which is based on the premise that if nursing homes are allowed to make recommendations they could inappropriately influence plan selection the long term care pharmacy alliance ltcpa recently issued report highlighting what it sees as the implications of this policy for beneficiaries34 specifically it stated that nursing home residents have poor chance of being enrolled in the part d drug plan that best covers their medications it noted that many individuals had been randomly assigned to plans

residents are typically very elderly and in poor physical and mental health most are unable to evaluate choose and enroll in plan on their own other beneficiary issues drugs not covered under part d several categories of drugs are specifically excluded by law from coverage under part d these include benzodiazepines used to treat anxiety disorders and barbiturates used for treatment of some seizures weight loss drugs and overthecounter medications states will continue to be able to cover these drugs under medicaid and receive federal matching for these expenditures35 however some observers are concerned that beneficiaries may lose access to these drugs an hhs survey of 47 state medicaid programs in december 2005 showed that 45 medicaid programs would continue to cover nonprescription drugs 46 states would cover benzodiazepines 45 states would cover barbiturates 35 would cover prescription vitamins and mineral products and 32 states would cover drugs for symptomatic relief of cough and colds36 costsharing for the dual eligible population some non institutionalized dual eligibles may have seen an increase in their costsharing charges when they transitioned from medicaid to part d 2004 comparison of part d costsharing charges with those applicable under the lowincome subsidy provisions showed that 11 states imposed copayments on drugs 13 states imposed charges that would always fall below part d levels five states had charges that were the same or higher than those under part d and 14 states had copayments that might be higher or lower than part d

supplementary insurance trust funds may 2006 39 ibid crs25 interaction with other programs patient assistance programs number of drug manufacturers have offered prescription drugs to lowincome medicare beneficiaries as well as to other lowincome persons with high drug costs these pharmaceutical assistance programs paps are not connected with federal programs paps operate in various ways they may offer cash subsidies free or reducedpriced drugs or both they may offer assistance directly to patients or replenish drugs furnished by pharmacies clinics and other entities questions have been raised about the potential interaction between paps and part d in particular observers questioned whether federal antikickback statutes would be implicated if paps continued to provide assistance to medicare beneficiaries by subsidizing their part d costsharing obligations special advisory bulletin issued by the office of inspector general on november 7 2005 40 stated that such arrangements would present heightened risk under the antikickback statute this was based on the observation that subsidies would be prohibited by the statute because the manufacturer would be giving something of value ie the costsharing subsidy to beneficiaries to use its product it further outlined several types of abuse that could occur including steering beneficiaries to particular drugs providing financial advantage over competing drugs reducing beneficiaries incentives to locate and use less expensive drugs and increasing costs to the program by shortening the time period before the beneficiary hit the catastrophic trigger the oig did state however that there were other options drug manufacturers could consider these included making cash donations to bona fide independent charity paps not affiliated with manufacturer and operated without regard to donor interests the oig bulletin also stated that paps entirely outside the part d benefit could pose reduced risk under the antikickback statute in these cases claims could be made against the part d plan for the drugs and any costsharing could not count toward the beneficiaries troop the bulletin stated that these programs would have to meet number of conditions in response to the oig bulletin many manufacturers announced that they would cease to provide pap assistance to any medicare beneficiary enrolled in part d in some cases beneficiary who did not enroll in part d could continue to receive assistance through the pap however there would be guarantee that the pap program would continue to offer the drugs indefinitely nor would the individual have help with the costs of drugs not covered under pap program further beneficiary delaying enrollment in part d after the may 15 2006 enrollment deadline would be subject to delayed enrollment penalty the oig bulletin and the subsequent response by drug manufacturers raised the concern that some beneficiaries would be faced with significantly higher outof pocket costs members of the senate finance committee as well as other observers 40 hhs oig special advisory bulletin provides guidance on patient assistance programs for medicare part d enrollees nov 7 2005 crs26 asked the oig to further clarify its position in april 2006 the oig issued an advisory opinion41 that two paps proposed by one company would not subject it to sanctions under the arrangements free drugs would not count toward troop once beneficiary began receiving drugs through either of the paps neither the part d plan not the beneficiary would be charged for the drug for the remainder of the year the company also entered into datasharing arrangement with cms that would enable paps to notify part d plans regarding beneficiary participation in the paps while the oig guidance applied to specific approach offered by one company it was seen as roadmap for other companies subsequently the oig issued additional guidance documents to other manufacturers interested in offering paps further clarification has been provided by cms it has specified that programs operating outside of the part d benefit are not precluded from assessing nominal beneficiary copayments these nominal copayments may count toward beneficiarys troop provided the beneficiary takes the responsibility for submitting the appropriate documentation to his or her plan42 state pharmaceutical assistance programs number of states have had state pharmaceutical assistance programs spaps in place for number of years these programs were set up to offer prescription drug benefits to lowincome individuals who did not have medicaid drug coverage many persons enrolled in spaps are eligible for lowincome subsidies under part d other persons enrolled in state programs are not eligible for lowincome subsidies because their incomes andor assets exceed the requisite limits however spap payments made on their behalf to cover part d costsharing charges will count toward the individuals true outofpocket troop costs trigger43 coordination with part d initial concerns the enrollment of spap participants became key issue for number of states mma defines an spap as one that provides assistance to persons in all part d plans and does not discriminate based on the part d plan in which the individual is enrolled in its january 2005 regulations cms interpreted the part d language to mean that if an spap offers part d premium assistance or supplemental part d costsharing assistance it must offer equal assistance for all pdp and mapd plans available in the region and may not steer beneficiaries to one plan or another through benefit design or otherwise violation of this nondiscrimination rule would violate the spaps status with respect to counting troop supporters of this approach contended that the definition of 41 hhs oig oig advisory opinion 0603 apr 18 2006 42 1cms medicare prescription drug benefits manual httpwwwcmshhsgov prescriptiondrugcovcontradownloadspdmchapt14cobpdf 43 prior to the implementation of part d several states had established pharmacy plus waiver programs these programs provided drugs and primary care services under medicaid waiver in the regulations cms stated that these programs could not qualify as spaps in part because program expenditures were federally matched therefore any pharmacy plus program expenditures could not count toward beneficiarys troop crs27 spap which includes the nondiscrimination provision is important for ma organizations and pdp sponsors the inability to steer beneficiaries to selected plan or plans effectively meant that an spap could not autoenroll its participants in preferred part d plans this proved to be concern for some states who argued they should be able to enroll their beneficiaries in preferred plans if they gave individuals the option to switch to other plans if they wanted to states suggested that allowing autoenrollment in preferred plans would allow them to leverage the potential of large number of enrollees during the negotiation process they stated that if they were not permitted to enroll individuals in preferred plans they would be faced with potentially providing different wraparound benefits for different plans based on variations in formulary and costsharing structures44 coordination with part d cms policy cms established policies intended to balance the need to adhere to the nondiscrimination requirement with state concerns coordination of benefits in july 2005 cms issued its coordination of benefit guidance for part d this guidance which was subsequently incorporated into the prescription drug benefit manual45 outlined the following four approaches that spaps could choose to provide their wraparound benefits 1 paying premiums for basic andor supplemental benefits 2 wrapping around benefits at the pointof sale 3 contracting with part d plans on risk or nonriskbased lump sum per capita method or 4 some combination of these under option 3 spaps would solicit lump sum per capita bids from part d plans in exchange for the provision of wraparound benefits the guidance document outlined steps spaps could adopt when paying lump sum per capita payments to part d plans on risk basis in order to be deemed nondiscriminatory with respect to the plan the individual was enrolled in in brief the process involves the following steps 1 states wishing to adopt lump sum per capita approach would define uniform benefit package 2 all part d plans in the region would be invited by the state to submit quote 3 plans not wishing to participate would not be required to submit quotes and states would not be obligated to provide wraparound benefits to beneficiaries choosing such plans 4 based on the submitted quotes states would determine what it would pay based on either the actual quote of each plan or an amount equal to the 75th percentile of all quotes with plans with higher quotes permitted to withdraw 5 states would have to assure equal access to enrollment in and comparable information on all part d plans participating in the chosen approach without any steering to individual plans 6 states would be required to 44 the cms approach ran counter to key recommendation of the state pharmaceutical assistance transition commission which was established by mma to provide advice on coordination and transition issues the commissions report issued in december 2004 recommended that spaps should be allowed to endorse one or more preferred drug plans for their enrollees 45 cms medicare prescription drug benefit manual chapter 14 coordination of benefits httpwwwcmshhsgovprescriptiondrugcovcontradownloadspdmchapt14cobpdf crs28 report the results of the bidding process 7 part d plans would be required to provide information identifying the spap as the coprovider of benefits and 8 plans would be required to periodically provide claims data to the state states selecting to pay nonriskbased lump sum per capita payments could do so as long as an equal subsidy amount was offered to each individual in each part d plan part d plans would be required to provide claims data to spaps authorized representative46 cms guidance also established process for facilitated enrollment in cases where spaps are their members legal representative under state law spaps serving as authorized representatives could identify objective criteria subject to cms approval that could narrow the range of options an spap would use to enroll member in plan spaps with individualized data could use this to facilitate enrollment of certain groups of individuals into plans best suited to them in terms of pharmacy networks or specific drug needs state actions states revised their programs in light of the implementation of part d the national conference of state legislatures ncsl reports that states responded to the mma changes in variety of ways some states modified existing programs to coordinate with part d established new state programs or in the case of five states dropped existing programs the majority of current programs provide wrap around benefits typically this means that for persons eligible for both programs spaps pay some portion of part d premiums andor costsharing and may cover some drugs excluded under the part d benefit as of february 2007 ncsl reports that over 15 million persons in 20 states receive some subsidy assistance under one of these programs47 state issues state contributions toward part d costs clawback requirement effective january 1 2006 states are longer providing coverage for part d drugs for their dual eligible population they could be expected to see reduction in their medicaid spending as result of this transfer however the law contains provision labeled by some as the clawback provision that requires states to continue to assume portion of these costs the formula specified in law is based on proxy for what states would otherwise be spending on drugs for the dual eligibles in the absence of mma initially states would assume 90 of these costs over the next nine years the states contribution would gradually decline to 75 46

source for each item generally state medicaid statistical information system msis and information reported on the form cms64 are used clawback issues the mma has been described as providing states some relief for expenditures they would otherwise incur for their dual eligible populations however with both the implementation of the clawback provision and the additional administrative responsibilities many observers suggested that the states would actually spend more than they would in the absence of mma48 others however contended that the states would see savings particularly over time as their share of expenditures as measured under the clawback formula declined 48 robert pear costcutting medicare law is money loser for states the new york times mar 25 2005 crs30 one of the key components of the clawback formula is actual drug expenditures in 2003 many contend that the data base for 2003 is flawed further states point out that while they had implementing significant cost control mechanisms any measures implemented since 2003 were not factored into the calculation on february 12 2007 the national governors association sent letter to hhs requesting that the statess 2007 contribution be adjusted to reflect actual program spending the association contends that cms should compare the rates paid to plans in 2007 versus 2006 rather than using the general health care index to make the calculation the governors noted that part d is operating below budget and therefore states should share in the savings49 other budget issues the clawback requirement has significant implications for state budgets other aspects of mma may also affect state spending possible effects on enrollment when mma was enacted it was expected that outreach for the drug benefit would result in woodwork effect with an expansion in the population enrolling in medicaid and medicaid savings programs current medicaid enrollment figures are not available however it does not appear that this has occurred to major extent this may reflect in part the fact that there are an estimated 3 million persons potentially eligible for the lis who have failed to enroll possible long term implications new enrollees who are full dual eligibles are included in the formula for the calculation of the clawback obligation some persons have raised concerns about the longer term implications for state programs facing fiscal challenges in an effort to control costs states might limit the number of dual eligibles by cutting back or limiting the number or types of optional eligibility groups limiting benefits or cutting outreach activities50 other issues impact on medicaids drug program the transition of drug coverage for the dual eligibles to part d was expected to result in drop of about 50 in medicaid drug spending this represents loss in market share for medicaid as result some persons have questioned whether states will have the same leverage to negotiate lower prices for the remainder of their medicaid population receiving drug benefits 49 national governors association letter from governors jon s corzine and jim douglas to michael leavitt secretary of hhs feb 12 2007 50 national health policy forum implementing the new medicare drug benefit challenges and opportunities for states nhpf meeting report aug 31 2004 crs31 interaction between part d and medicaid states are concerned about their ability to track drug utilization for the dually eligible population pharmacy data are one of fastest ways to pick up clinical problems as well as potential fraud another concern is that state medicaid programs will not have control over the drugs used by the dual eligible population they will longer be able to achieve savings through their own cost control mechanisms they will however be responsible through medicaid for any increases in other medical spending resulting from inappropriate drug use estimated impact cbo and cms have estimated the impact of the part d provisions cbo cost estimates in march 2007 cbo provided updated estimates of the drug benefit including its estimates relating to lowincome participation these estimates were lower than those provided year earlier and reflect both the fact that overall beneficiaries are tending to enroll in lower cost plans and part d enrollment particularly for lis enrollees is lower than expected the march 2007 cbo baseline estimated part d medicare spending at 470 billion in fy2007 522 billion in fy2008 and rising to 781 billion in fy2011 and that spending under the lowincome subsidy provisions would total 152 billion in fy2007 159 billion in fy2008 and rise to 243 billion in fy2011 it estimated that there would be 92 million lowincome subsidy enrollees in fy2007 97 million in fy2008 and rise to 105 million by fy2011 it also estimated that payments by the states under the clawback provision would total 71 billion in fy2007 75 billion in fy2008 81 billion in fy2009 88 billion in fy2010 and 96 billion in fy201151 cms enrollment estimates enrollment when cms published its final part d regulations in january 2005 it estimated that 144 million beneficiaries would be eligible for the low income subsidy in 2006 of these it expected 109 million persons would actually receive assistance52 these estimates were subsequently revised53 51 fact sheet for cbos march 2007 baseline medicare

53 when cms issued its final regulations in january 2005 it provided cost estimates for spending on various categories of persons eligible for the low income subsidy cms has not published updated estimates crs32 cms estimated that as of january 16 2007 390 million persons had drug coverage of the total 272 million persons had part d drug coverage 69 million were covered under the retiree drug subsidy program and 49 million persons had creditable coverage through another source such as through the department of veterans affairs as of the same date cms estimated that 132 million persons were eligible for the lis of these 10 million had coverage through part d or some other source with 92 million covered under part d itself of which 69 million were automatically deemed eligible cms estimated that approximately 003 million lis approved beneficiaries would have their enrollments facilitated in the next round leaving 327 million liseligible beneficiaries not enrolled cms noted that the 327 figure may include some liseligible persons who had not yet regained their deemed status or been approved for the lis by the ssa but were still receiving coverage through part d54 cms also reported that 632000 persons automatically deemed eligible for lis in 2006 lost their automatic status in 2007 it reported that as of january 2007 35 had either regained their deemed status or had applied for and qualified for the lis it stated it was paying close attention to this population group it did not state what portion of the remaining 65 were still enrolled in part d though longer eligible for lis and what portion had dropped their participation as noted earlier any individual determined liseligible at any point during 2007 will be able to enroll in plan at that point without late enrollment penalty current concerns mma established new prescription drug benefit for the medicare population mma represented major change for the medicare program for the first time specified program benefits namely coverage for prescription drugs vary based on an individuals income level further beneficiaries wishing to access the drug benefit are only able to do so through enrollment in private standalone drug plan or managed care plan with drug benefit implementation of the new program particularly enrolling the lowincome population proved challenging the main concern now is the fact that despite extensive outreach efforts not all persons potentially eligible for lowincome subsidies have enrolled in the program it is not immediately clear why some individuals have failed to enroll though several factors including lack of program awareness the nature of the application process itself and the assets limits presumably each play role there is also concern regarding the current situation of persons who lost their deemed eligibility status in 2007 54 1 cms medicare drug plans strong and growing press release january 30 2007 and 2 httpwwwcmshhsgovprescriptiondrugcovgenin02_enrollmentdataasptopof page crs33 it is hoped that the continued waiver of both the enrollment deadline and the enrollment penalty for the lowincome population in 2007 will encourage more persons to enroll during the remainder of the year legislative activity actions related to fy2009 budget it is expected that the 110th congress will continue to monitor program implementation particularly as it affects the lowincome population recent letters to the chairman of the senate and house budget committees as required by the congressional budget act of 1974 provide an overview of expected activities this year on march 2 2007 senators baucus and grassley chairman and ranking member respectively of the senate finance committee sent letter to the senate budget committee the letter noted that an estimated threefourths of beneficiaries who remain without prescription drug coverage would likely qualify for lis therefore the letter stated that consideration should be given toward investing more in outreach programs as complement to the effort the letter stated that the current lowincome application should be reviewed to ensure that it obtained the necessary information without being overly burdensome and that it provides sufficient instruction to respond to the questions the letter also stated that the asset test should be revisited the senators stated that consideration should be given to removing or increasing the current asset limits two committees have jurisdiction over the part d program on the house side congressman rangel chairman of the house ways and means committee sent letter to the house budget committee on february 28 2007 the letter stated the intention to monitor implementation of mma and to conduct oversight of part d congressman dingell chairman of the house energy and commerce committee sent letter march 1 2007 commenting on the presidents budget proposals it criticized the budget for failing to include proposals to remedy problems with the part d benefit pending legislation several bills have been introduced to amend part d on march 15 2007 congressman doggett together with 157 cosponsors introduced hr 1536 the prescription drug coverage now act of 2007 this legislation would require the secretary to provide for an expedited process for the qualification of individuals for lowincome assistance the process would require newly enrolling persons to receive information about the lowincome subsidy and permit them to opt into the expedited process by requesting the commissioner of social security to screen for subsidy eligibility through request to the secretary of the treasury the secretary would be required to make similar request through the commissioner and the secretary of the treasury for persons enrolled before implementation of this process crs34 the secretary of the treasury would upon written request to the commissioner disclose to the commissioner whether an identified individual was likely to be eligible for subsidy assistance and the amount of premium and costsharing assistance for which the person would qualify the secretary would be required to notify persons identified as potentially eligible but not otherwise determined eligible and provide them with information on the amount of subsidies and enrollment opportunities the notification would include onepage attestation form for income and assets the form would not require submission of additional documentation regarding income or assets it would permit the appointment of personal representative and would allow for the specification of language other than english preferred for subsequent communications if an individual in good faith executed an attestation and was subsequently found ineligible recovery would be made for subsidies improperly paid the notification would also provide information on the state health insurance program ship from which the individual could obtain assistance if the individual did not respond to the notification attempts would be made to follow up pdp and mapd applications would be required to provide an option for persons to optin to the expedited process hr 1536 also would amend current resources standards by law full subsidy eligible individuals had assets limits in 2006 equal to three times the amount of such standards for the supplemental security income ssi program ie 6000 for single and 9000 for couple increased in future years by the percentage increase in the cpi ie 6120 for single and 9190 for couple in 2007 these would be raised to six times the ssi level in 2008 ie 12000 for single and 18000 for couple with future increases tied to cpi increases current law resource limits for other lowincome persons were 10000 for single and 20000 for couple in 2006 raised by the cpi in future years ie 10210 for single and 20410 for couple in 2007 these would be raised to 27500 for single and 55000 for couple in 2008 with future increases tied to cpi increases hr 1536 would further specify that the value of life insurance polices and balances in pensions or retirement plans would not be considered in calculating resources and inkind support and maintenance would not be counted as income additionally hr 1536 would 1 index any current deductible and costsharing amounts applicable for the lowincome to the increase in the cpi not the increase in per capita spending as is the case for those not eligible for full subsidies 2 specify that receipt of lowincome subsidy benefits would have impact on eligibility for other programs 3 require the commissioner of social security as part of making subsidy determinations to screen for eligibility for medicare savings programs 4 establish 90day special enrollment period beginning on the date the individual received notification of subsidy eligibility and facilitated enrollment crs35 process for persons who failed to enroll in plan and 5 waive of late enrollment penalties for subsidy eligible individuals beginning effective 2008 as of this writing it is too early to predict whether there will be any lisrelated legislation enacted into law this year for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32902
