appeals for the federal circuit summary the us court of appeals for the federal circuit federal circuit is specialized court with exclusive appellate jurisdiction over patent appeals congress established the federal circuit in 1982 in order to promote predictability and uniformity in the patent law now that the federal circuit has celebrated its twentieth anniversary it is appropriate to consider th influence of the court upon patent law and more genera lly the climate for innovative industry within the united states number of commentators belie ve that the federal circuit has strengthened the economic legal and comme rcial significance of patents to us industry the federal circuit has broadened the s ubject matter which may be patented to include such innovations as computer software and bus iness methods some observers believe that in comparison to predecessor courts the federal circuit has also made it more difficult to show that patent is invalid because its subject matter would have been obvious in light of the state of the art th federal circuit is so said to have both decreased the showing patent owner must make in order to obtain preliminary injunction against accused infringers and increased the monetary damages owed as remedy for patent infringement the federal circuit has also attracted some negative commentary some commentators believe that the concentration of patent cases in one court provides less chance for sound development of the law thr ough the contributions of many jurists because the federal circuit routinely counters patent law issues the pace of common law development in the patent field may be accelerated as compared to other fields possibly leading to less legal certainty the federal circuit has also been described as booster of the pate nt law with jurisprudence that favors patent owners and takes restrictive view of antitrust principles recent developments continue to shape the federal circuit the 1998 report of the commission on structural alternatives fo r the federal courts of appeals known as the white commission did not recommend any immediate changes to the makeup of the federal circuit but it did suggest that the federal circuit may be able to assume jurisdiction over additional classes of cases for which national uniformity is desired the 2002 supreme court decision in holmes group inc v vornado air circulation systems inc appears to have limited the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the federal circuit in patent cases continued experience with the federal circuit may provide insights on the possible benefits of creating other specialized tribunals identification of the factors that make judicial specialization desirable as well as the impact of specialized

viewed by many commentators as the most significant reform to the federal judicial system in nearly century1 the creation of the federal circuit was motivated by perceived need for more consistent interpretation of the patent law2 in the early 1980s many experts believed that the differing circuit courts of appeals varied wi dely in their handling of patent disputes3 congress therefore established the federal circuit centralized national court with exclusive appellate jurisdiction to h ear cases arising under the patent law4 congress hoped the federal circuit w ould provide more

group inc v vornado air circulation systems inc 7 along with concluding observations patent law and innovation policy the patent law provides i nventors with exclusive rights to exploit their inventions8 in so doing the patent law offe rs economic incentives for individuals and institutions to engage in technological innovation absent patent system an entire industry might readily be able to appropriate the bene fits of one firms innovative efforts cognizant of potential free riders enterprises might devote few if any resources towards research and development the patent law solves this market failure problem by allowing fi rms the opportunity to appropriate the economic benefits of their innovations9 the regime of patents is also said to serve other goals commentators have observed that patent rights facilitate technology transfer10 without patent rights an inventor may have ta ngible asset to sell or license in addition an inventor might otherwise be unable to police the conduct of contracting party any technology or knowhow that has been disclosed to prospective buyer might be appropriated without compensation to the inventor the availability of patent protection decreases the ability of contracting parties to engage in opportunistic behavior by lowering such transaction costs the patent syst em may make technolog ybased transactions more feasible11 experts also believe that the patent system encourages the disclosure of products and processes12 each issued patent must include description sufficient to enable skilled artisans to practice the patented invention13 issued patents may also encourage others to invent around the pa tentees proprietary in terest others can build upon the patentees disclosure to produce their own technologies that fall outside the exclusive rights associated with the patent14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31703crs3 15american law institute restatement of unfair competition third 39 1995 16david d friedman et some

145through these mechanisms the patent system may provide more socially desirable outcome than its ch ief legal alternative trad secret protection trade secrecy guards against the improper appr opriation of valuable commercially useful information that is the subject of reasonable measures to preserve its secrecy15 taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physicalsecurity measures imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductive for society 16 also while the patent law obliges inventors to disclose their inventions to the public17 trade secret protection requires firms to hold their protections in secret the disclosure obligations of th patent system may better serve the goals of encouraging the diffusion of advanced technological knowledge the extent to which the patent system practically achieves these goals is difficult to assess economic research suggests that different industries attach varying values to patents for example one study of the aircraft and semiconductor industries suggested that lead time and the strength of the learning curve were superior to patents in capturing the value of investments18 in contrast members of the drug and chemical industries attached higher value to patents differences in the perception of the patent system have been attributed to the extent to which patents introduced significant duplication costs and times for competitors of the patentee studies have indicated that individual entrepreneurs and sm all innovative firms rely more heavily upon the patent system than larger enterprises larger companies often possess number of alte rnative means for achieving proprietary or property like interest in particular technology for example trade secrecy ready access to markets trademark rights speed of velopment and cons umer goodwill may to some degree act as substitutes to the patent system as sally wyatt and gilles bertin reported in their survey of alternatives to patenting representative of one european corporation opined that mu ltinational corporati ons could easily cease to use patents and use other available methods to achieve the same aims19 however individual inventors and small firms ofte n do not have these mechanis ms at their disposal as result the patent system may enjoy heightened importance with respect to these enterprises20 perhaps the best evidence available as to the perceived value of patents is that in the united states the number of filed patent applications and issued patentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31703crs4 21robert hunt

been subject to criticism however some observers believe that the patent system encourag industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets23 others believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity24 still other commentators suggest that the patent system often convert s pioneering inventors into technological suppressors who use their patents to block subse quent improvements and thereby impede technical progress25 the wright brothers for example patented method for stabilizing flight by warping the wings of an aircraft26 their patent covered any system that varied the lateral margins of the wings in opposite directions soon thereafter glenn curtiss and alexa nder graham bell improved upon the wright brothers wingwarping device by using set of wing flaps or ailerons although the curtissbell invention was separately patent ed use of that invention would result in the infringement of the wright brothers pa tent some commentators believe that the wright brothers employed their patent to block use of the cu rtissbell improvement invention to the detriment of the deve lopment of the us aviation industry27 when analyzing these contending views it is important to note the lack of rigorous analytical methods available for analyzing the ffect of the patent law upon the us economy as whole the relati onship between innovati on and patent rights remains poorly understood concerned obser vers simply do not know what market impacts would result from changing patent term from its current twentyyear period for example28 as result current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the patent system precisely in order to produce an optimal level of investment in innovationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31703crs5 29pl 82593 66 stat 792 codified at title 35 united states code 3035 usc 111 2002 3135 usc 131 2002 3235 usc 112 2002 33ibid

approval for the patented invention from other federal agenciespatent acquisition as mandated by the patent act of 195229 us patent rights do not arise automatically inventors must prepare and submit applications to the us patent and trademark office if they wish to obtain patent protection30 uspto officials known as examiners then assess whether the application merits the award of patent31 in deciding whether to approve pate nt application uspto examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention32 in addition the application must di sclose the best m ode or preferred way that the applicant knows to practice the invention33 the examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute to be patentable an invention must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tang ible benefit34 to be judged novel the invention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publica tion or other knowledge within the public domain35 nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was made36 if the uspto allows the patent to issue the patent proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention37 the maximum term of patent protection is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the application is filed38 the patent

litigation prior to 1982 congress has specified that patent litigation generally occurs within the federal courts as compared to state or local courts39 patent disputes ter the federal court system through two principal routes firs t patent applicant may disagree with uspto decision denying the issuance of patent in such cases the patent applicant is entitled to appeal the administrative ag encys decision from its founding in 1909 through 1982 specialized tribunal the court of customs and patent appeals ccpa was authorized to hear cases arising from the uspto40 appeals from the ccpa could be heard by the nations highest court the us supreme court the second possibility is patent enforcem ent issued patents provide their owners with certain rights but these rights are not selfenforcing patentee bears responsibility for monitoring its competitors to determine whether they are using the patented invention or not patent proprietors who wish to compel others to observe their intellectual property rights must ordinarily commence litigation41 patent proprietors commence enforcement litigation in the us district courts which are the trial courts of the federal court system congress has established 94 federal judicial districts including at least one district in each state as well as the district of columbia puerto rico th virgin islands guam and the northern mariana islands42 these judicial districts are organized into 12 regional circuits each of which has us court of appeals court of appeals hears appeals from the district courts located within its circuit43 for example the court of appeals for the second circuit presides over the federal district courts of connecticut new york and vermont while the court of appeals for the seventh circuit hears cases from the district courts of illinois indiana and wisconsin44 the supreme court possesses authority to hear cases decided from the courts of appeal45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31703crs7 46federal

structure for patent appeals congress created new court the federal circu it possessing nationwide jurisdiction to hear appeals in cases involving the patent laws47 congress accomplished this task through two principal acts first congress abolished the ccpa and invested the federal circuit with jurisdiction over appeals of adverse patentability decisions from the uspto second congress divested the regional ci rcuit courts of appeals of patent enforcement cases under the new law the federal circuit enjoys national jurisdiction over appeals in patent infringement cases as result patent applicants may appeal adverse patentability decisions from the uspto directly to the federal circu it in addition in patent infringement litigation appeals go not to the regional cour ts of appeal but to the federal circuit for example suppose that the us district court for the eastern district of virginia decides case involving violation of federal employ ment laws and another case involving complaints of patent infringement because the us di strict court for the eastern district of virginia sits within the fourth circuit any appeal of the employment case would be to the us cour t of appeals for the fourth circuit an appeal of the district court judgment of th patent case would be heard by the federal circuit however the supreme court may resolve appeals decided by the federal circuit the history of the federal circuit long history concerns the concept of single national court of patent appeals legislative proposals to establish such tribunal date back to at least 188748 from that time through the world war ii era bills proposing similar arrangements were introduced in numerous sessions of congress49 paul janicke member of the faculty of the university of houston law center observes that although debate over the merits of national patent appeals c ourt occurred over nearly century the points of contention remained substantially the same over the years50 proponents

cases from various circuit courts of appeal some courts were believed to be very favorable towards patent proprietors while others only rarely upheld patent or found that th ere was patent infringement these perceived differences in attitudes towards patents lead to large expenditures of time and money by litigants trying to maneuver their lawsuits into or out of particular circuit52 opponents of patent appeal s court instead believed that judicial specialization would lead to negative consequences among other commentators judge simon rifkind argued that specialized courts by considering only narrow class of cases year after year would grow distanced from the mainstream of legal and societal thinking53 as well such court might come to have stake in the field of law in which it was meant to serve as an impartial decider of disputes much like an administrative agency subject to industry capture specialized patents court might believe that strong patent system wi th frequent findings of patent validity infringement and high damages awards woul d be within the courts own interest54 such bias might overly strengthen the patent system skewing economic incentives to innovate and discounting th interests of the public although debate over the wisdom of na tional patent appeal s court continued support for national patent appeals court rose by the early 1970s the increasing sophistication of technology was also be lieved to lead to increasingly complex expensive and timeconsuming patent litigation55 concerns also grew that the technological compe titiveness of the united states had weakened as compared to major trading partners such as japan and germany56 during this period many commentators called for strengthening of the us patent system in order to increase incentives to innovate national patent appeals court was among the advocated reforms for invigorating the us patent system57 these themes were reflected in the work of congressional

increasing acceptance in 1978 the department of justice established the office for improvements in the administration of justice oiaj former member of the university of virginia law faculty daniel j meador headed the oiaj the oiaj proposed that congress merge two existing courts the court of customs and patent appeals ccpa with another specialized tribunal the court of claims the court of claims

consolidated c ourt would be termed the us court of appeals for the federal circuit the oiaj offered number of arguments in favor of this proposal the oiaj believed that the consolida tion of patent

of adding new judges or confining the cour t to single area of expertise the oiaj also observed that as practical matter the two courts to be merged already occupied the same building in downtown

viewpoints about the court this report surveys differing opinions concerni ng the impact of the federal circuit upon the patent system and innovation policy perceived benefits of the federal circuit number of commentators belie ve that the federal circuit has strengthened the economic legal and co mmercial significance of patents to us industry as explained by patent atto rney robert p taylor by any measure chosen the economic importance of patent property in 2002 is greater by an order of magnitude than th at of generation ago the moment and volume of patent litigation the atten tion that patents receive in financial transactions and corporate boardroom s the magnitude of judgments and settlements all attest to the aggregate impact that the federal circuit has made on the patent right and the procedures for asserting it77 many commentators believe that fede ral circuit case law concerning the standard of obviousness has had an important impact by strengthening the patent right78 under the patent act in order to be patentable an invention would not have been obvious to person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made79 some observers believed that the re

view with patent w easier for the innovative industry to discern more predictable legal envir onment for technological advancement has resulted critiques of the federal circuit the federal circuit has also been the subject of critical commentary over its twentyyear history some commentator s have expressed concern over the unique nature of the federal circuit which departs from the traditional structure of appellate courts in published judicial opinion chie f judge young of the us district court for the district of massachusetts stated the federal circuit is different unlike the other regional circuit courts of appeal the federal circuit came into be ing in part pursuant to an express congressional mandate to foster uniformity in the law of patents indeed the federal circuit views itself as substantive policymaker court with mission almost since its inception the federal circuit has been dogged with criticism for straying from the path caref ully delineated for appellate

standard that is believed to be lenient and perceived restricted view of antitrust principles as evidence that the federal circuit is favorab forum for patent owners the trend towards an expansive sense of the subject matter that can be patented including biotechnology business methods and computer software as well as the increased damages awards have been noted previously105 some observers see these developments not so much as reflecting th needs of modern industry or the actual economic consequence of pate nt infringement but rather bias towards increasing the importance of the patent law106 as noted above in the view of some commentators the federal circuit has lowered the standard of nonobviousness107 for example the federal circuit has prohibited uspto examiners from relyin g upon common sense in its patentability determinations instead examiners must cite specific earlier patents publications and other references that prove th invention would have been obvious108 i n addition in contrast to predecessor courts the federal circuit also allows patent owners to rely more heavily upon socalled secondary cons iderations such as the commercial success of the pate nted invention in order to prove that the invention would not have been obvious109 as result some observers believe that uspto examiners face more difficulty in rejecting patent applications on such inventions as business methods and accused infringers have harder time having issued patents declared invalid110 in the view of some observers the fe deral circuit has not rigorously upheld antitrust policies according to attorneys ronald s katz and adam j safer one potential and unintended effect of the creation of the federal circuit is that the delicate balance maintained for many years between intellectual property law and antitrust law may have been tipped decisively in favor of intellectual property111 katz and safer contend that in cases covering such practices as refusals to license and

analysts also believe that the concentration of patent law appeals within the federal circuit leads to rapid pace of legal development in speech delivered at the marquette law school judge randa ll r rader of the federal circuit explained that the number of copyright lawsuits is comparable to the number of patent suits each year judge rader furthe r estimated that while the average circuit court decides an average of 35 copyright cases each year the federal circuit has in recent years averaged 96 precedential patent cases annually114 judge rader concluded that the rate of common law development at the federal circuit proceeds at twentyfive times the pace of the average circuit115 such concentration could conceivably lead to less rather than more predictability within the patent law other observers believe the specializ ed appeals court model provides less chance for sound development of the law as explained by judge rader when the federal circuit speaks that becomes the nationwide rule and in many cases once it has spoken there is less percolation and less chance for experimentation channeling cases to single forum may deprive the patent law of the collective wisdom

well the 2002 decision of the supreme court in holmes group inc v vornado air circulation systems inc 121 appears to have restricted the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the federal circuit this report explores these two developments in turn the white commission congress created the commission on structural alternatives for the federal courts of appeals in 1997122 the commission headed by retired us supreme court justice byron r white has been more commonly termed the white commission the commission was charged to report to the president and the congress its recommendations for such

regional circuits to the federal circuit125 the draft report observed that pa tents and copyrights are linked in the constitution which permits congress to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries126 like patents copyrights are governed by single federal law th commission observed suggesting that uniform interpretation of those laws is desirable objective the commission further observed that the availability of both copyright and patent protection for computer programs has caused convergence in th two legal disciplines the commission noted that these developments have led some observers to suggest that the same court be assigned exclusive jurisdiction over patent and copyright claims127 the white commission deleted this discussion from the final version of its report however although the white commission did not explain this omission some commentary over this portion of the dr aft report was negative carl tobias member of the faculty of the univers ity of nevada at vegas law school observed that federal circuit judges had minimal experience with copyright128 michael k kirk executive director of the american intellectual property law association stated that the federal ci rcuit already possessed busy caseload that should not be further weighted down by the imposition of copyright claims129 finally mr kirk also believed that copy right on technologies formed relatively small part of the copyright law so that any perceived efficiency gains were minimal130 mr kirk further stated that the federal circuit should not become catchall court or dumping ground for va rious types of appeals that can be neatly carved out of regional

supreme court issued its decision in holmes group inc v vornado air circulation systems inc134 that case interprets the principal statutes establishing the jurisdiction of the federal circuit the first of these statutes 28 usc 1295 provides in part the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction 1 of an appeal from final decision of district court of the united states if the jurisdiction of that court was ba sed in whole or in part on section 1338 of this title in turn 28 usc 1338a states in part with emphasis added the district courts shall have orig inal jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents plant variety protection copyrights and trademarks courts traditionally look to see whether cas is arising under particular statute by looking solely at the documents the pl aintiff files with court to commence particular litigation these documen ts are termed the complaint135 thus if the plaintiffs complaint stated cause of ac tion under the patent law then the district court would possess jurisdiction and app eals would go to the federal circuit lawyers sometimes term this the doctrine as the wellpleaded complaint rule136 more difficult issues arise when the pl aintiffs complaint does not state cause of action in patent law but the defendants court filings do the defendants court filings termed as the answer may cont ain socalled counterclaims that include cause of action under the patent law137 for example suppose that the plaintiff claims an antitrust violation in his complaint while the defendant in turn asserts claim of patent infringement against the plaintiff in her answer the issue in holmeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31703crs21 138aerojetgeneral corp v machine

vornado was whether such case arises under the patent law within the meaning of the statutes establishing the jurisdiction of the federal circuit numerous earlier federal ci rcuit cases looked to whet her either the plaintiffs complaint or the defendants answer asserted cause of action based upon the patent law138 if so then the federal circuit believed that it possessed jurisdiction to resolve that appeal the federal circuit justifie d its interpretation of the statute based upon its congressional mandate to prevent forum shopping and provide consistent interpretation of the patent laws nationwide139 in holmes v vornado the supreme court overturned the federal circuit the supreme court held that counterclaim which appears as part of the defendants answer not as part of the pl aintiffs complaint cannot rve as the basis for arising under jurisdiction140 the supreme court held that the wellpleaded complaint rule was of long standing and could not be converted into wellpleaded complaint orcounterclaim rule141 the consequence of holmes v vornado is that appeals of cases based upon complaint that does not state cause of action in patent law but nonetheless involve c onsiderable patent issues w ill be heard by the regional courts of appeals rather than the fede ral circuit although the supreme court recognized that having regional circuits decide patent counter claims could undermine consistency in the patent law the concurring opinion of justice stevens observed an occasional conflict in decisions may be useful in identifying questions that merit this courts attent ion moreover ccasional decisions by courts with broader jurisdiction will provide an antidote to the risk that the specialized court may develop an institutional bias142 attorney james w dabney has stated that holmes v vornado strengthens the traditional right of plaintiffs to choose th eir own law and forum and contracts the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the federal circuit143 attorneys bruce m wexler and joseph m omalley jr are somewhat more concerned over the impact of the decision predicting that holmes v vornado is almost certain to introduce some strategic forum

that makes it more difficult for innovative firms to do business remains an open question with recent developments continuing to shape the jurisdiction of the court the federal circuit remains work in

been some congressional interest in creating court to hear pharmaceutical patent disputes investing single trial court with exclusive jurisdiction to preside over patent trials and introducin g
