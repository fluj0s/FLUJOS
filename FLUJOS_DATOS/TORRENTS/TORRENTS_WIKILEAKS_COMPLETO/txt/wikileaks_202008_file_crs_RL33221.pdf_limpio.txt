extent to which the stafford act allows local private nonprofit pnp organizations to be reim bursed for disaste rrelated activities or damages the first requirement for determining pnps potential eligibility for reimbursement by the federal emergency management agency fema is that the pnp have an effective ruling letter from the internal revenue service granting tax exemption under section 501c d or of the internal revenue code of 1954 as amended or state certification that the organization is nonprofit organization under state law1 local pnp may be eligible for reimbursement in either of two ways for reimbursement of costs associated with protecting the general public or for reimbursement of costs associated with th pnps site equipment or facilities in the first instance those efforts that protect the lives of the public such as search and rescue operations evacuation assistance mass sheltering or mass feeding would all be eligible for reimbur sement in contrast the second form of reimbursement is for costs the pnp incurs protecting repairing or replacing its equipment facilities or site this reimbursement might include the overtime costs of boarding up windows moving equipment to safer locale re pairing damaged window s and furniture or replacing destroyed equipment or structures it might also cover debris removal and other site cleanup costs these two reim bursement justificati ons are presented in more detail in the following eight brief sections funding channel for pnp reimbursement eligible applicants may request reimburse ment for disasterrelated costs through femas public assistance pa program the pa program breaks out the various types of reimbursable costs into seven categories the presidential declaration authorizing the federal disaster assistance identifies the counties eligible for assistance and specifies which pa categories are authoriz ed for each declared county public assistance program categories for reimbursement the seven categories for reimburseme nt under the pa program are category debris removal category b emergency protective measures including search and rescue shelter opera tions mass feeding emergency

services to the general public the stafford act authorizes reimbursement for costs associated with reducing the threat to the public3 examples of such emergency work include setting up staffing and operating she lters operating food kitchens and conducting search and rescue operations4 these activities fall under category b of the pa program typically the local government or the affected state has formal agreement already in place with local pnps that delineates the responsibilities and roles of these organizations within the broader framework of the communitys or states emergency response plan this agreement is necessary for reimbursement of costs associated with emergency services provided to the public usually the local government or the state will apply to fema for reimbursement of the costs incurred for providing these emergency serv ices to the public rather than the pnp itself5 the written agreement w ith the pnp would indicate if the pnp is to be reimbursed by the local or state government before or after the local or state government is reimbursed by fema reimbursement for pnps costs associated with its site equipment or facilities the stafford act allows certain pnps to request reimbursement for costs incurred due to disaster for measures taken to protect the facility equipment or on site staff to resume operations and to repair or replace damaged equipment or structures the evaluation of the request is to be predicated on the appropriate category of activity under the pa program being authorized by the presidential declaration for the applicants county

eligible pnp in order to meet eligibility requirements for reimbursement of costs associated with th pnps site equipment or facilities the pnps daytoday mission must provide essential services of governmental nature to the general public italics added6 these services have been further broken down into critical services and noncritical servi ces examples of cr itical services that pnps may provide include power water wastewat er treatment irrigation communications or emergency medical care7 pnps that provide these services may apply for fema reimbursement without first applying to the small business administration sba for lowinterest loan8 there are number of pnp functions of governmental nature that are not defined as critical but that may receive reimbursement these include medical facilities eg hospitals and outpatient or rehabilitation facilities custodial care eg nursing homes emergency facilities eg volunteer fire departments and search and rescue organizations and educational instituti ons eg k12 school boards and accredited colleges or universities other ligible pnps may provide essential health and safety services such as low income housing alcohol and drug rehabilitation facilities for battered spouses food programs for the needy and daycare centers for those with special needs such as those with alzheimers disease autism and muscular dystrophy9 finally there are other pnps that provide services of governmental nature that may also be eligible for reimbursement these may include zoos mu seums libraries homeless shelters and senior citizen centers10 nonprofits often deemed in eligible for reimbursement s m nonprofit gr oups are typica lly deemed ineligible for reimbursement they include those whose efforts are geared to na rrow portion of the

cost share requirements see 44 cfr 20647 14 it is possible that the agreement between the local government and the pnp may stipulate that the pnp itself apply to fema for reimbursement in which case the pnp must provide the local nonstate nonfe deral portion of the match 15 stafford act sec 309b 42 usc 5152b 16 ibid stafford act secs 311a1 and 312a 42 usc 5154 a1 and 5155areligious services or education conferen ce facility or center for the performing arts however there are exceptions for example nonprofit with specific membership requirements but whose memb ership rules incorporate an openended parameter such as all youth under age 16 or any adult over age 65 may still be eligible for reimbursement12 thus rural electrical c ooperative may be eligible for reimbursement for damages to its substation and pnp th at operates an eldercare center may be eligible for reimbursement for damages to its building but pnp that operates job training center may not ce job training centers are not typically eligible costshare requirements for pnps the stafford act stipulates that the share of costs reimbursed by the federal government will be not less than 75 of total costs the remainder is the statelocal requirement this is often euphemistically referred to as the match the match is to be split between the state and the applicant for reimbursement in some states it is an even split 125 state and 125 appli cant but in others it is 10 state and 15 applicant fema may increase th federal share up to 90 but only the president or congress can eliminate the match altogether13 if local government contracts with pnp to provide services then the local government is the applicant and it must come up with its portion of the match14 if the pnp is operating independently eg hospita l or utility coopera tive and the pnp is the applicant then it must contribute the applicants portion of the 25 match in order to receive reimbursement funding other stafford act requirements for pnp reimbursement three other requirements are placed on nonprofit applicants for reimbursement under the stafford act first the assistance provided by pnps may not be discriminatory15 second the assistance provided by pnps may not use federal supplies or aid to duplicate benefits provide d by insurance or other federal agencies thus fema funding will reimburse for shelters and housing and

reimbursement number of complex eligibility requirements must be met before fema obligates disaster relief fund monies to th state for distributi on to the applicant not all costs incurred by an eligible applicant are eligible for public assistance funding18 for instance damaged buildings belonging to pnp that were not being used eg were vacant or abandoned at the time of the disaster are not eligible for repair or replacement reimbursement19 costs for equipment or facility repairs that are actually routine maintenance eg replacing dead patrol car batteries or repainting walls undamaged by the disaster are also not eligible for reimbursement20 last example is that the request for re imbursement must be for work or damages directly resulting from the disaster itself and not due to deferred maintenance negligence or other causes21 figure 1 at the end of this report illustrates the manner in which local pnp may receive reimbursement from fema use of fema reimbursement funds for operating expenses fema does not officially reimburse fo r operating expenses even if the operating expenses have incr eased due to the disaster22 however the funds for completed emergency work are to be distributed to pnps after the work has been documented and verified c onsequently pnp may use the reimbursement funds in whatever manner it deems appr opriate including using them for operating expenses furthermore if pnp has an urgent need for funding and the processing of the application for reimbursement of emergency work costs has not been completed but these costs have been deemed eligible for reimbursement the pnp may receive an advance of portion of the re imbursement for emergency wo rk costs this advance is called immediate needs funding23 for reimbursement of costs associated withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33221crs6 24 us federal emergency management agency public assistance guide p 27repairing structural damage to pnps facility or for replacing destroyed facility the distribution of funds is often done incrementally once the damage has been verified for instance for projects deemed large currently those that cost more than 55 500 fema is require d to reimburse for actual costs paid and therefore must document the costs incurred as the proj ect progresses as result funds for permanent work are required to be spent on the project stipulated in the request for assistance on the other hand the pnp may be igible for assistance from the small business administration sba for operating costs additionally if the pnp is publicprivate organization it may be eligible for assistance from the economic development agency eda or if it is in rural area the u s department of agriculture usda in addition some insurers provide business disruption insurance to cover operating costs and loss of revenue finally the pnp may request funding from foundations or ot her charitable organizations funds to pnps for capital improvements if disaster causes structural damage to pnps facilities and the cost of bringing the facility up to new building code standards exceeds the revenue from insurance and the pnps cash reserves the amount of reimbursement under femas public assistance program may be augmen ted by additional f unds provided through the codes and standards ch annel under the public assi stance program this is sometimes referred to as the increased cost of compliance program24 also the pnp may be eligible for assistance from sba for capital improvements or if the pnp is publicprivate organization it ma be eligible for assistance from eda or usda if it is in rural area in add ition the pnp may be eligible for grants through the united way or charitabl foundations for capital improvements conclusion while the stafford act permits private nonprofits to receive reimbursement for disasterrelated emergency work or dama ges number of eligibility requirements must first be met the first is that the internal revenue service rule that the pnp is tax exempt under section 501c d or of the internal revenue code of 1954 additional eligibility re quirements are stated in the stafford act and expanded upon in femas policy guidance documents the public assistance policy digest fema 321 and the public assistance guide fema322 for particular cases femas 9500 series of policy statements discuss specific policy procedures and guidelines such as the use of temporar facilities in addition th costs for which the pnp is requesting reimbursement must be related either to services or activities rendered to protect the general public or to disasterrelated costs associated with the pnps site equipment or facilities finally the stafford act imposes costshare requirements on all local applicants for re imbursement including pnpshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33221crs7 figure 1 potential reimbursement to local pnps for disasterrelated costs fema obligates funds to the affected state from the disaster relief fund funds may not be released for projects in which either the state or local match is not met fema may increase the federal share of the costshare requirement from 75 up to 90 but higher 42 usc 5141 42 usc 5172a3 42

the national organization will be reimbursed directly by fema without statelocal match requirement if the local pnp provides these lifesaving services to the public through written agreement with the local government then the local pnp may be eligible for reimbursement either as an independent applicant for reimbursement or as part of the local governments overall application to fema for
