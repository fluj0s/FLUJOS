stab families program first created in 1993 under different name had expired at the end of fy2001 thus the 107th congress acted to reauthorize this program and make some program changes hr 2873 pl 107133 as prev iously authorized the program subpart 2 of title ivb of the social security ac t used mandatory funds to provides grants to states for use in four categories of services family preservation communitybased family support timelimited family reunification and adoption promotion and support in addition funds are reserved from the safe and stable fa milies appropriation each year for national evaluations of activities supported by th is program and grants to state courts to help them improve their child welfare proceedings the promoting safe and stable families program including the grants to courts is administered by the department of health nd human services hhs and its legislation is under the jurisdiction of the house ways and means and senate finance committees pl 107133 continues to fund these four broad categories of child welfare services along with state court improve ment grants and evaluations however it changes the programs funding authorizati on the new law sets an annual mandatory funding base of 305 million nd separately allows for discretionary appropriations up to 200 million annually the law also provides that out of any discretionary funds appropriated certain am ount must be added to the previously established set asides for program evaluation and court improvement grants legislative history congress first created family pres ervation and family support program in 1993 in response to the widespread percep tion of crisis in the nations child welfare system the crack cocaine epidemic was generally blamed for precipitating the dramatic growth in foster care that occurred during the midtolate 1980s which highlighted and exacerbated ongoing concer ns about the impact on children of other forms of substance and alcohol abuse poverty homelessness aids and mental illness as the foster care caseload grew the child welfare system faced high staff turnover and low morale shrinking supply of foster parents and foster homes and shortage of related support services such as drug and alcohol treatment and mental health care to address these issues child welfare agencies in some states and localities developed innovative services including in tensive family preservation services to help families in crisis avoid losing their children to foster care however federal funds were generally available only after children were placed in foster care rather than to help provide services for families to prevent placement in foster care thus these early family preserva tion activities depended largel on nonfederal and private resources at the same time growth in the foster care population resulted in largehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30894crs3 1 under title ive of the social security act the federal government reimburses states for part of their eligible foster care costs on an openended entitlement basis thus as the number of children in the foster care population increases federal spending also increases there is cap on federal foster care expenditures between 1985 and 1990 the number of children in foster care nationwide increased from 276000 to 400000 while federal spending grew from 794 million to 19 billion 2 for information about this program see di scussion of related programs in this report 3 see crs report rl30759 child welfare impl ementation of the adoption and safe families act increases in federal spending to help support these children and congress became interested in family preservation services as means of slowing down this growth1 while proposed by the clinton administration the program enacted in 1993 built upon provisions develope d and passed by the 102nd congress as component of urban aid and tax legislation former president bush vetoed this earlier legislation hr 11 for reasons unrelated to child welfare ultimately legislation establishing this program was included in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 which made number of chan ges in federal child welfare law the 1993 law authorized capped entitleme nt grants to states for family preservation and family support services under subpart 2 of title ivb of the social security act states already had flexib ility to spend child we lfare services funds available under subpart 1 of title ivb2 for family support and preservation activities but few states appeared to use significant share of such dollars for these kinds of services entitlement funding was granted for 5 years at the following ceilings 60 million in fy1994 150 million in fy1995 225 million in fy1996 240 million in fy1997 and either 255 million in fy1998 or the fy1997 level adjusted for inflation whichever was greater separate from this legisl ation debate was ongoing in the child welfare community about the challenge of achievi ng an appropriate balance between family preservation and child protection by 1997 some policy makers were concerned that efforts to promote family preservation had gone too far some argued that child safety was jeopardized by premature deci sions to return children home and that extended efforts to rehabilitate parents caused children to linger indefinitely in foster care in response congress enacted th adoption and safe families act asfa pl 10589 in november 1997 with two primary goals to make child safety paramount in child welfare decisions and to ensure that necessary legal procedures occur quickly so children who cannot return home can be placed for adoption or another permanent arrangement without unn ecessary delay to achieve these goals asfa made significant amendments to th foster care provisions authorized under title ive of the social security act3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30894crs4 4 this setaside was 2 million in fy1994 5 this setaside was 5 million in fy1994because asfa increased pressure on pa rents to resolve their problems quickly or potentially face termination of their rights to their children lawmakers felt additional services should be made available for these pa rents moreover the law promotes adoption for children who cannot be reunified with their fa milies and need for adoptionrelated services also was identified thus although the family preservation and family s upport program was not yet due to expire congress responded to these concerns by including an extension of the program in the 1997 asfa legislation along with amendm ents responding to these concerns asfa changed the programs name to promoting safe and stable families and reauthorized it through fy2001 at the following entitlement ceiling levels 275 million for fy1999 295 million for fy2000 and 305 million for fy2001 in addition asfa added two mo re categories of services th at states are now required to provide under this program timelimite d family reunificati on and adoption promotion and support the promoting safe and stable families amendments of 2001 hr 2873 were introduced on september 10 2001 by representatives wally herger and benjamin cardin as introduced and draf ted earlier by the bush administration the bill sought mandatory funding fo r the program of 505 million in each of fy2002fy2006 the presidents fy2002 budget request also asked for this mandatory funding level however at the august 2001 midsession budget review the office of management and budget ch anged the administrations budget request for additional promoting safe and stable families program from mandatory to discretionary funds subseque ntly the september 11 terro rist attacks and related national security and other spending prompted concern among some congress members about new program costs although support for the full 505 million in mandatory funds remained in the sena see bipartisan support for s 1503 introduced october 4 2001 and among house democrats congress ultimately passed fiveyear program reauthorization fy2002fy2006 that maintained 305 million base in mandatory f unding and allowing annual discretionary appropriations up to 200 million program elements from the entitlement ceiling amounts for safe and stable families now set at 305 million through fy2006 6 million in each fiscal year is reserved for use by the secretary of hhs to fund research tr aining technical assi stance and evaluation4 and 10 million in each fiscal year is reserv ed for grants to state courts program described below5 finally 1 of the entitlement dollars are reserved for allotment to indian tribes each year in addition to these amounts pl 107133 provides thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30894crs5 out of any discretionary funds appropriated for the promoting safe and stable families program 70 million in fy2002 2 be added to the existing setaside for indian tribes 33 be added to the set aside for grants to state courts and an additional 33 be adde d to the set aside for researc h training technical assistance and evaluation after these setasides are made remaining program funds are allocated among states according to their relative shares of children receiving food stamps subject to 25 nonfederal match states must submit plan to hhs that provides detailed account of how money will be used under the safe and stab families program prior to enactment of the adoption and safe fa milies act pl 10589 at least 90 of each states allotment had to be used for the original two categories of services family preservation and communitybased family support services as described above pl 10589 added two new categories timelimited family reuni fication services and adoption promotion and s upport services states now must use at least 90 for these four categories more than 10 of funds can be used for administration the federal statute does not specify percentage or minimum amount of funds that must be spent on any particular category of service but says that states must devote significant portions of their expenditures to each of the four in annual program instructions hhs has said that st ates must have strong rationale for spending less than 20 of their allotments on each of the four categories of services see below use of funds by states for more information income eligibility criteria apply to families served in any component of this program family preservation services family preservation services may be defined broadly to encompass range of activities and service delivery models designed to keep atrisk families together and avoid the need to place children in foster care the target population is ch ildren and families in cluding extended and adoptive families that are at risk or in crisis the statute authorizes the following programs to help reunite children with their biological families if safe and appropriate or to place them for adop tion or another permanent arrangement programs to prevent placement of children in foster care including intensive family preservation services that can enable children to remain at home safely programs to provide followup services to families after child has been returned from foster care respite care to provide temporary relief fo r parents and other caregivers including foster parents services to improve parenting skills and newly authorized by pl 107133 infant safe haven programs to provide way for parent to safely relinquish newborn infant at loca tion designated pursuant to state law among this array of activities intensive family preservation services have received the greatest attention especially in the programs early years as potentially costeffective way to prevent children from tering foster care these services are known by various names at the state and cal level but generally share some basic features roundtheclock ava ilability of the caseworker to the family very small caseloads to allow services to be intens ive an average of 8 to 10 hours per week spent with the family primarily with di rect facetoface contact and time limit on intensive service delivery generally ranging from 4 to 12 weeks one of the earliest and best known family preser vation programs is homebu ilders which began in 1974 in tacoma washington and has served as model for other programs around thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30894crs6 country however recent evaluations of this model have not produced significant positive impacts on reducing the placement of children into foster care see evaluation discussion below family support services family support services are intended to reach families that are not yet in crisis and to prevent child abuse or neglect from occurring as described in the statute family suppor t services are communitybased activities designed to promote the safety and wellbeing of children and families to increase the strength and stability of families inc luding adoptive foster and extended families to increase parents confidence and competence to provide children with safe stable and supportive family environment and to enhance child development pl 107133 clarified this definition of family support services by adding to strengthen parental relati onships and promote healthy marriages to the kinds of activities they provide examples of services from the conf erence agreement on the 1993 law include parenting skills training respite care to relieve parents and other caregivers structured activities involving parents and ch ildren to strengthen their relationships dropin centers for families information and referral services and early developmental screening for children during hearings on the original 1993 legislation hhs cited the following examples of family support activities home visiting programs for firsttime parents of newborns to connect them with appropriate services if needed programs to train mothers in the community to visit participating parents and share activities to enhance the development of preschoolers and state or regiona l networks of family support centers that provide services to young mothers timelimited family reunification services as added by the adoption and safe families act pl 10589 timelimited re unification services are intended to facilitate the timely reunification of children who have been removed from home and placed in foster care these services are intended to return children to their families within 15 months of their having entered foster care if safe and appropriate reunification services for children and th eir families include c ounseling substance abuse treatment services mental health services assistance to address domestic violence temporary child care and therapeutic services such as crisis nurseries and transportation to and from these activitie s lawmakers placed 15month limit on these services to be consistent with another provision in the adoption and safe families act of 1997 which requires states to initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights in the case of children who have been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months adoption promotion and support servi ces adoption promotion and support services also added to the law by pl 10589 are activities designed to encourage more adoptions out of the foster care system services include pre and postadoptive services and activities designed to expe dite adoptions and support adoptive familieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30894crs7 6 james bell associates family preservation and family support implementation study interim report march 1999 executive

service categories in 1999 james bell associates released an inter im report on the family preserva tion and family support services implementation study describing state and local planning efforts the relationship of planning to service delivery and the design of programs6 this report looked at state activities prior to the enactment of the 1997 amendments when only two categories of services were authorized the ctor found that services did not fall neatly into the categories of family preservati on and family support as defined in the legislation although the major ity of services were in ge neral more characteristic of family support programs th is was consistent with findings of the general accounting office gao which also studied the issue before enactment of the 1997 amendments and reported that states were using more than half of their funds for family support services7 family support services ar designed for broader population than family preservation activities in march 2001 james bell released nother implementa tion report on the intended use of funds by states in 1999 th is was the first year that states were required to spend portion of their allotme nts on the two new categories of services timelimited family reunifi cation and adoption pr omotion and support8 the report shows that four states did not plan to spend the required minimum of 20 of their allotments on family preservation services and one state did not plan to use 20 of funds for family support however 19 st ates intended to spend less than 20 on timelimited family reunifi cation in 1999 while 18 states planned to spend less than 20 on adoption promotion and support nationwide projected allocations for fy1999 were 29 for family preservati on 40 for family support 16 for time limited family reunification and 15 for adoption promotion and support hhs requires states to submit rationale for spending less than 20 on each category and some states indicated they were phasing in the new categories to avoid disruption of existing family preservation and family support activities other states said they deferred the decisionmaking process to local entities and some states failed to provide rationalehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30894crs8 looking at 30 states for which comparab data are available for each of the three fiscal years from 1997 to 1999 james be ll noted that states had been devoting more of their resources to family s upport in the early years than to family preservation however when states d to reallocate resources in order to accommodate the two new categories they shifted program funding away from family support to greater extent than fro m family preservation specifically states used 59 of their safe and stable familie s allotments for family support services in fy1997 which dropped to 39 in fy1999 at the same time states used 41 of their allotments for family preservation in fy1997 which was reduced to 32 in fy1999 other sources of funds james bell also reported that the safe and stable families program contributes only small part of total spending for the four services it supports the single largest source of support for family preservation services has been state and local resources accounting for 48 of total spending in 1997 and an estimated 67 in 1999 likewise state and local resources are the single largest source of support for family support servi ces accounting for 43 of total spending for that category in 1997 and 58 in 1999 the increase in the proportion of state and local spending for these two cat egories between 1997 and 1999 may reflect efforts to maintain overall rvice levels while federal funds have been reallocated to accommodate the two newest categories of services the second largest source of funding for family preservation has been the social services block grant ssbg which acc ounted for 14 of spending in 1997 and 12 in 1999 meanwhile safe and stab families accounted for 9 of total spending on family preservation in 1997 and 5 in 1999 ssbg provided 15 of the resources for family support in both 1997 and 1999 alt hough 21 in 1998 while safe and stable fa milies contributed 12 of total spending in 1997 and 6 in 1999 other sources of support for both categories included child welfare services under subpart 1 of title ivb medicaid temporary assistance to needy families tanf other federa l funds and in the case of family support services title ii of the child abuse and prevention treatment act capta and the independent living program for older fost er youth in the case of family support services in 1999 the first year that states we re required to devo safe and stable families funds to time limited family reunification the program accounted for 9 of total spending in this area compared to 64 from state and local funds 18 from medicaid 4 from ssbg 3 from tanf and 2 from child welfare services the safe and stable families program was most significant for adoption promotion and support in 1999 providing 37 of total sp ending in that category nonetheless the largest source of support was state nd local resources which accounted for 56 of total spending other sources of suppor t were tanf 4 child welfare services 2 and other federal funds 1 evaluations the secretary of hhs is required to evaluate activities funded under this program and in september 1994

the national evaluations have yet been published however several interim reports are available and more reports are expected to be released this year in may 1995 the contractors submitted two products including literature review of existing research on family preservation and family reunification and description of the range of prog ram models then in existence9 although numerous studies had been conducted of individual programs leading to initial enthusiasm for the family preservation approach the 1995 literature review found little solid evidence demonstrating that programs designed to prevent foster care placement or to reunify families had achieved their intended goals nonexperimental studies had produced misleading results and the few c ontrolled studies that had been conducted yielded mixed findings the research suggested that family preservation programs had only modest effects on family and child functioning although the contractors suggested that it would be unrealistic to expect dramatic results in this area given the scope of problems facing child welfare clients and the shortterm nature of family preservation services regarding family reunification the contractors noted that evaluations of such programs were still very preliminary but that few studies had reported encouraging results in 1998 the contractors submitted final report on one specific family reunification project known as home rebuilders in new york city10 this project began in 1993 and tested an alternative pa yment method for foster care in which six local agencies received flat rate for serving an identified group of children in foster care for 3year period these funds could be used for foster car or any service the agencies believed would achieve permanency funding was frontloaded in the first year to encourage early discharge and agencies could retain any savings they realized if the children left foster care before the end of the 3 years the impact of homerebuilders varied across the six participating agencies earlier discharge from foster care and fewer days in care was achieved in one of the three agencies using random assignment with 13 difference between the experimental and control groups this outcome did not occur at the other two random assignment sites however although one of th nonrandom assignment agen cies did show fewer days in foster care the contractors concluded that changes in fiscal incentives alone are not likely to result in major child welfare reform but that other factors are needed for reform to occur such as

states with regard to rates of placement in foster care or case closings likewise differences were found with regard to subsequent child maltreatment improve ments in some family functioning outcomes were seen at the point when services ended but these findings were not consistent across sites nor maintained over time interestingly however significant portion of program participants in two states reported great improvement in their lives at the end of treatment in their conclusion the researchers sugge sted that these findings should be used to reevaluate the objectives of family preservation programs they suggest focusing on improving child and family functioning among families with substantiated maltreatment reports but where the children are able to remain home rather than attempting to prevent placement of children who are at imminent risk of foster care the researchers suggested that tighter targeting of family preservation services might produce more positive impacts finally they noted that the shortterm nature of intensive family preservation services might be inconsistent with the real lives of program clients who are likely to experien ce chronic or recurring problems and

mothers are particularly vulnerable as these children typically come from househ olds where the mother was the sole provider making placement in foster care more likely when the mother is in prison
