mohammed has ruled morocco since the 17th century although the country was protectorate of france from 1912 until independence in 1956 king hassan ii aged 69 has led morocco for 37 years his heir apparent is crown prince sidi mohammed aged 34 but interior minister driss basri is widely regarded as the second most powerful man in the realm soon after he ascended to the throne the king initiated process of gradual controlled democratization constitution providing for representative government was approved in 1962 but two unsuccessful coup attempts in the 1970s derailed the process for some time the kings heightened attention to democratization in recent years may result from concern about succession he is of advancing age and has intermittent health problems the crown princes fitness to succeed and personal conduct have been questioned the kings steadfast commitment to political change and stable political system may partly reflect his appreciation of his sons weaknesses the crown prince goes on selected foreign missions and has been increasingly visible at imageenhancing charitable events 1992 constitution created unicameral legislature with more responsibilities than previous parliaments constitutional amendments in 1996 changed the framework to bicameral parliament on november 14 1997 the 325seat lower house chamber of deputies was elected by direct vote on december 5 labor unions professional organizations and local government officials selected the 270seat upper house the chamber of counsellors which has the unprecedented power to topple government by vote of confidence and may amend laws some older political parties had coalesced over time into three blocs the opposition koutla bloc the kings loyalists of wifaq consensus and the wasit or centre independents the koutlas socialist union of popular forces usfp won the most lower house seats and its leader abderrahmane youssoufi was named to be prime minister on february 4 1998 the king had long desired an opposition government to bring fresh approaches to the countrys problems and revitalize the political system yet the coup attempts of the 1970s had made him fear threats to his regime and depend on interior minister basris sometimes brutal oversight of national security therefore the king would not grant the koutlas demand for basris removal which had been the koutlas condition for participation when youssoufi abandoned that demand he was chosen to the head what emerged as coalition government of seven parties from the koutla and centre basri remains interior minister with control over security matters elements of the nonsecurity part of his portfolio have been shifted to the ministry of administration in addition youssoufi has rapidly established himself as the kings point of contact with the government supplanting basri in that role youssoufi has been attempting to reduce basris influence in other matters the few other retained ministers include abdellatif filali former prime minister who is foreign minister koutla controls the economic portfolios and the government program emphasizes economic and social issues with unemployment and education topping the

to the government foundation that was lost when they formed government the usfp is secular party with socialist inclinations istiqlal is rightist traditional party with arabistislamic tendencies and more to the point with ambitions to head government centre parties in the coalition such as rni which had governed in the past reportedly find compromises with their former opponents difficult the centre is disintegrating with some members participating in the government and others becoming opposition meanwhile wifaq has been marginalized in the opposition without program or leading spokesman wifaq and centre dominate the upper house whose power remains untested because the government has not passed much legislation governmental changes are occurring on the regional and local levels as well an innovative decentralization initiative is intended to bridge the wide gap between urban and rural areas it gives provincial and local assemblies authority and funds to carry out some development projects and address education and health issues as in some other muslim countries islamists are political factor of consequence and concern the regime has dealt with them with combination of tolerance and repression in june 1997 an unrecognized group isla wa tajdid reform and renewal merged with an inactive legal political party the popular constitutional and democratic movement mpcd islas leader abdelilah benkiarane became the mpcd leader benkiarane declared the partys principles to be islam the constitutional monarchy and nonviolence and vowed to work within the established governmental framework1 mpcd won 9 seats in parliament and supports the governments program it is organizing the grass roots but with limited financial resources the more radical adl wa ihsane justice and charity is banned and its leader the politically uncompromising shaykh abdessalam yassine has been under house arrest for nine years yassine followers are active on university campuses and in urban slums student members have been arrested in connection with university disturbances islamists inroads are attributed to their willingness to deal with economic and social ills an opening left by ineffective prior governments authoritarian nonislamist parties lacking grass roots programs and appeal and the interior ministry which has viewed islamist demands as security threat not socialeconomic issue human rights2 the human rights situation in morocco has improved somewhat in recent years but the record remains poor the 1997 parliamentary elections were 1 africa research

crs4 flawed by attempts of both the government and the political parties to influence the results through votebuying and pressure tactics the opposition which made some of these accusations nonetheless took seats in parliament and power for the first time this change in government has marked progress in the exercise of some essential human rights the us state department considers the ministry of interior responsible for most human rights violations security forces perpetrate serious human rights abuses torturing detainees and ignoring due process abuses are rarely investigated thoroughly amnesty international documents over 50 political prisoners and prisoners of conscience and many disappearances islamists and sahraouis who seek selfdetermination for the western sahara region claimed by morocco are often victims the government questions amnesty internationals numbers and its sources of information on the sahraouis the judiciary is subject to corruption and interior ministry influence and not independent freedoms of speech the press assembly and movement are sometimes limited economy3 the mixed moroccan economy is based on agriculture fishing manufacturing textiles clothing metalworking mining of the worlds largest phosphate reserves tourism and remittances from moroccans working abroad because of the leading role of agriculture which still employs 50 of the people and accounts for up to 20 of the gross domestic product gdp the economy is particularly sensitive to climatic changes in 1996 good year climatically gdp rose 12 in 1997 erratic rains caused 25 drop in agricultural production and an estimated 25 decline in gdp the outlook for 1998 is good morocco faces many challenges it is young country with 38 of the population below age 14 some 46 of the people are illiterate the official unemployment rate is over 16 but it is more than double that among the young the world bank estimates that 40 of the population live below the poverty level the government will be constrained by international monetary fund imf guidelines as it attempts to address these problems since the early 1980s morocco has followed an economic program backed by the imf world bank and paris club of international creditors reforms include restraints on spending tax and banking reforms trade and foreign exchange liberalization privatization and an anticorruption drive the results have been uneven for instance 6year privatization program launched in 1992 targeted 114 businesses for sale but only 52 have been privatized when the government as anticipated attempts to privatize stateowned companies with large royal shareholders it may face one of its greatest challenges the illegal drug trade helps many poor small farmers to survive morocco is major producer of cannabis and exporter of hashish to europe it also is transit point for cocaine shipments from south america to western europe the government has stepped up its war on drugs but enforcement is erratic due to budget constraints and corruption4 3 information mostly derived from the us state department 1997 country report on economic policy and trade practices and cia the world factbook 1997 4 us state department international narcotics control strategy report 1997 continued crs5 foreign affairs moroccos foreign policy generally follows prowestern course although the king is actively involved in arab and african affairs as well western sahara5 the western sahara is moroccos national cause and the one issue on which all moroccans agree since 1976 morocco has claimed the western sahara region to its south that had been spanish colony morocco waged protracted war against the popular front for the liberation of saqiat hamra and rio oro polisario which seeks independence for the region and has physical control of about 80 of the territory with 80000 troops in 1991 the arranged ceasefire and attained the parties agreement to participate in referendum to resolve the dispute in june 1997 the secretarygeneral named former us secretary of state james baker to be his personal envoy to jumpstart the process despite bakers effort enduring disagreements between the parties over voter registration have continued to delay vote it is unlikely that any moroccan government would survive the loss of the sahara or even major compromise on the issue north africa morocco is member of the moribund arab maghreb union with libya tunisia algeria and mauritania and has good relations with all except algeria border disputes the western sahara conflict and spillover effects of the war between algerias military regime and islamist guerrillas impede moroccos relations with algeria algeria backs the polisario which has refugee camps in southwest algeria prime minister youssoufi wants to end the freeze in moroccos dealings with algeria and reopen borders morocco adheres to the sanctions on libya but has good trade ties with it notably large barter agreement which enables morocco to purchase libyan oil arabisraeli affairs king hassan ii is very interested in arabisraeli peace and morocco has been the venue for many arabisraeli meetings some 10 of israels population is of moroccanjewish origin after the 1993 israelipalestinian declaration of principles morocco began to normalize relations with israel starting with trade and tourism in september 1994 the two governments agreed to open diplomatic liaison offices the king said that full diplomatic relations would come only with comprehensive peace the first middle eastnorth africa economic summit to forge an economic base for regional peace was held in casablanca in october 1994 however the king increasingly has become frustrated with the peace process stalemate and developments in jerusalem he chairs the organization of the islamic conference jerusalem committee and has criticized israels construction in jerusalem accusing it of trying to change the city at the expense of other religions6 the kings adviser andre azoulay disclosed that the king had decided to keep his distance from the israeli government pending progress in the peace process7 4 continued shipments to the united states

relations with europe are important to rabat in 1995 morocco signed new association agreement with the european union eu eu countries are moroccos major trading partners accounting for 70 of its trade moroccos closest european connections are with france and spain france is moroccos largest investor and trading partner and over 700000 moroccans live in france france formally supports the mission in the western sahara but is viewed by morocco and the polisario as favoring moroccos claims spain appears to be more neutral regarding the outcome of referendum sometimes relations between madrid and rabat are disturbed by moroccos campaign for sovereignty over two spanish enclaves in morocco ceuta and melilla other difficulties in bilateral relations between morocco and european governments derive from drug smuggling illegal immigration and moroccos attempts to restrict fishing in its territorial waters multilateral morocco has participated in international military efforts to address crises it was the first arab state to condemn iraqs invasion of kuwait in 1990 and sent troops to help defend saudi arabia morocco has supported sanctions against iraq but provided humanitarian

political parties the united states officially supports the approach to resolve the western sahara issue and the exercise of the right of selfdetermination through referendum but is perceived to favor
