barely rose in the second quarter of 2007 and many analysts expect price declines in many markets in the near future there have already been large drops in house sales and residential investment house building given the central role that the housing boom has played in the current economic expansion many observers fear that crash in the housing market will lead to an economywide recession they are concerned that fall in house prices could spill over into decline in aggregate spending through four channels first builders could respond to lower prices by reducing residential investment an important component of gross domestic product gdp second since mortgages are backed by the value of the underlying house fall in prices could feed through to financial instability both of these effects have already been felt with the rate of residential investment falling by double digits since mid2006 and the entire financial sector undergoing liquidity crunch triggered by problems with subprime mortgagebacked securities in august 2007 third fall in housing prices could lead to decline in consumer spending through negative wealth effect some economists have argued that when house prices were rising households responded to their greater housing wealth by increasing their consumption spending were prices to fall presumably the effect would be reversed this effect is difficult to measure and faces some theoretical objections for example every housing transaction is composed of buyer and seller when house prices fall sellers are made poorer but buyers are made wealthier in the sense that they can now devote less of their income to mortgage payments and more to other consumption fourth the impending reset of mortgages to higher payments for many recent buyers could lead to significant increase in the share of househo lds suffering from financial distress for some homeowners fall in prices would eliminate the option to refinance to avoid the distress these homeowners may then be forced to reduce consumption spending in response economic growth could decline in response to falling house prices through any of these four channels if all else remained equal but it is possible that spending in other parts of the economy could rise and pick up the slack and the government is not neutral bystander when it comes to the path of aggregate spending it can use expansionary fiscal or monetary policy to offset decreases to aggregate spending the federal reserve has already responded to the housing and financial downturn by reducing shortterm interest rates most economic models suggest that fall in prices in the range that has been predicted would not be enough to singlehandedly cause recession but some observers think it may be enough to tip an already tepid economy into recession httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34244g25g152g158g149g141g561g138 g561g10g152g158g156g146g151g144

shows while appreciation rates have fallen significantly since 2005 house prices are not yet falling by this measure price appreciation ground to halt in the second quarter of 2007 however and other data sources show small decreases in house prices over the past year although one quarter of zero price appreciation does not make for trend many analysts believe that house prices will fall significantly in the next few years most parts of the country have seen the same pattern of boom and bust although the timing has differed rapid appreciation rates began in california and the northeast between 2000 and 2002 moved to the midatlantic hawaii florida and nevada by 2004 and the southwest mountain region and pacific northwest by 2005 the only regions of the country that did not experience an extraordinary housing boom in this decade were the midwest and south prices increased more than 90 in five years in florida california arizona nevada rhode island maryland hawaii and the

inflation the proximate reason that rapid price appreciation abruptly came to an endand why analysts believe prices will continue to deterioratewas sharp fall in housing sales during the boom sales rose to very high levels existing home sales fell by 8 in 2006 and 13 in the 12 months ending in august 2007 new home sales fell by 18 in 2006 and 21 in the 12 months ending in august 2007 one reason that some analysts argue house prices will continue to fall is because the number of unsold houses on the market has risen sharply for example it is estimated that there was 10 months supply of existing houses on the market in august 2007 up from 4 months supply in 2004 lower appreciation rates have already had profound effect on residential investment house building housing starts fell by 13 in 2006 and 25 in the 12 months ending in august 2007 residential investment has fallen by 16 in the last four quarters residential investment is component of gross domestic product gdpif it falls

prices might fall in the future if at all key question to answer is to what extent the boom was caused by an asset bubble an asset bubble refers to rise in price that is due to irrational exuberance rather than changes in economic fundamentals 1 unfortunately it is difficult to identify bubbles until after the fact since 1 see crs report rl33666 asset bubbles economic effects and policy options for the federal reserve by marc labonte httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34244g25g152g158g149g141g561g138 g561g10g152g158g156g146g151g144

rationally if individuals always acted rationally bubble by definition could not exist since individuals would anticipate future price declines and reduce their demand for housing thereby preventing bubble from forming before it had started rapidly rising prices do not by themselves prove that there is bubble in fact there were many changes in economic fundamentals that by making housing more affordable increased the demand for housing over this period average aftertax income was rising and most importantly mortgage rates fell from 8 in 2000 to less than 6 in 2003 lower mortgage rates significantly reduce the cost of financing home purchase and would thereby increase the demand for housing with housing supply unable to adjust immediately increased demand would lead to some rise in real prices beyond general price inflation yet mortgage rates did not fall any further after 2003 and the boom nevertheless continued in some parts of the country until 2006 clearly some other factor must be responsible for the later years of the boom to make mortgages more affordable more borrowers took out adjustable rate mortgages arms which allowed them to reduce their initial mortgage rates below the fixed rate by taking on interest rate risk 2 affordability also improved at least temporarily thanks to the rise in alternative mortgages in the current boom and this increased demand broadly defined alternative mortgages are those that do not follow the traditional fixed payment structure alternative mortgages and smaller down payments expanded credit to buyers who could not previously borrow and temporarily lowered borrowing costs 3 borrowing costs were lowered through mortgage products such as interest only loans that allowed borrowers to make payment on the mortgage principal for an introductory period the rise in alternative mortgages could be seen as change in economic fundamental s that caused the boom or it could be seen as symptom of the bubble in the latter view buyers took on mortgages that they could not afford or did not understand because they believed that prices would continue to rise although the boom may have been initially driven by greater affordability as result of rising incomes and lower borrowing costs unsurprisingly rising prices led to rapid deterioration in affordability from 2003 on until ultimately the boom ended in 2006 housing was less affordable than at any point in the previous 20 years acco rding to the housing affordability index shown in figure 2 unlike the deterioration in affordability during the 1970s and 1980s which was driven primarily by higher mortgage rates the recent terioration was driven primarily by higher house prices 2 this strategy may have been myopic since an arm improves affordability only until interest rates rise and short term interest rates were unusually low until 2004 if the decision was driven by myopia it could be taken as more evidence of bubble 3 see crs report rl33775

higher values as more affordab in most markets an increase in demand would be expected to have little lasting effect on price because producers can increase supply in response to higher demand relatively quickly causing prices to return to their previous level housing markets are different because it takes longer to add to the housing supply and because some areas have land constraints in areas with land constraints rising prices are not necessarily proof that bubble is forming and because of the lag in supply pattern of rising followed by falling house prices as new supply becomes available could be consistent with economic fundamentals and does not constitute conclusive evidence that bubble has occurred whether the boom was bubble is arguably academic at this point since the end of the boom will affect the economy in either case nevertheless it is an important question moving forward because of what it implies for the future if the housing market is currently experiencing bursting bubble then prices may fall farther in the future than if the rise in prices were reflection of economic fundamentals bursting bubble may also magnify the economic effects of housing downturn since it would represen t an independent shock to the economy bubble could deflate slowly via long period of stagnant prices or suddenly it is the latter scenario that threatens macroeconomic stability since the economy has proven resilient to gradual adjustments indeed stagnant housing prices have not derailed the expansion to date

jobs created since 2001 have been in housingrelated sectors such as construction real estate and mortgage brokering 4 beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 residential investment stopped increasing since the second quarter of 2006 it has declined by more than 10 quarter at annualized rates over this period residential investment has reduced gdp growth by an average of 10 percentage points all

this figure measures the drag on gdp due to falling resi dential investment in an accounting sense it does not represent the difference between overall gdp and the counterfactual case where

of mortgage exceeds the value of the home in reality it seems unlikely given that houses are not solely investments to most homeowners and that people wish to maintain good credit history for the value of the mortgage to exceed the value of the house even after prices have fallen the loan would have to have high loantovalue ratio loan made fairly recently and probably to firsttime homeowner it should be noted however that loantovalue ratios have risen significantly in the past few years because homes are being purchased with smaller downpayments and because existing homeowners have borrowed against their equity to date overall default rates have risen but remain low 7 default rates on subprime loans loans made to borrowers with weak credit profiles have risen more rapidly however default rates on all adjustable rate mortgages prime and subprime have risen as well and the problem may worsen in the near future as significant share of existing mortgages are forecast to adjust to higher interest rates to the extent that falling prices lead to rising defaults it seems likely that it will be caused by the combination of falling prices and mortgage payments that borrowers cannot afford either because of adjustable mortgages resetting to higher payments or because borrowers took on mortgages they could not really afford in the first place 8 mortgages that have lost value but are still current are unlikely to threaten banks overall health but could lead the bank to curtail new lending through balance sheet effect when the value of banks assets declines then its capital will also decline if its liabilities remain constant the bank may then wish to replenish its capital by taking on fewer new loans if banks make fewer loans then all bankfinanced projects could decline including business capital investment traditionally bank regulation has been justified on the grounds that if losses on mortgages or other loans became widespread enough the solvency of large segments of the banking sector could be at risk and efficient financial intermediation could break down depository institutions have been required to hold adequate capital adhere to prudent lending standards and so on to avoid this outcome today some mortgages are held by depository institutions and some are securitized and sold on the secondary market as mortgage backed securities mbs one rationale for the development of secondary market was to move nondiversified risk off of bank balance sheets and disperse it throughout financial markets so far the increase in default rates has not resulted in any widespread problems for depository institutions and the intermediation channel has continued to function smoothly there is fe ar however that as the mortgages underlying the mbs default they will be brought back onto the banks balance sheets either through guarantees made to mbs investors or structured investment vehicles sivs 9 6 lower housing sales would require financial institutions to shift some of their activity from mortgage lending to other types of lending or investments while this would not necessa rily affect the overall profitability of the financial sector some institutions might find the shift in lending difficult par ticularly if they are small and heavily reliant on mortgage lending 7 mortgage bankers association delinquencies increase in latest mba delinquency survey press

turmoil in secondary markets the repricing of mbs to reflect the housing downturn has been untidy leading to financial distress for many nonbank mortgage lenders that rely on securitization and for

will become negative durin g housing crash viewing housing as an asset from lifecycle saving perspective an increase in the value of that asset would increase an individuals potential lifetime consumption assuming the asset would be liquidated at some point the lifecycle theory suggests that the individual would wish to spread the consumption derived from the future income from the sale of the asset evenly over his lifetime beginning immediately since the theory predicts that consumption derived from the increased wealth would be spread over lifetime the increase in consumption in an given year would be very small evidence that the effect of change in housing wealth is greater than change in stock market wealth is mixed one study estimated that households increase consumption by 008 for every 1 increase in housing wealth which was about three times larger than the authors estimate of stock market wealth effect 11 another study estimated that households increased consumption by 003009 for every 1 increase in housing wealth compar ed with 0007 increase in consumption for 1 increase in stock market wealth12 still if housing wealth fell sharply even small wealth effects can add up to large effects on the macroeconomy13 while this analysis has much to recommend it there are some offsetting factors that could diminish the importance of wealth effect on the overall economy first the proponents of the wealth effect tend to focus on the gains to the sellers but the housing market is made up of both buyers and sellers when prices increase sellers are wealthier and can increase their lifetime consumption but this is exactly offset by buyers whose nonhousing wealth falls when house prices go up eg they will now have to borrow more to purchase the house and devote more of their income to repaying their mortgage thus change in housing prices causes an income transfer from buyers to sellers which reduces the lifetime consumption of buyers by as much as the lifetime consumption of sellers is raised 14 10 see crs report rl34182 financial crisis the liquid ity crunch of august 2007 by darryl getter et 11 john benjamin peter chinloy and g donald jud real

determined by the ec onomys productive capacity and change in the price of an existing asset does not alter the economys productive capacity thus the wealth effect should be thought of as shortterm factor that affects the business cycle but has lasting effect on longterm growth 14 wealth transfer has net change in consumption if bu yers and sellers have the same marginal propensity to consume

housing wealth influences consumption by reducing disposable or aftertax income most counties or municipalities levy property tax as percentage of the houses value so that payment rises when houses assessed value rises this factor partially offsets any positive wealth effect third the lifecycle model makes several specific assumptions in determining whether or not consumption would be affected the appreciation must be unexpected since an expected appreciation would already have been incorporated into the individuals saving and consumption plans the asset cannot be held until death to finance higher lifetime consumption it must at some point be liquidated which is problematic assumption with owneroccupied housing since the homeowner still needs to live somewhere after the asset is liquidated to increase consumption upon the liquidation of primary residence the owner must move to lower cost region or residence this is not the case for houses that are rented or secondary residences the riskiness surrounding the appreciation would also be an important determinant of how much consumption would increase when housing wealth increased some economists have argued that the wealth effect from housing is greater than the wealth effect from the stock market because gains in housing prices are less likely to be suddenly reversed the current state of housing markets might suggest otherwise in markets that had rapid appreciation home owners may have felt hesitant to spend that wealth because of their uncertainty about whether or not the appreciation represented bubble that would soon burst if prices did subsequently fall but remained above preboom levels this hesitancy may prevent consumption from falling significantly consumption has remained strong to date this is not surprising since the wealth effect would reduce consumption only if house prices fell if prices instead stagnated as they have so far then consumption would not fall since household weal th would remain unchanged cbo estimates that if house prices fell by 10 and consumption fell 2 cents per 1 in lost wealth gdp growth would be reduced by 04 percentage points while wealth effect of 7 cents per 1 would reduce it by 14 percentage points 15 if their assumptions accurately approximate reality the wealth effect on consumption alone would not be enough to push the economy into recession

with unlimited access to credit when homeowners are instead liquidity constrained rise in house prices increases net housing equity and the potential to borrow as access to credit increases the ability to consume more increases so stronger wealth effect would be expected this scenario would be consistent with rational households who wish to smooth lifetime consumption or households that borrow unsustainably of course the number of homeowners who are liquidity constrained is arguably limited given that homeowners tend to have above average credit histories and unsecured debt eg credit cards is prevalent in the us economy continued much older but empirical evidence casts doubt on this prediction since the elderly have higher saving rates and home ownership rates than the young 15

indebtedness rapidly both because households financed bigger home purchases with smaller down payments and because they responded to rising prices by withdrawing equity from their homes through home equity loans second mortgages and refinancing from 2002 to 2006 mortgage debt increased from 64 trillion to 104 trillion and home equity loans more than doubled to 11 trillion16 during the housing boom some analysts argued that mortgage equity withdrawal mew was fueling consumption spending they argued that when many homeowners sold their homes or refinanced their mortgages they were borrowing against some of their built up home equity to finance additional consumption spending17 this scenario can come about through an increase in the houses value in which case it can be seen as manifestation of the wealth effect or decrease in borrowing costs study by alan greenspan and james kennedy estimated that fourfifths of the increase in mortgage debt since 1990 was the result of equity withdrawal 18 if house prices were to fall or mortgage rates were to rise this process could work in reverse as long as households borrowing is sustainable fall in house prices has direct effect on consumption but with higher indebtedness and falling house prices there is the potential for the share of homeowners in distress to rise sharply in the near future compounding this risk is the impending reset of many adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates between now and 2009 if mortgage resets force homeowners to devote larger share of their income to mortgage payments their consumption spending could fall whereas struggling homeowners could withdraw equity to meet mortgage payments when prices were rising quickly this option will longer be available for many homeowners furt hermore lending standards have tightened and nonprime mortgage rates have risen since august 2007 making it less likely that mortgages will reset or be refinanced on favorable terms consumption purchases financed by borrowing could be curtailed as borrowing sources dry up either because homeowners run out of home equity to tap or because default cuts off other sources of credit this problem is likely to turn out to be more serious if the housing boom turns out to have been bubble since it implies that more borrowers have gotten themselves into unsustainable situations how important is this factor quantitatively in the second quarter of 2007 065 of all mortgages entered foreclosure and the overall delinquency rate was 512 even assuming that all of these households reduced their consumpti on spending overall consumption growth would still fall by modest amount while these rates are predicted to rise even at the predicted rates too few households would be affected to have significant impact on overall consumption furthermore the empirical evidence that mortgage equity withdrawal leads to higher consumption is mixed 19 16 federal reserve flow of funds september 2007 table l218 17 mortgage equity withdrawal does not lead to onetoone increase in consumption for example some of the equity withdrawn may be used to pay off other debt and some may finance consumption that would have occurred in any case 18 alan greenspan and james kennedy sources and uses of equity extracted from homes federal reserve finance and economics discussion series

effect on the economy because markets naturally adjust to reallocate resources in the short run decline in economic activity via any of the four channels discussed above could lead to slowdown in aggregate spending but only if other sectors of the economy were unable to pick up the slack envision scenarios where other sectors would pick up the slack for example the current expansion has been characterized by low national saving rate made up for by borrowing from abroad that comes to the united states in the form of trade deficit if falling house prices were to lead to lower consumption and higher saving the effect on overall spending might be offset by smaller trade deficit since foreign borrowing needs would diminish expansionary monetary or fiscal policy could also be used to offset any decline in spending as will be discussed in later section the strength of housing crashs effect on the economy depends on the magnitude of the crash while economic models predict that fall in prices in the range that has been predicted would not singlehandedly derail the economic expansion see below for an example some observers think it may be enough to tip an already tepid economy into recession it could also make the expansion less capable of withstanding any additional unrelated shocks economic growth was below 3 for four straight quarters beginning in the second quarter of 2006 and although it grew rapidly in second and third quarters of 2007 most forecasters had predicted it would remain tepid through the first half of 2008 even before the financial turmoil began in august 2007 nonetheless none of the 50 private sector forecasters surveyed by blue chip in october 2007 was predicting that the economy would enter recession although they have reduced their growth forecasts since august of course the housing crash could turn out to be more severe than the forecasters are currently predicting in which case their growth projections would be revised downward

only if all else remains equal but the government need not remain idle and allow falling prices to feed through to lower economic growth it can boost aggregate spending in the economy through expansionary fiscal or monetary policy expansionary fiscal policy refers to increases in the budget deficit expansionary monetary policy refers to reductions in shortterm interest rates 20 indeed the fed reduced interest rates by 05 percentage points on september 18 2007 justifying the change on the grounds that without such policy action members saw risk that tightening credit conditions and an intensifying housing correction would lead to significant broader weakness in output and employment21 ideally expansionary policy and natural market adjustment can boost overall spending enough to offset any reduction in spending that resulted from the housing downturn in reality policymaking is hampered by enough lags and uncertainty that at times policy changes cannot prevent recessions

fed governor frederic mishkin recently made the case that the fed could largely offset the negative marcroeconomic effects of housing crash even in what would presumably be the worst case scenario22 the first simulation assumes that house prices fall by 20 over two yearsa much larger decline than has ever occurred in recent decadesand the fed responds to the change in economic conditions in the same way it has in recent history the simulation shows that by gradually reducing shortterm interest rates by nearly 1 percentage point the fed can limit the reduction in gdp to 05 below the baseline at its trough the effect on gdp comes from lower residential investment and consumption lower interest rates keep residential investment from declining significantly despite the fall in house pricesa surprising result given recent experience the fed model also makes conservative assumptions about the relationship between house prices and consumption which as noted above is subject to relatively wide band of uncertainty therefore governor mishkin performs another simulation making alternative assumptions that the response of residential investment and household consumption to house prices is much stronger than assumed in the feds model in this case the 20 decline in prices causes gdp to fall 15 below the baseline at its troughthree times greater than predicted in the standard model but still not enough to cause recession both of these results are based on an assumption that the fed reacts as it has historically when it sees gdp and inflation fall below their baselines but mishkin argues that the fed can further minimize the macroeconomic effect of house price decline by reducing rates before lower house prices have fed through to lower gdp growth in this case gdp declines by only 025 under normal assumptions and 05 assuming house prices have stronger effects compared to the baseline the fed does not have to reduce interest rates further to achieve these results it merely has to reduce them sooner essentially the fed can take advantage of the lag between the decline in house prices and its effect on the economy by putting expansionary policy in place in the meantime in reality economic models cannot perfectly predict reality and decline in house prices could have additional negative ramifications for the economy that the simulation results do not capture for example it could reduce confidence or cause financial disruptions of the kind seen in august 2007 and the fed operating in an environment of uncertainty may not be able to make the optimal policy choices that the simulation assumes nevertheless the basic message that one can take away from these simulations is that with the proper monetary policy response even the effects of much more severe housing crash than experienced to date would not be expected to cause recession empirical evidence suggests that the feds ability to counteract housing downturn may be more limited than it used to be however one new york fed study found that residential investment responds more slowly to change in shortterms interest rates than in the pastit now takes two years for the change in interest rates to have its maximum effect 23 according to fed chairman ben bernanke the fed estimates that residential investments share of the economys response to change in shortterm interest rates has fallen from 25 to 1424

sensitive to monetary policy changes as the traditional banking channel while this evidence may be bad news for the housing sector it does not necessarily imply that monetary policy has become less effective overall however as governor mishkin suggested the sooner the fed acts to offset housing crash the more limited the crashs effect on the economy would be this has led some critics to argue that the fed should go even further and raise interest rates to try and deflate housing bubble while it is forming according to this logic if bubble is never allowed to form then it cannot cause economic damage by bursting chairman bernanke has pointed out two main drawbacks to this proposal if we could accurately and painlessly rid asse t markets of bubbles of course we would want to do so but as practical matter this is easier said than done particularly if we intend to use monetary policy as the instrument for two main reasons first the fed cannot reliably identify bubbles in asset prices second even if it could identify bubbles monetary policy is far too blunt tool for effective use against them 25 in other words aggressively raising interest rates to counteract bubble risks instigating the very recession that critics presumably wish to avoid26 another critique of the feds current response to bubbles would be that although eliminating bubbles should not be policy goal in and of itself the fed should have recognized that the housing bubblelike the stock market bubble before itwas symptom of an overheating economy by keeping interest rates too low critics argue the fed caused the economy to overheat and inflation to rise as result the fed has made recession less avoidable and limited its room to maneuver to prevent it because there is now the risk that rate cuts would increase inflation even further g18g155g142g159g146g152g158g156g561g10g152g158g156g146g151g144g561g5g155g138g156g145g142g156g561 in determining the likelihood of future house price declines it useful to look at past declines since the house price index was first recorded in the 1970s housing prices have never fallen in nominal terms on national basis for more than one quarter and when they fell the decrease was more than reversed in the next quarter however house prices did fall in real inflationadjusted terms nationwide in the early 1980s from the second quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1983 house prices rose 156 whereas overall inflation as measured by the gdp deflator rose by 266 this trend seems easily explained by the change in economic fundamentals during that period the economy in 19801982 featured historically high real interest rates and the worst economic recession in the postwar period during this period nominal mortgage rates peaked above 18 and the unemployment rate reached doubl digits although there have not been large nominal declines in housing prices historically the housing market has been highly cyclical with little appreciation in the early 1980s and early 1990s and significant appreciation in the late 1980s and 1990s 25 ben bernanke asset price bubbles and monetary policy speech before the national association of business

housing markets however recent federal reserve study identified 17 states that experienced significant declines in housing prices in the 1980s or 1990s all 17 episodes were linked to four specific economic shocks which would point to some role for fundamentalsthe farm and rust belt decline of the early 1980s the drop in energy prices in the mid1980s which nega tively affected energyproducing states the downturn in new england in the late 1980s to early 1990s and the downturn in california and hawaii in the early 1990s which the author links to the reduction in defense spending and japanese financial crisis interestingly most of the states affected by the first two shocks did not experience preceding housing boom ruling out bubble on balance these examples seem to illustrate that recessions can cause house price declines but do not speak to whether causation can run in the opposite direction further the author identified several other housing booms in the 1980s and early 1990s that never resulted in housing declines underlining the point that not all booms are followed by busts 27 another recent study identified historical housing booms and busts and found that only nine housing booms 17 of the total were followed by busts28 figure 4 figure 5 and figure 6 focus on three cases california texas and new england where sharp prolonged increase in house prices was followed by significant and prolonged nominal decline in house prices in california after rising about 75 in four years nominal prices fell by 133 from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the first quarter of 1995 in texas after rising about 25 in five years with most of the increase in the first two years nominal prices fell by 144 from the first quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1988 in new england after rising about 170 in six years nominal prices fell by 129 from the first quarter of 1990 to the first quarter of 1995 in all three of the cases although the trough of housing prices took several years to be reached most of the decline occurred in relatively short time in texas prices were 128 down from their peak by the fourth quarter of 1987 in new england prices were down 106 by the third quarter of 1991 the pattern was little different in california where most of the decline occurred toward the end of the housing bust rather than the beginning prices fell 123 from the second quarter of 1992 to the first quarter of 1995 all three areas took several years after the bust had ended to reach their previous peak as seen in the figures hopeful sign for today is that in each case the crash did not reverse much of the prior appreciation it would be difficult to explain these price increases and subsequent declineswhich are quite large in real termsby macroeconomic factors alone in each of these cases while there were periods of rising and falling interest rates within each downswing the episode as whole could not be characterized as period of rising interest rates however in each case the local economy was experiencing recession although in each case the housing bust exceeded the length of the recession in texas the state economy shrank 05 in 1987 in california the economy shrank 19 from 1992 to 1993 and in new england the economy shrank 46 from 1990 to 1991 in california and new england simple comparison of house prices and per capita disposable income suggests the pattern of house prices in the 1980s fits bubble during the boom house price increases exceeded income gains when house prices crashed they were brought back into line with nominal income which helps explain why house prices did not decline as much as they had previously risen the texas experience looks least like classic bubble there the pattern is 27 david wheelcock what happens to banks

was considerably smaller than the california and new england booms and never caught up to income gains after the housing crash parallels between past housing crashes and the current episodes are limited by changes to the housing market these differences include the growing importance of mortgage securtiziation the growth in subprime lending the increase in the homeownership rate and easier

defined as significant decline in house prices then the united states has not yet experienced crash although it cannot be ruled out in the future given the continuing fall in housing sales were house prices to fall gradually or stagnate the economy is likely to be able to adjust without significant disruption were prices to drop sharply the risk to the economy is much greater if the boom was caused by bubble it implies that the housing downturn will probably get worse and sharp drop in prices is much more likely although changes in economic fundamentals particularly lower mortgage rates played an important role in the early years of the housing boom it is difficult to identify nonbubble explanations for their unprecedented rise in the latter years if housing crash is defined as sharp decline in residential investment then crash has already occurred over the past five quarters the rate of residential investment has declined by double digits and reduced overall gdp growth by an av erage of 10 percentage points all else equal while this drag on growth may persist in coming quarters it is unlikely to get much larger this suggests that the drag from the slowdown in house building could not cause recession by itself many economists have also predicted that fall in prices would have negative wealth effect on consumption if so and some doubts have been cast on this theory the effect has not been strong enough to perceptibly reduce consumption yet this is not surprising since the wealth effect predicts that stagnating as opposed to falling house prices as seen so far would not reduce consumption another channel through which falling prices co mbined with mortgage resets could affect consumption would be if it led to spike in mortgage default rates while subprime default rates have risen sharply the number of homeowners involved is too small to have much of macro effect but since the number of resets has not yet peaked and lending standards are tightening the default rate could get worse thus far more serious effect of the housing downturn has been the spillover of turmoil in financial markets culminating in the august liquidity crunch widespread liquidity problems have the potential to interfere with the smooth functioning of financial intermediation that is necessary for robust economic growth at this point it is too soon to say whether the liquidity crunch has fed through to lower economic growth banks could also respond to falling house prices by curbing new lending since falling prices reduces the value of their assets to date the sharp decline in residential investment has not disrupted the economic expansion but since national prices have not yet fallen it may be that the full effects of the downturn are yet to come while it appears that housing crash could not singlehandedly derail the expansion it is possible that it could tip an already tepid economy into recession economic growth was below 3 for four straight quarters beginning in 2006 and although it grew rapidly in the second and third quarters of 2007 most forecasters had predicted it would be modest through the first half of 2008 even before the financial turmoil began in august 2007 nonetheless none of the 50 private sector forecasters surveyed by blue chip in october 2007 was predicting that the economy would enter recession were the housing market to crash policymakers need not stand by and allow it to act as drag on the overall economy indeed the federal reserve has already reacted to the liquidity crunch by

frederic mishkin suggest that the economic fallout from even severe drop in housing prices could be modest if the fed responds optimally on the other hand some economists would argue that the fed has already committed policy error by not preventing what they characterize as housing bubble from forming in the first place while using monetary policy to target asset prices is likely to be problematic given the difficulty of identifying bubbles one could argue that the current housing cycle of boom and bust has led to less stable economy if housing crash were to lead to recession it would strengthen the argument that the fed should take less passive approach to asset bubbles in order to fulfill its mandate to maintain economic stability
