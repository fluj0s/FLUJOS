raja rogers meeting notes march 20 2007 raja rogers summary of points regarding vaidya appts person fills out form asking if they have any phys ical concerns give paper to vaidya so he know s their situation so he doesnt diagnos they are coming for traditional ayurvedic health evaluation and will go over diet lifestyle which will be appropriate to their particular doshas being in balance or imbalanced its just lifestyle and diet recommendation we dont prescribe we should have mapi catalog there if they have not such good sleep habits then they can have blissful rest if the vaidya feels that they need stronge r version of blissful rest then they have choice these are the things that are indicated to this particular dosha imbalance according to traditional ayurvedic knowledge we always say they have choice you could say you could start out with blissful rest which is less expensive if the person is in final stage of disease we tell them we are giving health coaching according to traditional ayurvedic know ledge not saying we are going to cure some disease because ayurveda does not really address the disease it addresses the doshas and the entire physiology brings the physiology back into balance of course there is limit to what we can do with diet lifestyle and few of the mapi herbal formulas vaidya should never say hes going to cure this or that and we should never say that because thats making promise we dont want to be taken in the wrong way that this is the miracle cure we can say that generally speaking when the body is in more balanced state then its in more happy state if we stay up many hours without sleep then we dont feel happy or use similar analogy elaine we have form from mapi that asks for the persons health concerns and info about their eating habits etc raja rogers good use that form elaine on ama pachana to purify ama handout it tells people to take 6 tables of v2206 and 4 tablets of mapi herb then it gives details about what to eat for 7 days etc okay to use concern that it may be seen as prescribing raja rogers okay to use that handout they have choice to either take it or not take it not everyone will receive this form jane do i tell the lifestyle recommendations or does the vaidya raja rogers you are repeating what vaidya tells you jeff murphy mohan doss arrived tonight 17 appts in lexington so far raja rogers good work jeff murphy if the person coming is strong gov is it possible to be more specific in his recommendations raja rogers he will do what he is comfortable with we always err in the direction of safety tell vaidya that these are long time govs or these are new meditators hes very sensitive to all this we dont diagnos or prescribe one thing we have learned at the raj tell people to prioritize some people come back in 6 mos and say i couldnt do everything so i didnt do it at all if they strain they are more likely to drop everything tell them to just do what you can the top 23 things you can work in after week if you can work in 23 more things then do that do everything comfortably the old principle of the comfortable ride use the term health coach not patient educator maharishi wants to build some wonde rful new spa buildings here in lancaster were changing vaidyas here alicne there is section on back of new mapi catalog that gives details about what mav does do we give the health forms back to the person after heshe sees the vaidya raja rogers yes jeff you should let vaidya mohandas that we just want to call people health coach rather than patient educator send him my best regards jane im uncomfortable with coach how about educators mary the word coach is very popul ar these days raja rogers coach means lot less than educator mary its safer raja rogers the main thing is that we dont use the word patient alcine we dont discuss anything to anyone else about patient elaine does hipaa apply to people other than mds raja rogers bottom line is that we shouldnt be talking to anyone about patient jane could use vaidya assistant what do we call the person seeing the vaidya steve client elaine this is used in psychological practices too alcine hipaa states that you shouldnt talk to anyone not even family about patient steve unless patient has it in writing jane what books on hand nancy lonsdorfs raja rogers you mean to sell yes thats okay anyone have herbs jeff murphy yes raja rogers anyone have catalogue should have one on hand call mapi tomorrow to see if they will send you catalog jeff murphy we have been thinking we would like to host domainwide wpa and rc over memorial day can we do this with inv america going on raja rogers yes as long as we are not in competition with dr rothenberg or anyone else having it on the same date call him and check dori
