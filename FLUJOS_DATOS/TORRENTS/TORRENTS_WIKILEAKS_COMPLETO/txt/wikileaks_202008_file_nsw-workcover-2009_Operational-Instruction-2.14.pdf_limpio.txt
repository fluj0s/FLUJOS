following principles scheme agent must charge late payment fee to an employer if wage audit and the application of the calculation methodology outlined in this instruct ion indicates that there is net late payment fee owing to the scheme b the amount of premium due on which the late payment fee is chargeable must be offset by any premium refunds due to the employer interest payable to the employer on overpaid premium identified after wage audit the legislation makes provision for interest to be paid for policy periods for which the employer is entitled to refund of premium it is the res

d05056604 calculation of late payment fees which can be recovered by the scheme agent section 174 provides for audits to be conducted for period of up to seven years after the performance of the work to which the audits re late agents should note that audits are now only conducted for the three most recent policy per iods unless serious noncompliance issues have been identified in which case the audit can be extended experience indicates that large proportion of audits reveal mixture of demands for additional premium and premium refunds from one policy period to another amounts of additional premiums payable that have been identified by wage audits are offset by any amounts of premiums refundable that have also been identified through the same wage audits therefore in ca lculating late payment fee payable by the employer the employer is effectively only char ged for the net revenue which has been lost by the scheme in the following examples the date on which premium would have been payable allows for the statutory twomonth period that the employer has to lodge their wage declarations plus another month in which to pay the premium demand issued by the scheme agent at the end of this period where scheme agent can readily identify the exact date when premium would have been payable for previous policy periods then that date mu st be used to calculate the late payment fee examples the following examples do not apply to calculat ions made under section 1754 section 1754 applies if the employer has provided false or misleading information and in this case an amount equal to the premium may be recovered in addition to the late payment fee for illustration purpose only the examples show the audit results over fiveyear period however audits are currently only to be conducted for threeyear period and can onl be extended with the approval of workcover example 1 the policy period is from 30 june to 30 june lat payment fee charges commence at the end of the third month of the new policy period t he premium would have been payable on 30 september for each period the cumulative balance for each period is calc ulated by adding the total outstanding from the previous period and the amount outstanding for the current period then applying the late payment fee 199900 200001 200102 200203 200304 additional premium owing 500 500 500 500 500 cumulative balance

two policy years audited and owes additional premium for the remaining three periods premiums outstanding for the 200102 and 200203 policy periods are offset against the amount owed to the employer for the two earlier periods consequently the employer has additional premium owing until the fi nal policy period only at this time does the additional premium begin to attract late payment fees
