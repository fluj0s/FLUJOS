6306c11 shspec272 engram chain running i finally found out why you cant run engrams i found out youve been trying to run engrams and you never run engrams you run chains of engrams this is the way i ran engrams in 1949 this got crossed up with repetitive processing flatten the process became flatten the engram when it should have been flatten the chain you flatten the chain by getting the basic engrams never exist all by themselves there is always chain an engram is only part of chain of similar incidents which in turn is part of time track you are essentially running time track you never handle an engram all by itself because it is too closely related to the rest of the track to be treated that way if you are skilled auditor you can quickly pick up bpc when the pc arc breaks indicate it and have the arc break disappear until you can do this you will have rough sessions in engram running the bpc is always the earlier incident on the engram chain charge is able to make the pc feel worse or better depending on whether it gets restimulated and encysted or blows you can let the pc learn more by entering lot of engrams and not finding basic the result is that the pc knows more but feels worse because you havent erased basic on the chain running chain of engrams is not the same as finding out about lot of incidents every time you run an engram you open up valve into the next earlier engram letting its charge get restimulated and partially leak into the one you are running if you continue to run the later engram it gets sticky ta ceases and it gets solid and will eventually collapse on the pc the bpc from the earlier engram causes the pc to arc break moving back to the earlier one blows some of the charge charge always flows later from its source not earlier we can only find the earlier engram because the later one was run as we go back on the chain each incident seems to be the earliest incident when it is actually just the earliest available incident if two engrams or any two pictures collapse the cause is bpc and the pc will very shortly arc break the converse is also true if the pc has bpc and is arc breaky you have two pictures collapsed outofvalenceness thats over there is also problem of bpc if an earlier engram is tapped it will bleed charge into the one you are running the somatic will strengthen but this phenomenon wont cause outofvalenceness an outofvalenceness is caused by an earlier portion of the same engram that you are working on that hasnt been seen it is assisted by charge bleeding from an earlier incident you could even run dubin case and get him earlier than the dubin however it is safer to use straightwire or mest processes suppose you are running an engram where the pc hit his head and when the pc goes through the incident the part where he actually hits his head gets skipped this indicates that the engram is part of chain of hit head so we work our way back through earlier incidents as he gets back to basic he gets full perceptics when we get to basic we run it over and over and his somatic blows if we came back up through the chain you could send the pc through each engram on the chain and now he would get the somatic each time the only way to flatten an engram is to flatten chain of engrams chains of overts follow the same principle as was done in sec checking this involved the withhold system used in prepchecking old style see hcob 1mar62 prepchecking class ii skill and pp 208209 above these also go much earlier than this life chains of overts include overt engrams it doesnt matter which you run because the overtmotivator sequence is an installed mechanism it is very old it is not as deeply laid in as obsessive create but it is equally implanted and engramic either overt chains or motivator chains can be run they rarely entwine sometimes the pc will jump chains from motivator to overt when that happens you should follow it down to the basic overt but you should then also pick up and complete the motivator chain running engrams is very simple here is how lrh would do it get crude date eg 89 trillion years ago get the pc to return to this incident ask him what he is looking at ask how long is this incident get the duration by meter get the pc to move on through the incident to the end there will be long pause the pc says i did ask him what it is all about the pc tells you ask for an earlier beginning get when it was send the pc to the earlier beginning then through the incident the pc goes through the incident and tells you about it pc has somatic lrh dates with the meter an earlier incident with the same somatic he sends the pc through that incident you go earlier date it etc if you dont complete the chain in one session and the pc doesnt get the picture run few commands of since the last time i audited you is there anything you were unwilling to duplicate run this to clean needle the picture will now be on dont harass the pc to find all the unknowns in the incident it is not necessary to do this when you have had rough session try since the day before that session occurred what have you been unwillingwilling to duplicate alternate these commands if the pc cant run engrams it is because he is at the wrong place on the scale of case levels to be able to confront it even dubin case can run earlier than the dubin but it is dangerous engram running is important because you wont make ots without it all the fancy stuff was developed to handle cases that were too heavily charged to run real track the least common denominator of the case scale is noduplicate which is right in the middle of the communication formula the swan song of this universe is that that which you are unwilling to duplicate tends to go on automatic an arc break is an unwillingness to duplicate if you show students bad tvd they will flub the first five minutes of their next session because they were unwilling to duplicate the bad tvd and therefore it went on automatic in their next session this is what happens when you show bad example you could clean up earlier bad auditing by running since few days before the bad auditing what have you been unwillingwilling to duplicate it will clean up resistance to duplication can be caved in one can become what one resists or the effect of what one resists persons ability to duplicate is what determines his ability to run engrams because the engram itself is duplication of the actual event the pc duplicates the event but if the picture he is running is an altered copy of the original it is dubin all engrams have some dubin in them and develop new material you can get some surprising changes one is particularly unwilling to duplicate dangerous things so one then gets lots of them the person who is totally unaware has tried to whip the mechanism of obsessively duplicating everything the trouble with this strategy is that his duplication goes on total automatic some people have very heavy engrams indeed over which they have control these engrams are very inaccurate they stub their toe and have picture of being run over by truck that is all they run if anything since there are very incredible things on the track anyway such as the helatrobus implants it would be very inaccurate and dangerous to determine whether or not pc can run engrams by looking for factualness for instance basic on prenatals is an incident from the helatrobus implant in which the thetan on pole is tumbled through series of tubes all curled up one way to see if guy can run engrams is to try him out if it is go you can get out the arc triangle in hurry better test is simple duplication for instance you can call off series of numbers 3 6 2 9 7 to person and ask him what you said if the pc didnt duplicate you you can forget about running engrams or you can go by the chart of attitudes or any test of duplication but you shouldnt go by the material he runs you can use an arc process to improve someones reality all sorts of other processes will also do this the duplication process see p 414 below also works well cchs are effective when rightly used to show the pc that it is safe to duplicate if the case cannot run engrams and if you are running them correctly engram running is probably too steep gradient for the pc the reason these data on engrams is important is that the helatrobus implants are long chain of engrams each one with basic and they tend to bunch the whole track on some cases you can only run six gpms before the rocket read shuts off and at this point you have to start running engrams when do you go earlier whenever the pc recognizes that there is something earlier however he states it he may say so directly or he may say something that shows that he is looking for something earlier if the pc sees something earlier you go earlier never ignore this if you ignore the indication that an earlier incident is available the one you are running will get harder to run besides you risk an arc break charge is registered on the emeter by needle and ta motion you must get ta action or you are just restimulating the case without blowing anything there is absolute basic on engram chains when you get to basic on chain there may be portions of it that themselves have earlier basics go ahead and run those out too there is only one basic basic it contains those impulses which eventually became aberration there are two things you can do with dating 1 relieve charge 2 identify something if you do total dating it goes down to the second you get the exact number of years plus days minutes seconds ago get the date accurately and the incident gets placed right where it should be on the track thus relieving charge dating also contains identification you can use rough dates for this purpose eg 89 billion or 450 million as long as you dont have bunch of incidents close together in row blocking out an incident has these steps 1 get an approximate date 2 move the time track to that date 3 ask the pc what is there accept whatever he gives you in every case 4 find its duration fairly accurately if it is days get the number 5 move the pc through it not to the end 6 then establish what was there 7 move the pc to the beginning and send him through again dont vary the routine and dont q and with the pcs unknownness if the pc keeps saying im stuck forget about holders and denyers he has just gotten in over his head bail him out and revert to lighter processes always suspect that there is something bit earlier ask for it blocking it out is done by going through it once after that the pc may be expected to tell you if there is something earlier generally run the pc through the incident twice once through is plenty if it is gummy having to go through an incident more than twice is suspect dont try to keep getting more out of it it is ok to keep running an incident as long as we are getting motion on the meter but dont strain to get more perceptics out of the incident more will turn up as you go earlier you can keep running an engram as long as the pc is interested in it and finding out more but the instant he says there may be something earlier go earlier or you will stick him in the later incident if you dont go for earlier incidents you blunt the pcs ability to go earlier and stick him where he is but dont force him earlier if he is starting to bounce up to pt let him and run arc processes basic isnt generally the more powerful incident it is just the first incident it seems so unimportant to the pc yet later incidents built up on it bigger and bigger basic is the shorter lighter incident theoretically you could run back to basicbasic if you found and erased this the pc would then have pictures and track if pc seems to be trying to escape running engrams by going earlier he is over his head and needs more preparation if you get the pc fully interiorized into the engram say by putting his attention on large object in the incident he will get it all fully charged up in 3d this is not what you want you will never get him out of the universe that you are packing around him
