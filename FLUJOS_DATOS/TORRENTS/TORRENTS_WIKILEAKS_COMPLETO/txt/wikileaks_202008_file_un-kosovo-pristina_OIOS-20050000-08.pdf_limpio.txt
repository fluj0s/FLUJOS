background information 4 pristina international airport constitutes sta owned enterprise under yugoslavian law the assets of the airport include the runways terminal buildings hanger fuel storage facilities and equi pment during the period covered by this investigation from 2001 until 2003 they were maintained by the public enterprise airport pristina peap in coope ration with military units of the kosovo force kfor pursuant to united nations sec urity council resolution 1244 dated 10 june 1999 and unmik regulation 1 1999 dated 25 july 1999 unmik is mandated to administer the territory of ko sovo including state owned and publicly owned assets this includes pristina i nternational airport 5 until the end of june 2002 responsibility for t he administration of the pristina airport was entrusted to the civil administration p illar pillar ii of unmik including official 1 and official 2 pillar ii supe rvised doti official 1 department of transport and infrastructure the doti was late r known as the transport sector of the unmik directorate of infrastructure ffairs doti official 1 left unmik at the end of june 2002 doti official 2 was recruited by the doti as an international staff member on 31 july 2000 in charg of airport operations 3 reporting to doti official 1 and continued in this role until 30 september 2001 engineering expertise was provided by series of ngineers seconded from the armed forces of united nations member state spec ifically airport engineer 1 airport engineer 2 and airport engineer 3 and lat er by consultant from the consulting company 6 on 1 july 2002 the responsibility for the admin istration of the airport passed from pillar ii to the kosovo trust agency kta and pillar iv the divisional manager was appointed under him were the peap offi cial and atcs official air traffic control services 7 on 1 april 2004 pristina international airport which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of kfor was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction under icao regulations 8 it is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined v investigation details 9 this part of the investigation relates to tend er for contract for the extension of the cargo terminal apron at pristina airport the v alue of the contract was 77431863 allegation 1 specifically the tender documents for the cargo pron did not comply with the requirements of article 234 of the unmik finance dministrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using kosovo consolidated bud get funds as they were based on summary documents and did not include clea r instructions on drawings and plans 10 note from the project engineer at the evaluat ion company to the peap official dated 31 january 2001 indicates that the evaluation company was commissioned to produce preliminary design for th cargo terminal at pristina airport the design also provided for the construct ion of the cargo apron extension 11 prequalification evaluation was held 5 april 2001 as result of which five companies were prequalified to submit bids for the cargo apron extension four companies submitted bids and following an evaluati on the contract was awarded to the vendor contract was signed for th cargo apron extension on 11 september 2001 12 letter from the vendor to unmik and peap date d 9 may 2001 indicates that it submitted bid for the cargo apron extension the tender documents include what appears to be section from the preliminary d esign documents produced by the evaluation company specifically it includes section entitled bills of quantities from pages 17 and 18 of the evaluation company preliminary design documents 4 13 an interoffice memorandum providing an outstan ding issues update to official 2 from doti official 3 to staff member 1 at the ffice of official 2 dated 18 may 2001 could give rise to the suggestion that offers were provided by companies on 28 may 2001 and the vendor had been chosen for the works in advance however more likely explanation is the date of t he interoffice memorandum has been incorrectly dated since the document cont ains reference dates relating to project events which post date 18 may 2001 at paragraph 2b the interoffice memorandum states that the cargo apron invitation t tender was based on summary documents 14 at paragraph 4 of the cargo apron extension eva luation report dated 2 august 2001 the committee notes that the bidding document s did not include clear instructions on drawing and plans it therefore was recommended that negotiations be held with the lowest bidder the ve ndor on further details of the scope of works 15 in combination the two documents suggest that the tender documents did not comply with article 233 of the unmik finance admin istrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using kosovo consolidated bud get funds 16 when asked whether heshe was of the view that the tender documents complied with the provisions of article 233 of the unmik fi nance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using koso vo consolidated budget funds doti official 2 conceded that if an engineer was asked this question heshe would indicate that the tender specification s were technically deficient and did not comply with article 233 17 doti official 2 explained that the technical tails of the cargo apron extension project were taken from the cargo terminal study pr oduced by the evaluation company and pasted into the tender document specifi cations thereafter it was up to the company winning the tender to demonstrate that they could fulfil the specification 18 according to doti official 2 airport engineer 1 who arrived shortly after the tender had been launched had been angry with the valuation company for allowing doti official 2 to send out excerpts of th eir study as the tender specifications airport engineer 1 had also express ed concern at the method used for preparing the tender documents as from an engineering point of view the tenders did not contain sufficient detail howe ver doti official 2 stated that if the evaluation company had been asked to prepare th tender documents it would have cost more money heshe had therefore pr epared the tender documents himselfherself and sent them to procur ement official at the cpe to review and help him with the procurement exercise 19 assistance from the cpe was provided primarily by cpe procurement officer and to lesser extent by the procurement official as to the procurement documents and rules however doti official 2 expre ssed the view that neither the procurement official nor the cpe procurement of ficer would have had the technical expertise or time to review the technical specifications 5 20 doti official 2 emphasised that there was gineering expert to support hisher work at the time the tender was launched fact that made hisher work very difficult allegations 2 3 specifically three of the persons on the bid open ing committee and evaluation committees were the same parties who should not hav carried out both tasks and the contract for the cargo apron extension was not channelled through the office of the legal adviser 21 the evaluation report dated 2 august 2001 is si gned by three parties who are also listed as having attended the bid opening sess ion this indicates that the composition of the bid opening committee and the ev aluation committee overlapped 22 when asked about this issue in interview doti fficial 2 confirmed that heshe was both on the bid opening committee and was mem ber of the evaluation committee heshe added that the people who evaluat ed the offers signed the evaluation report this is in conflict with regu lations which segregate the two roles an interoffice memorandum dated 24 september 2001 indicates that the contract for the cargo apron extension had not been channelled through the office of the legal adviser allegation 4 specifically that the vendor produced its own tes t results to confirm the quality of its own work on the cargo apron resulting in conflic t of interest 23 an interoffice memorandum from staff member 2 t the procurement official signed by doti official 1 dated 18 october 2001 in dicates that doti official 1 authorised the soil stabilisation work the memoran dum also adds that the work was inadvertently not included in the original cont ract 24 doti official 2 told the itf that in order to p rogress the cargo apron tender heshe had to organise geographical survey hesh added that only after the tests were done could the tender go ahead however the evaluation report at paragraph 4 suggests that information on the nature of the ground does not appear to have been included in the tender document s in addition letter from the vendor to unmik and peap dated 27 june 2001 bu t apparently not received at unmik and peap until 17 october 2001 ccording to manuscript note signed by airport engineer 1 at the bottom of the letter suggests that it carried out its own soil tests 25 letter from the vendor to peap dated 18 septe mber 2003 suggests that the vendor also produced its own bearing capacity repor t for the cargo apron thereby self certifying its own work whilst the tender documents at page 5 6 reference 114 provide for the contractor to pay l iquidated damages in the event that the loadbearing capacity of the apron is l ess than foreseen in the contract upon completion of the work the contract is silent as to whom should carry out the tests however it is questionable as to whethe r the vendor should have carried it out since it presents conflict of int erest 26 when asked about this in interview the divisi onal manager stated without seeing any other documents on the face of it it does appear that there could be conflict of interest here but the repor t was produced by professional pavement engineer at laboratory therefore one can assume certain degree of integrity 27 the itf notes that the peap official indicated that heshe was unhappy about the vendor selfcertifying its work and heshe comm ented that the airport engineer should have questioned it 28 the itf does not have sufficient technical know ledge to assess the adequacy of the vendors work however letter from the divis ional manager to staff member 3 dated 25 august 2002 gives rise to the pos sibility that it was not up to specification in certain areas vi conclusions 29 evidence indicates that the tender documents fo r the cargo apron did not comply with the requirements of article 234 of the unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using koso vo consolidated budget funds as they were based on summary documents and did not include clear instructions on drawings and plans this appears to have been due to an attempt to cut costs in preparing the tender documents as well as lack of appropriately qualified staff 30 in mitigation the inadequacy of the tender doc uments also appears to have been due to ignorance as to the appropriate quantity of detail to be included in the tender documents rather than deliberate act calcu lated to manipulate the tender process 31 doti official 2 is primarily responsible for th shortcomings in the tender documents although doti official 1 and the cpe mus t also bear certain amount of responsibility 32 the shortcomings in the tender documents are li kely to have prejudiced some companies in their decision as to submitting bids f or the tenders since they may not have been clear as to the detailed requirements of the tender and therefore submitted insufficient detail in their bids as re sult 33 three persons are indicated to have both attend ed the bid opening session as well as been on the tender evaluation committee in conflict with regulations 34 evidence indicates the contract for the cargo pron extension was not channelled through the office of the legal adviser 7 35 evidence indicates that the vendor produced its own bearing capacity report for the cargo apron thereby self certifying its own work and presenting potential conflict of interest vii recommendations 36 it is recommended that unmik ensure that all co ntracts are referred for legal advice before signature in order to reduce potentia l liability issues and avoid recurrence of the problems of this instant case i v0428201 37 it is recommended
