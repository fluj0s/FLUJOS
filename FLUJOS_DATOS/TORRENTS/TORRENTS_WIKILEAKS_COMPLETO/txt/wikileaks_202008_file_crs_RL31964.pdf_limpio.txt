billion is be available to states through titles ivb and ive in order to be eligible to receive these f unds states must comply with numerous federal rules which may limit how the states implement their child welfare programs frequent criticism of federal child welfare policy is its inflexibility regarding the use of funds by states2 in order to provide states with additional flexibility in their use of titles ivb and ive funds the 103rd congress included provision in the social security act amendments of 1994 pl 103432 allowing the secretary of the us department of health and human

safe families act of 1997 pl 105893 number of states have been granted waivers and have used these funds to establish an assortment of waiver projects ranging from managed care programs to substance abuse services for parents this report provides background informa tion on the child welfare waivers and description of the progress states ve made on these monstration

federal register june 15 1995 p 3147831483legislative history prior to 1994 numerous bills had been introduced to establish child welfare waiver demonstrations but had not been passed by the congress child welfare officials who desired additional flexibility had long advocated for waiver authority in child welfare such as had been ava ilable in other programs including medicaid and aid to families with dependent children afdc4 advocates of waivers hoped that states would then be able to us title ive funds for prevention and family preservation services title ive funds cu rrently defray state costs that are primarily related to the outofhome care of children and constitute by far the largest percentage of the total federal funds dedicated to child welfare the social security act amendments of 1994 included proposal to establish child welfare waiver demonstrations nd were enacted on october 31 1994 as pl 103432 authority for the waiver demonstr ations is found in section 1130 of the social security act the 105th congress extended and enacted other changes to the child welfare waiver authority through the adoption and safe families act asfa of 1997 pl 10589 the aut hority to approve new child welfare waiver demonstrations expired at the end of fy2002 and has not yet been reauthorized details of the waiver authorization principles and objectives the secretary of hhs was authorized to permit states to conduct child welfare demonstra tion projects that prom ote the objectives of titles ivb and ive and which may require the waiver of certain provisions of those laws titles ivb and ive are the sections of the social security act that govern child welfare services such as foster care adoption assistance independent living and family preservation and s upport states conducting wa iver demonstrations are still bound to the key principles of protectin g and promoting the safety permanency and wellbeing of children through thes demonstration projects the federal government seeks to test new approaches to child welfare that will help lead to improvements in the delivery effectiv eness and efficiency of services5 provisions excluded from waiver authority certain provisions of titles ivb and ive may not be waived for the purposes of these demonstrations the legislation sought to assure the safety of children protect the rights of children and their families and ensure permanency for children and therefore excluded from waiver are all protections regarding the periodic reviews of the status and progress of foster care cases permanency hearing requirements requirements that certain information be contained in childs case plan child protections such as placement setting guidelines family protections such as procedural safeguards to ensure thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31964crs3 6 for more information on some of the provisions mentione d see crs report rl30759 child welfare implementation of the adoption and safe families act by karen sparparental rights are respected the requirements of collecting data on foster care and adoption cases and the entitlement of any child or family to benefits6 duration of waiver demonstrations under the asfa amendments the secretary of hhs was permitted to grant waivers for up to 10 demonstration projects in each of fy1998 through fy2002 for poten tial total of 50 dem onstration projects over the course of the 5year authorization all states the district of columbia and puerto rico were eligible to receive waivers under the original authorization of the waiver demonstrations pl 103432 the s ecretary had only been permitted to grant waivers to total of up to 10 states the distinction between demonstration project and state is important because each state may implement more than one demonstration project each project may be conducted for up to 5 years not including time for startup and final evalua tion preparation and as allowed by the changes made by asfa the secretary of hhs may grant extensions for the demonstration projects cost neutrality as mandated by pl 103 432 the waiver demonstrations must be cost neutral to th federal government theref ore the approved allocation over the course of demonstration project must not exceed the amount that would have been expended by the fe deral government if the monstration project were not conducted to achieve cost neutrality the costs of the control group which consists of children being served by the existing state programs are used as the basis for determining the costs of the experimental group generally the same average cost perchild is applied to the experime ntal group allocation and cost neutra lity formulas may differ among the projects nd are dependent on the details of the project in addition how the federal gove rnment funds the project depends on which provision of the statute is waived in order to implement the project if title ive provision is waived then the federal funds are drawn from title ive currently all of the waiver requests have been for title ive provisions and therefore all of the federal funding for the dem onstrations are from the title ive funding stream states are responsible for paying for demonstration project costs beyond the agreed upon federal allocation states may be able to receive upfront funding in order to make initial i nvestments in their projects if after implement ation it appears that cost neutrality cannot be maintained throughout th duration of the project hhs will work with the state to modify the proj ect or take other actions as necessary to achieve cost neutrality see appendix b for statebystate list of project expenditures for each of fy2000 through fy 2002 expenditure data prior to fy2000 are not available evaluations each state that conducts wa iver demonstration must obtain project evaluation from an independent c ontractor this evaluation must at minimum make comparisons between the demonstration project the

would be required to conduct the proposed project and description of the proposed evaluation design both the state and federal governments are required to obtain public comments on the proposals if necessary hhs and the applying state will negotiate the terms and conditions of the waiver demonstration the secretary of hhs ma kes the final decision on the approval of waiver projects during the review process for the waiver applications hhs gave preference to proposals that met certain crite ria or addressed certain i ssues hhs initially provided guidance in the federal register regarding the social security act amendments of 1994 that it would grant waivers to test the same or relate d policy innovations in multiple states however later policy guidance on the asfa amendments gave preference to states that pr oposed unique policy alternatives and also to states that were not already operating demonstration project the adoption and safe families act also included requirement that certain types of pr oposals must be considered if submitted these are proposals that identify and address ba rriers that result in delays to adoptive placements for children in foster care
