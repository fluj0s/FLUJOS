6109c07 shspec51 reality in auditing engrams never ran with the pc out of valence all long engram running stems from the pc being out of valence we want him in the body he was in when the incident occurred its not necessarily his own valence its the valence he was in when the incident occurred being out of valence is the pcs way of denying responsibility for his part in the incident being in valence just permits him to run the pictures as long as he occupies body and thinks of it as himself hes not really being himself when the pc who is out of valence sees pictures they are small and thin they have nothing to do with him if the auditor is not aware of such phenomena he can make classic errors the pc sees picture the auditor never asks where are you viewing it from or what body do you occupy in the picture not asking these things the auditor thinks its all going fine when in fact the picture is way over there and very thin youre not really running the picture the pc saw you are running safe version with the condition that he never view it from the original viewpoint so it never asises pcs who are run this way on any process never get anyplace dont pay any attention the pc has from someone elses viewpoint it wont do any good conceptual processes have the virtue of moving pc straight back to the picture he is in that is of charging up the chain he is stuck in that makes him out of valence from that point on eventually he will wind up in his own valence in picture if the auditor doesnt make him handle it he doesnt know his business there are several approaches to this if you understand it the track is the series of pictures made by the person from the viewpoint he was occupying at the time of the incidents on it trying to run stuff from other viewpoints is just running branch lines and he wont get erasures his engrams are pictures of engrams and youre trying to erase picture that never occurred though the engram occurred there is simple method to handle this have you ever seen picture from inside the body you were in at the time the pc frequently will say well yes and he tells you about one or several take one of them and ask if theres anything about the auditing question he answered which is unknown run all the unknownnesses out of the incident you can find out that the incident has been with him ever since theres fundamental method find out if he has been in one and put him back in it if hes never been in an engram you can run recall an arc break this will unstack the track to point where hed find himself in the upsetting incident then you can flatten it another one which will do it easily get the idea of action out in front of you 200300 ft away conceive of an action 200300 ft behind you what happened to the mass it shifted you could follow this through use processes of inspection at distance and eventually get the guy to where hed be in the picture he was stuck in that peels down the valence people like repetitive processes if the pc has bad leg but never mentions it dont run it but if he complains about it there is something you can run ask if he has any odd pressures which will be his chronic psychosomatic illness probably his hidden standard run this vicious process who would have an unknown motion around the leg this sort of question will knock out chronic somatics if flattened it also works on absence of sensation another thing to do is see on the meter if motion confusion action etc reads well then make command who would have an unknown action etc around his leg pc who will not view his bank has tremendous intolerance of notions and unknowns motion can become intolerable to someone who is fixated on the subject of pain he believes that all motion adds up to pain pain does involve motion the strange thing is that someone who is trying to stop motion to prevent pain is doing the thing that makes pain occur if the thetan wasnt trying to stop motion around the body the body would experience pain notice with pain how it seems to result from two opposing motions as with all things people dont like it because they havent had enough of it in handling pc who has bank visible these factors must be present 1 he has an intolerance of pain hence of motion and unknowns 2 he has fantastic importance attached to motions and unknowns we see this but notis it people being very concerned about some particular unknown area the most unknownness there can be the most important one is the unknownness of motion being hit by surprise tends to give stuck somatic because of the unknownness of it those engrams which are most seriously stuck on the track are the ones composed of incomprehensibles the pc may keep getting fixed ideas about it in an effort to figure it out pretended knowingness substitutes for nonconfront of unknownness the importance of the unknownness and motion depends on the degree of threat to survival this goes back to the idea that one must survive which is the basic idiocy any way of getting version of unknown and motion together combined with valences gives you process to get the pc into his own pictures in space opera when theyre conditioning thetans theres sometimes tumbler incident this is pretty common hes thrown down shaft which is lighted at the top and bottom spinning as he goes he gets lot of pictures of white spots as he tries to stop himself all the way down so he gets bright spots stuck around him not very far from him at various distances up to 100 feet if you tell someone to look closer in than 200 feet hes likely to run into them there are lots of ways to get somebody dislocated delusory bank like dreams is an effort to locate oneself this is why 8c and tr10 make him feel better nearly every picture pc has is an effort to locate himself at point where he got dislocated unknown time plays major role tool having the pc spot unknown pictures shakes up all these efforts to locate himself by means of them hell get pictures flying by in all directions universe could be seen as an effort to locate oneself therefore because thetan doesnt have to be located its dirty trick to give him the idea he has to be located its very senior concept in processing that thetan does not have to if one could just cog on that out of the blue hed be clear but if you did begin to have that thought youd probably stop because the thought would set unknown motions going trying to locate another thetan must be basic overt but one that is prior to the overtmotivator sequence you try to get the concept i dont have to be located and you run up against the om phenomena you could run think of locating somebody this first runs off as good actions then it goes over into overts then into dispersal where he gets hard to audit if you clean up motion and unknownness well which cleans up valences the pc reaches back and starts changing his mind about these things and we get change of mind processing the route we are looking for is the route to change of mind the thetan just asising his old considerations what boobytraps this is that the pc must have escaped from innumerable pictures and gone off the track in numerous places he doesnt have concept of where hes been and what hes done and the unknownness of that is important because if hes escaped from these things they must have been dangerous thetan proves that things are dangerous by the fact that he ran away people in fact do not escape to the degree that things are dangerous they escape to the degree that they are unknown and have unacceptable motion wars are dangerous but known so people will play that game in war there is an effort to dislocate and locate by the enemy and by ones own commanders one could dream up substitute for war using the principle of locate vs dislocate fix and unfix the whole idea of power stems from the ability to hold location this is an idea of thetans which has become actualized in the physical universe the ability to hold the location depends in part on ones belief that one can hold it the power of body of troops on hilltop depends on their ability to hold their position and to make the enemy hold his position they have to take responsibility for holding the enemy where they are but they usually dont bother to pin the enemy down countries look weak after wars because one terminal has dislodged the other you always get generated energy by thrusting something at something that wont move this applies in the mest or the theta universe thetans friction against life and lifes thrust against him does generate energy the force of an engine depends on the strength of the elements that restrain the motion of the piston eg the bearings etc to the degree thetan resists position he gets picture to get solid 3d picture in pc get him to find time when there were two forces each trying to push the other away or find an argument the pc had with someone girls get the idea that they have to know something about electricity to understand scientology and since theyve gotten out of the habit of fighting holding the front line etc they think they shouldnt know much about power force etc this is not true girls generate more power and sparks than anything else in this society they will get firmly attached to an idea and not let go of it matter how much you argue it banks are charged and bother people to the degree that one has tried to hold positions and knock people off positions bank is like mold of what one tried to dislodge or hold position against when one is dislodged one dramatizes with picture from another position an out of valence picture if you try to force someone into the engram you only restimulate the forces pushing him away from it if you can take him up to it on gradient he can get into it you take the pc on gradient of what led up to the incident or masses and it will go back with confront into thenness and longer impinge on nowness
