institutional performance 45 purpose to establish system of metrics that will assist in formulating policy and implementing strategic plans to transform conflict and bring stability to wartorn societies these metrics provide both baseline assessment tool for policymakers to diagnose potential obstacles to stabilization prior to an intervention and an instrument for practitioners to track progress from the point of intervention through stabilization and ultimately to self sustaining peace this metrics system is designed to identify potential sources of continuing violent conflict and instability and to gauge the capacity of indigenous institutions to overcome them the intention is to enable policymakers to establish realistic goals bring adequate resources and authorities to bear focus their efforts strategically and enhance prospects for attaining an enduring peace stages of conflict transformation and stabilization stage 0 imposed stability drivers of violent conflict persist requiring the active and robust presence of external military forces in partnership with sizable international civilian presence to perform vital functions such as imposing order reducing violence delivering essential services moderating political conflict and instituting an acceptable political framework pursuant to peace accord stage i assisted stability drivers of violent conflict have been reduced to such an extent that they can be largely managed by local actors and developing indigenous institutions enabling the reduction of outside military intervention and civilian assistance to levels that can be sustained by the intervening parties over the long term note elsewhere this stage has been called viable peace1 or sustainable peace stage ii selfsustaining peace local institutions are able to cope effectively with residual drivers of violent conflict and resolve internal disputes peacefully without the need for an international military or civilian administrative presence note the fund for peace defines this condition as sustainable security2 major mission elements of conflict transformation and stabilization political moderation stable democracy security rule of law economic sustainability social wellbeing stage 0 stage i stage ii in devising measures to assess initial conditions and measure progress for each major mission element identified above two issues are paramount what are the motivations or means that drive conflict and what is the capacity of indigenous institutions to resolve conflict peacefully and maintain stability methodologies content analysis ca3 involves surveying media publications in order to gauge popular andor elite impressions of an issue advantages relies on readily available publications newspapers in particular can be important shapers of public opinion disadvantages difficult to choose which publications to survey labor intensive process of conducting the analysis expert opinion eo entails creating panel of independent knowledgeable and experienced experts to assess an issue of interest eg the capacity of law enforcement agencies to perform essential administrative and bureaucratic functions in this case panel of 35 experts might be used to observe operations in the field and to report on their quality the reliability and replicability of the findings depend on specifying the evaluation criteria and data gathering methodology in advance and following them consistently in the field advantages experts have the knowledge and expertise to offer informed and useful opinions on situation and can make sound qualitative judgments in relatively short period they may be used to study program documents interviews participants and make observations in the field the major costs involved are salaries and travel rather than complicated datacollection procedures disadvantages experts may have political agendas to advance one needs to be wary of relying on biased sample of experts it is especially important that the panelists be capable of independent judgment they cannot be permanent employees of the contracting agency or have financial stake in the future of the program being evaluated statistical analysis sa utilizes variety of statistics about security standard of living and economic development to assess the situation in country advantages statistics can appear to be more objective way of assessing progress provide useful standard for comparing progress at two different times disadvantages can be difficult to locate reliable indicators of the larger issue one is assessingfor example some have argued that number of deaths per month alone is not particularly good indicator of the strength of the insurgency in iraq statistics are easily manipulated to accommodate variety of interpretations surveypolling data spd involves conducting public opinion surveys in order to assess how the public views variety of issues advantages can provide useful general overview of societal views and values can easily be conducted on large number of people which provides more confidence in the findings disadvantages surveys must be carefully designed to ensure that the sampled public is representative poorly worded questions or untrained survey conductors can lead to inaccurate responses political moderation and stable democracy stage i objective
