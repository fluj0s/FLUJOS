of modifying the applicati on of the amendment under certain circumstances background the bradley amendment amendment1 is 1986 amendment to title iv of the social security act which prohibits the retroactive modification of child support arrearages2 the amendment language was contained in s 27063 the sixth omnibus reconciliation act 1986 and was introduced in an earlier bill by senator williamhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20642crs2 4 senator bradley and senator russell long introduced s 2404 the interstate child support acta bill to prohibit the retroactive modification of child support arrearages on may 5 1986 s 2404 99th cong 2nd sess 1986 there was formally introduced amendment to s 2706 which contained the amendment language 5 hr 5300 99th cong 2d sess 1986 6 pub l 99509 100 stat

parent perhaps through winning lottery might encourage desire to retroactively raise child support arrearagesbradley4 from whom the amendment takes its name the house bill5 was enacted in place of the senate bill as the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 19866 although originally the house bill did not contain provision regarding retroactive child support modifications the senate bill language was added to the house bill following the conference7 the amendment currently states 9 procedures which require that any payment or installment of support under any child support order whether ordered through the state judicial system or through the expedited processes required by paragraph 2 is on and after the date it is due judgment by operation of law with the full force effect and attributes of judgment of the state including the ability to be enforced b entitled as judgment to full faith and credit in such state and in any other state and c not subject to retroactive modification by such state or by any other state except that such procedures may permit modification with respect to any period during which there is pending petition for modification but only from the date that notice of such petition has been given either directly or through the appropriate agent to the obligee or where the obligee is the petitioner to the other obligor8 the practical effect of this provision is not to allow the retroactive modification by any state of an existing child support arrearage while most commentators focus on the states inability to reduce child support arrearages retroactively the amendment also prevents the states from retroactively increasing child support arrearages9 it is instructive to examine the legislative history in order to determine the congressional intent underlying the enactment of the amendment the senate reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20642crs3 10 s rep 348 99th cong 2d sess 155 1986 11 id 12 id 13 h conf rep no1012 99th cong 2d sess 272 1986 14 45 cfr 303206 2000 15 54 fr 1575815762 1989examined the current law concerning child support arrearages it noted that certain states allowed child support award to be retroactively modified in these states the administrative entity or court was able to reduce or nullify arrearages10 the amendment added new requirement to the child support enforcement program under title iv of the social security act which the states were required to meet in order to be in compliance with the program in order to meet this new requirement state laws relating to child support orders must prohibit changes to those orders which were effective on retroactive basis the report language states the committee recognizes that persons financial circumstances change the noncustodial parent may lose his or her job or face other circumstances that cause him or her not to be able to afford the original child support award the amendment is not intended to prevent changes in future child support payments if the financial situation of the noncustodial parent changes what the committee is seeking to prevent is the purposeful noncompliance by the noncustodial parent because of his hope that his child support obligation will be retroactively forgiven11 the report language further states that if the noncustodial parents financial circumstances change because of unemployment illness or other reasons the amendment puts the burden on the noncustodial parent to notify the custodial parent and the court or entity which issued the child support order of the noncustodial parents changed financial circumstances and the noncustodial parents intention to have hisher child support order modified modification would be allowed before the date of this notification12 the house conference report13 language reinforced the intentions of the senate report and used language nearly identical to that contained in the senate report regulations have been promulgated which are consistent with the provisions of the amendment14 the federal register release accompanying the final regulation reflects the legislative history15 application of the amendment it is beyond the scope of this report to evaluate the success or failure of the amendment within the context of the collection of child support arrearages numerous commentators have focused upon the lack of flexibility in the amendments notification requirements proponents of repeal or revision of the amendment cite two particular situations involving arrearages incurred by noncustodial parents one case involved noncustodial father who was held hostage in kuwait for almost five months and who was therefore unable to comply with the amendments notification procedures following hishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20642crs4 16 the arrest of the parent in arrears was state action not required by the amendment 17 associated press file dec 15 1990 18 see note 14 19 cheryl wetzstein childsupportlaw amendment comes to attention of hill wash times april 27 1999 at a8 cited to afterward as wetzstein 20 presumably the prisoner was not employed during his incarceration it is possible that he might have complied with the notification requirements and requested modification of his child support order through his legal counsel however the factual and legal circumstances surrounding this situation are uncertain so definitive conclusion can be made 21 this groups website is located at httpwwwancprorg the group provides model letters to write to federal legislators to request modification andor repeal of the amendment 22

individual who was incarcerated for murder following his release and exoneration he was arrested18 for nonpayment of child support19 obviously the hostage in kuwait was in position to comply with the notification provisions of the amendment legal and factual questions arise as to the ability of the prisoner to comply with the provisions of the amendment20 another consideration is that the amendment provides that an appropriate agent can perform the notification procedure such an agent might be relative or lawyer although the use of an agent does not necessarily resolve all instances when parent is unavailable to comply with the notification provisions of the amendment it does provide an option which may be able to be utilized under certain circumstances various noncustodial parental advocacy groups have encouraged the repeal of the amendment or the enactment of an amendment to the amendment one such group is the alliance for noncustodial parental rights legislative action center21 other comment ators and advocates do not want changes made to the amendment spokesperson for the center for law and social policy stated that if the amendment were repealed it would provide an incentive for guys who can pay but are determined not to22 arguments can be made for the repealmodification of the amendment as well as for the retention of the amendment in its current form judicial interpreta tions of the amendment have examined its applicability under certain specific sets of circumstances for example the court determined that child support award established after trial but made effective as of the first day of the day of the divorce trial was not retroactive modification of child support obligation as prohibited by the amendment23 another judicial interpretation of the amendment prohibited trial court from ordering father to pay child support retroactively to the date prior to the filing of his application to modify child support 24 other cases

has ever given serious consideration to repeal of the amendment however legislative proposals in the 106th congress if enacted would have the effect of modifying the application of the amendment in certain circumstances title 5 of hr 467826 provides funding for grants to public and private entities for demonstration projects designed to promote marriage promote successful parenting and help poor fathers obtain better jobs under the proposed fatherhood grant program the panel awarding the grants would give preference to entities that had written agreement with the child support enforcement agency in which the agency would cancel child support arrearages owed to the state by the father if the father was maintaining regular child support payment schedule or was living with his children although this provision does not repeal the amendment it would allow retroactive modification of child support obligations for noncustodial fathers who were living in community covered by the grant if the grantee had the abovementioned agreement with the child support enforcement agency and the father was either paying child support on regular basis or had reunited with his children27 similar provision is contained in hr 307328 which was passed by the house on november 10 199929
