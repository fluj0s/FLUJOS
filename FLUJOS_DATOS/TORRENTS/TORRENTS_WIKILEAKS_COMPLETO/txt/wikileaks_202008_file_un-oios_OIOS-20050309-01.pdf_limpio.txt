unctad has accepted all recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them overall unctad adequately administered 200 series personnel entitlements and oios noted only few minor shortcomings unctad agreed with th observations and already initiated action for most of them unctad paid some 23000 repatriation grant to fo rmer staff member before obtaining sufficient documentary evidence of relocation re view of the staff members personnel file disclosed other issues such as deficiencies in the recruitment inaccurate post classification noncompliance with staff rules on attendance and n onrecovery of portable printer upon separation in recruiting and administering staff members unctad should apply objective criteria and decisions regardless of the source of contributions funding the post unctad agreed with the thrust of our observation but stat ed that the payment was based on number of developments and circumstances evidencing relocatio n unctad subsequently presented confirmation dated february 2005 from unido that th former staff member now works at its rome office 200 series posts are funded with voluntary contribu tions and related contracts are issued based on available funding this leads to frequent renew of shortterm contracts and update of the staff members entitlements thus drastically incr easing the project staff units workload such shortterm contracts are not in the interest of eff icient personnel administration and human resources management and hamper satisfactory progra mming and implementation of projects unctad should consider issuing longer term contracts taking into account the expected duration of projects and make provision for the payment of termination indemnity in case the lack of funds requires termination prior to the xpiration of fixedterm or shortterm appointment unctad indicated that it would consider the feasibi lity of oneyear letters of appointment since may 2002 unctad has not established procedur for the classification of 200 series posts unctad should reinstate procedures to set bjective criteria for the classification of posts and for the promotion of 200 series

that unctad had procedures for recruitment and classific ation of project personnel the thrust of which was analogous to regular staff it would howe ver ensure that staff members from the project

october and november 2004 oios conducted an audit of unctad administration of entitlements the audit was condu cted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 the united nations conference on trade and developm ent was established in 1964 to maximize the trade and development opportunitie s of developing countries and to assist them in their integration in the world economy in 20022003 its total expenditure amounted to 93 million and 44 million in regular and extrabudgetary funds respectively for the biennium 20042005 its planned expenditure was 92 million under the regular budget and 41 million under the extrabudgetary res ources 3 in 2003 unctad had 126 project staff with staf f expenditure amounting to 105 million half of which was for base salary and the rest for related entitlements as of 30 september 2004 there were 103 project personnel wi th related expenditure of approximately 95 million 4 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 8 december 2004 with the chief administrative service the chief project personnel and consultancy unit nd other officers draft of this report was shared with the director division of managemen t on 13 january 2005 whose comments have been reflected in the report in italics unct ad division of management has accepted all of the recommendations made and is in the process f implementing them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to assess the compliance with regulations and rules as well as the efficiency of actual proc edures and organizational setup for administering the entitlements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on all entitlements eligible f or 200 series staff ie dependency allowance mobilityhardshipnon removal element lowance home leave and family visit entitlements assignment and repatriation grants an d rental subsidy entitlements paid in september 2004 were taken as reference for the popu lation to review the ensuing file review covered the complete employment period of concerned staff with unctad the processing and calculation of education grants was not covered by this audit as previous assignment on unog education grants had already included uncta d in the scope of the review 7 the audit activities included review of person nel files and personnel data in imis comparative financial analysis and review of inte rnal control and procedures iv audit findings and recommendations dependency benefits 8 out of the 13 files reviewed for dependency bene fits out of 38 staff members in receipt of the allowance in september 2004 three were missing supporting evidence for 2 eligibility proof of full time education for child or spouse statement of earning evidence was subsequently submitted to the project personnel and consultancy unit 9 one staff member index 395832 was in recei pt of dependency allowance although his spouses earnings were above the eligi bility ceiling following ruling by ohrm that the spouses language allowance which w as mentioned in the attestation provided by the spouses employer has to be tak into account in determining dependency benefit it was determined that the staf f member was overpaid for ten months at total amount of some 2500 unctad reported the c ase to unog as the staff member had moved to 100 series contract administered by g recommendation head2right unctad administrative service should followup with unog hrms to ensure recovery of dependency allowance of approximately 2500 as of 31 october 2004 overpaid to staff member index 395832 rec 01 10 unctad accepted the recommendation oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of proof of recovery of th overpayment from the staff member b mobility allowance 11 five years of consecutive service are required to qualify for mobility allowance in reviewing the imis staff members profiles oios ob served that this requirement did not seem to have been complied with in one instance in dex 433209 unctad explained that the entry on duty eod date in the mobility s creen in imis could be different from that in the personnel action form in this case the pr evious service under separate contract was not picked up in the mobility screen of imis the data was therefore misleading oios will take up separately with unog imis support the displ ay of the correct eod dates in the mobility screen of imis c repatriation grant 12 according to staff rule 2096 payment of r epatriation grant after separation shall require prior submission of documentary evidence th at the former project personnel have relocated away from the country of the last duty st ation reviewing repatriation grants paid in 2004 oios came across one case where unctad paid repatriation grant of 23086 to staff member separated on 31 december 2002 index n 570585 without prior evidence of relocation subsequent attempts to obtain from the former staff member the required documentary evidence failed despite several remind ers our review of the staff members personnel file further disclosed additional issues the staff member was recruited at generous l5 iv level although she had high school diploma only and had insufficient knowledge of any official language the address in geneva was not certain as the staff member never updated her initial temporary address which was her national permanent mission in geneva nine unauthorized absences over four years at uncta d led unctad to grant ex post facto special leave without pay on these occasions it is stated in confidential note in the file tha t unctad was unable to recover 3 portable printer assigned to the staff member 13 unctad explained that the case was political one and that the staff members post was funded by the staff members country of nationa lity the issue of recruitment was also recently raised by the board of auditors in its man agement letter dated 11 march 2004 as the recruitment of experts process was qualified as not transparent and consistent and as this case further illustrates article 101 of the u n charter setting the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency competence and integrity was not always adhered to 14 unctad further stated that the repatriation grant w as released to offset special leaves without pay and was based on number of dev elopments and circumstances which constituted sound evidence of relocation to rome u nctad subsequently obtained confirmation dated 7 february 2005 from unido that the staff member now works in its rome office oios considers that unctad in the future should n ot bend to political pressure on recruitment as in this case where not only was the contribution of the country of nationality of the staff member hence resources was at stake but also the credibility of unctad d classification and promotion 15 from the review of personnel files oios enquir ed on the classification and promotion of project staff unctad explained that since the implementation of the new staff selection system in may 2002 new procedures were implemented for 100 series staff only set procedure was provided for 200 series personnel though draft procedure was provided to senior management furthermore staff members in t he project personnel and consultancy unit are not involved in classification contrary t the provisions of both their job descriptions and the presentation on their functions in the unct ad intranet site 16 oios believes that procedures that set objectiv criteria and standards for promotion and classification should be reinstated the proje ct personnel unit should also be fully involved in the process as they are in charge and have broad understanding of human resources management they could give useful advic and guidance to substantive units recommendation head2right unctad administrative service should in consultati on with unogs human resources management service establis h and implement clear and transparent process for the p ost classification appointment and promotion of 200 series staff rec 02 17 unctad commented that procedures for the selection and reclassification of lstaff were abolished following the introduction in may 2 002 of the new staff selection system set out in stai20024 departmental panels unctad t hus established procedures for recruitment and reclassification of project personn the thrust of which was analogous to that applicable to regular staff more generally as regards lstaff ohrm has been carrying out unwide review in which unctad has been close ly and directly involved principal aim being to harmonize conditions of service the r eview is not yet complete as regards classification unctad stated that classification focal point is responsible for advising substantive divisions on job descriptions for the 1 00 series of the staff rules but also advising the project personnel and consultancy unit on the c lassification of lstaff job descriptions 4 18 unctad would however ensure that one or two members of the project personnel and consultancy unit undergo classification trainin g either with unog or new york oios will consider recommendation 02 as closed upon rece ipt of procedures in place for the post classification appointment and promotion of lstaf f possibly amended following the wide review contract duration 19 in its march 2004 management letter the board of auditors recommended that unctad consider documenting multiyear funding s trategy in cooperation with donors the lack of predictable funding sources ra ised by the boa also has an impact on project personnel administration contracts issued have to comply with the ceiling of available resources for given project leading to numerous shortterm contracts down to one month and frequently renewed 20 in frequently renewing shortterm contracts th project personnel unit is faced with additional workload not only due to the renewal of contracts but also because some entitlements depend on the duration of the employme nt this constant need for personnel administration prevents the units staff from perfo rming other essential functions as performance monitoring career development and advi sing on all pertinent matters it is also doubtful that staff members holding shortterm tracts can actually plan ahead and undertake project activities within the project tim eframe hence jeopardizing the delivery of planned outputs 21 in the view of oios the duration of project st affs fixedterm or shortterm appointments should take into account the expected duration of the projects concerned and reasonable funding expectations even if funds have not yet been received for cases where project activities have to be discontinued due to l ack of expected funds unctad could terminate appointments in accordance with staff reg ulation 91 b the extension of appointments over and above the level of firmly sec ured funding does therefore require financial provision for the payment of termination indemnity according to staff rule 2095 recommendation head2right unctad administrative service should review its tract policy for 200 series staff and consider issuing contracts of reasonable duration while making provision for the payment of termination indemnity in case expected project funding is not f orthcoming rec 03 22 unctad confirmed sharing the oios concerns on the d uration of contracts and indicated that their examination of statistics for separations of lstaff since imis was implemented concluded that the risk of separating an expert for lack of funds was minor unctad is considering the feasibility of issuing on eyear letters of appointment oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of policy decision on the duration of appointments for project staff f filing 23 oios noted in its review of personnel files th poor conditions in which staff members confidential data were kept in several in stances relevant documentation could not 5 be found as it was filed inconsistently or elsewher unctad mentioned budget constraints for both the archiving and the physical files thems elves recommendation head2right unctad administrative service should establish stan dard filing procedures for its personnel file and improve the c onditions for their safekeeping rec 04 24 unctad accepted the recommendation oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of information on the actions taken to impr ove the filing
