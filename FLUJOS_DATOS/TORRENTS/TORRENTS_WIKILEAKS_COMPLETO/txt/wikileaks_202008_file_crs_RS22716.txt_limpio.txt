estimated that about 55 million adults aged 65 and older or 16 of the us httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22716 population 65 and older receive longterm care services and supports1 of those older americans who receive longterm care most receive some form of informal or unpaid care primarily provided by spouses and adult children2 many believe that the demand for family caregiving is likely to increase with further increases in life expectancy and the aging of the babyboom generation at the same time demographic trends such as reduced fertility increased divorce rates and greater labor force participation among women lead some to believe that th number of available caregivers as well as the capacity for caregivers to provide needed care to older individuals may be declining although the federal government has established some programs and services to support family caregivers policy makers have identified the need for additional federal benefits this report briefly describes legislation enacted in the 109th congress and proposals introduced in the 110th congress that directly assist family caregivers hr 1032 hr 1161 hr 1369 hr 1542 hr 1560 hr 1807 hr 1871 hr 1911 hr 2244

established the national family caregiver support program nfcsp in 2000 under title iii of the older americans act oaa pl 106501 the nfcsp provides services that are directly targeted to family caregivers including information and referral services counseling support groups and caregiver training respite care services and supplemental services on limited basis eg adult day care home care home modifications4 for fy2008 nfcsp funding accounts for 1534 million or 8 of total oaa expenditures5 as the nation prepares for the growing older population and likely increase in demand for longterm care services among the frail elderly congress will face decision whether to expand the role of the federal government in providing assistance to family caregivers some policy makers favor enhancing services that provide direct support or expanding the availability and amount of federal income tax relief to caregivers while httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22716 others believe the federal government has limited responsibility in assisting families who provide unpaid assistance many by choice to older individuals the following describes legislation enacted in the 109th congress and proposals in the 110th congress that would provide new benefits or enhance and expand existing federal benefits and services to assist family caregivers recently enacted legislation the following summarizes legislation enacted in the 109th congress to directly assist family caregivers to older adults recently enacted legislation includes the lifespan respite care act pl 109442 and new provisions under title iii part of the oaa pertaining to the nfcsp that were included in the reauthorization of the oaa pl 109 365 lifespan respite care act in an effort to expand federal support of respite services for family caregivers caring for individuals of all ages the 109th congress passed the lifespan respite care of act of 2006 the law defines respite care to mean planned or emergency care provided to child or adult of any age with special need in order to give temporary relief to the family caregiver the lifespan respite care act authorizes appropriations totaling 289 million for fy2007 through fy2011 however congress did not fund these activities for fy2007 or fy2008 thus implementation of the law is contingent on future appropriations 3 crs report rl34123 family caregiving

fy2008 funding and fy2009 funding proposals by angela napili crs3 the lifespan respite care act authorizes the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs to award matching grants to eligible state agencies to 1 develop or enhance lifespan respite care activities at the state and local levels 2 improve the statewide dissemination and coordination of respite care and 3 provide supplement or improve access and quality of respite care services to family caregivers caring for children and adults the law also instructs the secretary of hhs to ensure coordination of respite care services for family caregivers by working with the nfcsp and other respite care programs within hhs pl 109442 authorized national resource center on lifespan respite care which among other responsibilities would provide training and technical assistance to state community and nonprofit respite care programs and offer public information referral and educational programs on lifespan respite care national family caregiver support program the older americans act oaa gives priority for nfcsp services to caregivers who are older individuals ie those aged 60 and older with greatest economic or social need and with particular attention to lowincome older individuals the 109th congress amended the oaa to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22716 clarify that priority for nfcsp services is also given to older individuals who are providing care to persons with severe disabilities including children with severe disabilities pl 109365 also required the state to give priority to those caregivers providing assistance to persons aged 60 and over with alzheimers disease and related neurological disorders proposed legislation the following identifies bills in the 110th congress that would expand or enhance the federal governments role in providing direct assistance to family caregivers these laws and proposals are organized into the following sections 1 enhancing and expanding caregiver services and supports 2 assisting employed caregivers through flexible workplace accommodations and income security policies and 3 providing caregivers with opportunities for additional tax credits caregiver services many family caregivers identify the need for enhanced services that can help them with their current caregiving responsibilities and provide further information or assistance as caregiving demands change over time research suggests that providing support for services to family caregivers can reduce caregiver stress avoid burnout and allow family members to continue providing informal care to an older relative thus potentially avoiding or delaying unnecessary institutionalization6 as previously mentioned one federal program the nfscp provides services that directly assist family caregivers to older individuals other federal programs may provide benefits to assist family caregivers however they may have eligibility restrictions or limitations on the amount and duration of covered services proposals to expand services to caregivers include but are not limited to increased funding to the nfcsp national 6 brenda c spillman and sharon k long does

disruptions may include arriving to work late or leaving early taking time off during the day reducing the number of hours worked from fulltime to parttime status or taking leave of absence major changes to employee work schedules and work disruptions can affect income and job security some proposals have suggested different approaches that would broaden the family medical leave act fmla pl 103 3 to make the laws requirements an option for more employees examples of these approaches described below include expanding fmla eligibility broadening the care recipient group and expanding the type of activities for which fmla can be taken under current law the fmla requires private employers with at least 50 employees employed within 75 miles and public employers regardless of size to extend jobprotected unpaid leave to employees who meet lengthofservice and hoursofwork eligibility requirements covered eligible employees are entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year employees can invoke fmla to attend to their own serious health condition and to care for newborn newly adopted or newly placed foster child the 7 on august 3 2007 s 898 was reported by the senate committee on health education labor and pensions with an amendment in the nature of substitute and placed on the senate calendar 8 for fy2008 the addgs program was funded at 115 million crs5 fmla also makes it possible for covered workers who take time off to care for parent spouse or child with serious health condition to do so without fear of jeopardizing their jobs two proposals would broaden fmla eligibility by lowering the threshold for coverage of private sector employers from 50 to 25 or 15 employees hr 1369representative carolyn maloney and hr 2392representative lynne woolsey respectively9 another proposal would eliminate the hoursofwork eligibility requirement hr 6029representative tammy baldwin which states that an employee must have at least 1250 hours of employment during the 12month period prior to the leave request replacing it with an employment requirement of at least 12 months by covered employer prior to the leave request one proposal hr 2792representative carolyn maloney would assist family caregivers by broadening the care recipient groups under the fmla statute beyond the employees own parent spouse or child to include elderly relatives such as parentin law or grandparent in addition to other individuals eg domestic partner nondisabled children aged 18 or older another bill hr 7233 representative carolyn maloney httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22716 would assist family caregivers by expanding the type of activities for which fmla can be taken such as allowing leave for transporting older relatives to medical and dental appointments and for visiting them in nursing or group homes yet other workforce related proposals would require employers to provide paid time off to their employees for their own medical needs or to care for the medical needs of certain family members two bills s 910senator edward m kennedy hr 1542representative rosa l lauro would require certain employers to provide minimum paid sick leave benefits to eligible workers s 1681 senator chris dodd uses employer and employee contributions to create trust fund that would partially compensate eligible workers on jobprotected leave for fmla reasons other proposals hr 1369 and hr 2392 mentioned above would also authorize grants to state and local governments for wage replacement for eligible individuals who take leave from employment to respond to family caregiving needs another type of proposal is directed at assisting those who leave the workforce to care for an older disabled family member these individuals may have less opportunity to save or accrue benefits over their lifetimes which may leave them economically vulnerable in retirement one proposal designed to alleviate the longterm financial affects for caregivers would amend the social security act with respect to determining entitlement for old age survivors and disability insurance oasdi hr 1161 representative nita m lowey would deem an individual to have been paid wage according to specified formula for each month during which the individual provided care to dependent relative of any age for at least 80 hours without monetary compensation for maximum of five years tax credits policy makers have also suggested additional tax relief that would directly assist families caring for an older individual in need of longterm care several 9 for further information see crs report rl31760 the family and medical leave act recent legislative and regulatory activity by linda levine crs6 bills would provide tax credit to directly assist family caregivers these proposals vary in terms of the size of the tax credit any income limitations in determining the amount of the credit whether the credit is phasedin over time the amount of applicable individuals and whether the tax credit is refundable or nonrefundable ie limited to the taxpayers liability for example s 897 senator barbara mikulski and hr 1807 representative eddie bernice johnson would allow for phasedin nonrefundable tax credit for family caregivers among other things the tax credit would amount to 1000 in 2007 increasing to maximum of 3000 in 2011 s 2267 would allow caregivers non refundable tax credit of up to 6000

corrine httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22716 brown would provide caregivers with 3000 refundable tax credit for up to two family members with longterm care needs policymakers have also suggested changes to the dependent care tax credit dctc and the dependent care assistance program dcap which would expand either the tax credit amount or the eligible dependent population10 the dctc provides eligible taxpayers credit to offset some costs of formal care for qualifying child or disabled spouse or other dependent the dctc is limited to circumstances in which the care is necessary for the taxpayers employment the dependent care assistance program dcap which allows caregivers who work for employers with dcap to exclude up to 5000 of earnings used for qualified dependent care expenses the dcap limit of 5000 in qualifying expenses applies regardless of the number of qualifying individuals three bills hr 1911 representative joe donnelly hr 6390 representative corrine brown and s 614 senator charles schumer include provisions to expand the dctc to taxpayers with caregiving expenses for parent or grandparent who does not live with the taxpayer another bill hr 1871 kirsten gillibrand would increase the tax credit rate to 40 of qualified employmentrelated expenses for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes agis of 100000 or less hr 5655 representative anthony d weiner would increase the dollar limitation on employmentrelated expenses that qualify for the tax credit for the dctc from 3000 to 6000 as well as make the tax credit refundable the bill would also expand eligibility by repealing the requirement that the taxpayer and dependent share the same residence and requiring that qualifying retirees be eligible for such credit one proposal hr 6448 would increase the dcap tax credit by applying the 5000 limit to each qualifying individual up to maximum of 4 individuals 10 for further information on the dctc and dcap see crs report rs21466 dependent care current tax
