science and industry division november 7 2007 abstract in the united states and around the world growing number of businesses interest groups and individuals are purchasing carbon oﬀsets and asserting that all or part of their greenhouse gas ghg emitting activities eg air travel corporate events or personal automobile use are carbon neutral as result these exchanges represent voluntary market for carbon oﬀsets because there is currently federal requirement that ghg emissions be curtailed the concept of purchasing carbon oﬀsets to achieve carbon neutrality or reduce ones carbon footprint has spurred both interest and debate in recent years this report provides an overview of carbon oﬀsets and examines some of the issues that are generating debate and controversy although there is some overlap of issues between voluntary carbon oﬀsets and the oﬀsets used to comply with mandatory reduction regimes this report focuses on the voluntary oﬀsets market unless otherwise stated the carbon

offsets to reduce their carbon footprint or to categorize an activity as carbon neutral carbon offset is measurable avoidance reduction or sequestration of carbon dioxide co 2 or other greenhouse gas ghg emissions offsets generally fall within the following four categories biological sequestration renewable energy energy efficiency and reduction of nonco 2 emissions in terms of the carbon concentration in the atmosphere an emission reduction avoidance or sequestration is beneficial regardless of where or how it occurs credible offset equates to an emission reduction from direct em ission source such as smokestack or exhaust pipe the core issue for carbon offset projects is do they actually offset emissions generated elsewhere if the credibility of the voluntary offsets is uncertain claims of carbon neutrality may be challenged evidence suggests that not all offset projects are of equal quality because they are developed through range of standards in the voluntary market there are commonly accepted standards although some standards are considered stringent others are less so at least 30 companies and organizations domestic and international sell carbon offsets to individuals or groups in the international voluntary carbon market two recent studies that examined many of the offset sellers found general correlation between offset price and offset quality due to the lack of common standards some observers have referred to the market as the wild west this does not suggest that all carbon offsets are low quality but that the consumer must necessarily adopt buyerbeware mentality when purchasing carbon offsets this places the responsibility on consumers to judge the quality of carbon offsets the viability of the voluntary offset market may influence future policy decisions regarding climate change mitigation for example credible offsets could play an important role particularly in terms of costeffectiveness in an emissions control regime there is some concern that the range in the quality of voluntary market offsets may damage the overall credibility of carbon offsets if this occurs it may affect policy decisions concerning whether or not to include offsets as an option in mandatory reduction program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34241g24g152g149g158g151g157g138g155g162g561g5g138g155g139g152g151 g561g17g143g143g156g142g157g156g497g561g17g159

2 or other greenhouse gas ghg emissions offsets generally fall within the following four categories discussed in greater detail later in the report biological sequestration renewable energy energy efficiency and reduction of nonco 2 emissions carbon offsets are sometimes described as projectbased because they typically involve specific projects or activities that reduce avoid or sequester emissions because offset projects can involve different ghgs1 they are quantified and described with standard form of measure either in tons of carbonequivalents or co 2equivalents frequently expressed as tce or tco 2e to be considered credible offset the emissions reduced avoided or sequestered need to be additional to businessasusual ie what would have happened anyway in the context of mandatory ghg emission reduction regime an offset can come only from sources not covered by the reduction program ie outside the emissions cap2 emission reductions from regulated sources would be required under the cap and thus would not be additional by comparison reduction activity may be additional if it occurs from source in nation that does not limit the sources ghg emissions as more nations or us states establish mandatory caps on emission sources the universe of potential carbon offsets will shrink

voluntary carbon offsets is their integrity it is generally agreed that credible offset should equate to an emission reduction from direct emission source such as smokestack or exhaust pipe several criteria determine the integrity or quality of an offset project g3g141g141g146g157g146g152g151g138g149g146g157g162g561 this is generally considered to be the most significant factor that determines the integrity of the carbon offset additionality refers to whether the offset project eg wind farm would have gone forward on its own merits or own financial benefi ts without the support of the offset market in other words would the project have happened anyway if the project would have occurred without the financial support of the offset buyer the emission reductions generated from the project would not be additional the additionality criterion is at the crux of an offsets integrity but additionality can be difficult to assess in practice the standards used to analyze projects additionality vary and some groups may downplay the importance of this attribute an offset seller who employs more stringent additionality analysis will likely offer higher quality offsets 3 the world bank report states that the estimates are based on an unpublished study the authors of the study provided the estimates to the world bank prior to its publication world bank 2007 state and trends of

emissions baseline an estimate of the businessasusual scenario or the emissions that would have occurred without the project if project managers inaccurately estimate the baseline the offsets sold may not match the actual reductions achieved for example an overestimated baseline projecting more emissions than would have been emitted in the projects absence would generate an artificially high amount of offsets baseline measurement may present technical challenges in addition project developers would have financial incentive to err on the high side of the baseline determination because the higher the projected baseline the more offsets generated g6g152g158g139g149g142g561g5g152g158g151g157g146g151g144g561 carbon offset is meaningful if it is only counted once to be credible when an offset is sold it should be retired and not sold again or counted in other contexts however opportunities for doublecounting exist for example us buyer may purchase offsets generated through the development of wind farm in country state or locality that has established ghg emissions targets the us buyer will count the offsets which may have been purchased to counter an increase in personal air travel in addition the nation state or locality in which the wind farm is located may see an emissions reduction due to the wind farm this decrease will be reflected in the nations ghg emissions inventory thus the offset project wind farm may replace other reduction activities that the nation might have taken to meet its target tracking system needed to avoid such doublecounting does not exist 6 some may argue that doublecounting is less of problem if the offset project occurs in us state county or city with only voluntary target as opposed to nation subject the kyoto protocol however the impact would be the same if the state is eventually part of federal emissions reduction program and the state is allowed to take credit for the earlier reductions associated with the offset project by taking credit for an earlier reduction the state will need to make fewer reductions to be in compliance with the new mandatory program g18g142g155g150g138g151g142g151g140g142g561 when carbon offsets are generated from project there should be confidence that the emission offsets are permanentthat the emissions are not merely postponed this characteristic is most pertinent to biological sequestration projects specifically forestry activities for example buyers need some assurance that the land set aside for forests will not be used for conflicting purpose eg logging or urban development in the future although natural events fires or pests are hard to control human activity can be constrained through legal documents such as land easements in addition an offset could come with guarantee that it would be replaced if the initial reduction is temporary 6 see anja kollmuss 2007 carbon offsets 101 world watch

in the voluntary market carbon offsets can be generated from multiple economic sectors this report discusses carbon offsets grouped into the four categories identified above each category contains list of possible carbon offset examples specific integrity issues may be associated with particular offset categories these issues are discussed below the potential problems highlighted below should not necessarily rule out entire carbon offset categories if offset project developers can address these potential obstacles the offsets may be credible however it may be difficult for offset buyers to know if these problems were addressed as discussed later in the report g4g146g152g149g152g144g146g140g138g149g561g21g142g154g158g142g156g157g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 trees plants and soils sequester carbon thereby reducing its amount in the earths atmosphere7 biological sequestration projects generally involve activities that either increase sequestration or preserve an areas existing sequestration ability that is under threat eg from logging or development this offset category includes sequestration that results from activities related to agriculture and forests and is sometimes referred to as land use land use change and forestry lulucf projects example of these projects include planting trees on previously nonforested land ie afforestation planting trees on formerly forested land ie reforestation limiting deforestation by purchasing forested property and preserving the forests with legal mechanisms eg land easements setting aside croplands from production to avoid emissions released during crop production promoting practices that reduce soil disruption eg conservation tillage compared to the other offset categories biological sequestration projects offer the most potential in terms of volume particularly forestry projects however this category is arguably the most controversial because of several integrity issues that are typically associated or perceived to be associated with biological sequestration projects some agricultural sequestration offsets may raise concerns of additionality ie the sequestration activity would have happened regardless of the payments received from offset buyers for example farmers may be able to generate offsets by conducting notill operations on their land but for the offsets to be credible the impetus to adopt this practice should be driven by the financial gain from the offset market if the notill practice was part of normal operations before the offset market then the offset would fail the additionality test there is anecdotal evidence indicating that some farmers have been using th notill technique for years but still received compensation for the offsets 8 if this is the case this would be fairly straightforward example of nonadditional offset should this bar other farmers who have not been practicing conservation measures eg notill farming from receiving offsets for initiating such measures arguably the measures provide some benefit on their own eg less fuel use because some farmers have been 7 for more information on these processes see crs report rl34059 the carbon cycle

primary driver at some farms this example demonstrates the difficulties associated with proving that project is additional biological sequestration offset projects may present challenges in terms of measurement this issue is especially relevant to forestryrelated offsets the carbon cycle in trees and soils is complex variations across tree species ages and geographic locations increase the measurement challenge 9 in addition other variables complicate the measurement of reductions from forestry projects for example recent study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences stated we find that globalscale deforestation has net cooling influence on earths climate because the warming carboncycle effects of deforestation are overwhelmed by the net cooling associated with changes in albedo10 and evapotranspiration11 latitudespecific deforestation experiments indicate that afforest ation projects in the tropics would be clearly beneficial in mitigating globalscale warming but would be counterproductive if implemented at high latitudes and would offer only marginal benefits in temperate regions 12 as mentioned earlier biological sequestration projects often raise questions of permanence ie whether the activity that generates offsets will continue although many observers expected biological sequestration offsets to dominate the international market this has not been observed in practice concern of permanence has been one of the issues that has hindered the development of biological sequestration offsets in developing nations 13

than fossil fuels particularly coal therefore use of renewable energy sources would avoid emissions that would have been genera ted by fossil fuel combustion these avoided emissions could be sold as carbon offsets hi storically renewable energy sourceswind solar biomasshave been more expensive per unit of energy delivered than fossil fuels in most applications 14 sales of renewable energy offsets may provide the financial support to make renewable energy more economically competitive with fossil fuels potential renewable energy offset projects may include constructing wind farms to generate electricity installing solar panels 9 for more on these challenges see crs report rl31432 carbon sequestration in forests by ross w gorte 10 albedo refers to the reflectivity of the earths surface for more on this effect see crs report rl33849 climate change science and policy implications by jane leggett 11 evapotranspiration is the sum of evaporation and transpiration the transpiration aspect of evapotranspiration is essentially evaporation of water from plant leaves for more on this issue see the us geological survey website at httpgawaterusgsgoveduwatercycleevapotranspirationhtml 12

energy offsets may raise concerns of additionality several offset sellers offer renewable energy certificates or credits recs as carbon offsets one rec represents the creation of 1 megawatthour of electricity from renewable energy source recs generally convey the environmental attributes of renewable energy projects and recs may be sold to promote further use of renewable energy however rec does not necessarily equate with carbon offset credible offset must be additional to the status quo recs are not subject to the same standard although some offset sellers closely scrutinize the recs they offer for sale as offsets there is system or standard in place to ensure that recs are additional15 several factors other than co 2 emission reductions may drive the development of renewable energy project although renewable energy has historically been more expensive higher fossil fuel prices and tax incentives16 have made renewable energy more competitive in recent years moreover many states have enacted or are developing renewable portfolio standards rps an rps requires that certain amount or percentage of electricity is generated from renewable energy resources twentyeight states have impl emented or are developing some type of rps17 although some sellers will not issue recs that were counted towards an rps it is uncertain whether all sellers follow this protocol18 these factors complicate the determination of additionality regarding renewable energy offsets projects particularly offsets based only on recs

generally require financial investment these capital investments may pay off in the long run but may be unprofitable in the shortterm particularly for small businesses or in developing nations examples of possible energy efficiency offset projects include upgrading to more efficient appliances or machines supporting construction of more energy efficient buildings replacing incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs energy efficiency improvements are sometimes described as regrets policy because the improvements would likely provide net benefits eg cost savings regardless of their impact on other concerns climate change or energy independence thus the issue of additionality may be particular concern for energy efficiency offsets for example in some cases it may be difficult to discern if the improvements would have been made regardless of the offset market 15 anja kollmuss and benjamin bowell voluntary offsets for airtravel carbon emissions evaluations and

efficiency offsets energy efficiency improvements may occur at different location than the actual reduction in emissions for example business that runs its operations with purchased electricity will use less electricity if energy efficiency improvements are made but the actual emission reductions will be seen at power plant this may create doublecounting situation although the federal government has not set mandatory ghg emission reduction several states and local governments have enacted limits 19 if the state counts the emission reductions at the electricity plant towards its goal while the business sells the offsets the reductions will be counted twice20 g20g142g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g16g152g151g556g5g17

generally controlled through law or regulation these sourcesprimarily agricultural industrial and waste management facilitiesemit nonco 2 ghgs as byproducts during normal operations in many cases the individual sources emit relatively small volumes of gases but there are large number of individual sources worldwid in addition these nonco 2 gases emitted have greater global warming potentials gwp than carbon dioxide21 offset projects in this category could provide funding for emission control technology to capture these ghg emissions examples of emission capture opportunities include methane ch 4 emissions from landfills livestock operations or coal mines gwp 25 nitrous oxide n 2o emissions from agricultural operations or specific industrial processes gwp 298 hydrofluorocarbon hfc emissions from specific industrial processes such as hfc23 emissions from production of hcfc22 gwp of 14800 sulfur hexafluoride sf 6 from specific industrial activities such as manufacturing of semiconductors gwp 22800 this offset category is relatively broad as it can involve many different industrial activities as such there are offset types in this category that are generally considered high quality and others that have generated some controversy for example methane capture and destruction through flaring from landfills or coal mines has reputation as high quality offset these projects are relatively easy to measure and verify and in many cases would not have occurred if not for the offset market offsets involving abatement of hfc23 emissions from production of hcfc22 primarily used as refrigerant have spurred controversy22 although offsets from hfc23 abatement are 19 see crs report rl33812 climate change action by states to address greenhouse gas emissions by jonathan l ramseur 20 one way to address this potential dilemma is to restrict energy efficiency projects to only those that reduce or avoid onsite combustion of fossil fuels 21 gwp is an index of how much ghg may by its potency and quantity contribute to global warming over period of time typically 100 years gwps are used to compare gass potency relative to carbon dioxide which has gwp of 1 for example methanes gwp is 25 and is thus more potent ghg than carbon dioxide by factor of 25 the gwps listed in this report are from intergovernmental panel on climate change 2007 climate change 2007

the kyoto protocol or other emission reduction obligations the concerns highlighted by this offset type could apply to the voluntary market as well23 of the offset types certified through the kyoto protocols clean development mechanism cdm hfc23 offsets represent the greatest percentage 50 of the certified emission reductions cers24 have come from hfc23 projects before the formation of the carbon offset market facilities in the developing world which produce about half of all hcfc22 vented the byproduct hfc23 to the atmosphere25 with the carbon market in play facilities can generate offsets by capturing the hfc23 emissions controversy has arisen because the hcfc22 production facilities can potentially earn more money from the offsets destroying hfc23 emissions than from selling the primary material hcfc2226 this creates the perverse incentive to produce artificially high amounts of product in order to generate the more lucrative byproduct g21g158g153g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g138g155g146g157g162g561 this issue is perhaps more relevant within the context of mandatory ghg reduction program but it may have an analogous application in vo luntary offset market th kyoto protocol states that emissions credits or carbon offsets must be supplemental to domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified emission limitations and reduction commitments emphasis added 27 proponents of supplementarity argue that carbon offsets are means of escaping or postponing real reductions this concept could also apply in the context of voluntary ghg reduction advocates of supplementarity may argue that if parties individuals or companies want to achieve carbon neutrality parties should focus primarily on reducing their own emissiongenerating actionseg travel vehicle choice size of home or office etcinstead of looking to counterbalance the emissions from lifestyle choices through the purchase of offsets 28 continued see the united nations environment programme unep riso centre cdm pipeline data at httpcdmpipelineorg indexhtm 23 moreover hfc23 offsets may be in the voluntary market there is system or registry in place to track the exchanges in the voluntary market 24 regulated facilities can use cers to meet compliance re quirements under kyoto or the european unions emission trading scheme 25 by comparison major producers in the developed world continue to voluntarily capture and destroy hfc23 see michael wara 2006 measuring the clean development mechanisms performance and potential working paper 56 stanford center for environmental science and policy 26 this calculus depends on the market price for carbon offsets see michael wara 2006 measuring the clean development mec hanisms performance and potential working paper 56 stanford center for environmental science and policy 27 article 17 kyoto protocol 28 taking this argument step further some have compared carbon offsets to indulgences that were sold during medieval times ie purchasing offsets helps to assuage the guilt associated with carbonintensive activities or lifestyles see eg kevin smith 2007 the carbon neutral myth carbon trade watch at

offsets to individuals or groups in the international voluntary carbon market the quality of the offsets may vary considerably largely because there are commonly accepted standards some offset sellers offer offsets that comply with standards that are generally regarded as the most stringent eg the clean development mechanism29 or the gold standard30 these standards generally have robust test for additionality as well as more substantial monitoring and verification procedures as such offsets meeting these standards incur higher transaction costs adding to the cost per ton of carbon some offset sellers offer offsets that meet the sellers selfestablished guidelines these self established protocols can vary considerably raising questions of integrity are the protocols addressing additionality concerns are the offsets accounted in such way as to avoid doublecounting are the offset projects verified by independent third parties assessing the standards can be challenging for consumer moreover some companys standards are not made public but may be considered proprietary information 31 two recent studies have examined approximately 30 companies andor groups that sell carbon offsets on the voluntary market32 the following list highlights findings from the analyses the prices for carbon offsets range between 5 and 25 per ton of carbon offset prices show correlation with offset quality overhead costs can vary substantially by seller however this factor may not be good indicator of offset quality33 the tax status of seller profit firm vs nonprofit group was not good indicator of offset quality arguably the most significant finding of the two studies is the general correlation between offset price and offset quality this correlation is more striking considering the range of offset prices 5 to 25 per ton of carbon reduced 29 the clean development mechanism cdm was developed under the kyoto protocol projects are assessed on an individual basis and must be approved by an executive board an independent thirdparty verifies the projects emission reductions for more information s ee httpunfcccintkyoto_protocolitems2830 30 the gold standard was developed by group of nongovernmental organizations the gold standard sets requirements beyond the cdm but only applies to renewable and energy efficiency projects see httpwwwcdmgoldstandardorg 31 for example one report found it difficult to evaluate certain offset marketers because the offset certification and verification process was deemed proprietary see anja kollmuss and benjamin bowell 2007 voluntary offsets

2007 farm bill both the housepassed bill hr 2419 hrept 110256 and the senate agriculture committeeapproved bill number forthcoming versions include provisions that would facilitate the development of privatesector market based approaches for range of environmental goods and services eg water and air quality carbon storage habitat protection etc involving the agriculture and forestry sectors the house version would among other things establish an environmental services standards board chaired by the us department of agriculture usda that would provid grants and framework to develop consistent standards and processes for quantifying offsets from the farm and forestry sectors the senate version differs in approach but also directs usda to develop framework to develop standards and procedures however the senate bill requires the initial focus to be on carbon markets 34 hr 823 welch introduced february 5 2007 this bill would authorize federal agencies to purchase offsets or renewable energy credits and direct the department of energy to certify whether the offsets are eligible based on rules developed by the department g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g156g561 carbon offset purchases are intended to generate emission reductions that would not have occurred otherwise in terms of global climate change mitigation an emission reduction avoidance or sequestration is beneficial regardless of where or how it occurs for example ton of carbon reduced at power plant will have th same atmospheric effect as ton of carbon reduced avoided or sequestered through an offset project the core issue for carbon offset projects is do they actually offset emissions generated elsewhere if the credibility of the voluntary offsets is uncertain claims of carbon neutrality may lack merit evidence suggests that not all offset projects are of equal quality because they are developed through range of standards although some standards are considered stringent others are less so in some cases the standards used are not even made available to the purchaser due to the lack of common standards some observers have referred to the current voluntary market as the wild west this does not suggest that all carbon offsets are low quality but that the consumer is forced to adopt buyerbeware mentality when purchasing carbon offsets this places the responsibility on consumers to judge the quality of carbon offsets the voluntary carbon offset market raises several issues that congress may consider the viabilityboth actual and perceivedof the offset market may influence future policy decisions regarding climate change for instance some people are concerned that the range in the quality of voluntary market offsets may damage the overall credibility of carbon offsets 35 if this occurs it 34 for more on this aspect of the legislation see crs report rl34042 environmental services markets farm bill proposals by renee johnson 35 see trexler mark and kosloff laura 2006 selling

include offsets as an option in mandatory reduction program this is an important policy question for congress although some oppose the use of offsets based on supplementarity concerns see discussion
