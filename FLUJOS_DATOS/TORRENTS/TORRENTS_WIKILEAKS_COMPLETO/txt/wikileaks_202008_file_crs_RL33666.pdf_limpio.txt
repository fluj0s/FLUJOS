economy entered recessi on by september 2002 the standard and poors 500 index had fallen by nearly half fro m its peak in hindsight it is clear that some of the appreciation in stock prices in the 1990s was caused by bubble rise in price that cannot be attributed to unde rlying economic fundamentals but is instead caused by irrational exuberance around the same time that the stock ma rket boom

have declined preci pitously in august 2007 problems with subprime mortgages led to widespread financ ial turmoil this has led some analysts to conclude that s imilar asset bubble has infected the housing market these experiences have led some critics to question the federal reserves feds policy of nonintervention towa rd bubbles if bubbles reflect harmful economic imbalances they argue then the proper policy response is to raise interest rates to neutralize them this proposal faces two main drawbacks first bubbles cannot be accurately identified and their magnitude cannot be estimated until after the fact theory suggests that the fed would be able to accurately identify bubbles only if it knew more than the thousands of professionals participating in those markets who believed high prices to be ju stified second aggressi vely raising interest rates to counteract bubble risks instigatin g the very recession that critics ostensibly wish to avoid the relative shallowness and brevity of the 2001 recession is seen as evidence in favor of handsoff policy response to bubble fed chairman ben bernanke has argued that the fed should respond to bubble only insofar as it causes inflation or growth to rise above sustainable levels but need not be concerned about eliminating bubble fo r its own sake bubbles lead to higher investment in the affected industry and consumption spending by making households feel wealthier according to bernankes philosophy the fed could raise interest rates in response to bubble if th is spending increase were inflationary assuming bernankes philosophy were corr ect the issue of whether the fed has responded to bubbles aggressive ly enough in practice to prevent them from igniting inflationary pressures remains the fe d waited until 1999 to raise interest rates during the stock market boom and cut rates in 2007 in response to financial turmoil both of these episodes have been marked by rising inflation and if increases in house prices were recorded in the owneroccupi ed shelter portion of the consumer price index recorded inflation would be even higher today critics also argue that the feds passive approach to growing bubble is

oversight duties an analysis of regulatory options is beyond the scope of this report 10 an investor would sell the market short by borrowing the asset from one party and selling it to third party when the loan came due the price of the asset would have fallen back to its fundamental value and the investor could pay back the loan at profit there are two shortcomings to this argument in reality first investors face credit constraints and if bubbles remained for long periods of time in vestors might not be able to borrow for long enough to profit second under the uptick rule short lling of security is prohibited when the price of that security is falling on the nyse and amex sec rule 10a1 this rule does not preclude short selling as the bubble is growing however 11 for recent defense of efficient markets theory see burton malkiel the efficient continuedthe fed be able to accurately identify bubble this debate is important to congress in order to effectively exercise its oversight duties for the federal reserve9 what is bubble economic theory suggests that in competitive market price is determined by supply and demand and equals the marginal cost of producing the good market is said to be competitive when there are many buyers and sellers who are perfectly informed and rational prices can be easily altered and there are barriers to entry bubble is said to occur when price doe s not equal marginal cost standard economic theory called efficient markets theory strongly concludes that bubbles cannot occur in competitive markets because any time price exceeds marginal cost producers will increase their supply thereb pushing price back down to marginal cost at first glance few markets seem to better fit the perfect competition criteria than the markets for equities and homes there are millions of buyers and sellers an enormous number of transactions ta ke place informati on abounds professional analysts closely evaluate ma rket trends prices adjust rapidly and so on few goods markets meet these criteria equity prices are based on the present di scounted value of future dividends and price appreciation obviously it is extrem ely difficult to accurately forecast these values into the distant future and this would seem to suggest that bubbles could form still standard theory rules out bubbl developing based solely on uncertainty for two reasons first theory predicts that systematic errors will not be made by market participants overall in other words optimistic and pessimistic prediction errors should on average nearly cancel out most participants should not systematically overestimate future prices as bubble implies second standard theory does not necessarily require all market participants to be equally smart or sensible but it predicts that less skilled pa rticipants will eventually be driven out of the market because they regularly lose money in transactions with more skilled participants in other words analysts who recognize the existence of bubble should be able to profit from it by selling stocks shor t and in the process of short selling the bubble should be deflated10 this possibility seems to rule out large and protracted bubble similar to the one that developed in the 1990s11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33666crs5 11 continued market hypothesis and its critics journal of economic perspectives vol 17 1 winter 2003 12 see ivo welch

economist timothy cogley demonstrates that small modifications to economic fundamentals lead to large changes in fundament prices for example if economic growth increased from 2 to 3 annually equity pri ces would rise 284 if the spread between stocks and bonds fell from 8 percentage point s the average since 1926 to 5 percentage points the average since 1966 equity prices would rise 110 timothy

national bureau of economic research working paper 8077 january 2001so why would these markets suffer from bubbles economists who accept that bubbles do occur in reality argue that peopl are not always as rational as theory predicts psychological behavior such as herd mentality12 overconfidence animal spirits as coined by john maynard keynes and biased selfattribution taking credit for ones success and blaming others for ones failure may trump logic at times13 people seem to have tendency to project past results forward into the future with little regard for whether funda mentals would justify such an assumption onetime improvement in fundamentals should be matched with one time increase in prices in which case there is reason to think that future appreciation rates will match recent ra tes and yet the longer that high returns persist the more certain people become that those returns will persist in the future and the larger the bubble becomes in his classic study kindleberger argued that bubble often emerges after legitimate shift in fundamentals that warrants some increase in asset prices14 in the case of equity prices in the 1990s fundame ntal changes such as the acceleration in productivity growth reduction in inflation increased appetite for risk strength and duration of that economic ex pansion and so on merited some legitimate increase in stock prices in hindsight it is clear that these fundamental changes did not justify the full increase in stock prices that actually occurred yet at the time financial professionals justified the price rise s by using optimistic assumptions about fundamentals within standard models15 most famously in 1999 two economists released book entitled dow 36000 which argued that stock prices had not yet risen nearly high enough based on fundamentals16 these explanations may have been highly unlikely but they were not impossibl therefore finding the dividing line at the time between the legitimate price increase and the bubble was impossiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33666crs6 17 for efforts to identify bubbles empirically see refet s gurkaynak econometric tests of asset price bubbles taking stock federal reserve board of governors finance and continuedsimilar fundamental explanations can be found for why house prices have risen in recent years lower mortgage rates reduced borrowing costs dramatically innovations in mortgage markets reduced liquidity constraints eg down payments have fallen and access to credit has rise n following the stock market crash individuals perceived homes as relatively more desirable investments and lower inflation reduced the relative upfront costs of mortgage still there is limit to how far price increases can be justified by these explanations for example the only change to have occurred from 2003 to 2006 is greater prevalence of nontraditional mortgages which some see as sympto m of bubble yet prices increased more than 50 in that time and builders shoul d respond to higher demand by increasing the housing stock which would push prices back down although this factor is limited in areas where land is limited just as todays stock prices should reflect future dividends and apprecia tion todays home prices shoul d reflect the future costs and benefits of ownership costs of ownership include maintenance and borrowing costs benefits include forgone rent pa yments and tax deductions any increase in prices should reflect change in these costs and benefits or else it is caused by bubble w ith extreme enough assumptions about say future rental savings or mortgage rates nearly any increase in housing prices can be justified so it is impossible to currently identify housing bubble with any certainty the housing market differs from an ideal competitive market in one important way supply responds to price changes with lag and in some areas is constrained by lack of open land this means that ri and even subsequent decline in price in the housing market is more ambiguous than in the stock market it could be fundamentals at work greater demand cause s prices to rise which increases supply with lag the housing market may also be further from the competitive ideal than the stock market because there is short selling there are high transaction prices the profit motive is not the only motivation for buying and most buyers and sellers have little expertise expecting the average buyer to be able to make complex calculations about future pa rameters may be unrealistic on the other hand it is easier to project homes future price than companys future earnings because the projection is based on tangible asset while people will not readily switch from ownership to rental housing ultimately co mparison of ownership costs to rents will influence peoples decisions at the margin s and should therefore not move too far apart discussions of housing bubble should be co gnizant of the fact that there is national housing market pri ce patterns vary widely acro ss different regions while prices in some regions have risen much mo re rapidly than the national average other regions have seen little real appreciation in the recent boom thus if there is housing bubble it is series of calized bubbles not nationwide bubble the failure of economic theory to accura tely predict bubbles does not mean that bubbles do not exist or theory is useless what it does suggest is that it would be very hard for policymakers to accurate ly predict bubble until after the fact17 forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33666crs7

governor points out that the bull equity markets of the 1950s and 1980s were about as strong as the 1920s and 1990s markets based on price appreciation alone there is way to tell until after the fact that the former two would keep rising in price while the latter two would turn out to be bubbles18 what effect does bubble have on the economy effects on investment consumption and gdp asset price bubbles do not have any di rect effect on gross domestic product gdp because gdp measures the current production of goods and services while bubble represents change in the price of an existing asset bubbles indirectly affect the economy because economic agents alter their behavior in response to the change in the price signal for example when corporations stock price rises it may respond by increasing its physical capital investment spending higher than it otherwise would have19 likewise when housing pr ices rise developers may respond by increasing the housing stock more than the market can profitably support in the long run as shown in figure 3 the responsiveness of investment spending to price changes can clearly be seen in the data when equity prices were rising non residential physical capita l investment spending increased from 763 billion in 1995 to 1232 billion in 2000 following the stock market crash in 2000 investment spending declined to 1072 billion in 2002 both the rise in equity prices and investment spending were heavily concentrated in the hightech sector of the economy during the boom and equity pri ces and investment spending fell disproportionately in that sector after the crash investment spending on information processing ip equipment and software grew more than 15 each year from 1995 to 2000 similarly residentia l investment housing cons truction boomed in recent years in tandem with house prices rising from 449 billion in 2001 to 597 billion in 2005 as the housing boom ended it then fell to 570 billion in 2006 all data are adjusted for

of economic analysis note ip equipment and software is sub component of nonresidential investment this suggests that bubbles may cause allocation of resources that leads to inefficiencies in the economy for example the dotcom bubble of the 1990s probably led to too much inve stment spending by hightech companies relative to the rest of the economy some of these inve stments probably never generated output that justified their cost yet in the aggregate this misallocation did not seem particularly costly to the economy since the dotcom s ector was too small to singlehandedly have large effect on the overall economy howe ver japan arguably provides an example where the misallocation problem was more costly for the overall economy and contributed to persistent economic stagnation after the bubble burst more debatably economists have also proposed that aggregate spending will be affected by wealth effect when asset prices rise and fall20 according to this logic when asset prices rise asset holde rs would use some of their newfound wealth to boost their consumption spending eval uating the importance of the wealth effect is difficult because asset prices and cons umption are not exogenous for example rapid gdp growth or lower interest rate s would cause both to rise simultaneously some of what is popularly identified as wealth effect such as mortgage refinancing should more pr operly be considered the st andard results of monetary easing furthermore attributing wealth effect to housing is problematic because an increase in the price of existing housing makes the seller richer while simultaneously making the buy er equally poorer income that the buyer could have used on other goods must instead be voted to financing the purchase of

reserve lender of last resort by marc labontehouse21 in any case the size of the wealth effect relative to overall economic activity is likely to be modest because the life cycle theory predicts that spending from an increase in wealth would be spread equally across ones lifetime for example federal reserve economist calculated that assuming marginal propensity to consume from wealth of 004 an estimate w ithin the standard range the stock market decline from 2000 to 2002 would reduce gdp growth by 036 percentage points as the author point s out this estimate is small enough to be indistinguishable from normal fluctuations in economic activity22 i n f c t consumption grew far more rapidly than overall gdp during the recent stock market decline23 from policymakers perspective the fortunes of partic ular industry may matter less than the overall economys ability to generate full employment the importance of bubbles therefore will depe nd largely on how damaging they are to the economys overall health if the ec onomy can shrug off bursting bubble and continue to smoothly expand then prev enting bubbles would probably not be policy priority alternativel if bubbles lead to recessi ons or financial crises when they burst then policymakers have st rong incentive to stop bubbles before they start bubble could lead to diffi culties in the financial system if it caused large firm or number of firms holding the assets which are declining in value to experience insolvency or illiquidity24 financial firms are in terdependent and if the troubled firm is unable to honor its obliga tions trouble could spill over to other firms with which it had dealings if the probl em became serious and widespread enough it could prevent the smooth functioning of financial intermediation causing non financial firms difficulty in financing th eir own operations thereby feeding through to the general economy crisis in the banking sector is what made the great depression so longlasting

although the fed was able to restor overall liquidity relatively quickly it is too early to tell at this date if the liquidity crunch will have any broader and lasting damage for the fina ncial system or the economy27 the most famous and arguably misunde rstood bubble in us history occurred in 1929 when the stock market crash coincided with the onset of the great depression while the stock market crash may have helped instigate that economic contraction the consensus among economists is that the bubble had little to do with the depth or duration of the depressi on instead most ec onomists blame the contraction in the money supply which in turn led to widespread bank failures for the depressions severity28 likewise japans economic stagnation in the 1990s may have started with the bursting of equity and property bubbles29 but most economists attribute its unusual persistence to tight monetary policy problems in the banking sector and structural rigidities in the overall economy these experiences suggest that policymakers reaction to bubble is as important as the bubble itself in influencing economic activity30 by contrast two more recent experiences suggest that bubbles

although those occurred near the end of the recession the increase in oil prices and the unusually lengthy dur ation of the expansion which presumably could not last forever the nation has never experienced hous ing bubble before in the post world war ii period nominal prices have never fallen significantly prices fell in the early 1980s when adjusted for inflation but not nominally the decline was probably caused by the recession and sharp increase in mortgage rates and not as result of bubble therefore it is difficult to j udge how severe an effect on the economy bursting housing bubble could have since house prices are still rising according to the hpi it is too soon to draw any conclusi ons about the current situation there are historical examples of sharp declines in local housing prices in california new england and texas all three of thes episodes took place during serious economic contractions31 it is difficult to say however whether these price declines caused economic difficulties or we re merely the result of economic difficulties for example the texas episode is attributed to the sharp decline in energy prices in the mid1980s there are histori cal examples of when housin g prices have stalled and in these cases residential investment spe nding has fallen sharply by cumulative 41 from 1980 to 1982 and 24 from 1988 to 1991 presumably the bursting of housing bubble could result in even larg er declines resi dential investment accounts for too small share of gdp to cau recession singlehandedly however for example it accounted for an average of 04 percentage points of gdp growth from 2003 to 2005 and reduced gdp growth by 03 percentage points in 2006 for recession to occur decline in resi dential investment would need to be accompanied by broader financial distress it remains to be seen if the turmoil of august 2007 will be long lasting or si gnificant wealth effect on consumption effects on inflation just as bubbles have direct effect on output bubbles are also not measured in inflation because inflation is defined as the change in price of goods and services not existing assets in the late 1990s some analysts argued that measures like the consumer price index cpi or the gdp deflator undermeasured inflation because equity prices were not included in their definition of inflation this argument is incorrect these measures by definition are meant to cap ture changes in the prices of goods and services not assets change in equity prices is change in paper wealth with direct effect on the pri ce of goods and services it may change households purchasing power but this will re gister in measured inflation as soon as the household increases its consumption in response if individuals change their consumption slowly in response to rising asset prices then changes in asset prices may be good predictor of future inflation in the goods market32 but in practice ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33666crs12 32 continued of

would not affect infl ation versus expected infl ation and it is unclear why expected future inflation would be manifested in asset prices but not more traditional measures such as surveys or inflation indexed treasury bonds thus the consensus among economists is that asset price increases may be one of many useful predictor of future inflation but should not be incl uded in measurements of actual inflation33 although the argument to include asset pr ices in inflation is theoretically weak for equity prices it is on much stronger ground when applied to housing prices conceptually house is not seen as consumption good but rather as physical asset that generates stream of consumption services called shelter in fact shelter is one of the biggest expenditures in the basket of goods and services measured by the cpi owneroccupied shelter accounts for 23 of the cpi basket34 thus it would stand to reason that an increase in house prices would therefore be registered in the cpi as rise in the cost of shelter but as measured in the cpi the rise in house prices has had effect on the cost of shelter35 that is because the cpi records the cost of owneroccupied shelter as the rent that the owner could get for his house if he rented it out since this ca nnot be measured directly it is imputed in the cpi from similar rental proper ties for that reason it is referred to as the rental equivalence method of measur ing shelter inflation in the absence of bubble the cost of owneroccupied shelter and rental properties should be qual since houses fundamental price is equal to the presen t discounted value of the future opportunity cost of renting but if bubble were pres ent then by definition the cost of owner occupied shelter has diverged from the cost of rental properties this suggests that when bubble is present more direct measure of hous ing costs would yield more accurate measure of inflation36 there is an alternative approach to meas uring the cost of owneroccupied shelter called the usercost method which measur the direct costs of providing the shelter instead of the cost of foregone re nt associated with the house from 1950 to 1983 shelter was measured in the cpi us ing similar method if bubble werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33666crs13 37 increases in house prices due to quality impr ovements should not be included in measure of inflation therefore the calculations in figure 4 are based on census constant quality house price index 38 of course many homeowners have fixedinte rest mortgages that would not change when mortgage rates change this would reduce the overall inflationary effects of change in mortgage rates using user cost methodpresent inflation would rise under the use rcost method and not th rental equivalent method for most homeowners the primary cost of housing is mortgage costs of course lower mortgage rates in recent years have reduced borrowing costs at the same time that higher house prices have ra ised borrowing costs any alternative measure of owneroccupied shelter inflati on would need to take both into account while not true usercos t measure of inflation figure 4 compares the bls rental equivalence measurement of inflati on to measure of inflation based on the mortgage cost which is the single largest determinant of user costs for constant quality house37 when measured by mortgage costs shelter inflation rose faster than 5 per year in 1999 2000 nd 2004 to 2006 all years when house prices and mortgage rates both rose38 perhaps surprisingly shelter costs experienced deflation from 2001 to 2003 despite rapidly rising hous ing prices because of falling mortgage rates by contrast the measure of shelter costs used in the cpi has shown little fluctuation in recent years never exceeding 41 in fact even as inflation surged by the mortgage cost measure shelter inflation declined to 24 in 2004 and 2005 source bls crs calculations based on data from census bureau note mortgage

for economic policy and research june 2000as can be seen in the figure the majo r drawback to usercost method is the extreme volatility in price changes that it generates this volatility occurs because small changes in interest rates lead to large changes in mortgage payments the bureau of labor statistics prefers using the rental equivalence measure in the cpi because it is less volatile

suggests that the economy may currently be experiencing infl ationary pressures that are not being recorded in the cpi what should the federal reserve do about bubbles policy response as bubble inflates congress has mandated that the federal reserve maintain full employment and low and stable price inflation39 the fed has discretion to develop whatever strategy it sees fit to accomplish these goals one important reason for not giving the fed longer or more detailed list of goals to accomplish is that the fed has only one tool available to fulfill its mandate its ability to alter shortterm interest rates it can therefore pursue only one goal at time so giving it more goals would dilute its ability to accomplish any particular goal for that reason shift toward using monetary policy to eliminate asset bubbles would be justified only if it was goal whose importance was on par with the exis ting mandated goals or if it could help better accomplish the existing mandate as stock prices rose more and more rapi dly in the late 1990s amidst the general climate of exuberance there was growing chorus of critics calling for the fed to step in and raise interest rates high enough to pric k the bubble before it got any bigger40 higher interest rates increase firms borrowing costs and reduce its profitability which should all else equal reduce the firm s market value they argued that the larger the bubble was allowe d to get the more damaging it would be to the economy when it eventually burst the feds response was far more cautious wait and see what effect the potential bubble has on the economy and then respondhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33666crs15 41 it is demonstrated statistically that the fed did not respond to asset price movements outside of any effect

chadha et monetary policy rules asset prices and exchange rates international monetary fund staff papers vol 51 3 2004 that paper finds that in cluding asset prices as an explanatory variable improves

of monetary policy to the stock market quarterly journal of economics vol 118 p 639 based on empirical data the authors estimate that 5 increase in stock prices led to 014 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate they argue that this is consistent with policy of the fed responding to stock price increases only to the extent that they influence aggregate spending 42 testimony of chairman greenspan before the joint economic committee us congress june 17 1999 43 one justification for the discrepancy might be that the inflating of the bubble was gradual but the deflating was sudden sudden changes in equity prices are more likely to affect overall economic activity than gradual changes 44 alan greenspan economic volatility speech at symposium sponsored by the federal reserve bank of kansas city jackson hole wyoming august 30 2002to any changes in economic activity41 thenchairman alan greenspan testified in 1999 that monetary policy is best primarily focused on stability of the general level of prices of goods and services as the most credible means to achieve sustainable economic growth should volatile asset pri ces cause problems policy is probably best positioned to address the consequences when the economy is working from base of stable product prices42 critics argued that this strategy was da ngerous in their eyes the bubble was clear indication of where the economy was headed toward cycle of overheating followed by contraction and the fed should have responded preemptively to prevent it they argued that fed policy amounted to waiting to act until it was already too late after the stock market began declining in 2000 they questioned the discrepancy between the feds eagerness to cut interest rates sharply at that point compared to its passivity when stocks were rising fearing this asymmetry in response encourages investors recklessness43 yet perhaps the weakest point in the critics argument is that any attemp t to prick the bubble risks instigating the very recession that the critics argue the bubble will cause in greenspans words it was far from obvious that bubbles even if identified early could be preempted short of the central bank inducing substantial contraction in economic activity the very outcome we would be seeking to avoid44 the current fed chairman ben berna nkes philosophy on bubbles has closely followed greenspans in 2002 speech he argued if we could accurately and painlessly rid asset markets of bubbles of course we would want to do so but as practical matter this is easier said than donehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33666crs16 45 ben bernanke asset price bubbles and monetary policy speech before the national association of business economic s new york ny october 15 2002 46 ben bernanke and mark gertler monetary policy and asset price volatility federal reserve bank of kansas city economic review 1999 fourth quarter p 17 47 this view which is echoed in his 2002 speech is at odds with bernankes statement that the fed cannot identify bubbles with much certainty since the fed cannot respond to bubbles inflationary effects unl ess it can identify the bubble 48 perhaps the most unrealistic aspect of th eir model is the assumption that private individuals foresee that the fed will stamp out the inflationary effects of the bubble which allows the fed to do so with very little actual in crease in interest ra tes this assumption leads to much more benign outcome than if the fed did raise rates sharply to cancel out the bubbles inflationary effects it seems leap of faith to assume that investors are forward looking enough to anticipate the fed s reaction so precisely but are not forward looking enough to prevent the bubble from emerging in the first place 49 economist john taylor goes further and uses econometric simulations to argue that if the fed had responded more vigorously to inflationary pressures from 2002 to 2006 the housing bubble could have been avoided john taylor housing and monetary policy working paper presented at federal reserve bank of kansas city symposium september 2007particularly if we intend to use moneta ry policy as the instrument for two main reasons first the fed cannot reliably identify bubbles in asset prices second even if it could identify bubbles monetary policy is far too blunt tool for effective use against them45 these views are fleshed out in 1999 paper by bernanke then an academic economist and economist mark gertler that demonstrated an asset bubbles effect on theoretical model of the economy that validated the feds strategy at the time46 the authors show that in the presence of bubble inflation and employment stay closer to their desired levels in the model when the fed targeted inflation which they argue was close to actual fed policy than when it targeted the bubble they do not argue that monetary policy should remain unchanged in the presence of an asset bubble rather they argue interest rates should respond to the bubble only insofar as the bubble affects inflationary pressures 47 once its inflationary effects were negated the fed should allow the bubble to remain48 this argument was important because it offered rebuttal to cr itics of the fed that claimed the fed was carelessly ignoring the equity bubbles effects on the economy whether this strategy worked as well in reality as it did in theory is an open question but it helps clarify two distinct criticisms of fed policy at the time and perhaps today one line of criticism would acknowledge that the feds use of policy to negate the bubbles effect on inflation and employment was the correct strategy but underestimated the bubbles effect nd therefore did not respond vigorously enough in the 1990s or today49 for discussion see the text box in that light if bubble were good predictor of future inflation targ eting it could be justified since monetary policy affects inflation with lag the other line of criticism would argue that bubbles are undesirable nd the economy cannot be thought to be operating on sustainable path until they are eliminated in this view eliminating bubbles would be legitima policy goal in and of itself since bubble is incompatible with economic stabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33666crs17 how has the fed responded to potential bubbles to date as discussed above the current fed ch airman and his predecessor take the position that the fed will alter policy in re sponse to bubble only to the extent that the bubble affects inflationary pressures or employment this raises the question of how aggressively the fed believes it should act to achieve that policy and whether it has been aggressive enough critics believe the fe d has responded too weakly when bubbles have arisen in the late 1990s the fed kept the fe deral funds rate flat until 1998 when it was reduced by 075 percentage points in response to concerns about financial stability resulting from the russian debt default and insolvency of the hedge fund long term capital management the fe d did not raise rates until 1999 at which point rates were increased by 175 percenta ge points over the next year at best it could be argued that the fed belate dly responded to the equity bubble beginning in 1999 however inflation was rising in 1999 and exceeded 3 in 2000 as measured by the consumer price index cp i and the unemployment rate had fallen below 4 for the first time since the 1960s so it is possible that these rate increases were carried out without an consideration of equity prices fed governors and regional presidents expressed c oncern about financial bubble many times in the transcripts fro m the federal open market committee fomc meetings between 1996 and 1999 fe d officials were more candid in the transcripts about their certainty bu bble existed than they were in public statements in fact their internal forecast in november 1997 projected 20 decline in stock prices in 1998 and ye t monetary policy was not tightened until 1999 for example as early as decem ber 19 1995 chairman greenspan stated that the real danger is that we are at the edge of bond and stock bubble that is the reason why if we are perceived to be easing policy it is conceivable that we could foster further problems in that regard in spite of those fears the fed decided to reduce interest rates by 025 percentage points at that meeting in the current decade the federal funds rate steadily rose from 1 in 2004 to 525 in june 2006 again it is difficult to say to what extent these rate increases were motivated by concern about po tential housing bubble in june 2005 congressional testimony chairman green span said although bubble in home prices for the nation as whole does not ppear likely there do appear to be at minimum signs of froth in some local markets where home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels most of the rate increases were merely removing the stimulus previously put in place in response to the 2001 recession moving current policy back to more neutral leve l adjusted for inflation the federal funds rate is still not particularly high at present based on standard measures of monetary policy and inflation has shown clear rising pattern since 2003 exceeding 3 since 2005 as measured by the cpi so tightening may be motivated by traditional concerns without reference to house prices in september 2007 the fed reduced rates in response to the liquidity crunch spurred by subprime mortgage problems that began in the previous month it remains to be seen whether the rate cut helps or hinders housing market adjustment transcripts of the fomc meetings are released with five year lag so it will be some time before it is known how concerned the

argues that the negative effect on growth would be even smaller if the fed reacted more aggressivelyfed economist glenn rudebusch poses the latter view in terms of tradeoff between better longterm outcomes since the bubble would not be allowed to grow larger until it burst on its own at the co st of worse shortte rm economic outcomes since growth would temporarily be reduced by the effort to eliminate the bubble he believes legitimate case can be made for the tradeoff but only if it meets three strong tests which he argues ar unlikely to be met in practice50 first rudebusch says policymakers must be able to accurately identify bubbles before they burst while it may seem obvi ous after the fact that an equity bubble existed in the late 1990s as greenspan put it at the time bubbles generally are perceptible only after the fact to spot bubble in advance requires judgment that hundreds of thousa nds of informed investors have it all wrong betting against markets is usually precarious at best51 if the fed had acted on the assumption th at there was bubble it would have been going against the expert opinion of many if not most financial market professionals at the time this would have been problematic for the fed both analytically and politically since shareholders are unlikely to be happy that the fed is pursuing policy of reducing their wealth the certainty in identifying bubble makes policy response potentially costly if the fe d guesses correctly that there is bubble and responds then economic out comes could improve but if it guesses incorrectly output andor inflation would be more volatile than they otherwise would have been second the fed must be unable to readily mitigate the damage done after the bubble bursts according to rudebusch in ot her words if lower interest rates can quickly bring the economy back to full em ployment after bubble has burst as was the case in 2001 then there is nothing to be gained by using monetary policy to eliminate the bubble before the fact for example fed governor mishkin uses the feds macroeconomic simulati on model to show that 20 decline in house prices can be offset by lowering interest rates by 075 percentage points so that gdp growth falls by only 05 percentage points at the peak year52 on the other hand if the bursting of the bubble were to lead to fina ncial crisis or credit crunch that

rates do not reduce stock prices enough to eliminate bubble ben bernanke monetary policy and the stock market some empirical results speech at widener university pennsylvania october 2 2003significant disruption the economy pre emptive action could be advantageous53 it could also be advantageous if the bubble causes resources to be misallocated across sectors of the economy since monetary policy is too blunt to be aimed at specific sectors the importance of avoiding recession depends largely on how important one believes the misallocation problem to be there are those who follow the maxim of andrew mellon treasury secretary at the onset of the depression liquidate labor liquidate stocks liquidate the farmers liquidate real estate it will purge the rottenness out of the system54 in their eyes misallocated resources are the problem and recessions can be useful cure in this case bubbles should be stamped out regardless of the costs in contrast mainstream macroeconomic policymaking sees recessions as the chief problem and is re latively indifferent bout the misallocation of resources finally rudebusch says preemptive monetary tightening must be an effective means of deflating the bubble to be warrant ed greenspan doubted this would be the case nothing short of sharp increase in shor tterm interest rates that engenders significant economic retrenchment is fficient to check nascent bubble the notion that welltimed incremental tig htening could have been calibrated to prevent the late 1990s bubble is almost surely an illusion55 in other words the irrational exuberan ce driving the bubble was unlikely to be quelled by small rise in interest rates only large increase in rates he claimed would affect bubble and such an increase would be highly likely to cause recession asset prices might also be unrespons ive to shortterm interest rate changes if they do not feed through to longterm in terest rate changes which the fed does not control for example the fed incr eased shortterm rates from 11 to 32 between 2003 and 2005 but 10year treasury rates only rose from 4 to 43 and mortgage rates from 57 to 59 over th at time if bubble were unresponsive to interest rate hikes or the reduction in gdp growth from such hikes was greater than would occur when the bubble burst then there would be advantage to pre emptive policy another drawback to us ing monetary policy to

british central bank appeared to reverse its stance by providing financial markets with significant liquidity 58 the moral hazard argument should not be ov erstated investors will only be bailed out in instances when their losses correspond with responses by the fed and plenty of investors still experienced losses during financial turmoil despite the feds actions targeted to specific regions and regi ons without bubble would share in the contractionary effects of higher interest rates policy response after bubble has burst as discussed above the fe ds belief that monetary policy can be effectively used to counteract the damage done by flating bubble is central to its position that it need not interfere with growing bubbl whenever financial markets have dropped sharply during chairman greenspan s or bernankes tenure including episodes in 1987 1998 2001 2007 the fed has responded by reducing interest rates in the eyes of many economists the 2001 and 2007 declines were the result of bursting asset bubbles in chairman bernankes words it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy56 in other words sharp decline in financial markets may result in decline in economic growth and in orde r to maintain stable economic growth the fed must offset the financial decline by cutting interest rates or adding liquidity to financial markets nevertheless critics argue that there is an asymmetry between the feds laissez faire approach to inflating asse t bubbles and its interventiona ry approach to deflating bubbles further they argue that the asy mmetry has an important effect on investor behavior because it increases moral hazard the economic term for the idea that people take greater risks when they are insured against adverse outcomes in this case in the words of the head of britains central bank the provision of such liquidity support undermines the efficient pricing of risk by providing expost insurance for risky behavior that encourages excessive risktaking and sows the seeds of future crisis57 these critics argue that more efficient investment decisions would be made in the long run if the fed allowed financial dow nturns to run their course and imprudent investors took losses58 the feds alacrity when prices fall could even make future bubble larger than it otherwise would be si nce the feds actions reduce the payoff tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33666crs21 investors betting against bubble thereby in terfering with the markets tendency for selfcorrection the drawback to the moral hazard critique is that allowing financial turmoil to run its course could run c ounter to the feds longrun goal of maintaining economic stability if turmoil were to lead to r ecession not only would overly risky investors take losses but so would efficient firm s that saw demand for their products drop solely because of the cyclical downturn some would argue that liquidity has characteristics of positive externality whose benefits to society exceed the benefits to private firms who provide it if so enough liquidity can be provided only through government intervention in this case by the fed although the positive externality argume nt is generally consistent with mainstream economic thought it and the moral hazard critique are not mutually exclusive traditionally government programs that create moral hazard are complemented by government regulations to reduce risky behavior for example deposit insurance creates the incentive for ba nks to take on excessive risk so bank regulations restrict the amount of risk that banks are allowe d to take if moral hazard really is being created by the fed there may not currently be corresponding regulations to offset the extra risk it generates conclusion bubbles are difficult to identify with c onfidence until after the fact this limits the ability of policymakers to respond to bubbl effectively nevertheless their effect on the economy has been demonstrated to be significant enough that there is risk in ignoring them bubbles lead to volatility in investment spending consumption and in the worst case scenari financial instability because the rise in house prices is not captured in the cpi and other inflation measures true inflationary pressures in th economy may have been greater than measured in recent years possibly suggesting that the economy is overheating critics have argued that the fed shoul d act more aggressively to counteract bubbles when they form the fed has re sponded that such policy would detract from its mandated goals to keep inflation and economic growth stable the greatest drawback of the critics argument is that aggressively raising interest rates to counteract bubble risks instigating the very recession that they ostensibly wish to avoid the fed claims that it will respond to bubbles insofar as they affect economic growth or inflation but case can be made that the fed has underestimated the effect of bubbles on the overall economy and infla tion and growth have been less stable than desired as result looking at the hi storical record there is strong evidence that the fed has followed its stated policy th at it would not purposely eliminate bubbles at most it has tightened policy slightly more than would be justified by inflation and output alone when possible bubbl have formed but it cer tainly cannot be ruled out that the interest rate path the fed has pur sued would have been exactly the same in the absence of any potential bubble since th fed is not explicit about how differenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33666crs22 factors are weighted in its decisionmaking process there is way to settle this argument definitively the fed did not raise interest rates in the face of unusually rapid increases in stock prices until 1999 the sharp fall in stock prices in 2000 would seem to vindicate the feds critics at first glance but the fed could also argue the experience proved its policy to be correct the 2001 recession was one of the mildest and briefest declines in output since world war ii although it did not look nearly as mild from the perspective of the job market efforts to deflate the bubble earlier may very well have resulted in recession of equal or greater magnitude besides slow recovery in capital investme nt spending the economy showed few lasting scars from the stock market crash by 2003 capital investment spending had fully rebounded as well and although bubble seems to ve formed at some point it does not seem to have been as large in hindsight as critics had predicted for example at its trough the sp 500 was still 10 higher than it wa s when greenspan made his irrational exuberance speech thus although policy in tervention may have been justified at some point it was probably not nearly as early as critics had demanded had the critics policy been pursued some of the rapid output gains of the last few years of the 1990s expansion could have been lost the burden of proof remains with critics that policy of deflating bubbles would meet rudebuschs th ree tests accurate identification improved macroeconomic stability and effective deflation part of the feds rationale for not in terfering when bubbles are forming is its belief that expansionary monetary po licy can be used to avoid any serious ramifications from bursting bubble althoug h this has been true in the past it is still too soon to tell how well this stra tegy worked in august 2007 critics argue that the asymmetry in its response creates moral hazard problem since investors believe that the fed will bail out mark ets when bubble crash they have the incentive to take larger risks perhaps ev resulting in larger bubbles than would otherwise have formed
