different elements depending upon whether the offense involves killing or attempted killing 18 usc 1512a1 or some other use of physical force or threat 18 usc 1512a2 in essence it condemns the use of violence to prevent witness from testifying or producing evidence for an investigation and sets its penalties according to whether the obstructive violence was homicide an assault or threat

section 371 is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years and conviction requires the government to prove the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the scheme by one of the conspirators subsection 1512k has specific overt act element and the courts have generally declined to imply one under such circumstances regardless of which section is invoked conspirators are criminally liable under the pinkerton doctrine for any crime committed in the foreseeable furtherance of the conspiracy accomplices to violation of subsection 1512a may incur criminal liability by operation of 18 usc 2 3 4 or 373 as well section 2 treats accomplices before the fact as principals that is it declares that those who command procure or aid and abet in the commission of federal crime by another are to be sentenced as if they committed the offense themselves 1 as general rule in order to aid and abet another to commit crime it is necessary that defendant in some way associate himself with the venture that he partic ipate in it as in something he wishes to bring about that he seek by his action to make it succeed it is also necessary to prove that someone else committed the underlying offense section 3 outlaws acting as an accessory after the fact which occurs when one knowing that an offense has been committed receives relieves comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder his or her apprehension trial or punishment prosecution requires the commission of an underlying federal crime by someone else offenders face sentences set at one half of the sentence attached to the underlying offense or if the underlying offense is punishable by life imprisonment or death by imprisonment for not more than 15 years and fine of not more than 250000 the elements of

underlying offense but imprisonment for not more than 20 years if the solicited crime of violence is punishable by death or imprisonment for life subsection 1512a violation opens up the prospect of prosecution for other crimes for which violation of subsection 1512a may serve as an element the federal money laundering and racketeering statutes are perhaps the most prominent examples of these the racketeering statutes rico outlaw acquiring or conducting the affairs of an interstate enterprise through pattern of predicate offenses section 1512 offenses are rico predicat offenses rico violations

been written and constructed with such sweep that they cover among other things obstruction of government activities by corruption they reach any scheme to obstruct the lawful functioning in the judicial legislative or executive branch of government that involves 1 the deprivation of money property or honest services and 2 the use of the mail or wire communications as an integral part of scheme congress expanded the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes with the passage of 18 usc 1346 which defines the scheme to defraud element in the fraud statutes to include scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services some courts have said that honest services fraud in the public sector typically occurs in either of two situations 1 bribery where public official was paid for particular decision or action or 2 failure to disclose conflict of interest resulting in personal gain prosecutors may favor mail or wire fraud charge over or in addition to bribery charge if for the reason than that under both fraud sections offenders face imprisonment for not more than 20 years rather than the 15year maximum found in section 201
