the arguments over how closely the programs payments to the individual states should match the amount of federal highway taxes each states highway users pay to the highway account of the highway trust fund htf referred to as the donordonee state issue it has reemerged dur ing the debate over the reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs tea21 transportation equity act for the 21st century pl 105178 during the 108th congress conferees failed to reach an agreement on reauthorization hr 3550 donordonee issues however are expected to be readdressed when reauthorization legislation is reintroduced in the first session of the 109th congress donor states are states w hose highway users are estimated to pay more to the htf than they receive don ee states receive more than they pay the basic donor state argument is relatively straightforward call for equity or fairness donor state advocates generally contend that for too ma ny years they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infra structure especially the older highway infrastructure in the northeast some of the donor state advocates argue that the federal role should be redu ced and that the federalai d highway program should be streamlined or eliminated and the federa l highway administration fhwa should become primarily conduit for block grants to the states donee state advocates argu that fairness should not be separated from needs they assert that the age of their highway infrastructure especially in the northeast the high cost of working on heavily congested urban roads and the limited financial resources in large sparsely populated wester n states justify their donee status they also argue that there are needs that are inherently federal rather than state and that national highway network ca nnot be based solely on st ate or regional boundaries number of interest groups and stat departments of transportation have proposed that reauthorization should in crease the minimum guarantee to 95 and expand the guarantee to cover all federa laid highway programs this may be difficult to achieve in tight budget environment the minimum guarantee program is already the largest federal highway program the federal highway administrations donor donee figures indicate that for fy2001 all 50 states were donee states nd for fy2002 49 states were donee states this increased concerns over the comparability of the state payment calculations and the state receipt pportionments plus allocations calculations for the donordonee state concept to be statistically valid the total state payments and overall receipts should be equal this does not mean th at concerns over distribution equity are unimportant but that the ratios underpinning the debate may at times have more to do with the gap between overall revenues and distributions than donor losses and donee gains also the use of noncurrent data may skew the donordonee ratios and lead to conclusions about donor

few federalaid highway program issues have raised as much heated debate as the persistent argument s over how closely program payments to the individual states should match the amount of federal highway taxes each state pays into the highway account of the highway trust fund htf1 the issue is commonly referred to as the donordonee state issue donor stat is usually defined as state whose highway users pay more in estimated federal highway tax revenue to the htf than that states department of transportation receives from the federal government in federalaid highway funds donee st ate receives more federal aid highway funds than its highway users pa to the htf in general donor states would like to get higher return on th eir taxes paid while donee states oppose having their funding shares reduced on the surface closing the donordonee divide would appear to simply require mathematical adjustment to equalize the return on taxes paid under the surface however the donordonee divide is the result of complex interaction of highway program fo rmulas discretionary program spending equity adjustments differing regional needs national needs the impact of the business cycle on revenues and spending as well as the overarching issue of determining the appropr iate federal role in funding federalaid system highways the overall issue for congress is how to structure and maintain federalaid highway program that meets federal highwa policy objectives secondarily is the question of whether the federalaid high way program provides or should provide as equitable as possible return to the states on each tax dollar the states highway users pay into the highway account of the htf this report begins with general back ground discussion as well as legislative history of the issue with emphasis on the donordonee controve rsy during the two most recent surface transportation reauthorization debates the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 istea pl 102240 and

finally the report examines some of the issues that in the past have constraine d efforts to increase donor state federal aid distributions to bring them more in ba lance with state revenue contributions during the 109th congress both the house nd the senate passed surface transportation reauthorization bills hr 3 and hr 3 as amended in the senate that included provisions designed to

of this writing the bills are under consideration in the committee of conference this report however is not legislative tracking document for the minimum guaranteeequity provisions in these bills3 background there are number of characteristics of the federalaid highway program that need to be kept in mind during discu ssion of the donordonee question first the federalaid highway program is really an umbrella term for all the highway programs administered by the federal highway administration fhwa most of these programs can be described as being either formula apportioned programs which constitute the vast ma jority of program funding or the smaller discretionary allocated programs the formula pr ograms apportion funds to the state departments of tran sportation based on formulas t forth in legislation the discretionary programs are programs nominally under the control of the fhwa that were designed to provide funds to proj ects chosen through competition with other projects in recent years however most of the discretionary program funding has been earmarked by congress the distinction between formula and disc retionary programs becomes especially significant in the process of attempting to make equity adjustments in the funding levels among the states for example how can all discretionary programs be constructed to guarantee designated percent return to states on their payments to the htf and still remain discretionary the programs were created to fulfill perceived policy needs the separate program budget accounts were authorized based at least in part on the amounts of money each prog ram needs to meet its program goals determined in part by the budget constraint s of the time rather than by basing the distribution on estimates of the revenue pa id by highway users in the individual states the definition of donor and donee states is c ontroversial in part the use of the terminology donor and donee itself leads to interpretation problems charges often in newspaper opinion columns by state offici als or by constructi on interests that states congressional dele gation has failed to secure the states fair share if the state receives less than 100 return on its highway tax contributions are common during highway program reauthorization the fair share at the 100 return level is problematic for number of reasons first if all states got 100 there would not be enough funds left to administer the programs second some highway needs such as roads on federal lands border crossing infrastructure trade corridors and interstate system maintenance havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31735crs3 inherently federal aspects that would lik ely not be addressed if the federalaid highway programs were predicated on 100 return to all states even advocates of devolution of much of the federa laid highway program to the states have acknowledged some federal n eeds third donor states themselves have in the past recognized the need for some states to get an increased share during the istea reauthorization debate for example donor states agreed that large sparsely populated states and some small states such as rhode island vermont and delaware should get increased shares four th many of the donee states with what appear to be unusually high shares are stat with small progra ms in relative dollar terms and bringing them down to 100 would not free up enough funds to significantly increase the donor state share as whole some argue that the minimum guarantee percentage currently 905 coul d be more accurate benchmark for fair share nearly all the debate over donordonee i ssues is based on statistics drawn from table fe221 in the annual fhwa publication highway statistics the use of this tables statistics as the basis of donor donee arguments is problematic this is because the minimum guarantee is based on the most recent year data available for contributions to the htf usually two ear lag while distributions apportionments and allocations are determined at the beginning of each fiscal year this brings into question the comparability of fe221s pay ments into the fund statistics and its apportionments and allocations from the fund statistics that are used to determine the share ratios for example the fy 2003 table compares on dollar indollar out basis fy2003 contributions into the fund to fy2003 appor tionments and allocations as will be discussed later the tea21 905 minimum guaranteed rate of return for fy2003 is calculated based on fy2001 payments to the htf this means that in years of rising highway tax collections the two year lag in contribution statistics pulls some states below the minimum guaran tee level of 905 this can give the impression that the minimum guarantee is not working effectively when it actually is the use of noncurrent data may skew the donordonee ratios and lead to conclusions about donor or donee st atus that may be unwarranted under tea21 this most recent year data available statistical dilemma on the contributions side has been complicated further on the spending side by the revenue aligned budget authority raba distribut ions that are base d on historical and future estimates of revenues rather than current year actual revenues this led to large gap between the estimated total contributions of the 50 states to the htf and the actual distributions apportionments nd allocations from the htf for the donordonee state concept to be valid statis tically the total estimated state payments to the htf should equal the to tal state receipts from the htf donordonee issues have become fundame ntal part of the policy debate over federal highway funding over the last 20 year s with interest in the issue generally surfacing in the context of the broader bate during the periodic reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs this legislative context is important because it means that any equity adjustment provisions must fit with the overall compromises that create r eauthorization bill that can pass both houses of congress and gain executive branch approvalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31735crs4 4 staa also established the mass transit ac count of the htf but did not make it subject to the minimum guarantee the donordonee discussion is limited to the highway account of the htf and does not take into considera tion federal mass transit funding which is also paid for by federal fuel taxes but is deposited into separate account although typically donee states in the northeast are more tran sit dependent some highway donor states get significant federal transit funding while so donee states especially the large pass through western states get relatively littlelegislative history although some would argue that the s eeds of the donordonee controversy were sown with the enactment of the federal aid highway act of 1956 title ii of which established the highway trust fund htf case can be made that it was the first publication of table fe221 in the 1972 edition of the fhwas annual highway statistics that fed concerns about the state fair share issue that persist to this day table 221 comparison of estimated state payments into and receipts from the highway trust fund and fede ralaid apportionments published for each state in sidebyside format presented not only the state payments to and receipts from the htf but also the ratio of aggregate paym ents to aggregate receipts for 1957 through june 30 1973 the receipt of federal aid fo r each dollar paid to the highway trust fund varied greatly from state to state alaska appeared to fare best and north carolina worst at 834 and 052 respectively during the 1970s significant construction was still being done on the interstate highway system but the degree of effort required varied significantly from state to state this may have in the minds of some provided reasonabl justification for the disparity among state returns on each user tax dollar of revenue states pa id into the htf by the early 1980s however the interstate system was nearin g completion at the same time general perception that us roads and bridges d deteriorated coincided with growing support for increased spending on transportation infrastructure in part as an economic stimulus measure surface transportation assi stance act of 1982 staa staa pl 94424 authorized significan t increase in funding for the federal aid highway system for the years fy1983fy1986 and included provision designed to mitigate the dissatisfaction of donor states by providing that each state would receive minimum allocation from the core fhwa programs4 specifically the bill ordered the fhwa to allocate among the states sufficient funds to assure that each states total apportionments from th core highway and safety programs interstate highway substitution primary secondary inters tate urban bridge replacement and rehab ilitation hazard elimina tion and railhighway crossings and section 203 of the highway sa fety act of 1973 would not be less than 85 of the percentage of estimated tax pa yments each state paid into the highway account of the htf these equity adjustment allocations could be obligated to the core highway programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31735crs5 surface transportation and iform relocation assistance act of 1987 sturaa sturaa pl 10017 authorized the federalaid highway program for fy198719 91 retaining the 85 minimum allocation but altering the basis of its calculation the act revise d the calculation to include the allocated sometimes referred to as discretionary programs w ith the exception of federal lands programs and safety programs for fy1987 and fy 1988 emergency relief f unds and interstate construction discretionary f unds were not included in th calculation the act made permanent the minimum allocation provision established by staa with the exception of the changes in the treatment of the minimum guarantees the formulas for allocation of funds under staa and sturaa remained the same minor changes were made in the criteria fo r awarding discretionary program grants emergency relief and federal lands highways grants continued to be distributed on projectbyproject and n eeds basis respectively intermodal surface transporta tion efficiency act of 1991 istea istea pl 102240 reauthorized surf ace transportation programs including federalaid highway programs for fy 1992fy1997 making major changes in the overall program structure program fo rmulas minimum allocation and other provisions that could impact the state dono rdonee ratios to great extent the changes were an outgrowth of the fact th at the remaining unfinished portions of the interstate system would be completed under istea the act also enunciated broader vision of the mission of federal highway programs to include air quality alternative transportation nd historic preservation istea retained the three formula programs that provided funding for the interstate system interstate construction interstate maintenance and interstate highway substitution as well as the bridge replacement and rehabilitation program the other formula programs such as the primary system seconda ry system urban system and urban transportation planning were replaced by the national highway system program the surface transportation program and the congestion mitigation and air quality program the distribution criteria for projects under the discretionary programs remained the same except that the interstate construction program renamed the interstate discretionary program was changed to be at the discretion of the us department of tran sportation usdot and the inte rstate 4r program funds were now setaside within the new national highway system program equity adjustment provisions istea included five provisions with separate funding designed to assure more equitable di stribution of federal funds to the states the 90

be received that year by each state under the donor state bonus starting with the state with the lowest return each state was brought up to the level of the state with the next highest level of return this was repeated successively for each state until the istea authorized program amount was exhausted hold harmless this provision set specific percentage that each state was to receive from the core formula highway programs plus federal lands highway programs minimum allocation donor state bonus and interstate reimbursement each state received an addition to its regula r apportionments to raise its total to the set percentage reimbursement for interstate segments istea authorized 2 billion for fy1996 and fy1997 to reimburse each state for the costs to them of building segments of the interstate system without federal assistance prior to or during the early days of the inters tate construc tion program despite these provisions significant gaps remained among states on their share return on contributions to the htf as reauthorization of istea approached dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of the equity provisions led to challenges to the istea program paradigm transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 the reauthorization debate that pr eceded passage of tea21 pl 105178 included wide range of views on the donor donee state issue and is worth reviewing because all the major underlying argument s that had over time emerged reemerged during the tea21 debate significant ch aracteristics of the debate included greater primarily regional role and virtually role for pa rty affiliation also in play were different philosophies of the appropriate role of th federal government visa vis the states differing view s of whether the completion of the interstate highway system should trigger reduction in fede ral involvement in highway construction how national highway needs criteria can fit returnonthetaxdollar view and the influence of large increase in gas tax revenue to the htf on program structure regional conflict over funding under istea southern and mid western states made up most donor states wh ile northeastern paci fic rim and large sparsely populated western states made up most of the donee states in general donee states were satisfied with the distribution under istea and supported the istea works legislation that in genera l adhered to the istea funding formulas most of the donor states joined step 21 coalition whose centerpiece proposal was guarantee that each state receive at least 95 return on its estimated contribution to the highway account of the htf the dominance of regional differences over party affiliation was reflected on the senate committee on environment and public works where the republican committee leadershiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31735crs7 supported the donee friendly istea work s bill while republican colleague sponsored the streamlined transportation efficiency program for the 21st century step 21 which included the 95 cents on th dollar guarantee as well as program formula changes supported by donor states donor state arguments the basic donor argument is relatively straightforward call for equity or fairness donor state advocates generally contend that they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infrastructure especially the older highwa infrastructure in the northeast the southern donor states have been fastgro wth areas relative to many of the donee states and argue that their needs are just as great or greater secondary argument for some of these states is that they ar generally more depe ndent on roads and do not benefit from federal transit spending to the degree that some donee states in particular new york do fi nally some of the donor state advocates argue that with the completion of the interstate highwa system the rationale for the donordonee disparity in federal highway funding is so weakened that the federalaid highway programs could be strea mlined or eliminated and th fhwa should be little more than conduit for block grants to the states donee state arguments donee state advocates generally argue that fairness should not be separa ted from needs donee stat argue that their position as donees is justifiable because of the age of their infrastructure especially in the northeast the high cost of working on ready heavily congested urban roads and the limited financial resources in large sparsely populated western states donee state advocates have also argued that wh all federal progra ms are considered not just the federalaid highway program northeastern states are often donors while southern states are often donee states donee state s upporters also argued that southern and midwestern states spend less of their state and locally derived resources on highways than the donee states and chide the donor states for pleading for federal funds when they are not willing to up their own resources finally donee states argue that it is unreasonable to expect fhwa to become little more than tax collector for the states they argue that there are needs that are federal rather than state and that national highway ne twork cannot be based on state or regional boundaries devolution what most observers considered more radical approach was the transportation empowerment act sponsored by senator connie mack of florida and representative john kasich of ohio th is bill would have devolved much of the federal highway program role to the states only program for maintaining the interstate system and federal lands highwa ys would have remain ed federal four year phase out of 12 cents of the federa l gas tax would have corresponded with the declining federal role stat would have had the option of replacing the declining federal taxes with gas tax increases of th eir own states would then have had the freedom to spend or not spend on their ow n roads as they saw fit although this proposal garnered some s upport from advocates of reduced federal role in government it did not obtain broad support fro m many governors state legislatures or state departments of tr ansportation many of whom were wary of the political implications of pushing large replacement gas tax increases through their state legislatures and at the same time keep ing these funds programmed for highwayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31735crs8 5 pl 105178 sec 1104 also 23 usc sec 105 6 tea21 authorizes such sums as ma be necessary for fy1998fy2003 for mgtea21 equity provision changes the equity

available during tea21s lifetime by shifting in 1997 revenues generated by the 43 cent deficit reduction gas tax to the htf congress was able to provide for large increases in highway funding for all states the extra money made the donordonee debate less urgent to the donor states as the a21 authorization nears its expiration fy2003 however the donordonee state issue has resurfaced federal highway user taxes the highway account of the htf is s upported by revenue from combination of variety of fuel taxes as well as taxe s on heavy tires truck nd trailer taxes and heavy vehicle use tax revenues from the fuel taxes are also distributed to the mass transit account and the leaking u nderground storage tank trust fund part of the tax on gasohol is paid to the genera l fund of the treasury all tire truck and trailer and heavy vehicle use ta xes go to the highway account because the federal taxes on fuel are collected at the first point of distribution at the terminal rack rather than at the retail level most of the revenue is collected from small number of corporations located in relatively small number of states to determine how much of the revenue should be credited to highway use in each state the fhwa has to make estimates based on state fuel use and fuel tax data because tax treatment of fuel sales varies from state to state and often from federal tax treatment as well this is complex pro cess for example the fees on tires heavy vehicle use heavy truck and trailers sales are attributed to states based on states special fuels usage although the ba sic methodology is considered sound the estimates are not an exact repli cation of sales in each state10 statistical caveats in most years the revenues from the ta xes that support the htf have increased however combination of the impact of september 11 2001 on travel and the recession has for the moment caused veling off of revenues the use of non current data ie revenue estimates from two years prior may skew the state donor donee ratios and lead to conclusions about donor or donee status that are unwarranted this and fluc tuations of total annual payments into the htf and total annual apportionments and llocations from the htf mean that the apportionment and allocation to tax payments ratio for the states as displayed in highway statistics table fe221 will sometimes s how final share for some states below 905 this does not always indicate that the minimum guarantee has been unfulfilledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31735crs11 it is also important to keep in nd that table fe221 provides same year

spending ie the guarantee was in effect 905 guarantee of 94 of the total federalaid highway program fy2001 the year of the vanishing donor states the statistical problems with the comp arative tables relied upon to identify which states are donors and which are donees were brought to prominence by the release of the highway statistics 2001 version of table fe221 according to the table all 50 states and the district of columbia were donees during fy2001 this should be statistically impossible the assumption underlying the donordonee debate is that contributions ie st ate payments and state receipts ie apportionments and allocations distributed to the states for each year are roughly similar because revenues for fy2001 were lower than expected while total distributions including revenue aligned b udget authority calculations were several billion dollars higher all states ratios were pulled up bove 10 this pattern was nearly replicated in fy2002 for fy2002 49 states had ratios above 10 and one state california had 099 this does not necessarily mean that concerns over distribution equity are unfounded just the opposite may be the case rather the statistical ratios underpinning the debate may have more to do with the gap between overall revenues and pa yments than tradeoff between donor losses and donee gains preliminary data for fy2003 indicate th at 17 states had return under 10 the gap between the estimated total state payments to the htf and total actual apportionments and allocations which occu rred in fy2001 was not the first such time statistical problem has occurred it was however the only year in the tables for the most recent ten years that all 50 states and the district of columbia had ratio over 10 49 states were donees in fy2002 figure 1 shows the changes from year to year of total state contributions to the htf and total receipts apportionments and allocations from the fund what is important is that they differ virtually every year this brings into question the use of table fe221 ratios as currently computed as means of determining donordonee status in fy1994 only one state ratio fell below 10 it was year somewhat similar to fy2001 in that revenues fell while apportionments and allocations from the htf remained high in fy2002 contributions increased slightly while recei pts from the htf fell slightly but the gap between the two

purposes of the reauthorization debate is significant imp rovement over the year ly tables it does not eliminate the statistical problems created by comparing two year old and current data or the gaps between overall contri butions versus overall receipts fixing this problem could be difficult delaying the apportionment and allocation data until the state shares are calculated ie apportionments and allocations would also be based on data from two fiscal years earlier would almost certainly be opposed by many states on possible change that might narrow the fluctuations of the differences between estimated contributions to the htf and receipts would be to add revenue adjustment factor to bring the contributionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31735crs13 12 this would not deal with the year shif ting of budget authority that can occur under rabas look forwardl ook back estimates estimates closer to current ear revenue levels for exam ple national fuel tax receipt data totals are available much earlier from the treasury department than the state data computed by fhwa using this know n total to create weighted adjustment factor could adjust fhwa calculated state contribution shares to reflect the more current known totals although this would be adding an estimated adjustment factor on to other estimated data ie earlier year state share totals it would probably be more representative of the same year data needed to make more accurate donordonee ratios12 the minimum guarantee and total program size as mentioned in the earlier discu ssion of tea21 the minimum guarantee determines the total highwa program size the method of calculating the total program size necessary to provide the final adjusted state shares can lead to counterintuitive results for example in some situations in creased tax revenues could inadvertently reduce the size of the minimum guarantee apportionment necessary to provide the state shares re quired and thereby reduce the total program size only fhwa however has the expe rtise and data bases to determine the outcome of any proposed tax increases or minimum guarantee program changes reasons why contributions to the htf vary from year to year there can be significant fluctuations in the total tax revenue state is credited for paying into the htf there are number of reasons individually or in combination that have led to increases or decreases in the reve nues that states pay to the htf from year to year federal tax rate changes the federal tax revenues into the htf on gallon of gasoline and diesel fuel were raised by tax chan ges in 1983 5 cen ts

blend another 25 cents is distributed to the general fund economic conditions the revenue stream generated by ll the federal highway taxes grows or contracts with the growth or contracti on of the

on were increasing somewhat as subs titute for the controversial additive mtbe this has had an impact on htf revenue beginning in fy2001 some of the impact of business cycles is difficult to quantify because of the timing of tax increases in the 1980s nd 1990s which pushed up revenues the recession of 2001 had major impact on the re venues paid to the htf nearly 35 billion less revenue was paid to the ht f in fy2001 at the same time total apportionments and allocations to the states increased over 46 b illion reflecting the fy2001 revenue aligned budget authority incr ease in combination this led to situation where all 50 states received more from the htf than they paid in for fy2001 all 50 states were donee states for fy2002 although the gap between contributions from and receipts to the states contracted somewhat 49 states and the district of columbia remained donee states13 eventually however when economic growth increases total payments from the states will rise relative to apportionments and allocations as the contributionreceipt gap narrows the number of states in the donor category can be expected to increase fuel tax evasion changes in enforcement of fuel tax evasion can have an impact on the level of revenue collected according to fhwa th farther down the di stribution chain that gas taxes are collected the greater the problem of gas tax evasion14 this has caused some states to move their collection up to the first level of distribution ie to the terminal rack as is done by the us tr easury when such change occurs it can cause an increase in revenues credited to the state making the change the wholesale level is less prone to tax evasion than the retail level but is more prone to tax evasion than the terminal rack record keeping according to fhwa in some states the quality of record keeping can vary from one reporting period to another for inst ance delays in reporting by the state can mean that one reporting period can lead to low estimate in one year and high estimate in the next states that collect their data at the retail level may be more vulnerable to this kind of record keeping problems all of the elements discussed above can affect the

structure of the nimum guarantee varied in staa istea and tea21 as did the range of programs covered by the guarantees interact with each other also it is impor tant to understand that changes in one

as result of congressi onal earmark as mentioned earlier the raba adjustments can also have majo r impact on apportionments and allocations fair is foul and foul is fair the elusive resolution of the donordonee issue the persistence of the donordonee debate as part of the reauthorization of federalaid highway program is reflecti on of the differing views and expressed needs of the many stakeholders in fede ral highway spending policy and the genuine difficulty in addressing these differences although the basic endgame is who gets the money the wide differences over what constitutes equitable distribution or what degree of federal involvement is bad or good for the nation as whole or the states in particular has to date consistently led to comp romise reauthorization bills donor state coalitions as result have faced nd continue to face both political and practical barriers to raising the donor state shares for more information on equity guarantee issues and options see crs report rl32409 highway program equity guarantee issues raising the minimum guarantee since staa1982 set the mg at 85 it s been raised twice to 90 under istea and to 905 under tea21 howeve r the closer the mg approaches 100 the more difficult increasing the mg becomes16 under tea21 the mg includes base share percentage for each state similar to the hold harmless percentages under istea to achieve over the life of six year reauthorization minimum guarantee of 95 as has been proposed unless the base per centages of the donee states were reduced could re quire much higher total program level to allow for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31735crs16 17 this assumes that the scope of programs under the mg continues to cover most programsmg distribution donee states will almost certainly resist any attempt to eliminate or significantly reduce their base shares ironically assuming the money were available donor states might actually get mo re money in absolute terms by leaving the base shares as they are and accept as they did in tea21 the benefits of larger mg apportionment major change such as raising the 905 share to 95 would probably require that legislators start with that percentage and work back through all the federalaid programs goals and formulas to make them conform to the new guarantee even so achieving the 95 level on dollarin do llarout basis could be difficult the 15 administrative takedown the 1 for tropolitan planning organizations and the roughly 2 or more that generally go to the federal lands highways program the program that least lends itself to equitable distribution across all 50 states leaves any 95 equity mechanism with little room to maneuver17 some propose bringing these programs and activities under the minimum guarantee umbrella as well this however exacerbates the diffi culties of developing statistical and administrative paradigm that could successfully distribute this combination of discretionary program and ad ministrative funds among the states and still fulfill their statutory program purposes in entering this debate states will need to decide if their goal is to increase their st ates total federal funding or closing the donordonee gap either expanding the minimum guarantee to include the allocated discretionary programs or establishing second minimum guarantee to cover these programs has been proposed by some states that ve traditionally been donor states as mentioned earlier the impact of these changes on either the total program level or on individual state funding is difficult to pred ict only fhwa has the expertise and data bases to dete rmine the impact of these proposals another strategy donor states could atte mpt would be to focus on raising the base percentages in favor of the donor states coupled with either modest or change in the 905 minimum guarantee even with increased availability of funding the likelihood of getting enough donee states to accept smaller shares and support such program change would be low federal highway discretionary programs and federal needs another issue with raising the minimum guarantee is how to fund the discretionary programs because the minimum guarantee distributions are apportioned to the core formula programs the larger the minimum guarantee the less revenue is available to fund discretionary programs such as federal lands highway programs and the corridors and borders pr ograms over the last few years the discretionary program funding has been largely earmarked during the annual us department of transportati on appropriations process these programs are very popular as sources of earmarks which are outside the control of the state departments of transportation eliminating or substantially reducing these programs to allow for higher minimum guarantee percentage could therefore be difficult forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31735crs17 those who favor the availability of discretionary programs for congressional earmarking related issue is the view that certain program goals are inherently federal generally included are fede ral support for border crossing infrastructure trade corridors and roads that cross or serve federal lands even if the federally administered discretionary prog rams could be restricted to only those programs that serve clearly federal needs there would be limits to how far the minimum guarantee could be raised in addition should these federal needs programs be eliminated significantly reduced or turned over to the states the reduced federal role this implies could be viewed as strengthening the argument for the devolution of the federalaid highway programs and the taxes that support them to the states as mentioned earlier most states are wary of raising state taxes to replace reduction in taxes at the federal levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31735crs18 818283848586878889909192939495969798990123020040060080010001200 contributions receiptssource fhwafigure 2 ohio contributions to and

both payments and apportionments and allocations increased somewhat and ohio remained donee state according to preliminary data for fy2003 ohio again became donor state its rate of return dropped to 090 according to fhwa the quality of the estimates of highway user tax revenues paid by users in each state is poorer the farther back in time the estimates go with the increased importance of the estimate s under istea and especially under tea21 accuracy of the estimates has improved ho wever as previously discussed because federal fuel taxes are imposed at the point of distribution rather than at the point of sale the estimates of fede ral revenue derived from fuel use in each state is extrapolated from data on state fuel taxes table 1 below sets forth for the fi scal year s 1981 to
