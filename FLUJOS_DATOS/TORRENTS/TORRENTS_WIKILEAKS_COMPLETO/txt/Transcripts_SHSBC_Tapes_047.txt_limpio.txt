shsbc 47 ptps unknownnesses lecture given on 22 august 1961 okay whats the date audience 22nd its the 22nd by george it is twentysecond of august 1961 i fooled you that time there is date on this watch and its always accurate i just never read it pretty hard to keep up with galactic time earth time greenwich time australian time just as if there are lot of times well im surprised frankly that you had courage enough to come to the lecture today i thought you would probably not come what i told you the other day for once in my life im right as matter of fact astounding campbell ran whole editorial one time on the fact how damnably right i was and that was what was wrong with unfortunately i am right the reason the australian course took long long time to get people going on goals assessments the reason nobody got their goal in washington on the washington course and the difficulty which has been entertained here are all under the heading of rudiments out goal vanishes if the rudiments are out the goal vanishes now this is the way it is and it is worked out with this particular unit at this time i am very sorry to say that person after person after person the goal has been there for weeks and weeks and weeks smothered by an outrudiment so it was just the rudiments were out that was all and that happened to the goal and the goal does occur in the first 150 goals pc gives you and the terminals should occur in the first couple of hundred terminals and that is the way it is the mystery is solved and i want to thank the people here at saint hill for bearing with because i have kept my cottonpicking paws off of you and maybe this has slowed down your case gains but its speeded up scientology and i will now let you in on something the fact that i have not been doing goals assessments on you because i could do goals assessments and it proved absolutely nothing and if it depended on to do goals assessment on everybody on earth who will be cleared from this time henceforward pretty grim huh and interested in boats too so look it over that doesnt make sense so what ive had to do here is suffer agonizingly and watch this go on and on and on because i couldnt figure out what was happening you see i wasnt at all sure i wasnt at all sure that we had not encountered another phenomenon and the other phenomenon was that goals just kept nulling and person would sooner or later eventually go clear on just nulling goals and i was not at all sure that this couldnt occur and youve proved it conclusively it doesnt occur all right thats very well worth knowing and it i havent been using you for guinea pigs ive been teaching you the best i knew but i at the same time have not gotten myself so involved with cases beyond steadying you up and keeping you on straight line that we failed to find out what was going on with goals assessment so its its green light now the starters gate is open there is reason now why any case matter what condition that case is in cannot be cleared the barrier is only this barrier that the goal or the terminal of the case becomes smothered by outrudiments and the goal disappears off the emeter if the rudiments are too wildly out and so assessment can go on forever an assessment forever does not make clear now thats very well worth knowing so that was the only bug as far as im concerned on the line now with case after case here in just the last few days we have been coming up with the fact that it was goal number two goal number forty and so on and yet weve gone on and assessed just endlessly past this point with appreciable case gain you see now we go back clean the rudiments up very very carefully and what do we find sitting there we find the persons goal answering up live we find the persons terminal answering up live but smothered smothered by an outrudiment so if it took this long to learn this after we had the technology of clearing as of spring of 1961 you see and if it took clear into august to learn this bug id say it was very very profitable to remember that bug so this can happen with an emeter although weve known this for very long time that this could happen with an emeter that reading could disappear off of an emeter because of an outrudiment that was not an unknown phenomenon but it didnt have great importance until we were doing goals assessment and i hadnt connected it directly with this difficulty in goals and its been quite little stunt here trying to find out what did connect up and why but that is the only thing it is it isnt anything else its nothing very spooky and its just the fact that goals assessments take forever when the rudiments are out when the rudiments are in they are rapid the goal of the pc will be found in the first 150 or so goals and the terminal will be found in the first couple of hundred terminals certainly within that wide order of magnitude youll find the goal and the terminal of the pc now when the goal and terminal of the pc is found now why dont we get instant and immediate clearing how can clearing hang up now rudiments out thats all just the rudiments out if case is running and running and running and running and running for long time on the prehav scale and so forth we could have several bugs we could be running on foreshortened prehav scale or something of that sort but thats up to thats not up to you i can give you the best and most now in primary scale and ive already given it to you verbally i havent released it in actual puttogether there could be something buggy about that or this could have occurred and this is apparently the next bug the level looked flat because the rudiments were out so this phenomenon also applies to the running on prehav scale if its flat and level looks flat then you must turn over hell heaven and everything else to make sure the rudiments are completely in and then check the level again for another run and thats the only way to be safe run it another twenty minutes run it twenty minutes to flat then just tear the rudiments to pieces any way shape or form you possibly can with sensitivity at 16 in other words just get them in in in and then run another twenty minutes of the same auditing command got it audience voices mmmhm in other words dont trust flattest until you put the rudiments in take the first as conditional flattener now get the rudiments in and run another twenty minutes so you actually have forty minute test for the end of level on terminal goals terminal follow that seem simple thing to do all right so lets make another little rule of thumb here as we go just as cautionary point when we have gone to 200 goals and we havent gotten the pcs goal we get the rudiments in with sensitivity 16 matter if it takes us sessions to do it we handle those various chronic longduration present time problems we just handle everything we can and go back to the beginning of the first list we made and go over it again and well find the pcs goal every time because were doing it just time after time this is just working out pocketapocketapocketa its just open and shut its just mostly matter now of going over it and everybody who has gone through this routine so far thats over half of this particular unit we found the goal in the first 150 so if you get up to goal number 200 and you havent got the pcs goal although you were sure the whole time that the rudiments are in youre absolutely sure that during this assessment the rudiments are in that fact alone says theyre out that alone says theyre out so youd better start back at the beginning of the thing get those rudiments in with sensitivity 16 just be just niggling nasty about the whole thing get them really in and then go over that goals list again from the beginning and youll find the goal now thats whats throwing it out and thats how we can get it in okay this is quite win for us this is quite win the first clear from this unit was vickie now lot of people had hand in this took too long to get her goal so she had to be stabilized out after she arrived back at joburg she stabilized out and went clear boom there was just nothing to it i mean it was dead easy but there was an awful lot of work went in on this case by members of this unit and by mary sue and so forth making sure of the goal and terminal but we got these little late it was little late in the course when these things finally came so we couldnt complete the run and it took just few hours to stabilize the case after it got home so thats your first clear now the sooner you get the pcs goal and terminal the more time can be devoted to this now youve done lot of work here this summer on the subject of routine 1a problems and rudiments i was trying to get problems arc breaks and that sort of thing prestraightened out now oddly enough that is successful action might not look successful at first glance it might look like wild excursion but it isnt we have to remember that vickie was absolutely flattened on routine 1a before the rest of it took place isnt that interesting all right therefore you can put another little rule of thumb down here this is an interesting tip youve got pc thats arc breaky you can get into this kind of jam how do you clear rudiments with rudiment out ah thats fascinating question isnt it how can you clear rudiments with rudiment out and theres the biggest single problem thats rough problem how do you clear rudiments with rudiment out well ill tell you frankly that you cannot clear an arc break with present time problem in existence and if you make an arc break with the pc while you are running present time problem you have had it you have just about had it the arc break is sufficiently bad that you cant clear the present time problem and because the present time problem is in existence you tell what happens when you try to audit case with present time problem in existence isnt it nochange its nochange isnt it you can audit case twentyfive hours with present time problem in existence and get absolutely graph upgrade of any kind whatsoever the case shows improvement of any kind why present time problem had it pegged well lets look at this in the little tiny vignette of you trying to clear rudiments on somebody and you start present time problem have you got present time problem yes the needle says yes the pc says what is it you say and the pc tells you and then you drop the lampshade and accidentally let off 12gauge shotgun and do few other little minor things that causes an arc break with the pc what are you going to do that is very interesting point what are you going to do because your arc break clearing process wont run why wont it run it wont run because theres present time problem in the case the guy gave you the present time problem you made the arc break now because hes arc broken you cant audit the present time problem very easily now wherere you going to go so theres the biggest single jam up in auditing and is the basic source of any feeling you have that its hard to clean up an arc break the arc breaks which youve had trouble cleaning up are those which occurred while you were trying to clear up present time problem think it over and of course they didnt clear theres process known to man that will clear an arc break if it has been made on the present time problem grim huh so it isnt choosing the wrong level that stalls case from clearing its clearing up rudiments ability to clean up those rudiments and when this one occurs when you get an arc break going when present time problem is in existence of course you cant clean up the arc break well ill give you tip as to how to go about this this is not an unsolved problem it has been unsolved to you up to this time although you probably havent looked at it straightaway as problem only it is the roughest problem of auditing thats why your case doesnt make any progress from that point thereon and of course because the arc break is there the present time problem now reads null its submerged because youve got an arc break on top of its read so you of course dont now suspect that youre running case with present time problem on it because you think youve solved the arc break you got the idea heres the way i would handle this i would just somehow or another bull my way plow my way blunder my way through the present time problem process that i was running i wouldnt try to clean the arc break seems to be violation of auditing doesnt it but it isnt in other words the pcs got present time problem you had registry now if while trying to clean that present time problem you get an arc break you had better give the arc break minimal attention and continue with the present time problem whether it now registers or not otherwise your case will hang fire you look kind of whats this you want to know how the hell you do that well you just altitude your way through it without invalidating the pc any further or something like that youd be surprised what you can do with hearty oh well i know that was an awful goof and im sorry but lets just bull our way somehow through this present time problem lets at least get that out of the way and then well handle this other thing all right and go ahead and handle the present time problem that you were handling okay you see that as practical course otherwise the problem is totally unsolvable because you cannot clean the arc break with any arc break tr5n or anything else it wont work when its sitting on top of the present time problem thats it all right now running an arcbreaky pc normally is because the pc is being audited over problems you have not detected or you have ignored in some fashion any active busy person in life has great many present time problems which he notises in order to be audited i wouldnt be looking at anybody but they have lot of present time problems dont you see and they notis these things and they say well i dont have present time problem because here i am being audited wrench you see and im not going to do anything about that letter that telephone call thats all later got the idea and here i am being audited okay go ahead and audit now you dont get registry the guys sort of arc broke himself you know he said well thats it and you got present time problem on notis you as an auditor should suspect let us take an executive in central organization let us take anybody who leads an active life in any way that that person has hanging fire at the moment hes being audited at least one present time problem and on such person in beginning session if you do not find present time problem get suspicious and run one anyhow got it audience voices mmmhm now thats the only thing thatll hang cases up in clearing is outrudiments and if present time problem in is in existence you of course cannot clear the rest of the rudiments and present time problem can be notised it can be submerged by the pc himself can actually be just smashed into existence ive had pc say well i just dont pay any attention to these things i dont see why anybody else has to have arc breaks or anything because i just dont pay any attention to these things the only thing that registered do you have any arc breaks you are not paying any attention to you get registry the pc actually with attention just totally fixated on this arc break has notised it has forcefully put another flow of attention elsewhere while holding almost with force this arc break into invisibility you get slow gain see that well that works on many people with present time problems if person is leading an active life and if person has lot of indian clubs in the air in existence you can just count on the fact the person has come into session with present time problem it is utterly inevitable that they have come into session with present time problem and thats it and on such person it is faster to run routine 1a any version of to its bitterest end before goals assessment or goals run is attempted it is faster interesting huh were not just taking the evidence of one case although we do have one case in complete evidence of this but we have other instances of this so if youre getting slow run after youve found terminal now we know why terminal disappears we know why goal disappears or terminal disappears it becomes invalidated in some way rudiments go out in some fashion various other things happen in that early assessment area rudiments out so you dont find the goal you dont find the terminal assessment goes on forever and it actually does the case good dont think that it does the case any good because it doesnt all right now got that if the thing isnt running smoothly suspect first that you havent flattened the level theres something left on this level every time you finish up level suspect theres something left on the level because series of unflat levels can keep case from clearing so remedy number one of this these difficulties weve been having in clearing is simply do double check on the level as i gave you before twenty minute check its flat quarter of tone arm motion twenty minute test quarter of tone arm motion or less for twenty minutes dandy wonderful wunderbar gorgeous now lets get the rudiments in now lets run it for another twenty minutes and see if we still have quarter of division or do we have four dials got the idea all right now we know its flat now we can count absolutely on the thing being flat before we go on to our next level assessment okay now if case in spite of this precaution continues to hang up in running the goal on terminal routine 3 case continues to hang up and were not now paying any attention to security checking well take that up in moment case isnt blowing clear assume the case is being audited over present time problem and just do everything you can possibly do to thresh out this thing and you have routine 1a and it would not be amiss if case apparently is hanging fire is going let us say something on the order of twentyfive hours without any appreciable gain even though hes being run on his goal and terminal twentyfive hours is perfectly adequate test on this and the person doesnt seem twentyfive hours of goals and terminal run im talking about doesnt seem to be making terrific gain somethings happening here get profile on him profile hasnt appreciably done something one way or the other assume immediately the person is being run on present time problem shift immediately over to routine 1a flatten routine 1a go back and pick up the goal once more that the person had and terminal and continue your run okay got it and we wont have this forever clearing that will put it to bed in hurry now case that in the process of doing case assessment sheet and doing early work with appears to be arc breaky drop your goals assessment and go on at once to routine 1a and get problems goodbye forever because case arc breaks only when present time problems have their attention split that is the basis of the arc breaky case arc breaks present time problems routine 1a is the treatment and i dont care how many versions you run of routine 1a i dont care how many oddities you throw into it as auditing commands get that person totally totally totally accustomed to problems confront on problems recall present time problem what problem isnt present you know anything anything at all only get problems just completely shaken out ill give you little bit more on that but let finish off this dissertation just exactly on the subject of clearing get 1a flat flat flat now thered be two places where youd flatten 1a one it becomes obvious to you that this pc is hard to hold insession thats becoming obvious to you that the pc is hard to hold insession the pc is arc breaky your auditing is fairly good and the pc continues to arc break assume at once that the pc is being audited over the top of present time problems which could include merely present time problem of long duration and hidden standard you see that all comes under the heading of present time problem all right that one and later if the case doesnt seem to be going clear after being run for twentyfive hours on the terminal and so on doesnt seem to be all right you missed lets take up routine 1a flatten routine 1a completely utterly and completely get off all of these stuck attention points on the subject of problems worries anxiety and concerns come back to the same goal dont do new goals assessment come back to the same goal same terminal get your rudiments all the way in reassess it newly on the prehav scale and sail along youll find out it probably will now assess at the same place that it assessed the first time you ran it it very probably will and then go on clearing the case you got that now this gives you little more scope doesnt it it gives you little more hope along this line but i have seen all these points working out i have good reality on these various points and it seems very improbable that any auditor doing businesslike technical job you know knows his trs pretty good and knows his model session pretty good and knows how to run an emeter and so on it seems very improbable to that with these precautions he would fail to clear any pc that sat down in front of him even though they were stark staring mad okay i just would think it improbable that it wouldnt happen because that is all that is happening that stands in the road of clearing rudiments are out and the chiefest rudiment that can go out is the one that causes grind is the present time problem thats the main one that can go out so thats the one youve got to get off because it can stall everything else given an auditor who is giving an auditing session of course okay hm is that easily grasped by you easily understood hm feel yourself coming out of little bit of fog of why are we grind grind grind on assessments and why are we grind grind grind when we get the fellows goal and terminal huh does that make any sense to you all right if present time problem was that important then we had better do something more comprehensive about routine 1a and wed better get routine 1a into some kind of shape hm all right routine 1a is simply problems and security checks thats all routine 1a consists of routine 1a does not have any auditing commands it is simply problems handle them you see so this gives you completely wideopen field for the handling of problems how do you handle problems and thats what it comes under the heading of which is whole subcategory of scientology and its become very important category but routine 1a is designation by definition simply handles problems and security checks all right so weve got this whole subclassification of how do you handle problems whats the anatomy of problem ive given lot of lectures on it postulate counterpostulate each postulate being surrounded by its own confusion it is problems alone that give you this terrific idea of survival if you want somebody who works very very slowly in an organization for instance have somebody who has lots of problems everything will seem like forever to them see everything seems like forever its your timelessness problem gets locked up in time because its number of factors which are all jammed together and so on so sort of timelessness or slowness or something like that is caused by problems so this tells you that problems could be read directly by one sticky meter an unchanging graph see the answer too each one of these things is that the guys got problems this is what youd say see meters sticky guys got problems unchanging graph guys got problems see relatively simple remark slow reaction time his reaction time is below normal guys got problems fellow isnt moving around much in life doesnt like to leave his home guys got problems got the idea motion guys got problems follow this the answer to these various motion characteristics are all problems problems stick and float and tend to move forward in time and the fellow can be so fixated on the thing that he looks like hes moving forward in time but actually hes stuck in the past so of course everything seems to be timeless around him so therefore his reaction time his inability to move around and do things his loss of activity in the society an unchanging graph sticky meter which and an unchanging meter you can add that to the list all of these things denote problems all right now if problems are that important aside from all earlier definitions of problems there must be another definition of problems that is even more useful to you and that definition of problems exists in one single word unknown thats the problem problem is an accumulation of notknowingnesses and consideration of the person as to the value of the notknowingnesses i told you one time that thetan was mystery sandwich that he was stuck to his bank with mystery clear back about 54 55 mystery sandwich thetan mystery bank and thats how his bank is stuck there thats how he stuck to anything thats how he stuck to valences and so forth mystery is the glue of life if you want freedom you must restore knowledge if you want slavery establish ignorance now there isnt i didnt make single comment about rome or anything of this sort im on my good behavior today but if you want to if you want to install great deal of slavery youve got to take the knowledge out of the subject and create bunch of notknows the common denominator then and its very interesting to have common denominator of all problems aside from their anatomy of postulate counterpostulate and confusioncounterconfusion and all of this sort of thing the common denominator of all problems is an unknown an unknown problem cannot exist in the absence of notknowingness when knowingness is established problem ceases to exist theres an old dianetic axiom on this by the way is randomity can be caused by missing datum man thats the most randomity that can be caused the randomity currently called an automobile engine lot of randomity connected with automobile engines these days and the missing datum of course is an engine an automobile engine is way to make state tax motorists see it burns tremendous quantities of fuel which is very dear which is very hard to get keeps the state wealthy and keeps the oil companies wealthy and everybodys wealthy but you havent got an engine what you need in an engine is something you can throw couple of carrots in and it has maximum of about three working parts and there it goes thats an engine see an automobile engine for the absence of an engine causes you to put in fuel at high taxation and high sales price to create heat and then to put in radiator and water jacket and fan to take the heat away which i think is an awfully interesting action both of them are totally opposed to one another and the engine must run by heat so you cool it now all kinds of things could be said about this but of course the missing datum is something in the field of engineering on the subject of propulsion or motors or something see its missing datum i dont adventure to tell you what the missing datum is about engines but it causes all this other randomity see and every time you get in your car you say well can i afford to go home you know i think the gasoline in the united states is now worth something on the order of ten cents gallon and the government gets about thirtyfive cents gallon oh but recently i understand theres been gas war and now they have to pay the service stations to sell it i think thats about right theyre selling it for fourteen cents and they get at the stations and the oil companies and so forth costs them nineteen cents to provide the station with it or something like that nonsense theres that randomity then theres the randomity of replacement of engines and then theres the randomity of automobiles that actually cant be controlled they havent got good positive engine although the engines all right but the engine slows down in speed its very hard to slow down one of these engines just because you take your foot off the accelerator is reason you are instantly and at once braking with an engine you arent really theres split second or two there when the engines inertia goes on various other things are occurring and you get the randomity of traffic traffic accidents that sort of thing relatively uncontrollable motors theyre not slung low enough theyre not positive enough you get well you get the problem called angeles totally freeways swooping in all directions going up into the sky and down into the valley all completely hidden under vast miasma of smog see automobile automobile mufflers this causes bunch of randomity so everywhere you look you get more randomity more randomity more randomity more randomity and so forth and its the missing datum engine whats proper method of propulsion all right you see that there are all kinds of problems evolve out of this one missing datum now mans difficulties were busily getting more and more difficult his various relationships nation to nation person to person group to group this sort of thing was getting more and more involved and so forth because of missing datum the missing datum added up to many data technology about man so lot of people kept coming in with all kinds of false knowingnesses of various characters and another and this just created more problems you see one didnt have positive datum concerning man well was he bad or good or was he an evil beast obviously most of their data is wrong because it isnt working all right so this causes tremendous in the civilized world it causes tremendous amount of randomity its just the missing datum dont you see all right so the only reason im calling this to your attention in the broad sphere is so that you can see it easily when applied to bank all right heres pc and you start running problems on this pc and you run you say describe the problem and describe the problem he keeps giving you different problems different problems different problems different problems problems problems problems problems problems you ever notice that you keep running this he keeps giving you different problems all the time even though you went in for problem you wind up with problem aaaz see youve just got problems problems problems theres missing datum someplace theres an unknown and just as angeles smog goes up to this idea of engine the data on how to make proper propulsion unit just as traffic accidents automobile taxation government efforts oil company you know all these other problems each one of those could be considered as separate problem dont you see but if you started running them on the pc well do you have problem and describe the problem to and the pc would say angeles smog describe the problem to and the pc would say traffic accidents and describe the problem to and the pc would say taxation got the idea and these things dont seem to add up because you dont even know what the problem is you see but thats why hes got problem because he doesnt know what it is see and it causes you to qanda with him little bit because he doesnt know what it is then all of sudden you dont know what it is got the idea because obviously its an unsolvable situation the common denominator of all problems is you could cut through to center problem of the pc with great speed by running unknownness on the subject of problems interesting idea isnt it unknownness on the subject of problems all right lets give you sample process now let define for you first twoway comm twoway comm is an inquiry of the pc as to what is going on and an invitation to him to look at it and that is all its an inquiry as to whats going on and an invitation for him to look at it an invitation direction for him to look at it so it is limited to how are you doing whats worrying you and well whats that all about and youve just about summed up the totality of twoway communication and when we say twoway comm youd better just limit it to just exactly that and nothing else how are you doing well tell about it which is just about the same thing as take look at it and what is that all about thats twoway comm now ive done nobridge statement here but you have been handling processes as twoway comm ah ah ah ah ah ah twoway comm does not consist of any process whatsoever you understand theres process involved in twoway comm except the process called twoway comm how are you doing tell about it what is it got it thats it and theres nothing more to twoway comm than that now our next observation in this particular line is that if you start process you flatten it and that had to do with engrams 1950 and it had to do with all of the 50s and it has to do here with the early 60s and this is datum about auditing which has never changed there has never been any change variation and so forth there are tremendous lot of constants in auditing and this is one of them three basic constants of auditing could be say run session flatten all the things you run into dont keep qandaing and running into more things that you dont flatten flatten what you contact and end sessions these have always been with us you see so that if you start any type of inquisition on the subject of the present time problem you flatten it by the emeter if youre going to run unknowns on present time problem flatten it by the emeter what do i mean by flatten it well you dont have to run twenty minute test on it but you sure have to get the needle action out of it you have to get the needle action out of the process you are running all that is all that is cautionary im just doing review here of something because im about to give you datum and that is to say in model session it is totally allowable to run out the present time problem by discovering the unknowns connected with it and youll run more present time problems faster than you ever heard of its with speed use any version of the oddnumbered postulates what shouldnt be known what is not known what have you forgotten about it what should be forgotten about it who would be upset if you did forget about it anything you want to do that is one process youre running unknowns on the present time problem and that is not twoway comm youre running process youre running process with varied command and thats all youre doing so get that well established because you can wind pc up in fine state man because you get him way down the track and you all of sudden shift gears on him into saying im going to run some other process on this now thinking you have not been running process and youre going to be in trouble at once so running the oddnumbered postulates which is the notknow forget on down to doubt and pretended know the whole rack of the notknow scale you can keep putting these to pc in any kind of version or wording you want to and you dont have to go repetitive repetitive repetitive what have you forgotten thank you what have you forgotten about that thank you what have you forgotten about that thank you now that is not being very smart and its not being very speedy because theres something forgotten about the problem theres something notknown about the problem theres something doubted about the problem theres something pretended and all youve got to do is get all these various versions of notknowingness off the thing and the problem goes svoosh im giving you this because you can stop worrying about present time problem occupying threequarters of your session if you do this well now the only reason you object to present time problem is because it takes such damn long time to flatten one of the things and theres such marvelous opportunity in this long time for arc breaks as ive just pointed out to you are very dangerous while youre running them see so weve got another process here which has just sprung up and which is very old actually but applied to this particular problem of problems is right on the common denominator of problems the guys got problem because he doesnt know well lets find out what he doesnt know and the problem goes foosh got the idea problem almost has one each at least minimum of one each of each part of the notknowingness scale usually the problem should be notknown by somebody the pc doesnt know something about it in other words an unknown theres an unknown concerning it by forgetting it he would get even with somebody you see some part of it somebody else doesnt know about it you know all of these various versions of notknow occur around problem and there may be just only one of each see so its varied idea of problem well lets plow out the stupidity of the thing and weve got it made you see see how that would work now if you became able to do this well understanding that twoway comm just has its three parts of how you doing tell about it and what is it and thats all then you wont get into the idea that youre running unknowns with twoway comm thats phlooey see youre actually running process now you said in the rudiments you said all right do you have present time problem and you got little knock matter how tiny but you got knock on the meter and you say what was that and the pc says well that was uh i dont know how long the session is going to last and you say well we agreed to end it at four oclock and he says well all right and you say good well do you have problem knock youve got it you say do you have present time problem knock and you say what was that and the pc says oh i dont know im pretty worried about the mail i dont know whether ill get the mail tomorrow or something like that and you say well all right whats in it you know and he says something or other and something or other and thats what thats all about and so on and you say okay how is it you know how you doing that sort of thing well all right i think i can handle that you say all right do you have present time problem knock now youve handled it by twoway comm all right but the second time you said it well do you have present time problem the second time you said do you have present time problem you get another knock well the way youd handle it with notknow is without announcing the fact you would start in on notknow run on this particular problem and it is process and you should understand it as process the way you bridge out of that can be very careless but it nevertheless has to be bridge out im going to ask you couple of more questions about this now and then end this end this see its not process but it is and youll find out the problem will have evaporated rather rapidly now what would you ask him well hes worried about the mail now thats present time problem hes got but this is going to turn one way or the other one way or the other and you say well can you phrase that problem little bit better well yes and now its twisted one way or the other and you say well is there something unknown there oh hell yes i dont know whether the mails going to come or not i just told you well all right are you afraid somebody else is going to forget oh yes as matter of fact thats the whole thing they mightve forgotten to send it to you know and then that would be hell of mess and youd say well all right now should this be unknown to somebody or other well not really anybody but it really should be unknown to my wife because she doesnt know im getting it and you say well all right thats fine you say well is there anything else there that is unknown is there anything else there that should be forgotten is there anything else there that if you forgot it somebody else would be real upset oh i get it all right thats fine all right now do you have present time problem knock got it now if you learn to do that expertly and smoothly and try to kind of stay on the subject of vaguely what his present time problem is not trying his whole case and terminal too you got the idea youre talking about mail and he was worried about mail so this seemed to be the common denominator of his present time problem was an unknown about mail or it might have been an unknown about somebody going to mail him something or something of this sort you see but you got that sorted out now you stay on that as line of questioning its notknowingness about mail otherwise youre going to get angeles smog taxes and were going to wind up running the whole case and find him eight trillion years ago and so forth and we wont have handled the present time problem well be handling the whole case with unknowns which we could do too see but flatten what you contact not only flatten the process youre running but flatten what you contact dont let that thing get out from under you youre trying to flatten that thing which you contacted you are not trying to flatten the case and that is the auditors biggest difficulty on the subject of q and and q and could be redefined as an auditors effort to solve the whole case having contacted one incident see they let that incident go and then they get hold of another incident and they get hold of another and another and another and another and another and another and another and another ohhh where are we what is this all about so the fellow said present time problem and he said mail all right mail we got him to redefine it we were careful about it lets make him really define this present time problem and then lets get that present time problem fixed that present time problem it has to do with mail otherwise hes going to go down to the deepest unknown of his bank theres nothing wrong with that in processing but theres everything wrong with that in rudiments see see hes going to wind right up and find the unknown which is motors and he will suddenly say motors and youll say what well he says this adds it up angeles smog taxation oil companies the murder of rudolf diesel it all adds up everything all adds up and so forth and i got it and thats the basic unknown they dont have motor well thats great theres nothing wrong with that at all but that is not what we are trying to do in rudiments see so he will go around this whole excursion and get down to the central unknown of his track if we continued to question him in this particular line and thats perfectly all right for session but not all right for rudiments so identify the object of the ptp remember you get changes on terminals you dont get changes on conditions so get the object of the ptp ptp object car ptp object mail ptp object wife ptp object husband got the idea ptp object now of course theres another object going to creep in on you and thats the beginning of the smog over to the tax company you see youre not interested in that other one that wasnt worrying him minute ago why should it worry him now well weve restimulated him into worry so we can process him out of restimulation in other words were going to come off of that got the idea so what dont you know about mail what should be forgotten about this mail preferably this mail you see what should be forgotten about this mail well should this mail be unknown to anyone you know suspect him of that well if you forgot about it entirely would that be an overt against somebody yes it sure would itd be an overt against i wouldnt pick up my paycheck you see you got what youre trying to do youre trying to take this whole thing but youre trying to take it against one object which is the object of the present time problem and if you get very good at this youll find out present time problems cease to worry you youll start to regard them with some contempt so the guy has present time problem you know that twelve fifteen questions at the absolute outside later he wont have this present time problem hell be fine his attention will be in the session okay see this so theres trick there now obviously that was one of the things we needed desperately in auditing was ways and means of handling present time problem rapidly effectively and scoot along right on down the line and get it all handled and get that rudiment out of the way and get the session going okay now youll find out that if you can ably handle pt problems that your arc breaks will get very few to minimize arc breaks handle present time problems all right now theres one more little factor involved in all of this and thats routine 1a as whole subject routine 1a consists of course of everything you could think of in relationship to problems any time you think up problems process it could be part and parcel to routine 1a you could say who has problems thank you who has problems thank you who has problems thank you thats fine thats routine 1a what problem could you confront thank you routine 1a what problem isnt present routine 1a you understand what unknowingness exists about problems routine 1a good or bad see its all routine 1a you could run any of these versions for routine 1a and youd come up at the other end with total ability to confront problems without being upset about the unknowns of them youll find mans main difficulty is confronting the unknown and its the one thing he does not like to do well basically its hard to do its hard to do germs you say what germ could you confront and of course the answer is i cant confront any germ as far as your confrontingness is concerned germs were an invention of fellow by the name of pasteur and existed only in his notebook youve never seen one youve seen microscope but how do you know you arent just looking at brownian movement i never talked to any germs oh ive been down skid row in chelsea and i have talked to some germs but im sorry i apologize but its not there you ask some its an absence of confrontingness dont you see theres nothing there to confront you dont carry microscopes around and examine all of your friends you know i can see social gathering now where everybody was insisting on microscoping everybodys hand before he shook hands you know very interesting but anyway its noconfront confronting the absent joe bill pete somebody wife husband something is absent for forty years and you say well what part of your wife could you confront the answer of course is part of my wife she isnt here its noconfront isnt it all right but it also happens to be an unknown an absence adds up to an unknown and were back to processing loss which we knew as very powerful potent button about 57 and 58 loss the direct processing of loss when you start processing unknowns because what is so damned maddening about loss is you dont know what has happened to it see and it just becomes instantly notknow so therefore person who has lots of problems is liable to start experiencing sensations of loss you get all kinds of crossplays going here of one kind or another you see hes starting to assign causes of loss person has the problem of having murdered his father that hed never seen you find this in an institution hes going around the bend on the subject of having murdered his father you find them all the time but he didnt see but the idea that his father is gone and that he doesnt know who his father was or he some kind of lineup of this character occurs so lot of notknowingness about father causes the fellow to go to the bottom of the prehav scale and pretend some knowingness and to add to this pretended cause and pretended knowingness and pretended cause are almost blood brothers youll find these two things going together consistently and continually when somebody gets real plowed in on pretended knowingness youll find pretended cause moves in behind it and it makes somebody who is busy inventing things feel very peculiar indeed i mean somebody whos actually inventing something it makes him feel very peculiar because if he gets down to the inventors society why hell find bunch of fellows perhaps who pretend to know all about his invention and who invented it two years before he did these things go hand in glove boom boom and we ran into this so often that i invented rebuttal in scientology which is quite effective which is well what did you invent and of course it leaves them there with their jaws flapping you say soandso and soandso and i did soandso and soandso and then the other person says oh yes yes i invented that yeah oh yeah we did that and so forth and we know all about that and you say well what do you know about thats the end of the conversation man the person who is in that state cant duplicate and they cant feed back what youve said you see thats the trick so they tell you something entirely disrelated that is way over the hills and far away up to that moment youre caught in this trap you say well i havent done so much you see you nothing has been made out of you for whatever you have done you know nothings been made out of you but then you find out hasnt been nothing made out of you that youre just looking at whole pool of nothing its an interesting rebuttal but pretended knowingness and pretended cause are blood brothers not cousins but brothers and you find the two things coming up consistently and continually youll find somebody whose pretended whose pretended knowingness is saturating his whole track from one end to the other and you get you get to point where he cant look at monument without having ordered its erection you got this you see his pretended knowingness goes along with having caused it now when you start running into this youre at the bottom of the notknow scale because its substitute know you got the idea its substitute know it isnt know now exactly how you handle that particular end of the game is very interesting because it isnt really direct contact its very hard to make direct contact at that end of the game unless you go at it obliquely through the subject matter of problems the person has had so many problems that he has begun to substitute false solutions and those false solutions are the pretended knowingness that you see on the case so you actually dont process the pretended knowingness what you do is process the guy for problems any problems process will cause such pc to really get up on the step and fly i dont care which one of the problems processes it is but any one of them will just will take off on this particular process because you enter it at the level of reality of what problem is and then youll find out because youre handling the confrontingness or the existence of problems all of sudden these false solutions and pretended cause and that sort of thing fade out on the case so problems are very good approach on it 1a then has very extended usages and can handle cases which are baffling you to this degree you can say that if the case is baffling you an excellent approach is to flatten 1a now when i say flatten 1a i mean to get the guy used to confronting unknowns when he was finally used to confronting unknowns whether in the version of problems or otherwise you would then have somebody who wasnt obsessively escaping from them you would have somebody who was longer experiencing superanxiety youd have somebody who wasnt experiencing got to go or got to stay cant move you know cant leave cant stay or anything else youve solved this but it is the confrontingness of the unknown jealousy is basically an inability to confront the unknown very possibly the absence of jealousy amongst the polynesians is the fact that when infidelity as its called by the anglosaxon is accomplished in the hut it is normally done in full view see theres nothing unknown about it so jealousy becomes unknown in these particular zones and areas but where an unknown is racked up you get jealousy and the sickness and so forth that somebody experiences over jealousy itself is not on the buttons of betrayal is not on the buttons of this on that on the other thing and infinite numbers of explanations were just back to more smog more smog and taxes and oil companies you see and all of these things are not quite related but somehow or other the incidence of cancer in angeles you see would come into all of this and so on and just bzz wild explanations which just dot the landscape all connect together to an unknown and the unknown is is she being faithful or is he being faithful or is he being unfaithful or not you know or do they know something about the activities of my wife that i do not know you got you got all these things unknowns unknowns you know is there something i dont know that they know and you get all these balanced knows and unknows and person who gets literally sick about love for instance you know and hes all mixed up about all of this kind of thing dont enter it on the basis of male and female has nothing to do with it you could probably solve it on the basis of oh scarcity and abundance of women or men or something like this but basically it just comes down to inability to confront an unknown now thats fundamental only this particular unknown has to do with the sexes you see how youd work this out so when case is presenting baffling aspect to you make up your mind that you had better improve the cases ability to confront the unknown and were right back in routine 1a method of approaching the unknown is of course through problems you just get him to start citing problems what problem could you confront what problem would you rather not confront and so on and on and on and on and on doesnt matter what youre running youre still running something that is on the border fringe of unknow see notknown so therefore you would you would get that thing mopped up wouldnt you all right why does case suddenly dive into the middle of the bank and cant come out and wont come out and you cant plow the case out and you take dynamite blasting powder anything else you can possibly think of what on earth would you say offhand would be the reason for this why does case dive at his engrams why has case got himself so glued into his bank why why well its just why i mean the question itself why answers it the guy is unable to not ask why theres an unknown occurs in the incident he gets some tiniest slightest glimmer of the unknown and he dives right straight at the engram and there he goes and you find another engram and he dives at this one and you find another engram and he dives at that one you find another engram and he dives at that one and the next thing you know youve got the most horrible mishmash you ever saw called bank why the answer is he cant stand the question why thats all he cannot confront an unknown in other words he becomes very hectic at the idea that an unknown exists it mustnt exist anyplace in the world well the hell it mustnt whatcha going to do run it totally on know we cant its stuck flow heres an oddity though his allknowingnesses are invented knowingnesses even though youre in body and your body is real it isnt necessarily true it is simply know but that know is invented somebody invented the idea of body you follow this now with the inability to confront an unknown eventually you get into state of inability to confront the known you know its both sides of the same coin and eventually you get somebody who cant confront and then youll have trouble with the person so that to this person any little tiny incident of the day or night becomes problem that he dwells on hes outside all of sudden he doesnt know whether he might have dropped his ballpoint outside the door or left it in the car he doesnt have the ballpoint now did he leave it in the restaurant ah is it here ah did he have ballpoint in the first place has he ever owned ballpoint and this just magnifies and magnifies you get him insession you yourself say all right do you have present time problem well i dont know where i put my ballpoint he says very matter of factly you see you get little fall on it you say well what about this ballpoint and he says well i missed it and you say well do you have present time problem now you dont get any fall and you say well it couldnt be too much of problem because it only concerns ballpoint and what you have totally overlooked is the fact that to him that much unknowingness is enough to send him through the roof and he sits there all through the session without telling you and thinks ballpoint i didnt put it there in the car i put it see it isnt that the ballpoint is valuable at all its just the fact that there is an unknown where is this damn ballpoint got the idea hes almost berserk on the whole idea youre not processing person with present time problem youre processing someone with craze practically and yet you as the auditor might say to yourself well that isnt much of problem so i wont pay much of attention to it well the bug factor is how much of problem is problem to pc and that is all regulated by his ability to confront the unknown and if he cant confront anything that is unknown you will find him totally glued all the way up and down the track totally mishmashed into every engram he has ever contacted personally privately by himself hes every time he ran into one he goes zoooomp stuck see got the idea all right thats what youre trying to process and of course youre trying to get his attention off of something on to what you want to run or what should be run and his attentions stuck on his damn ballpoint and if you queried him youd find out that the last ballpoint that he had anything to do with was totally empty and he didnt even have refill for it and it wasnt the kind of ballpoint that could be refilled all right thats whats stopping people from going to clear thats about all it is too all right now you could get something going like this now were getting wicked now were getting wicked we could get something that would be as horrifying as this as process and this is horrifying process what unknown about an auditing session could you confront what unknown about an auditing session would you rather not confront i dont care how many legs you put on it you can run it just that far and you get anybody whos having any very great difficulty auditing or just doesnt really think they ought to be auditing and theyll blow their skulls on it practically itll solve this difficulty itll solve the difficulty whambam and it is specific process that you could run on an oldtimer that doesnt really like to audit much anymore or somebody thats having lot of difficulty learning how to audit or something like this this would resolve on that exact process is what unknown about an auditing session because of course the pc is sittingg there being totally unknow and the fact that the pc has some unknowns is enough to drive the guy halfway around the bend and he gets stuck up in every pc i know an oldtime auditor that i think he audits once in while but you cant get him to audit very much and he does flyabout every time you hear of him someplace hes someplace else see the intelligence never has time to get to you im not talking about anybody that you know particularly its an oldtimer from south africa anyway he picks up every pcs somatic matter what somatic the pcs got when hes auditing the pc hell pick it up and hell have it for two or three days the usual settleout period for restimulation why because its mystery and just the fact that what is it bang and thats it hes got it you got the idea he just snaps terminals with these unknowns instantly well itd half kill him to run this process on him but hed run it and hed come up at the other end feeling fine and smelling like daisy this is just specific application of particular type of thing in its simplest form that is workable process and it does handle then specific thing all right weve got somebody and he used to write and doesnt like to write anymore and we want to rehabilitate his writing use the same factor what unknown about writing could you confront whether the storys going to be bought of course you see and he automatic the unknowns the unknowns have driven him out of it nothing else eighteen lives ago the fellow could sure speak arabic hasnt been able to speak much of it since it go turns on and off appears in casablanca or something like that asks street beggar something speaks arabic startles the hell out of it see and then the next moment cant speak arabic whats happening there whats happening to somebody who cant learn german now there are some unknowingnesses german mm one of these compound polysyllabic words or an irregular verb hh monro remarks on fellow being stomped to death by an elephant in zoo that he was trying to teach german irregular verbs to the fellow could make animals talk you know the story well what is this whats unknown about not the german language so much but german would undoubtedly produce considerable reaction there for the rehabilitation of language dont you see all right now ill give you another one it is true that this is the case this is this is truth here as far aas processing is concerned that it is valences valences are packaged mass knowingnesses and the treatment of condition is an attempt to alter valence without addressing the valence and at time can this occur you cannot well you cannot treat mr joe blow if mr joe blow isnt present youre trying to cure joe blows arthritis but joe blow isnt on this side of the planet maybe not even on this planet you got the idea so you put some arthritis in test tube or something see and ill fool around with the calcium and so forth and you finally conclude there isnt much you can do about it and so on and then this fellow is trying madly to do something about arthritis and he does something about arthritis something about arthritis arthritis and he finally has got arthritis but he got arthritis he was trying to cure joe blows arthritis only you dont know that joe blow ever existed so what about arthritis could you forget and that sort of thing would probably be bit of blind alley you might get someplace with it some process addressed directly at arthritis just as such well the probability is that unless you handle some mass like an engram or something like that that would cause jammed bones or something you actually are not going to get anyplace with this arthritis you got it because you are not addressing character named joe blow who is basic on the chain of arthritis in other words address the valence do not address the condition it took about fifteen years to find this out so its well worth filing behind your left ear its good auditing rule so long lists of goals are not going to make anybody progress particularly but long lists of valences could and i am now working on how to get rid of hidden standards which is to say present time problems of long duration which people are using for standards as to whether auditing works or doesnt work and the first process i have turned up with that has anything to do with this is one of the unknown processes and it runs like this this would be series of commands that you would run and you understand that this is an experimental process but i have every reason to believe that it would be quite workable process its on the basis that treatthevalence idea in other words get valences on the case dont get conditions you want to treat his arthritis so you say who or what might have arthritis what isnt known about that person what might you have done to him what might you have withheld from him four commands in row there is method of using an unknown salted down with some other things and combined with this valence idea who or what it goes idiotic as this who or what would have case like yours ohhh what isnt known about whether he said who why itd be him or her or whatever it was proper pronoun or it what might you have done to him what might you have withheld from him and you run security check and an unknown and valence identification all in the same bucket i dont say that that particular one will produce any particular marvelous results because the thing is too dug in on something like that and youll get it best on your goals terminal assessment but were talking about the handling of hidden standards so this fellow has bad eyes and we are very interested in this and its good beautiful hidden standard now we know how to get it on the security check we say what shouldnt be seen you know what have you done that shouldnt be seen and that sort of thing and just start checking them off and flatten it out on the meter you see we can do that weve already done it and practically had somebodys eyeballs rolling around on the floor you know but lets look at this now from this other process line not necessarily neglecting the security check approach either we do that too but this persons got bad eyes good hidden standard is his eyes getting better well auditings working eyes getting worse well what the hell its present time problem he isnt beeing audited hes sitting in present time problem so you got to handle it see all right so youd run something like this who or what would have bad eyes i dont care what version of this you use what is unknown about that the person it what might you with have done to them what might you have withheld from them and you would just go on stripping off valences valences valences valences valences valences valences valences and all of sudden zzzzzzz something is going to happen with regard to his eyes see im attacking this problem of hidden standard and attacking this problem of problems because these things are the primary holdups in clearing you see as you can see because ive been telling you this in this lecture anyway there is an experimental process which undoubtedly would bear lot of fruit now you could probably get rid of all sorts of things you could probably invent whole route to clear with just knowing about this particular facet you see youve got hitormiss huntandpunch sort of thing that could handle an awful lot of hidden standards well this fellow is worried about habit hes got and he just keeps worrying about this habit hes got well who or what would have that habit what isnt known about it or him what might youve done to such person what might you have withheld from such person and certainly were going to get whole track godknowswhat you see but its just going to be valences valences valences valences valences valences valences now theres one more rule that goes along with this is for some reason or other well it actually substantiates the theory that thetan is mystery sandwich if you run lots of unknow and notknow i mean lots of it youve got to remedy havingness so stand by to remedy havingness if youre running lots of notknow notknow first postulate stuff because frankly the whole bank is becoming unglued havingness will remedy much more rapidly and so on but youve got to keep it jacked up or the pc is liable to get pretty nervous because youre taking bank off of him in broadsword slabs and hes got to be able to reorient himself in the physical universe so therefore itd be an awfully good thing to find the havingness and confront process early in processing in any event at any convenient time early in processing you find it too early and its going to shift but at any convenient time early in processing find the pcs havingness and confront processes particularly since you are going to run some unknowns sooner or later you will be running some unknown of some character or another on this pc and the second that you do this you know that the havingness is going to drop and that youre going to have to stop the process every half an hour or so and remedy the fellows havingness just to keep him flying okay so its rule that goes along with it that rule has been going along with notknowingness for very long time by the way takes terribly smooth auditing job to get around this and it takes optimum environment for auditing and all that sort of thing never to have to remedy havingness on notknow itd just be superoptimum and nobody ever gets audited in superoptimum atmosphere okay well now if you can wrap your ears dont bother you wrap your brain around this stuff i want it to be available but if you can put some of these in practice why i think you will get some of these cases really off the launching pad and really rolling okay thank you very much xmpbodyhtml
