unit july 17 1977 0 president jimmy carter the white house washington dc i am for the first time in my life seriously concerned about freedom in this country i was introduced to scientology iand while 1 am not spending large amount of my resources there i hare dereloped growing interest in what scientology espouses i was shocked to see the stories about fbi raids on scientology churches week ago what i saw on tv and read in the atlanta newspapersl 1 hare learned or experienced to date in scientology my reaction was to call the scientology and when i did was told the reports on tv and in tfe tiwpapers were distortedi believed that but i had way to verify ithowever iiwas veryinterested in seeing the official response from scientologysee attachmenti thought the response came on little strong with the police state1 verbagebut i cannot verify that what scientology says is untruehowever i can verify thasyjaeomment of rebuttal fromscientology on tv or inflhhhhi newspapers nothingfc7cthat is scary the freedm of the press has struct new cord forme and i do not like the sound of it i call it suppression of myfreedom to know 7 furthermore i am concerned over the noncongruence of scientologys concern with ijjtekpol and the news medias lack of concern is interpoltthe drug traffic gobetween for drugs from the french goft coming into this country via the ciav is interpoi private company based in prance that collects data on 0s citizens and if so how can 1 find out what they have for is interpoi run by an exnazi commandant does interpoi have an office in us

4457812 press release _ v rc jevrhw pounderl7k0n hubbard for immediate release official statement fkom the church of scietwology in the early morning hours today our churches in angeles and washington dc were the target of gestapo police state raid as retaliation for recent attempts at government reform and an attempt to cover up massive international narcotics operation known to officials of the us andsome foreign governments for the past three years the church of scientology has sponsored the national commission on law enforcement and social justices investigation of interpol the private frenchbased police association two years ago we first heard the rumors that there was ijnotier aspect t6 the infamous french connection that involved both interpol and governmental officials but it was not til few months ago when the mcl director of reseasech toured europe at we were able to uncover the first suppeteig evidence only wkks ago did we make thie material public requesting that the apartment ot justice investigate the evidence we found the justice lapartments response came early this morning when fbi agents took sledgehammers crowbars andlock cutters to our churches and broke into our offices before the staff could even arrive which is an illegal act for us this is not new in 1963 the federal government perpetrated similar raid on the founding church in washington dc carting off several tons of religious materials we fought that battle for 10 years in the courts and finally won the case with the government returning all seized materials since then we have employed the preedom of information act 2 to force further disclosure of governmental harassment and false information circulated by federal officials and have found hocking false reports at every step the government has responded with nazi mentality and this latest tactic proves to us beyond reasonable doubt that the government is terrified and is resorting to the final frantic attempts to prevent the ultimate disclosures both we and they know lie behind their brutalities today even their allegations of stolen governmental records is not new either with us orith others daniel eusbergs psychiatrists office was broken into when he obtained the pentagon papers the fbi has executed black bag jobs around the country but now the tactic is more brutal and sledgehammers have replaced the quit and covert entry s lev montfis ago ncles research director was traveling through europe t find the drug and cia connections we had heard rumored so long the retaliation there was to attack him in the mediai as fraud and swindler who was also peddling forged or stolen vs governmental coeuments the documentsturned out to be report on xnfcerpol publish by the general accounting office and purchasable for one dollar that same truinpedup charge has now appeared with the fbi who ace making the same false allegations in order to break into our offices and confiscate wholesale what they have not been able to find in mail covers and other means the fbi has not permitted the oturch to xerox copies of material they took however church observers indite that fbi is on fishing expedition in fact they have taken church documents and documents obtained by the church under the freedom of information act the history and tactics of the fbi are becoming painfully known to the american public and this latest gestapo raid shows there has been reform in government dirty tricks 3 they have in effect proven to us that our research is correct that there is massive international narcotics cartel heretofore unrevealed which is operating with the knowledge and consent of highly placed governmental officials both here and abroad who will go to any means and use any tactics to prevent its disclosure that secret cartel is behind the heroin and cocaine smuggling into this country and extends into the highest ranks of the french judicial and police systems thus it is coincidence that our church in france was raided last year during that probe vie are not talking about 9 few dishonest cops we are talking about an operation that is being run with the blessing of french officials and the cooperation of american officials in washington from whence the orders for this raid came tie raid of church is in keeping with their criminal mentaliy and we are now rededicating ourselves to the fight not only for religious liberty but to expose those who are seeking to turn this cooxy into police stat our past ri story of vigorous government reform and the 750 million dollar sjit against the us government for conspiracy filed by the csssinh of scientology several months ago is certainly motive enough for ta ys government to use whatever reason they could create to get oir information and legal documents we of course are taking immediate legal action 30 for further information contact arairte shape church of scientology of florida 120 giralda coral sables florida 33134 telephone 305 4457812 august 2 1977

am writing to you about ray deep concern for the recent action of government representatives breaking into two churches of scientology only recently have i become genuinely interested in studying scientology and i have been taking courses for about ihree months as far as i can determine scientology is totally dedicated to the spiritual andphysical improvement of man it is enconceivable that scientology would present any threat to the united states government unless yotr consider telling the truth threat i too seek only the truth my concern is that the government or its agencies may not want certain truths known and that they may be trying to suppress any further comments from scientology about the fbi i hope that you will investigate this matter to insure that violation of the first ammendment is not taking place why is scientology attempting to sue the united states government do they have any proof to support their claims against the fbi and interpol these are questions that i hope will be answered i must admit that i have some concern that my name will now go on someones list in washington as one to tee watched please do what you can take good hard look and expose the truth whatever it may be i trust you and have confidence in you very rufy yours pbiooj4750rer4178s federal bureau of investigation foipa deleted page information sheetxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx pagete
