lower levels of auditing lecture given on 17 march 1964 whats the date audience march the 17th seventeenth seventeen mar 14 is that it all right well going to talk to you today about some more lower levels of auditing first id like to tell you something about the existing world situation ive had gamble on time going that began in january of 1963 and it was just time gamble moreno less could i complete the job before the roof fell in see that was the time gamble i took the calci knew i could complete the job but could i do it before the roof fell in you see there were many factors involved in this and it begins much earlier actually wondering whether or not theres going to be another warsaber rattling and atombomb sizzling going on and so forth but the time schedule was mainly dependent on scientology organizations and scientologistshow long they could hold out you know i took calculated risk and neglected organizations and scientologists during the period from january of 63 on through till actually last month or something like this i started doing something about it in november really but not with enthusiasm i started really crowding it home along about january year later and that was simply to conserve administrative time and put all the time on research making about an eighteenhour research day you see i cancelled out all social activities all footonthemantel sort of activities cut down my breathing and devoted every tiny scrap of time i possibly could to the research line trying to complete job which of course could not ordinarily have been completed in years and years and yearsthe amount of work which still had to be done and mary sue caught the brunt of that for long periods of time there she didnt have enough sleep to bother about but wewe got ourselves straightened out and augustaugust marked the point of could be done could be done herehere are the materialswe have our hands on them and so forth september those materials were understood but not labeled or communicated and the period from then september of 63 on through till january were pretty well devoted to codification the relay and communication that is the labeling of the material the defining and looking exactly at what you had putting it together in way that could be communicated you see and forwarding it through to conclusion this was of course all on the level of ot now when we say ot why your imagination can just run riot i mean whwhat do we mean ot well i dont know think of something terrificthats ot see what exactly is the zenith well of course there is none itsits an infinity of up and you cant really put label on it and say well it stops here because the truth of the matter it doesnt stop but exactly what did one have to do one to make an ot exactly what did one have to do to get the materials in communicable form labelled and so forth and then what did one have to do to communicate the materials so they could be understood and used these were the immediate problems which were faced and i think youll agree that was hat full of problems now at the same time it was necessary to form bridge from the individual you might say on the street on through to reaching distance to these materials and that had to be solved too and oddly enough that is the more difficult problem that problem is now proving more difficult than the upperlevel problem because of course with ones attention very closely devoted to the idea of exactly what it is and exactly where you can go and exactly what you have to do to come along and tell somebody how to get rid of his sciatica or something at level of auditing he can comprehend so that he can get reality so he will move forward toward it is quite stretch of wits because you know what his sciatica is you see hes got gpm or item thats out of place like crazy see hes going along in life giving himself wrong goal all the time you know something like this hes doing something goofy with class vi materials thats for sure but of course hes out of communication on the subject and you cant talk to him on this subject it doesnt make any sense to him edgar i think came as close to packaging that up as anybody had some fellow saying instead of is it your own goal you see well is it something you did and instead of an implant gpm saying something was done to you you know he was dividing these things up and i think he cured somebodys longstanding tb or something he cured tb with this justnotnot using implant or actual gpm or anything like that but just saying well was it something you did and is it something that was done to you rather terrific job he did i think about thirtyfive minutes of auditing on this sort of thing but exactly how does one get somebody up to reaching distance you see its aitsits steep mountain when you get there itsits steep very exacting mont blanc but as you have often noticed walking in foothills every time you come up to hill and you say i have now climbed the hill at the moment you reach the crest you see bigger hill you see well in this particular case when you get to the last hill you see mont blanc you see now weve got to scale that you know but these little foothills become progressively bigger as an individual walks along and unless hes walked securely up the hill to the crest of the hill hes so discouraged when he sees the next hill that he quits so its progress of wins in other words and you have to have materials which cause the individual to walk forward with wins well what is win well if youhe accomplishes something that he wants to accomplish that in essence is win and lose is he fails to accomplish something that he wanted to accomplish and it all comes back to this basic thing what does he want to accomplish so were actually back on class vi materials arent we ratherrather fabulous if you want to turn on feeling of sadness and apathy on pci wont give you the process because for once in my life i havent got my notes but its in mary sues notesan exact process that does this but it just takes up his little goals in life and straightwires those that have been blunted see the idea of whats he tried to do that he failed to do dont you see and that type of process im just giving it to you as process type not as the exact process but the exact process does exist in fact there are two of them and this is quite remarkable because this repairs his ability to win brandnew thought to you isnt it i mean to repair mans ability to win you dont realize that that pc that you get in off the street who just came along for the curiosity you knowbecause annabelle had some processing and it made her feel bettermay be unable to win at anything and youre trying to give him win and he cant win at anything see he might be able to inherit million bucks and he still wouldnt have win because he cant win so you get fooled because you estimate that if this man had million bucks you see then he would have win well then you could cut it down further and say well its because he cant have million bucks its because he cant have win he cant win so matter what you did for him get rid of his sciatica arthritis or anything elseno matter what you did for himyou would find this individual in state that he couldnt win so therefore although hes gotten rid of his arthritis he can have noarthritis you see he can have the item noarthritis you know in life but he cant have the win of noarthritis see so therefore he cannot go on with you as the auditor in any very good frame of mind dont you see thats how beaten to his knees youd find the bulk of the population so therefore when we talk about mounting these little foothills one by one and finding another foothill little bit bigger until we get to the mountain we are actually dealing with progress or gradient of wins and it actually is much more difficult job to get somebody from level 0 to level v than it is to get him from level v all the way through i think that you would have horrible idea of trying to walk up the easiest slope with some girl let us say who has french spike heels and theyre made out of abrasivetype material you see i mean the type of material that just rips to pieces you know if you get spot of water on it it goes you know and she cant walk very well anyway you see and shes wearing one of these french skirts that permits stride of sixteenth of an inch you see and shes held together with glue and sticky plaster you know the makeup is on and if the slightest drift of wind came by it would mess up her hair and trying to get this girl over little bit of rough terrainsee now thats about your firstlook at your first step now when youre taking this person from v up through vi youre dealing with an experienced mountaineer in spiked boots whos perfectly decent with rope you see and an alpenstock and so forth and youll find actually that its much safer to climb mont blanc with him than it was to walk up this gentle slope with this girl so those are the problemsthose are the problems of the progress of scientology but the political problem which we were faced with is were facing world which is more and more intolerant and which is more and more bent on giving people wins literature is getting more and more apathetic and thea hero is something nobody could even imagine in these times you see and its all pretty horrible and its all pretty grim and man is born to trouble and dies in more trouble you know thats the motto win has almost dropped out of popular literature you findyou find in even some of the more adventurous tales today that the treasure is in the cave but somehow or other at the end of the story they dont ever get it out and that is merely the acceptance level of win that is all that is and the acceptance level of win dwindles away to practically nothing it can get to this point nothing horrible happened to today and that is level of win see youve sometimes seen pc set goal like that you know session goal to get through it somehow but thats actually pretty high level of win compared to how low it can get on social level well to get back to what i was telling you earlier the calculated risk was could i do it in time could i do it in time and i did it in time and we arrived and this is about the first time its ever happened in scientology but sitting down in scientology library and research files and available to the thirty students who are on that course right now is practically every scrap of material that could be assembled on the subject of vi thats fabulous thing you say well naturally get piece of stuff like this we could research for long time get an awful lot of data together and theres lot more things to know and all that sort of thing that is not true at level vi right now i can tell youtell you little things like well this is an actual goals pattern from beginning to end find little thing like this i just found that thea createtype goal is never an oddnumbered goal it is always an evennumbered goal that create therefore in life itself is twisted into junior status compared to destroy destroy is considered superior to create believe it or not thats in the levels of class vi see well thats an interesting philosophic observation all it does is make it little easier for the auditor to plot the goals on the pc gives him better start so thatit gives him little tiny clue if theif the pc is trying to plot createtype goal you knowno matter what the wording of the goal iswhy he would be foolish to try to plot it in the oddnumbered slots but if hes trying to plot destructivetype goal and so forth he would be foolish to try to plot it in the evennumbered slots you see thats just making life just little easier but thats about the level of advance that we are at there little odd bit that doesnt amount to great deal but is interesting to an auditor who is trying to get goals plot together the one thing we dont know is is we dont know how many goals patterns there are but at guess there is very finite number of actual goals patterns that is theyrethey arent random forever which i consider is quite interesting i mean there are probably very fewvery few and so we can look forward to some time in the future when we say hes pattern you know hes pattern b if hes pattern b well then his goals are brr brr brr brr brr brrp we have to find them all and put them all in place but its just pow pow pow pow pow requiring very little of the pc all of which gives great certainty because the diffmost difficult point in any of this is finding and plotting goals you get one of those goals out of line youll wrap pc around telegraph pole the like of which youve never heard of man but its interesting news that there are probably just few of those but you get what the level of advance is we have all the technology find them all and put them together theres an infinite number of patterns you see these are little bonuses well anyway afterhere we are thirteen months fourteen monthsabout fourteen months after the kickoff on this and the job is all done and wrapped up and ive been involved for the last month or so particularly strenuously trying to put together andorganizational difficulties in auditor organizations and relationships and classification materials and consulting people about how they wanted classification to go and doing various things of this particular kind thats been the more recent activity and with governments leaning all over scientology and looking down our throatsfor instance the probabilitymary sue was always curious she always said the government wants something out of scientology shes always saying this the government wants something theres some reason for this and we finally found it they want the emeter for frontline combat troops i thought that was very interesting yeah its pretty crazy isnt it typical you see they get so much infiltrationthis is seriousthey get so much infiltration in modern warfare of the type that is being fought that they cant tell friend from foe so theyre going to equip frontline combat troops with portable lie detectors and of course theres only one portable lie detector in the worldthe emeter i knowed something was getting those chilluns you see but apparently they have some kind of an interest in it and you woulda thief or criminal never can ask you for something theyve got to steal it and i wasnt saying all the governments are thieves or criminals dont get wrong i think theres one or two that arent i know this is about the wildest curve you ever heard of and its completely unbelievable you can see soldier walking around carrying an meter before he shoots the guy you see he puts the electrodes in his hands you know bunch of psychotics i know it doesnt sound right but it soundsit sounds just exactly what government would do now in view of the fact that nobodys going to help them run these things and nobodys going to tell them how they operate and so forth i dont imagine their program will be very successful but i dont think theyre trying to be successful because i think their acceptance of win is total crash they know theyve won because theyre lying there with bits of meat splattered around the landscape see thats government level of win now the situation can become very acute in the next year or so in scientology because of course weve got to win back any lost ground and put things all together and so forth but weve made it at this end but remember only we here at saint hill have any reality on the fact that its made see only we have anara reality on that earlier saint hill training did great deal for organizations and auditing all over the world levels and standards of auditing have just come up enormously in the last couple of years so that i read now criteria from organizations and auditors around andas to whats gone wrong with case or whats gone wrong with situation its very smart its very intelligent they know what theyre doing on that sort of thing so weve put their basic auditing into good condition now ive got to move some of the old processes like prepchecking and r2h arc break stuff and that sort of thing back into their hands and weve got to put together this little gradient of wins and match that up and we will have this thing made because there isnt much doubt of turning out ots at saint hill as matter of fact my estimate to ot now is in terms of hundreds of hours and its very interesting had newnew datum recounted the number of actual gpms on the track got rid of few and was able to buck up to the tiger and count him by the nose and there are only about ten series of goals not fifteen thousand ten series making only about four hundred and twenty gpms not many thats not many at all and in view of the fact that you have pattern you could knock those offa slow auditor could knock them off at about one every hour and half in the early stages of the case which quickly cuts down to every hour which quickly cuts down to about every halfhour see so theres your case estimate its the number of timelonglength of time it takes to get goal plot together plus what and length of time to run that you can count it up and you cant get more than five hundred hours matter how hard you try see for total case and we cracked this thing down the middle crosswise and upside down and its been long hard haul and its been very hard on people in the field and its been very hard with shifting patterns of processes being carried along the research line changing organizational staffs and upsets and trying to get people trained and trying to get through and hanging on somehow and so forth its been roughbeen rough but roughness makes very seasoned people it is not all loss see when you recognize that an individual moving forward with certainty will go through fantastic amount of ramifications and upsets and that sort of thingif hes moving on certaintyyou dont have to worry too much about how smooth it is its just how certain it is the hardest part of the problem though and what im talking to you about in this lecturethe hardest part of the problemis getting the individual over these little gradients of wins gradient scale of wins well this is complicated by the fact that an individual can get into certain number of arc breaks and stop auditing he canhe can stop he might not stop forever but hell stop now you recognize let melet make few technical points let mesuffice to say we started in january of last year to pour the coal on were in march of this year and we have won and as soon as people find it out why everything will start going smooth again and everything is working forward at mad rate of speed saturday evening post articles or victorian parliaments or something of that sort for instance victorian parliament thought they could completely break the back of scientology by just shaking it down for counsels fees all the time continuing their hearing on and on and on and on and on well i just cracked the back of that i just wired peter and told him id underwrite his counsels expenses from here on out see of course poor victorian parliament because theyll be sued for every penny of it when we get through but the pointthe point here is weve achieved mont blanc and mont blanc is surrounded by foothills and how do we get the people from the paved street over the foothills at least to the base of mont blanc we havent got any worries at all once we get them in sight of mont blanc as soon as theyve got reality on where theyre going what theyre doing and so forth theyll go through hell and high water in order to move the rest of the way but those early winsthose early winstheyre the problem theres your mother or your father or your relative or somebody and there theyre sitting there and they dont know you know they say it so well or theyre completely openminded about it what occurs at this particular point well you recognize that theres win available and so you give up ninety percent of the time you give up and all im putting into your hands here is little piece of technology what you probably recognize is that win isnt available so you stop trying or doggedly you keep on in frame of mind of realizing win is available so therefore dont create one do you see that audience member mmhm now dissemination totally hangs up on this one problemthe win available and it hangs up from the auditors viewpoint it hangs up from the scientologists viewpoint thats where it hangs up doesnt really hang up from the pcs viewpoint its our recognition of win available look how long i kept trying with the ushathe government i used to write them letter every now and then i used to try to do this and that and so forth i was eventually writing them in very very hopeless frame of mind i mean myrather antagonistically defensive hopeless to hell with you if you did reach out your hand id probably step on it you know thats thisthat kind of frame of mind and you just write them off see just write them off thats your recognition of how much win is available which by the way is monitored and not only by the waybut is monitored directly by your acceptance level of win now the scale of winold chart of attitudesthe scale of win is gradient scale and is not expressed in the early chart of attitudes so im giving you brandnew scale here this scale is vitally important to anybody working in central organization or working as private auditor or any scientologist trying to get anywhere with scientology this is the one that knocks his head off or lets him go over now theres two sides to this scaletwo sides to this scale an outward win of assistance and an inward win of being assisted now its win for anybody if he assists and its lose for somebody if he doesnt assist this is all on the basis of failed intentionand well reduce it down to that in moment you intend to help aunt hattie with her lumbosis and you give her some auditing and maybe she gets over it but she doesnt think she has she doesnt think it did her any good what happened now what does that demand of the auditor it demands that he has more confidence in his own observation than in the pcs estimate of the situation it requires certainty of observation without reassurance from the pc now thats an old datum but its terribly interesting to get involved with because it means that you are so certain that you have accomplished something with the pc that you do not need the pcs statement that it has happened in order to be sure of what you have done now frankly thats an almost impossible level but if you fall short of that level you then go into agreement with the pcs acceptance of wins whats his acceptability of win and if youre expecting that pc to tell you that you have wonand that pc being down scale has very low acceptance index of winsyou then will be made to feel that you have loses i doubt that theres an auditor here thats done any auditing at all that hasnt at one time or another run into this one we get rid of aunt hatties lumbosis for her or we got this person so they longer have screaming nightmares or something and they tell you well that didnt help much they have various ways of saying it it was probably the bromo seltzer you know im longer taking the bromo seltzer and you say what the hell are you talking about you know here i sweat my skull to the bone andover you as case and there you are and so on well now comfort relaxed frame of mind any such acceptable level of serenity you might say being at case and relaxed about things requires that you know the exact situation and know that it is the exact situation the whole component part or all the component parts of this thing called peace of mind or serenity or poise or selfconfidence or anything else depends on the individuals i meani mean true self confidence not walledin maniacal idiocy see the house is burning and you say well im perfectly happy this is the typethis is what this finally got to in india you know youyour indian guru came down scale pretty fast over period of time and his idea is that you should be able to look any disaster in the teeth you see and be completely serene well thats insanity man that doesnt apply you know in other words he had it redefined into the ability to endure or the ability to suffer it was longerno longer what it started out to be and that is you must be able to conceive the truth of any situation that is the true and complete answer to selfconfidence serenity any one of these other desirable things which all adds up to simply peace of mind peace of mind doesnt even mean an inactive frame of mind you know it just means well youre calm about it you know now thatknowing the truth of the existing situationis really the only thing which supports selfconfidence now it may be virtuous to be truthful and it may not be were not speaking of virtue were simply speaking of theof the aspects of truth but most departures from the truth have to do with an attainment of point of safety an individual departs from the truth in order to obtain self security or something of that sort either for the other fellow or himself you see those are departures from the truth thats fear of what might happen to him man is terribly complicated in his civilization by having these points very outvery very very out for instance civilization at every point can force upon the individual lies in other words they can make the individual lie theit begins with the social lie and then theres the police lie and then theres this and that all the uncomfortable things that can happen to you if you were to tell the truth if you were just to tell the truth consistently and continually in the existing civilization according to the standards of the existing civilization you probably couldnt live twentyfour hours see in the first place overfrankness would get you in trouble and cost you probably lots of your friends these are the various arguments which have been offered by past philosophers and so forth if you said nothing but the truth for twentyfour hours why you would lose everybody you knew and you would probably wind up suicide or something but its builteven that philosophy is built to discourage an individual from an announcement of truth well when one fails to announce truth one is then to that degree protecting lie and thus one begins to surround himself with lies in his social atmosphere this is very esoteric this is rarefied air of philosophy im giving you here but its nevertheless very germane its something thatsomething that you should look at the society then by various tricks and mechanisms brings an individual into state of tolerating lies or aiding and abetting lies and so forth and adds some virtue to this and then recognition of the truth gets converted into enduring the truth you see see the ill just stand here and recognize the house is on fire and then i will be all right you see well this is getting pretty wild its taking very upscale characteristics and moving them down very low scale if you stand in the middle of burning house the recognition of your selfconfidence the recognition of the truth of the situation and so forth is not going to keep you from being burned as long as youre in body and wearing flammable clothes that i can guarantee youre going to be roast long pig in time so whatswhats this thing whats this thing were talking about recognition of the truth in any existing situation alone has the power to asis that situation and very often one is confronted without gradient scale with so much truth that one cannot assimilate it or asis it and then one gets swamped with it well thisthis fellows always had an unhappy marriagelets look at this onehes always hadalways had an unhappy marriage and hes often wondered why and actually only the finding of the truth about the marriageonly the finding of the truth about the marriagecould bring calm marriage about right or bring calm frame of mind well thats an easy thing to state and so forth but now lets take this fellow and hes got all of his normal aberrations and upsets and frailties and weaknesses and so forth and we suddenly unload on him the reason why the marriage has been such failure you know he gethe gets it he finds it out all in one and onehalf seconds see he is immediately and instantly overwhumped see thats more truth than he can asis maybe he finds out that his wife has been unfaithful to him for ten years you see something like this only it all unloads on him like that well he cracks up so this actually discourages person from the recognition of truth so what is it really that brings an individual away from recognizing truth and makes him less clearsighted what is it its lack of gradient thats all its just lack of gradient it isnt done on gradient scale it isnt done one little step at time time then enters into this thing we take person who is completely in the middle of the dark ages living utterly under an intolerant church and ferocious political system and we take this individual there he is see hes in stygian godhelpus you see and we face him up with the situation that man would be better off if he were permitted to be educated and if he had some degree of political freedom well those are certainly banal truths to us here in the twentieth century theyre certainly banal truths but believe when they hit the french population in the late 1700s they werent taken banally everybody went nuts they went mad france moved outtried to move out of the dark ages into higher level of truth in two minutes with breathing stops see and truth in that particular instant taken on such fast gradient see too quick too fast man there were aristocrats hanging from every lamp post and sansculottes in every gutter starving to death and on this pile of upset and shock what actually were they advertising it was greater degree of political freedom you see that people ought to be educated i mean you get back down to what were they trying to put across in the french revolution well they actually werent even trying to put across that they should get rid of the king they werent trying to put across many of the factors which have drifted down to us through what is laughingly called history book what they were trying to put across is bunch of fellows had gotten the idea that the dark ages had been over for some time but nobody had been given the benefit of this and so people ought to be little bit better informed of things and the political freedom ought to be little bit better established and they frankly in the early stages of it would have settled for almost anything but nobody would give them any degree of truth the king was very stupid he could have issued decree year or two before he did you see that would have given them certain number of these things and all would have been calm but they were all faced with these situations and what turned against them they got caught right into the middle of there must be truth and the forces of notruth loomed up over the heads of the french people and they went mad you see they had recognized what the truth of an existing situation should be you see but it was too great too fast gradients of any kind murder rape slaughter in all directions and then finally napoleon see i mean almost anything happened to them so the situationthe situation is they came back to very debased state they were more debased after the revolution than they were before it dont forget it france actually has never been political entity of any great stability on wide plain which is very easy for horsemen or tanks to operate on and is very susceptible to invasion at point really protected by anything and has therefore been an unstable political entity for very very long period of time but she frankly has never since really ever held up her head amongst the nations of the worldnever really since she isnt right now i mean this fellow joan of arcpardon megeneral gaulle looks awfully tall for joan of arc i do you suppose somebody has given him wrong pitch on past life you know he thinks of himself as joan of arc its puzzled for some time i just wondered if somebody over there hadnt made misestimate you know got broken meter something but the pointthe point is that this country has actually never risen toto any great status amongst nations and that sounds very peculiar state very peculiar to say that until you realize that the diplomatic language of the world before the french revolution was french and educated man ever spoke in courts of the world in anything but french interesting datum isnt it french succeeded latin as the diplomatic language of the world here was great power they had an empire of very great size and so forth and they started going downhill well they hihit too much truth too littletoo little ability to use that truth to recognize it gradient scale of approach to it evolution in other words from the darkness in which they existed into the light somebody just suddenly turned the klieg lights right straight in their eyes you see and they went mad and they actually have never lifted their heads since all right how do you protect an individual confronting truth and knowledge from this exact occurrence let call to your attention that we very often dont protect the individual from that they get ahold of some early work because this work was designed as aas research into life and the reason it succeeded is because there were holds barred and there was nothing held back it existed as study into what was there somebody gets hold of book about exteriorization or something like this they recognize the truth of the situation see like that and they go right off their hinges then they go around and you cant ever get them to talk to anybody you see about communication or you should run little 8c on the pc or you should do this or do that this guy all you can do is tell him not to be three feet back of their heads you see you got to bang everybody out of their heads you know and so forth and i was joan of arc and everybodys had past life you see and so on they go rattling on at this mad rate well its all true see its all true but they reached there with gradient and they have interim reality and actually get reality on the truth so theres another factor which is involved in truth i know it sounds strange that something else should be involved in truth theres another factor called reality which we could define as this philosophical oddity the ability to assimilate truth see reality is the ability to assimilate truth and therefore when we talk about assimilation we must come around to another point assimilation is dependent upon causedistanceeffect or communication and then theres such thing as an even balance of mind while one is assimilating and we call that affinity you have actually your factors of affinity reality and communication bound up in this thing called truth so truth is truth but truth which has arc hooked up to it is denied the individual and can wrong him and harm him truth must go hand in glove with understanding all the truth in the world can sit in the middle of park for everybody to gaze at and if there is potential of understanding of any kind whatsoever it will not be truth to anyone it will simply be truth its just truth but not truth to anyone so there are two different degrees of truth and it sounds funny splitting it up well get into kants untenable bailiwick first thing we know how things are knowable and unknowable well never go that mad there are things which could never possibly be known by anybody anyplace and so forth thisyou dont realize it but you know thats standard philosophic opinion circa 1964 nobodys ever bettered itfor idiocy transcendentalism do you realize there are things that transcend your ability to understand that you will never understand that nobody will ever understand that they transcend you forever and will always be unknown and so forth the ego that would write that would be too big to fit in the normal hat because how could he recognize it hes in effect saying i am in this benign position where i understand all this but you wonderful way to make slave isnt it debar him forever well fortunately there are such thingsno such things as unattainable truths all truths are attainable we can just reverse transcendentalism all truths are attainable but the work of laotze the work of many philosophers in many ages the work of the adepts the common activities of guru in india at this present moment is totally concerned with the route to truth how does one approach truth they say the truth exists how does one approach it thats an interesting point when you dont know what the truth is its saying how do you get to memphis without knowing that there is any town called memphis or even that there are any towns studying only the route to truth then with nobody around who has final concept of what the truth is is an idiotic activity best relegated to dog kennels lets all sit down and study how to get to rupf and then nobody ever asks whats rupf what do you mean how to get there not even ask this is it road across space measured by time is it spacetime journey that we are making what kind of journey is this to rupf well lets just discuss how to get to rupf and of course we get total bogdown of every philosophic activity at once kant solved it he says you could never know what rupf is that was good solution that kept lot of speculation from occurring the slave masters speculation i meana slave masters operation to prevent anybody from ever reaching anything but now we happen to be in an optimum position with regard to this thing we happen to be in an optimum position by certain clinical demonstrations which are not necessarily therapeutic in any degree we can demonstrate such things as exteriorization we can demonstrate such things then as disconnection with total reality between the individual and his body all right we can demonstrate then that the individual is not body we can demonstrate many points of this particular character so we know where were going were going toward freedom and were going toward free individual now we know additionally that what is is the creation of such an individual i dont care if hes the big thetan or an average thetan its still creation of such an individual weve gone further than this theres difference of order of magnitude of life between man and vegetable you wondered why on earth i was playing around with plants i was trying to see if there were different orders of life that responded on different wavelengths and so forth in my own crude way that was about as close as i could come to testing it out very recently one of the great universities with one of the great budgets with one of thewell we wont go on on that particular coursehave finally discovered that you can train one generation of monocells and have them respondhave the next generation respond to the stimuli that the first generation was trained with in other words theyre getting something there which they say the memory in the monocell transfers complete into the next generation thats better stated than their experiment because i did those experiments in 1938 and they have not even come up to really interpreting them theirs is something like life eternal is about to take place via the monocell theyve come to the conclusion that all life is cellular activities and so forth and that cells are made out of mud or something i dont know what theyrewhat they think or are up against but theyre about where i was in 38 see and they will branch off of that because they will very rapidly run into things which are not digestible as truth you see and they wont get their next budget thats how truth never gets discovered you see its unreal to the people who are giving them the money so anyway we know then that certain phenomena exist and great many of these phenomena are demonstrable on research auditing level which we seldom employ today since all that work has been done so we know what truth we are trying to attain now everybody has to greater or lesser degree some sympathetic harmonic with that truth see they know these things are true at some level even the level of feel do you see now whats their reaction to that truth it all depends on how much truth they can assimilate or how much reality they have on the approach to this truth so what is life what is life well we know that its not city in the sky nor spot on road map we know that it lives right where the pcs sitting we know were continuously in contact with it so its not really journey across time and space but its journey of undoing the lies by which the individual has road marked himself in the lies the nonvolitional actions the conditioned responsesif you want to use an archaic term belonging to the nineteenth century various things have marked this fellows road and he has traveled downward hes traveled downward theres lot of experimental data which exist on the fact that he has traveled downward the size of the gpm in the third series is unconfrontably larger than the size of the gpm in the current series in other words you just go three serieses back from the present series you see and my goodness this fellowsyoure staring at stuff that must have been made by much more powerful being you see he made it himself and so you can recognize that he is going downhill that he is on downhill road now we have to find out what milemarked the downhill road what put him down to the next curve every time see and all we have to do to recover the individual fortunatelyall we have to do to recover him and his ability by our rationale is undo these mileposted turns for the worse see what was he doing repeatedly and continually that was putting him on downhill so we are traveling road that has been traveled but traveling it backwards so we know what this road is the way the tao whatever you wanted to call this thing you see we know what that road is it is the road that the individual has followed from degree of perfection and beingness and selfnessnot selfishness but just being himselfon down to disintegration forgettingness bluntingness until hes in the state you find him in the pcs chair now he has traveled that road and all the auditor has to do is walk him back that road its alreadyits already there its all milemarked you see and just get him to the point where he started to make that road downward in order to recover the individual which we know existed to begin with the potential the individual has sitting right in the chair so the road to truth then adds up to us as the individual potential the situations in which that individual potential can be lessenedthats all part of the truth and what has happened actually to this individualthats all part of the truth how this individual is related to the remainder of the universewhich is all part of the truth and what we can do to restore the potential of that individualand thats all part of the truth so whats truth now seen from the viewpoint of an auditorseen from the viewpoint of an auditorits what actually happened or the situation which actually exists at any given moment in the state of beingness of an individual thats truth dont say truth is the ultimate that we are seeking to attain truth is that which exists i know i contradict myself i once gave lecture on the road to truth well i mightmight better have said the road to perfection or the road to an ultimate truth you see but were just taking apart this thing as an anatomy and by doing so we see although this is very esoteric discussion indeedprobably been more philosophy factual and backed up on the subject of truth stated here in the last few minutes than has ever been stated before on this planeteasily see because its usually all hedgedup you see in so many pitches and so many directions that people want you to go so many curves on the line that you cant separate the wheat from the chaff we find ourselves in this then interesting position of knowing where were going and knowing how to get there and knowing what the road is and knowing the processes that we have to go through and the disciplines which we have to master and execute in order to arrive at that point all these things we have but amongst these things this is one that we have not mastered an estimation of the individuals ability to conceive of truth here sits this greengrocer and you tell him something about scientology well now you might saybe using the word scientology but you are talking to him about the road to perfection you are talking to him about the road to ultimate truth you are talking to him about the composition of himself you are talking to him on the subject of who are you what do you consist of what potentials could you have what potentials have you been robbed of or have robbed yourself of where are you going what is life what is your relationship to your fellows what is your relationship on any dynamic you may be using the word scientology but these are the things which you have embarked upon to discuss and the unanswered question is what can he recognize yes you could throw all the truth down his throat and he might suddenly in stareyeyed startlement you see go about half off his hinges what do you know you know there are several things you can do that perform an overwhump of this particular kind minor and greater and theres reason why you shouldnt do it im not saying there are certain things which you mustnt do but if you were to say to him try not to be three feet back of your head and he banged three feet back of his head my god hes standing there looking at this hwph theres an awful lot of truth im and its it lot of you have hadthe old timers around here have had that experience you know im and its it now i know you know huhhwuhh uhhuuh yes see and youve also had this experience two hours later what exteriorization i wasnt exteriorized well possibly something happened but i dont know now youve shot the individual momentarily into the rarefied air of he could see it but he couldnt have it so you can show people things they cant have and theres how you generate an unreality you show people truth which they are then unable to achieve attain or accept for instance if we didnt have gradient scale now of getting from the man in the street to class v we would very soon within year or so find ourselves in very involved situation of nothing we knew to be true would be true to them it would only be true to few of us it would become very unreal to these people now if youll notice theres common denominator to everything ive been telling you hit with too much truth the individual thereafter degrades thats common denominator to all of this common denominator to france common denominator to you getting off the airplane any of this sort of thing you hit this individual he exteriorizes bang he said im im spirit i dont have mass the body is body im different than it two hours later hes harder to process now whats going on here well it means the individuals acceptance of win the ability to win has been excited and has lost in the process he cant have it he cannot attain it this one he cant win its too much and when i think of saints of olden times and im very sure some of those boys were capable of throwing around the partridges and making the birds all sing in cminor simultaneously or something around this you know and piling up loaves of bread or driving swine off the empire state building im sure theres been this kind of action you see in the past because its potential notice that its the common denominator of the type of action which excites man and which drives him afterwards into degrade quite interesting christians killed more christians in one year in alexandria than the roman empire in its entire persecution of christianity ever executed this is the action of degraded people why were these people degraded well they were hit in the teeth with too much miracle nobody could ever repeat the miracle and you show one method one method in christianityim not against christianitybut you show oneone method by which an individual living in certain way can in actual fact achieve any of the abilities of sainthood why this is very very interesting if you look this over you go around repenting ye repenting ye and you go around debasing ye debasing ye and all youre going to do is key in few actual gpms you go around turning the other cheek all the time youre going to introvert i knew we had it made when saturday evening post article began to paint us as dangerous people theres just thread going through that of the scientologist is sort of violent fellow theres thisjust this hint coming up thats very healthy thats very very healthy because every time group or movement has been recognized as totally peaceful everybody has shot them right down like dogs i gave you an example of that in one lecture one day jewish people poor people more peaceful people on earth and look whats happened to them so its not unhealthy to be thought of that way but it was interesting that this fellow without any evidence could come to these conclusions and so forth were not dangerous people nobodys just trying to paint it this but to paint the individual scientologist as dangerous or violent person in any way shape or form is about as far as you can get from truth but for the public to tend to believe that or for an individual to start to believe that or scientologist start to be fought in some particular line is not an unhealthy sign thats very good sign it means that youre not that introverted but our materialsour materials are very prone to lay great deal of truth out in front of people well it puts you on withhold not to do so so there is slightest reason under the sun to do so lay out the truth but provide the road and that road is provided by having levels of acceptable truths or realities that an individual can attainattainable realities in view of the fact that you cant start running him in the next ten minutes up the side of mont blanc like mountain goat it requires that you establish and rehabilitate his ability to win in some fashion and then increase it in some fashion to eventually achieve the point where he can have truth and that way you wont just throw everybody around you into complete frothing ecstatic worshipping apathy i cant think of anything worse myself you may haveyou may have different opinions about it youwhen you get them run out you let know but that isthat is where any philosophy errs this has been solved in the past when anybody got ahold of piece of truth they then built up hierarchy of secrecy they then built up class secrecy level well that will operate in any event because you cant expect somebody who knows nothing about tr 0 and has never audited pcto be able to sit in an auditing chair and audit pc much less on anything very touchy so certain amount of training and skilla lot of ithas to exist before that level is attained this is selfdenying mechanism this is mechanism of automatic denial due to mere fact that it intervenes some training you see and it intervenes some understanding it takes while to assimilate the materials involved and so forth but outright pitch for secrecy is intolerable well you cant know that because you are only class iii we can hear it now around the central organization the class iv auditors have secret meeting because theyre covering materials which shouldnt be known at level i you see i can just see some haggardlooking girl standing sadly out in the hall and so forth shes just been ejected because they have found out that she flunked her class iii examinations and she was present in meeting thatthat was now going to take up technique zed you see and shes not supposed to know that because if anyif theres any similarity between what im talking about and certain orders which exist on the planet its purely intentional the routethe route only demands this it only demands this of you it does not matter what you tell people it does not matter what you show people it does not matter to what degree you momentarily or temporarily overwhelm public that is not the final point the final point is whether or not you provide for them gradient scale of acceptable wins and acceptable realities by which they can progress to higher state and better understanding and if you can do that you succeed and if you can merely shock them out of their boots youll inevitably fail you see actually it doesnt matter what percentage of them does take that route that doesnt happen to matter you dont have to have full 100 percent sweep you see but that route must exist and it must exist wide open not back of narrow locked closed doors otherwise you never make any progress toward any ultimate freedom or betterment of affairs anywhere okay audience mmhm thank you
