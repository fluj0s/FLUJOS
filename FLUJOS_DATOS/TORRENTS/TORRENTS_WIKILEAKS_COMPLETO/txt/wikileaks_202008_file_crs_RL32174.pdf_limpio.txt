for period of 3 to 5 years recipients of 21stcclc grants are to use them for out of school time activities that advance student academic achievement the programs focus is now exclusively on these activities for children and youth and on educational activities for their families increasing public and congressional attention has been focused on the program in part because the 21stcclc program has grown rapidly from 750000 in funding in its first year fy1995 to 1 billion in fy2004 public support for after school programs is very strong how ever recent evaluation of the 21stcclc program based on data from the 20002001 school year conducted for the us department of education did not find significant improvements in most academic outcomes the reauthorized 21stcclc program requires state and local recipients to use funds to help students acquire the skills they need in order to meet state academic achievement standards employing scientifically based research where relevant and to demonstrate the success of their programs in achieving academic improvement several issues have arisen regarding implementation of the reauthorized program some of the hurdles that states and program implementers must confront in achieving academic goals include the difficulty in securing participation by students particularly middle schoolers in progr am focused on academics the relatively limited amount of program time per student on average in which to make difference in academic achievement and th vast divergence in after school program content and goals although there is limited research to date on the 21stcclc program itself there is an extensive and growing body of research on after school programs more generally this research has provided many examples of promising practices in after school programs that focus on academic imp rovement some of the elements found promising for program success are well qualified and extensively trained staff connection to the school day curriculum opportunities for one on one tutoring and structure designed to achieve clear goals this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32174contents introduction 1

with grantees selected by the us department of education ed awards were for up to 3 years and were required to include at least 4 out of 13 potential activities intended to serve the local community1funds were required to be equitably distributed among urban and rural areas across the nation among the states and among rural and urban areas within states the program shifted in emphasis as the amount appropriated for the program increased the original authorizing language required the secretary of ed to give priority to those 21stcclc projects that offer broad selection of services which address the needs of the community2beginning with the programs significant expansion in fy1998 an add itional prioritywas addedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32174crs2 3for ongoing updated information

with public notice of such availability provided10 evaluation issues most of the research into after school programs has examined after school programs in general rather than 21stcclc programs in particular in part because of the relative newness of the 21stcclc program the research often focuses on individual programs that provide high quality out of school time services to group of children or youth over an extended period of time in general research that employs random assignment methods is c onsidered the most rigorous however because of the rarity of such research designs in the field many surveys of after school programs discuss at least some programs that did not employ random assignment in order to be able to examine vidence from the field on what elements in programs are most promising there have been many surveys of this quasi experimental and case study research that have indicated positive effects from after school programs on variety of outcomes11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32174crs5 11continued programs us department of health and human services and the national institute for child health and human development 1998 and jacquelynne

contracted with mathematica for both an implementation and an impact study of 21stcclc afterschool programs the mathematica study is the most rigorous study to date specifically focused on the 21stcclc program the mathematica study is multi year study based on baseline and follow up data collected on 4400 middle school students and 1000 in the first year element ary school students data are collected from students teachers principals progr am staff members and school records the first results from the evaluation were published in february 2003 based on 1 year of data for the 20002001 school year the evaluation did not find significant improvements from 21stcclc programs in most academic outcomes or in the numbers of latchkey kids children in self care the study was designed to focus on outcomes of typical 21stcclc programs rather than of programs implementing best practices13 the middle school sample was based on data for 4400 students because these middle school programs

results from the complete elementary sample w ill be available in the winter of 20032004 random sampling was facilitated by the fact that many elementary school 21stcclc programs were unable to serve all the stude nts who would have liked to participate the elementary schools in the initial sam ple had higher percentage of minority students especially african americans and had higher poverty levels than other elementary centers overall that are in the same cohort nevert heless the studys authors believe the eleme ntary school findings have strong internal validity for attributing student outcome differences to the 21stcentury program15 typical elementary center had 45 nutes to an hour for snack and homework an academic activity for an hour and recreati onal or other activity for the remaining 1 to 2 hours however some elementary cente rs had programs that were structured differently some focused on skill buildin g for state assessment tests for example16 overall positive effects

results from the mathematica study has prompted considerable discussion and controvers part of the controversy regarding the mathematica evaluation is due to the fact that the study results were linked to significant reduction in fy2004 spending for the 21stcclc program proposed by the administration in its budget request critiques of the mathematic study have noted that the results are only first year results and are for the 20002001 school year before the requirements of the newly reauthorized program were in place for xample in 2003 policy commentary the nongovernmental forum for youth investment states at least dozen other studies that em ployed experimental and quasi experimental designs offer different more positive findings about afterschool programs drastic cuts are recommended based on the findings of one study using one year of data collected on programs that are only few years old when positive findings fromstrong studies bound such decisions should be informed by an accumulation of documented knowledge17 additionally some have argued that programs that are relatively new and undergoing changes should not be evaluate d for funding decisions at that stage of their development others have critic ized some aspects of the methodology employed in the study18 implementation issues how will after school programs and states meet the 21stcclc program accountability requirements what are the hurdles program implementers might encounter in achieving academic improvement goals data from the first year mathematica studyhave provided insight into some of the implementation issues that have been encountered by 21stcclc programs academic improvement the reauthorized 21stcclc program requires that programs focus on academic assistance and enrichment and that

apr 29 1999 washington 1999 21mathematica and decision information resources when schools stay open late p 2 1 that states and program implementers must confront in achieving academic goals include firstly the difficulty in securing participation by students particularly middle schoolers in program focused n academic improvement secondly the relatively limited amount of program time pe r student on average in which to make difference in academic achievement and fi nally the vast divergence in after school program content and goals firstly because programs are usually voluntary students must find the after school programs appealing the mathema tica study found that on average middle school students attended center only 32 days year and elementary school students 58 days year and attenda nce was found to drop off as the year progressed thus low attendance rates and the decline in participation over time may be significant impediment to academic improvement because participation is voluntary it may occur on regular or d rop in basis for middle school students the decision of whether or not to participate is generally made by the student programs must be enticing to potential par ticipants by not making them too much like school and by including recreational nd other activities that appeal to middle schoolers mathematica inter viewed students who chose not to participate to explore this phenomenon students who had chosen not to participate surveyed in six selected programs said that they would rather hang out after school were involved in other organized activities after school or were not interested in the activities almost half of the students thought the centers were mostly place kids go when their parents are at work and quarter considered them just for kids who need help in school participants who had stopped attending echoed these sentiments19 secondly student success in programs f ocusing on academic achievement has been found to be strongly correlated with more time when learning actually occurs time on task or academic learning time20however most after school programs have limited time on task for academic activities the after school programs evaluated by mathematica most often pr ovided homework assistance as the main type of academic assistance and in many cases the assistance was minimal in middle schools visited for example site visitors observed that most homework sessions resembled study halls in which students were expected to know thei r assignments bring their materials and work independently these sessions typically consisted of about 20 students monitored by 2 staff members usually certified teachers or certified teacher and paraprofessional although having teachers from the host school oversee homework sessions offered potentially fru itful path for helping students after school the caliber of homework assistance was low 21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32174crs9 22first year results from mathematica did not find more positive outcomes for middle school students who participated for more days during the year however it did find that these students were more disadvantaged and more motivated on average than

clearinghouse n what works at httpwwwwwcorg 2620 usc 7174these data indicate that some existing p rograms may have difficulty providing academic assistance of sufficient duration and with sufficient time on task to significantly improve academic outcomes there is also evidence however that more attendance alone may not be sufficient22these issues have caused some to ask whether an expectation of significantly improved academic outcomes is reasonable for these after school programs holding afterschool programs accountable for improving standardized test scores at time when schools are struggling under the weight of this demand makes little sense at best policy makers could push for proportionate joint accountability and encourage schools and out of school programs to work together to achieve this longterm goal23 finally programs receiving 21stcclc funds have traditionally been diverse group with different goals content and str uctures as consequence monitoring setting goals and evaluating these diverse programs can be difficult 21stcentury is funding stream that provid resources to range of programs many of which are not connected by an overarching system at the local or state level there is guarantee that grantees are part of networks that set common standards or create shared sense of accountability24 because of this diversity and lack of coor dination widespread dissemination of promising practices and their implementation across programs is made more difficult among the goals of the reauthorized 21stcclc are providing clearer focus for programs and

indicated to mathematica their desire to continue programs after 21stcclc funding expired but few had successfully lined up sufficient outside funding site visitors observed few concrete actions leading toward sustainability at the time of the visits about onethird of grantees had made plans and taken actions to sustain their program half had developed some plans but had not yet taken any action in surveys of center coordinators and host school principals only 10 of principals and 12 of coordinators reported that funding sources had been identified or secured27 mathematica cited three factors that potentially impede program sustainability 1 project directors were ften responsible for host of tasks many times including non21stcclc tasks and as consequence had little time for planning for the future and seeking potential funding sources 2 project directors in remote or poor areas expressed concerns to interviewers about the lack of availability in their area of potential sources of future funding and 3 the lack of matching requirement for local grantees may have delayed planning for future funding additionally foundation community and local funding for these programs is limited and the 3 year grant period provided relatively s hort time frame to conduc t future planning28 the reauthorized 21stcclc program has increased the time frame for grants they may now be up to 5 years and permits states to require matching funds directions for the future what have researchers found that may be helpful in creating effective after school programs as noted above research on after school programs is by and large not based on 21stcclc programs because of its relative newness but on other individual after school programs and large ly focuses on promising practices gleaned from high quality after school programs29for broadly focused after school programs one researcher has stated tha t effective programs must have supportive staff positive peer relations and opportun ities for sustained participation in meaningful activities which may be s ports arts music or academics30for after school programs with an academic focus some research indicates that successful programs need well qualified and extensiv ely trained staff connection to the school day curriculum opportunities for one on one tutoring and clear goals with well laid out structure to achieve their goals31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32174crs11 31continued p 55 32ncrel viewpoints 10 afterschool learning and beyond l r n i n gp i n t associates 2003 33us department of education and the cs mott foundation after school summit summary report 2003the north central regional educationa l laboratory ncrel has published several resources on after school programs including the beyond the bell toolkit which is comprehensive guide intended to provide advice on setting up an effective after school program ncrel cites five ele ments that it believe s are essential for effective programs first programs need to be design ed based on individual students academic needs revealed by the schools student assessments and teacher reports the regular classroom teacher s hould regularly share the specific needs of individual students skills that should be learned more completely with afterschool staff second staff need specific conten t knowledge and instructional strategies to facilitate learning it is not enough to have staff that simply supervise homework completion third class sizes need to be small generally ratio of 115 orlower for younger students seems to be ideal fourth there needs to be consistent formal and specificcommunication between extended and regular day staff daily planners and academic communication logs can serve as vehicles for studentled conferencing among students staff and parents finally programs need to be evaluated for their effect on raising student achievement this means collecting pre and post assessment data and conducting longitudinal studies on the effects of extended academic support32 additionally ed arnold schwarzenegger and the cs mott foundation hosted an after school summit in the summer of 2003 to explore ways to improve and measure the performance of 21stcclc after school programs the attendees developed an extensive list of student perfo rmance indicators in several major areas academic social skill building health and community that were viewed as important in indicating success in after sc hool programs in addition beginning list of evaluation measures and program elements essential for attaining improvement in these student performance indicator s was developed by the attendees33 as states and the local grantees work to adapt to the changes required by the 21st cclc program as reauthorized by pl 107110 they confront variety of difficulties in implementing successful pr ograms some of which are discussed here however they will also have increasing access to growing body of research and evaluation including the best practice literature to help guide the evolution of these programs
