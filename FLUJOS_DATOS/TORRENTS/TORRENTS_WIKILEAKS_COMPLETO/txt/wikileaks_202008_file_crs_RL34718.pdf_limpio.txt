taken from the federal assistance award data system faads and the federal procurem ent data system next generation fpdsng which are important sources of information for usaspendinggov they note that

2590 the federal funding accountability and transpar ency act ffata pl 1092821 according to supporters of the new law the ffata was an attempt to reduce wasteful and unnecessary spending by the federal g overnment including spending on funds earmarked for special projects2 to that end the legislation required the office of management and budget omb to establis h publicly available website that would allow users to search for detailed informa tion about entities that are awarded federal grants loans contracts and other forms of assistance using the website supporters asserted citizen or watc hdog group would be able to easily determine how much money was given to which organi zations and for what purposes3 the premise of the legislation was that by making the details of federal spending av ailable to the public government officials would be less likely to fund projects that might be perceived as wasteful supporters of the legislation so suggested that the website would give citizens the opportunity to better understand how the gove rnment distributes funds and enable the public to become more invol ved in the discussion of federal spending priorities4 three of the primary categories of fede ral expenditures and obligations to be included in the database federal grants loans nd contracts represent significant element of federal spending according to the most

include corpora tions associations partnerships sole proprietorships limited liability companies limited liability partnerships states and localities by january 1 2009 by law the website must include access to information on subgrantees and subcontractors that receive federal funds through primary award recipient the act excluded indi vidual recipients of federal assistance and organizations with

all categories of awards are ultimately to be covered by the database including grants contracts subgrants subcontracts and loans two special provisions addressed particular types of transactions individual transactions of less than 25000 are exempt and credit card transactions were ex cluded until october 1 2008 to achieve greater transparency the act required the website to provide the

the federal assistance award data system faads and grantsgov11 according to the act user must be able to access information from these databases directly through the website the act was explicit on this point it was not acceptable merely to provide links to these or other databases because that would force users to search for information at different websites as previously noted the act did not re quire information on subcontractors and subgrantees to be included in the databa until january 1 2009 the delay reflected the fact that information on subrecipients was not collected consistently across federal agencies and programs to addre ss existing gaps in the data on subawards the act required omb to implement pilot program that tested the feasibility of having primary recipients provide information on their subgrantees and subcontractors there was provision in th legislation that allowed federal award recipients and subrecipients to be reimbursed for the costs associated with collecting and reporting data on subrecipients the act also specified that any requirements for collecting data on subawards made by state and local governments under block and formula grants be

reliability of underlying data database of the breadth and depth contemplated by the ffata is only as useful as the quality of the information it contains as noted previously the act referred to three existing databases as likely sources of information for the new public database faads fpdsng nd grantsgov usaspendinggov draws extensively from faads and fpdsng but it is unclear whether data from grantsgov is also incorporated numbe r of observers have expressed concern about relying on information from faads and fpdsng both government officials and knowledgeable members of th public describe si gnificant weaknesses in the databases such as incomplete and inaccurate information that cannot be quickly corrected these observers suggest that substantial changes in the collection reporting and verification of information relating to federal assistance awards would likely be necessary before faads and fpdsng might be considered reliable sources of information in 2005 report gao noted that fpdsng users lacked confidence in the data provided largely because there was rigorous system in place to ensure the data were accurate and complete13 in 2006 panel of procur ement experts attempted to use fpdsng in their evaluation of fede ral contracting opera tions but reportedly found so many errors in the data that the chairman declared th at fpdsng is not reliable database14 one reason the data are inaccurate is human error contract information might be incorrectly entered into fpdsng by inexperienced users who have received minimal training15 moreover agencies might vary in the degree to which they fill out the fields in the database resulting in data of uneven quality in one instance fpdsng users reportedly complained that the database failed to consistently identify contracts

have been reported with faads th governments primary source of grant award information in 2006 report gao reviewed 86 federally funded grant programs and determined that in the majority of cases the administering agencies provided data incomplete data or inaccurate data to faads over threeyear period18 the report concluded that these problems occurred because 1 the census bureau lacked the resources to ensure agencies were submitting accurate and timely data 2 agen cy program officials lacked knowledge of faads reporting requirement s and 3 agencies had not implemented sufficient oversight to ensure they were submitting accurate data census bureau official concurred with these findings adding that number of data elements required by the ffata are not uniformly captured by federal agencies or grant award recipients such as information on subrecipients and th congressional district in which federal funds are spent19 the official also noted that agencies are currently required to update their information in faads on quart erly basis so it might take time for agencies to develop the capability to upda faads within 30 days of making an award as the ffata requires some members of congress have also expressed cerns about fpdsng and faads during floor debate of the bill in the house one supporter cautioned that the ffatas potential to improve oversight of federal funds while substantial would be largely determined by the degr ee to which improvements in fpdsng and faads were made dur ing implementation20 another supporter expressed concern that the problems with fpdsng and faads were so significant that if the administration is not committed to making this legislation work all we will get is another incomplete and hardtouse database21 after the ffata was

the data are to be submitted to meet the requirements of the ffata23 on november 9 2007 omb issued its most comprehensive memorandum on data submission requirements under the ffata24 this memorandum required agencies to submit plan to omb by december 1 2007 that identified gaps in their data on grants contracts and loans and outlined their plans to address any deficiencies in addition it required agencies to implement in ternal controls to ensure the accuracy integrity and timeliness of their submissions the reliability of agency data submissions remains concern less than three months after the launch of usaspendi nggov in december 2007 omb criticized the quality of the data that agencies were providing in memo randum dated march 6 2008 omb called on agencies to redouble th efforts to improve data quality as much of the data submitted for posting to the usaspendinggov in the past has been incomplete untimely and in accurate review of the website on october 3 2008 more than two years after the ffata was enacted bears out this assessment with regard to timeliness of data the ffata requires award information to be posted to the website not more than 30 days after the award is made the contract data available october 3 how ever had not been updated in six weeks while grant and loan updates ranged from august 2008 to august 2007 meaning some agencies had not updated their assi stance award data in over year25 the lack of timely information may result in significant gaps in award data on usaspendinggov for example on october 3 2008 the website provided fy2007 and fy2008 assistance data for two ag encies the department of homeland security dhs and the small business administration sba which had combined assistance outlays in fy2006 of over 750 billi on if assistance outlays at those two agencies were at similar levels for fy2007 and fy2008 then usaspendinggov may be missing data for as much as 15 trilli on in assistance awards just for dhs and

agencies did submit fy2007 or fy2008 data it of ten appeared to be incomplete on october 3 2008 usaspendinggov showed that the social security administra tion ssa reported 5399 billion in assistance outlays for fy2006 but only 38 million in fy2007 similarly the website showed that the department of agriculture reported assistance outlays of 1470 billion for fy2006 but only 247 billion for fy2007 the partment of h ousing and urban development hud repor ted 1003 billion in assistance outlays in fy2006 but nothing for fy2007 here again it appear s that data on hundreds of billions of dollars in assistance awards are not av ailable on usaspending gov as mandated by the ffata implementation costs concerns have been expressed re garding the cost of implementing usaspendinggov two types of costs are at issue the costs of implementing the act as whole and the costs associated with the development of information on subawards overall implementation costs it is not known how much the initial implementation of usaspendi nggov has cost there is publicly available estimate for example of the dollar value of the time it has taken federal agency employees to collect validate and submit award information it is also not known whether agencies have had to modify their internal data collection systems to obtain information not previously collected im plementation costs ma not be distributed evenly across agencies agencies that have reported little or information for fy2007 or fy2008 may have found that they are further behind other agencies in terms of their ability to obtain the required assistance award data and may have to invest more resources to meet the ffatas reporting provisions prior to enactment cbo estimated th at the ffata would cost 15 million to establish and maintain the new database of federal assistance between 2007 and 201126 the cbo estimate however was based on ombs assurance that the government currently collects all of the information needed to create comprehensive database on federal spending27 the estimate might thus reflect the cost of simply combining existing systems without fully accounting for other costs associated with improving the quality of the data in those systems one expert familiar with fpdsng and faads said that an enormous amount of data cleanup will be necessary to correct inaccura information in those systems28 another

national association of state auditors comptrollers and treasurers nasact expressed strong reservati ons about the potential financ ial and administrative burden that the proposed reporting requireme nts would impose on state and local governments30 in particular nasact noted th at collecting data on subgrantees would be very very costly for state nd local governments since federal grant funds are often passed down mu ltiple levels eg state receiving federal assistance gives subgrant to organization which in turn gives subgrant to organization b additional costs might be incurred under the bill nasact said if state and local grant recipients were required to modify th eir financial systems to collect and report any other new information after s 2590 wa s amended to include the pilot program for collecting information on subgrantees nasact said it supported the bill with the new language but also noted that it still believed obtaining all the required information will be challenge31 some trade groups have made similar arguments regarding the cost of collecting subcontractor information the council of defense and space industry associations codsia for example has reportedly stat ed that prime cont ractors do not normally collect subcontractor information at the level of detail require d by the ffata and that doing so would become significan t administrative burde n on both contractors and subcontractors32 the subaward reporting pilot program mandated by the ffata was intended to identify the least burdensome and most costeffective method for collecting and reporting data on subawards information from the pilot program is available yet however as it did not commence until oct ober 8 2008 more than year beyond the statutory deadline of july 1 200733 explanation for the delay has been provided after the pilot program is comp lete it may provide sense of the costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34718crs10 34 the three other cosponsors were senators carper coburn and mccain along with senator obama these three senators were cosponsors of the ffataand technical challenges that agencies may face in collecting and reporting subaward data the pilot will only test reporting award data from firsttier subrecipients however and there may be greater costs and technical challenges associated with collecting data from lower tier subrecipients which tend to be smaller and may have less welldeveloped reporting systems in place earmarks and wasteful spending although one of the stated purposes of the legislation was to enable the public to use the online database to identify congressional earmarks it is unclear how users of usaspendinggov might actually do this since neither faads nor fpds ng collect that information not all gran ts loans or contr acts are congressionally directed some are at the discretion of th responsible federal agency unless the congressionally directed items are specifically identified as such the website will be of limited value for purposes of earmark identification the ffata also intended the website to provide the public with an opportunity to assess the worthiness of individual aw ards the manner in which an award is described under the award title field on usaspendinggov might lead the public to draw different conclusions about the value of given federally funded project for example project that some believe has merit might be descri bed in manner that puts it in an unfavorable light in this wa award descriptions might influence the publics perception of whether fundi ng action is wasteful or not proposed legislation to amend the ffata on june 3 2008 senator barack obama on behalf of himself and three cosponsors introduced new legislation to expand and improve th quality of the data posted to usaspendinggov34 s 3077 the strengthening transparency and accountability in federal spending ac t of 2008 would amend the ffata and require usaspendinggov to provide new information on federal awards

the highest lowest and median offered price among acceptableprocurement bids details about the amount of each c ontract awarded including profit incentives and options to expand or extend contract

competitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34718crs11 35 s 3077 uses the definition of congressionally directed spending item found in pl 110 81 which amends the senates standing rules and therefore applies

performance inform ation would lack proper context he argued such as metric to help the public understand the comparative severity of actions taken against contractor without the proper c ontext he wrote the public might presume that all such cases represent probable or proven misconduct of serious nature when some actions are routine and ot her actions may result in findings of misconduct he questioned how making ch information available to the public would improve federal procurement oversight the ffata and s 3077 also differ in that the former identified specific sources of data to use in implement ation but the latter does not until these data sources are identified it will not be possible to estimate the cost and technical challenges associated with implementing s 3077 it is not known for example the extent to which agencies are already collecting the data they would be required to report the quality of that data and the cost of collecting data not currently captured by agencies implementing the reporting provisions of s 3077 may also pose technical challenges for agencies the data that must be reported under the b ill which range from workplace discrimination to violations of the clean water act may now be located in half dozen or more parate databases and it is not known how difficult it would be to incorporate these databases into the usaspendinggov search function httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34718crs13 concluding observations although usaspendinggov was operatin g before the statutory deadline implementation of the ffata may be considered behind schedule in that the data made available to the public remain incomplete and untimely the effectiveness of usaspendinggov as an oversight tool is diminished in proportion to the amount of award information it does not provide in addition because the ffata subawa rd pilot program was not launched by the statutory deadline it seems unlikely that subaward information will be incorporated into usaspendinggov by january 1 2009 as the act requires if the pilot program concludes in november 2008 there may not be sufficient time to address the problems identified by the pilot particularly if the solutions involve developing new financial da ta collection and reporting pr ocesses the ffata does permit the director of omb to extend the reporting deadline by an additional 18 months for subawards that were passed thro ugh state local or tribal governments the director may also exempt entities with gross income from all sources of 300000 or less from subaward reporting require ments until the director determines that such reporting would not cause undue burden on the subaward recipients it is possible the director will exercise these authorities which could delay reporting on subawards that passed through govern ment entities until 2011 while smaller entities those with less than 300000 in total income could be exempt indefinitely implementation of the ffata could be ffected by enactment of s 3077 the new legislation would expand the informa tion about federal assistance awards and recipients which some observers may view as increasing transparency primary objective of the ffata in particular s 3077 would require usaspendinggov to identify earmarked awards function that the website does not currently have s 3077 would also establish new rules to enhance the quality of data on usaspendinggov which as previous ly discussed remains an issue expanding the data available through usaspendinggov might also slow full implementation of the ffata agencies and award recipients are still developing procedures that will enable them to meet the ffatas reporting standards and omb continues to address the technical challenges associated with posting data to usaspendinggov some observers suggest that the requirements of s 3077 would strain already tight agency and recipient resources and ultimately hamper ffata implementation
