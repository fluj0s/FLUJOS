master monograph rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandami 68 know thyself and thou shalt know the universe and the gods 2007 supreme grand lodge of the ancient mystical order ros√¶ crucis 006 published by the grand lodge of the english language jurisdiction amorc inc 0707mandamus 6 concurrence 2this monograph deals with objective consciousness nd the subconscious of humans such subject has always fascinated phi losophers and mystics psychologists and psychiatrists are now quite inter ested in the analysis of mental processes however their investigations are often limited in that they do not sufficiently take into account the spiritual or igin of those processes it is true that the study of human consciousness is infinitely complex because as jc friedrich von schiller writes in the following quot ation it is very difficult to go back to the source whence issue our ideas of ne cessity and of universality nonetheless we hope that the rosicrucian teachings will enable you to better grasp this fascinating subject neither abstraction nor experience can bring us bac k to the source whence issue our ideas of necessity and of universality t his source is concealed in its origin in time from the observer and its super sensuous origin from the researches of the metaphysician but to sum up in few words consciousness is there and together with its immutable unity t he law of all that is for humans is established as well as of all that is to be by us for our understanding and our activity the ideas of truth and of right prese nt themselves inevitable incorruptible immeasurable even in the age of sen suousness and without our being able to say why or how we see eternity in the necessary following the contingent it is thus that without any share on the part of the subject the sensation and selfconsciousness arise and the ori gin of both is beyond our volition as it is out of the sphere of our knowled ge jc friedrich von schiller 17591805 3rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 6 dear fratres and sorores we have devoted the preceding monographs to the stu dy of time and space because it is important for you to understand well that we deal with two concepts which have counterpart in the spiritual world in other words they concern only our earthly life and the perception wh ich our physical senses give us of our material environment this is why we have said that time and space correspond to an objective state of consciousness r if you prefer to product of our objective consciousness of what then does this for m of consciousness consist this is the subject we shall examine today objective consciousness by definition our objective consciousness is the totality of processes which enable us to per ceive and interpret the physical world in this respect the objective cons ciousness depends upon our five physical senses and upon the five objective fa culties that are associated with themie sight hearing touch taste and s mell it also depends on our various mental processesin other words our memory imagination thinking and generally speaking on mental potentials which psychologists designate by the term subjective functions that is why rosicrucians feel that the objective faculties and subjective functions form in their tirety single phase of human consciousnessin this instance its objective phase the purely objective aspect of our objective consciousness concerns the percept ion of impressions coming to us from outside whereas its subjective aspect i s more particularly associated with the interpretation of these impressions and th resulting mental activity if these few remarks seem difficult to grasp at pre sent do not be worried they will be the subject of much more detailed study i n future degree within the framework of this postulant section we want to draw your attention to the limited and illusory aspect of our objective consciousness in effect our five senses deceive us constantly and ften lead us into error in our judgments moreover they are unable to perceive ev erything that forms the vibratory ocean in which we are constantly immersed for example there exist numerous light waves which our vision cannot percei ve and interpret to take the most obvious example the infrareds and the ult raviolets make impression on our objective consciousness yet it is impossibl to deny their existence likewise our hearing cannot perce ive sound waves exceeding certain vibratory frequency depe nding on the situation it may involve infrasoundsthat is 4rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 6 sounds whose vibratory frequency is extremely lowa s well as ultrasounds which belong by contrast to very high octaves of th universal keyboard of cosmic vibrations what applies to sight and hearing is also valid for taste and smell because there exist foods which produce taste and fragr ances which manifest themselves by precise odor as for touch it can also be misled by the texture and consistency of certain substances animals on the other hand see objects or colors which make impression on our eyes or at least which are not subject to any interpretation in our objective cons ciousness some of them dogs and cats for examplehear sounds of which huma ns are totally unaware this is likewise true of certain odors which we are completely unable to smell what enables animals to perceive colors sounds an d odors that make impression on us is not their objective faculties rather it is their psychic facultieswhich function completely naturally for them human beings also have these psychic faculties at our disposal yet unlike animals we must develop them or rather prod them out of the state of inactivity in which they have been left for too long we will sho w you in due course how to achieve this from the preceding we can deduce that the objectiv consciousness of human beings is limited in its field of experimenta tion and allows us to perceive only the lowest material forms on the vibratory pla ne moreover as heraclitus stated matter is in state of perpetual becoming in other words it is subject to constant modifications and is never in permanent way what it appears to be this means that the fundamental law of the material world is change for example certain carbon compounds are gradually transformed deep in the earth and become diamonds after several mill ennia furthermore it is because of these different changes that carbon can be used with great precision to determine the age of the most ancient objects or bones contrasted with carbon we have uranium which due to very specifi c reactions with some of its subatomic particles is classified among rad ioactive elements in that capacity uranium constitutes metal whose transfo rmations are extremely rapid these two examples are simply meant to show you that matter changes constantly i n fact all material substances are in state of either ev olution or involution these two apparently opposite states be ing the 5rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 6 two major phases of the cycle that matter follows i n its various processes of transmutation thus even if we are not objectively aware of it t here is not single element of matter in the entire universe that is now what i t was only few seconds ago likewise each cell of our physical body is differe nt from what it was few months ago and within very short time it will b different from what it is right now change motion and instability are thus the c haracteristics of the material world therefore what we perceive through our obje ctive consciousness cannot be permanent or stable in other words our sight hearing touch taste and smell convey to us sensations which by virtue of their origin are only reflections of the change motion and instability of our external environment consequently our mental interpretation of the mate rial world cannot be trustworthy that is why mystics have always emphas ized the fact that human beings must call upon the transcendent faculties if they want to know the mysteries hidden within them and around them unfor tunately most people place all their faith in their physical senses and only trust what they see hear touch smell and tastesaying in essence that noth ing exists for them beyond what they can perceive by means of their objective consciousness it is for this reason that many people deny the existence of the s oul and naturally of god by acting in this way they destroy their psychic f aculties and close the doors to all impressions that transcend their sensory facult ies the subconscious nonetheless one can deny that there exists within us form of consciousness that is independe nt of our objective perception for example when we sleep the various organs of our body continue to fulfill their role our heart keeps bea ting our lungs keep breathing our blood circulates at normal rate etc this l occurs because phase of our conscious activity is still functioning even when our objective and subjective faculties are inoperative this phase of consciousn ess which acts within us without our being aware of it is none other than t he subconscious for it is this phase which directs all involuntary functions of ou r body in other words it is under the influence of the subconscious that all in ternal activities take place in our bodyfrom our general metabolism down to the work done by each one of our cells it is fact th at we are not in command of those internal activities becaus even when using our will we cannot keep our heart from beating 6rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 6 our lungs from breathing our blood from circulatin g etc this is because our subconscious does not depend in any way on our obje ctive consciousness to accomplish its work in the service of the physical body rather it is under the control of cosmic consciousness which is present i n our entire being in accordance with the preceding explanations huma n beings possess dual consciousness the objective consciousness wi th its subjective aspect and the subconscious the objective consciousness conce rns the perception of the external world by means of our five sensory faculti on the one hand and the mental interpretation of this perception on the other hand it is therefore associated directly with our state of wakefulness nd with voluntary actions we may exert over our physical surroundings due to it s very nature and role the objective consciousness is governed by our brain an d is primarily concerned with our physical body it is therefore limited and mortal the subconscious on the other hand directs all our involuntary func tions and works under the direct control of cosmic consciousness it is throu gh this intermediary that we may receive psychic impressions which our objective faculties cannot perceive by its very nature it is unlimited and immortal be cause it is closely associated with the consciousness of the soul in the next monograph we will complete our present study of conscious nessor at least what we want to state concerning t his subject in this section we will also give you few simple but important ex periments so that you may develop faculty indispensable for mysticnamely intuition meanwhile we recommend that you direct your attention to your perceptions involving sight sound touch smell and taste so that you will realize to what extent they involve limited aspect of your conscious life as you engage in this exami nation think of the infinite possibilities of your subconscious in this way you will understand that you are indeed dual bein g uniting finite dimen sionthat of the bodywith an infinite dimensionth at of the soul such an understanding will constitute an important step in the mastery of cosmic laws with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class master practical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 7in this monograph we have explained that human bein gs possess dual consciousness the objective consciousness and the subconscious this duality can be demonstrated by the following two very simpl experiments the first consists of sitting comfortably and closi ng your eyes before you begin make sure that the room in which you are sea ted is as silent as possible also make sure that it is not too brightly lit and that the temperature is normal so that you will not be disturbed by light or heat in short see to it that your physical senses are unaffected by the perception of some condition outside yourself then concentrate on your inner lifeon ur breathing the beating of your heart and in general on all the internal f unctions to which you usually pay attention in this way you will become aware that your life is indeed divided into two worlds the external and the inter nal for the second experiment mingle with crowd as s oon as you have the opportunity while amidst this large number of peop you can verify for yourself that despite all the hubbub surrounding ou and all the things you can see hear touch and smell you remain fully ware of being an individual distinct from all others this proves that whateve r surroundings we are in at given moment we never lose awareness of our inne r personality such realization shows that our conscious activity is du later we will show you that this duality applies to all levels of creation 8summary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period the objective consciousness is the totality of pro cesses which enable us to perceive and interpret the physical world in this regard it depends upon our five physical senses and the five objective fac ulties that are associated with them as well as upon our subjective functions that is our mental processes our five objective facultiessight hearing touch taste and smelldo not perceive everything that forms the vibratory oc ean in which we are constantly immersed this means that many vibration s are not subject to any interpretation on the part of our objective sciousness all material substances are in state of either volution or involution these two seemingly opposed states being the two ma jor phases of the cycle followed by matter in its various processes f transmutation there is not single element of matter in the ent ire universe that is now what it was only few seconds ago this is because the material world is characterized by change movement and instability most people only trust what they see hear touch smell and taste by acting this way they destroy their psychic faculti and close the doors to all impressions which transcend their sensory facul ties there exists within us form of consciousness tha t is independent of our objective perception it is the subconscious our subconscious directs all involuntary functions of our body and acts continuously under the control of cosmic consciousn ess which is present throughout our beingnotes 9mandamus 7 concurrence 10intuition is truly remarkable faculty if only be cause of its many applications it is one of the major functions of ur inner selfor if you prefer of cosmic consciousnesswhich permeates our entire being due to intuition it is possible to gain knowledge that we cannot acq uire through conventional means that is why rosicrucians attach so much impo rtance to the development of intuition we have been conditioned by our trai ning at home and in school to heed what others have said or written rather tha n our own intuition it is absolutely necessary for us to correct this error because such way of thinking gives to our objective consciousness supremacy w hich deprives us of true wisdom in concurrence with this point of view we cite the words of ralph waldo emerson great poet and mystic of the 19th century to believe your own thought to believe that what i s true for you in your private heart is true for all menthat is genius s peak your latent conviction and it shall be the universal sense for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the last judgment familiar as the voice of the mind is to each the highest merit we ascribe to moses plato and milton is that they set at naught books and traditions and spoke not what men but what they t hought man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages yet he dismisses without notice his thought because it is his in every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts they come b ack to us with certain alienated majesty great works of art have more affecting lesson for us than this they teach us to abide by our spontaneous imp ression with goodhumored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voice s is on the other side else tomorrow stranger will say with masterly good sen precisely what we have thought and felt all the time and we shall be forc ed to take with shame our own opinion from another ralph w aldo emerson 1803188211rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 7 dear fratres and sorores in the previous monograph we have seen that humans are endowed with an objective consciousness that includes our five obje ctive senses and the whole of our subjective functions and with subconsciou s that operates under the control of cosmic consciousness which is present t hroughout our being from psychological and mystical point of view th is is completely accurate however you should not conclude from this that we are animated by four totally distinct forms of consciousness in other w ords we do not possess an objective consciousness subjective consciousness subconscious and cosmic consciousness operating in completely inde pendent way in fact there exists only one consciousness in humanscosmi c consciousnessand it is only in its manifestations that it is multipl in character by way of analogy there exists in the absolute onl one light which in the present case is the light of the sun only when th is light is refracted as in the rainbow for example does it appear to us in the fo rm of different colors this is likewise true with human consciousness its phas are only effects produced by cosmic consciousness when it is channeled throug h our various psychic centers and through our various mental processes ou will find diagram illustrating this point in the practical applicatio n of this monograph cosmic consciousness the preceding observation leads us now to consider very important mystical principle since the universal flow of cosmic consciousness enters into every human being and si nce that consciousness by definition is that of the cosmic it follows that w are never separated from the cosmic moreover the cosmic represents the tot ality of natural universal and spiritual laws by which divine intelligence exp resses itself throughout creation consequently we are permanently united t that intelligence and we possess it in the innermost part of ourselves this also implies that all people are united with one another on the inner level bec ause all are animated by cosmic consciousness and are constantly connected w ith the divinity let us use an analogy to help you understand this p rinciple better for this purpose imagine the flow of cosmic consciousness s an electrical current and divine intelligence as the generator of this cu rrent now visualize tens hundreds thousands of electric light bulbs connected on this same circuit in this analo gy it is 12rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 7 obvious that the current feeding each one of these bulbs is the same and that it comes from single source even though the light mitted by the bulbs differs due to their wattage or the color of their glass i f you now consider that these bulbs represent human beings you will understand t hat the same flowthat of cosmic consciousnessenters each of them and tha t each one manifests according to his or her spiritual evolution the po wer and intensity of that flow to some degree let us now consider another important point on sev eral occasions we have stated that humans possess within themselves consci ousness of the cosmic which is called either cosmic consciousness or universal consciousness in our teachings this consciousness is for obvious r easons in the image of its sourcein other words perfect consequently it co ntains all the wisdom of the universe and includes knowledge of the past pr esent and future of all humanity and of our own existence ou may find it difficult to conceive that the future can be inscribed in cosmic consciousness however we will explain to you later that this truth does not contradict th idea that all of us have free will at our disposal and that we remain the creator s of our own future rather for now we wish to show you that each of us becau of the presence within of cosmic consciousness possesses the key to all m ysteries of the universe and of our own life intuition in the preceding monograph we have emphasized the fact that we cannot attain knowledge of these mysteries by ans of our objective faculties because they only apply to the perceptio n and interpretation of the material worldin other words to the visible and t angible world if we want to acquire knowledge of the mysteries we must ther efore call upon those faculties which because of their nature transcend the limited powers of our mind among these faculties one of the most use ful for every mystic is intuition because it is one of the major functions of cosmic consciousness in humans to make it effective we only need to quiet the objective reasoning and listen to our inner self in this way it is possibl to receive reply to specific questions we ask ourselves provided that these stions are legitimate and acceptable from cosmic point of view we indicate that these are specific questions because this faculty h as its own limitations and thus the solution to certain probl ems can only be obtained through meditation we will see ho w this is accomplished in the next monograph 13rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 7 intuitive impressions are neither limited nor affec ted by our five physical senses although they are subject to interpretation when translated by our mental processes on the other hand time and space have n influence over them and material condition can prevent them from manifes ting in us moreover contrary to what is commonly thought it is entirel possible to develop our intuition and to benefit from its assistance in our lives as we previously indicated we need only grant greater importance to our inner consciousness and develop the habit of establishing dialogue with it we propose therefore that you try the following experiments whenever you have an opportunity during the upcoming months or even in the years to come as you will see these exercises are very effective in awakening our intuitive perception they constitute in themselves technique that you will find very useful experiments whenever you wish to know the time refrain from consulting watch or clock instead close your ey and concentrate for few seconds on the question what time is it then r emain passive for few moments and place yourself in state of inner rece ptivity if you succeed the exact time will suddenly come into your consciousne ss or you will have the impression that it is certain number of minutes b efore or after given hour note carefully the first intuitive impression which comes to you and then verify its accuracy by consulting your watch and other wat ches for you will find on occasion that your watch may be running fast or slo w it is possible that you may be tempted to reject precise hour which comes to you intuitively by considering that this hour ca nnot be the correct one since according to your reasoning it is not logical in r elation to the time when you last looked at your watch in this case do not cas t doubt on your intuition instead trust it and take it into account in other words do not allow yourself to be influenced by this kind of reasoning because u will note that impressions coming just after an intuitive response always resu lt from our objective consciousness and not from our inner consciousness ou should not limit your experiment to time if u hear the telephone ring at home or work instead of answering immediat ely wait few seconds and ask your inner self who is calling or w hat is the subject of this call after asking the questio n wait moment for the answer and once again strive to be receptive to your intuition as you do so remember that the first impression received is the one you must accept eve n if 14rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 7 it seems strange to you this will prevent you from getting into the habit of trusting second or third impression which may occ ur to you if your replies are inaccurate at first do not be discouraged tinue your attempts until you notice that the impressions received become increas ingly accurate the same process may be applied with the mail sent to you if you receive letter with outward sign of the senders ident ity or of the letters contents hold the envelope in your hand for moment close your eyes and ask yourself for few seconds who wrote this letter or wha t is the subject of this letter place yourself in state of receptivity nd wait for the results of your intuition then open your mail and verify whether our intuitive perception was correct or not when carrying out these experiments it is very imp ortant that you avoid any reasoning and that you listen to the first answ er which arises in your consciousness our intuition must be developed in such way that as soon as it expresses itself you longer allow any obj ective reasoning to replace or even to modify the intuitive impression given to you if you succeed there will come time when this faculty will function wi th such rapidity that at the very moment you ask the question its reply will co to you immediately at first you will find that certain number of er rors do occur this is because your intuition lacks development it is also probab that you will obtain such vague or fleeting impressions that you will not hee d them and will retain in their place reply from your reasoning however ou will gradually find that proper concentration and receptivity will allow you r intuitive perception to express itself with increasing accuracy with these fundamental experiments we will end toda ys study give them your full attention because as we will show you in the next monograph they constitute the first approach to wh at our tradition calls cosmic attunement with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterpractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 15the purpose of this diagram is to show you that the various phases of human consciousness are not distinct rather they all are manifestations of single flow of consciousnessthat of cosmic co nsciousness from now on we ask that you reflect well on the philosop hical and mystical effects resulting from this we shall return to thi s very important point in future degrees objective consciousnesscosmic consciousness subconscious subjective functions objective facultiescosmic intelligence16summary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in

consciousness is in the image of its source in other words perfect consequently it contains all the wisdom f the universe and includes knowledge of the past present and future of all humanity and of our own existence to attain knowledge of all the mysteries we must call upon faculties which by virtue of their nature transcend the lim ited powers of our objective consciousness intuition is one of the most useful faculties for mystic b ecause it is one of the major functions of cosmic consciousness in ach of us therefore we must give special attention to its developmentnotes 17mandamus 8 concurrence 18in connection with the subject discussed in this mo nograph we propose that you read the following excerpt from book ent itled creative meditation written by lama anagarika govinda as you will note what is said regarding the different phases that should be obser ved during meditation is in full agreement with the technique that rosicruci ans use for meditating we recommend that you give your complete attention to the following quotation inspiration is the very heart the central force of all meditation since inspiration is spontaneous faculty also interpre ted as rapture it cannot be created on command but only induced by arousing our interest or our admiration thus before we can get inspired we mu st prepare the ground create the mood the receptivity of the mind and f or this there are two requirements relaxation quietness peace and har mony on the one hand and on the other something that gives direction and co ncentration to the mind ie either mental subject or visible object of cont emplation that is sufficiently attractive to hold the attention of the meditator the beauty of nature or of poem moving prayer as devotion chant the remembrance or the image of charismatic perso nality or an enlightened one in whose footsteps one wishes to follow all th are conducive to meditation other good preparations are music ince nse flowers and light or the ritual of offering them in temple or at shr ine as was usual in every tibetan home as well as in most indian homes of bu ddhists and hindus alike in short the elements of beauty and devotion are t he most powerful incentives of meditation both these elements are united in betan thankas which may explain the strange fascination they exert on the m odern mind and especially those interested in spiritual values and meditative practices for devotional temperaments prayer itself becomes an entrance to m editation in fact prayer in deeper sense as direction of the heart i s itself form of meditation whatever we love becomes an easy subject of contemp lation because it requires effort but follows the natural inclina tion of mind and heart continued on page 2719rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 8 dear fratres and sorores this monograph is the last one you will receive as member of the postulant section of our order the following bookl et entitled neophyte guiderosicrucian initiation contains very important information for the continuation of your rosicrucian studies furthermo re it provides basic explanations regarding the traditional stage throug h which you will be passing very soon and which will make you neophyte of our mystical order do not neglect its study absorb its contents well in the preceding monograph we offered some simple xperiments to awaken your intuition and to release it from its tent state we sincerely hope that you have given the experiments sufficient atte ntion because they form the basis of development for your intuitive perception and of practice which our teachings have designated as cosmic harmonization this traditional expres sion refers to an inner state resulting from perf ect harmonization between human consciousness and cosmic consciousness in th is respect the awak ening of intuition is not the only experiment rosic rucians can perform as part of cosmic harmonization contacts with the celestia l sanctum and the work of the silent council are fully integrated within t his framework because these contacts and this work require that we harmonize wi th the loftiest planes of cosmic consciousness this is likewise true of medi tation which as we will now see constitutes an art of considerable importa nce in the realm of mysti cism this art is based on the fundamental principl of intuition however the revelations it allows us to obtain have much more important significance meditation first of all it is important to understand that m editation has absolutely nothing to do with daydreaming in other words in its mystical application meditation does not correspond to bjective state where we give free rein to our fantasy in this sense its aim is not to escape from the material world or to take flight from mundane problems it i s rather to rise voluntarily into the spiritual world so as to gain access to it s light it thus constitutes form of cosmic harmonization whose goal is either t secure the answer to particular question or the solution to precise problem or to make oneself receptive to the inspirations that cosmic conscious ness is willing to give us to meditate it is not necessary to go to church synagogue mosque or any other edifice that peop have 20rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 8 dedicated to religious life it is possible to medi tate anywhere whether in room of house or outdoors provided that you have the required tranquility in that respect the most sacred temple is none other than the human being because within our own inner depths is found the key to all the mysteries however and wherever we are we can commune inwardly and place ourselves in harmony with the god we are capable of conceiving and of ving independent of any religious belief before coming to the technique you should follow fo r meditating effectively we would like to emphasize that all ditation should take place on the level of the celestial sanctum in other wor ds rosicrucians should go to this symbolic place whenever we wish to harmo nize ourselves with the cosmic the method we taught you concerning this in the booklet liber 777 the celestial sanctum is particularly effective for producing this desire d inner state any mystical experience carried out on this plane becomes integrated in work which as you will recall is opened and cl osed by two invocations that are very significant within the rosicrucian traditi on these two invocations convey an intent which reflects our desire to work in the service of divine intelligence and to place this work under the aegis of the rosy cross they also symbolize the allegorical framework in which we pla ce our period of cosmic harmonization that is why you will always use thes invocations from now on to begin and end your meditations however you can meditate without feeling compelled to rise beforehand to the level of the ce lestial sanctum even though your communion with the cosmic will be more meaning ful if you ascend to that exalted place in the previous monograph we explained that conscio usness in the form manifesting in human beings operates according to phases which differ and yet are dependent on one another considering that the aim of meditation is to harmonize oneself with cosmic consciousness it is quite evident that we must transcend the objective level on which we are situa ted in our waking state in other words it is impossible to meditate if our nsory faculties are fully active or if our mental system is engaged in reasoning abo ut multiple facts thus the first thing to do to carry out successful med itation is to lose consciousness of our earthly surroundings n the one hand and on the other hand to place ourselve s in as calm subjective state as possible on the very ed ge of our subconscious these two major conditions are requir ed for 21rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 8 the establishment of an inner dialogue with the cos mic consciousness which infuses the universe as well as our entire being to help you understand the method to be used for ef fective meditation we will now bring to your attention the basic techn ique of this art as was transmitted to us by the masters of our tradition as you will note the technique is quite simple as it is not necessary to perform complicated procedures so as to enter into contact with cosmic consciousness ev erything is simple in the absolute it is human beings who because of our mo mentary ignorance make things far more complex than they are here is the technique we urge you to follow as faithfully as possible experiment when you wish to enter into meditation the first t hing to do is to retire to quiet and peaceful place if ou meditate at home take care to select room where you have the necessary tranq uility because it is very disagreeable on both the physical and psychic leve l to be disturbed during meditation also make sure that the room temperatur is moderate so that you feel comfortable similarly the lighting must be s ubdued so that your sight will not be subjected to any outside influence in short make certain that the place you have selected for meditation stimulates s little as possible your five physical senses and the objective faculties corresp onding to them once these conditions are met sit with your back s straight as possible the palms of your hands upon your knees and your f eet flat on the ground slightly apart if you meditate outdoors the posit ion you assume should be as comfortable as possible for the body must not b subject to tension or discomfort once again you must keep your back as straight as possible as soon as you have assumed the desired position c lose your eyes and take series of deep neutral breaths for approximately one minute neutral breathing consists of inhaling and exhaling deeply through th nose without any pause between inhalations and exhalations we will explai n to you later why we use this type of breathing when preparing ourselves for meditation we can tell you that this method is especially effective in inducin g state of consciousness most favorable for this kind of experiment we call thes breaths neutral as there are also deep positive and deep negative types of breat hing which will be taught to you later in your studies after about one minute of deep neutral breathing r esume your normal breathing and rise to the level of cons ciousness 22rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 8 symbolized by the celestial sanctum after having m ade certain to recite the opening invocation when you feel that you have rea ched that plane concen trate on the purpose of your meditation if it conc erns question you wish to have answered repeat this question mentally sev eral times as clearly and concisely as possible if the problem is one of dee p concern and whose solu tion you cannot conceive summarize it mentally whi trying once again to be as clear and concise as possible finally if you wish to meditate merely to benefit from peace profound and from the general inspiration which any cosmic harmo nization can bring you will not need to concentrate on the goal of your ditation simply remain perfectly calm and receptive so that cosmic conscio usness may impress within you the revelations it intends for you after concentrating for few minutes upon the ques tion or problem which is the subject of your meditation place yourself i n state of absolute passivity in other words do not think about this question or problem any longer let yourself drift into feeling of perfect fusion wit h cosmic consciousness this state of passivity is necessary when we meditate up on specific goal because it enables our question or problem to be transferre d to cosmic consciousness through the intermediary of our subconscious witho ut this transfer the object of our meditation remains in the subjective aspect of our objective consciousness and consequently cannot receive r esponse from the cosmic once you feel the desire to end your meditation per iod slowly return to objective consciousness open your eyes recite the closing invocation of the celestial sanctum and resume your regular activiti as this experiment shows the purpose of meditation is to use the subconscious to bring about mental transfer in t his regard you will note that the first phase of this transfer occurs from ur objective consciousness toward cosmic consciousness and the second phase ccurs from cosmic consciousness toward our objective consciousness g enerally the answer or solution sought is given to us during the passive p hase of meditationthat is to say when we are in receptive state however it often happens that we feel the inner urge to close our ditation even before we receive an answer or solution in th at case an answer or solution is most often given to us in the form of strong intuition when we have resumed our acti vities 23rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 8 in some unusual cases it comes to us by way of our dreams what is certain is that any meditation practiced according to the trad itional method that we have just indicated is effective and never leaves us wit hout solution or answer the akashic records we will now consider very important point when we meditate simply to communicate with the spi ritual world and to receive certain inspirations from itand not for th purpose of obtaining the answer to question or the solution to probl emour meditation often contains
