of direct changes to the tax expenditures themselves but also because of changes elsewhere in the tax code consequently while many tax expenditures may be considered permanent the revenue losses can vary year to year because of changing economic conditions and changes to the tax code for example the revenue loss and distributional impacts of many tax expenditures will change after 2010 when the individual income tax rates are scheduled to revert back to their pre2001 levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34622 order code rl34622 tax expenditures and the federal budget updated september 10 2008

the long term federal fiscal problem budget experts from think tanks and academia have developed proposals for dealing with longterm fiscal difficulties many argue that the federal budget deficits are unsustainable and threaten the future of the economy but they differ on the causes of federal deficits one group cla ims that social security medicare and medicaid are the major drivers of escala ting deficits and proposes that the budget process be reformed so these three progra ms are longer on autopilot another group proposes reducing projected deficits by reducing the growth of medicare and health care spending increasing medicare premiums for higher income beneficiaries eliminating or limiting many tax expenditures reforming farm subsidy programs and adhering to payasyougo budget rules among the options likely to be considered to deal with the longterm fiscal problem is reform of the federal tax system the growth of the alternative minimum tax amt and the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts in 2010 will likely force some action on tax policy past efforts to reform the federal tax system have included policies to rein in the use and expense of tax expenditures which account for large proportion of the resources the fe deral government uses to achieve various national goals by 2007 it is estimated th at tax expenditures amounted to about 1 trillion and accounted for about quarter of total expenditures when combined with outlays for mandatory spending programs and net interest payments almost three quarters of total expenditures are for permanent programs that many claim are more or less on autopilot the proportion of to tal expenditures subject to annual review by the appropriations committees in the ppropriations process has been declining over the past two decades estimates of the revenue losses and distributional effects of tax expenditures depend on the parameters of the tax code both will change not only because of direct changes to the tax

of escalating deficits as first step to establishing budget responsibility they propose that the budget process be reformed so these three programs are longer on autopilot specifically they recommend th at 1 explicit longterm budgets for the three programs be enacted which are sustainable set limits on automatic spending growth and reduce the relatively favorable budgetary treatment of these programs compared with other types of expenditures 2 the programs be regularly revised to determine whether they are within budg eted amounts and 3 significant long term deviations from budgeted

legislation under the jurisdiction of the legislative committees primarily the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee most but not all mandatory spending is permanent in

estimates tax expenditures in terms of revenues lost to the us treasury the revenue loss is straightforward and easily understood concept it is simply the taxes not paid and represents revenues forgone by the government simply aggregating the individual tax expenditures as estimated by the jct ignores the interactions among tax expenditures recent study estimates that the sum of revenues lost under the separate tax expenditures is about 8 less than the revenue loss when the tax expenditures are taken as group see leonard burman christopher geissler and eric j toder how big are total

spending was approximately equal to the estimated revenue loss of tax expenditures about 76 of gdp estimated tax expenditures experienced large decline relative to gdp between 1987 and 1989 largely

since then over 100 special deduc tions exemptions and credits have been added to the tax code of course for the first 25 years of the income tax tax expenditures were relatively unimportant prior to world war ii the federal income tax was of little economic importance individual and corporate income tax receipts amounted to less than 2 of gross domestic product gdp by 1945 however income tax receipts accounted for over 15 of gdp as the income tax became more economically important so did the tax subsidies from the special deductions exemptions ex clusions and credits in the mid1960s the department of the treasury became interested in tracking and accounting for these tax subsidies18 indeed the term tax expenditures was first used at this time19 with the enactment of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 933 44 tax expenditures were officially defined as those revenue sses attributable to provisions of the federal tax laws which allow special exclusion exemp tion or deduction from gross income or which provide special credit preferential rate of tax or deferral of tax liability20 both the department of the treas ury and the jct prepare annual lists and estimates of tax expenditures tax expenditures include reductions in tax liability resulting from special tax provisions to determine if provision is tax expenditure the jct defines baseline or reference income tax structure referred to as the normal income tax law which has broader concept of income than under us tax law21 the committee staff uses its judgement to distinguish between what are normal income tax provisions and what ar special provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34622crs9 22 the current bush administration which has questioned the whole concept of tax expenditures stated

mcdaniel tax expenditures cambridge ma harvard university press 1995 p 14 25 henry c simons personal income taxation chicago il university of chicago press 1938 p 50the us department of the treasury uses similar procedure to identify tax expenditures but uses two baseline income tax structures the normal income tax baseline and the reference income tax baseline the reference tax baseline is closer to existing tax law and consequently id entifies fewer tax expenditures this baseline has been used by the treasury since 1982 prior to 1982 there were few differences between the tax expenditures lists of the jct and the department of the treasury since both used the same baselin after 1982 the differences between the two lists have grown the jct has used consistent methodology to define and estimate tax expenditures over time whereas the department of the treasurys methodology has changed from admin istration to administration22 other baseline tax law structures have been proposed one commonly proposed baseline is the consumption tax baseline which is used as one of the baselines in the administrations annua l list of tax expenditures this baseline has fewer builtin distortions than the income tax for example the choice between future consumption that is saving and current consumption is not biased as it is when income is taxed many of the largest ta x expenditures would longer be defined as tax expenditures using this baseline concept and an alternative set of tax expenditures would be produced the current tax system however is an income tax furthermore many observers believe it is unlikely that the us income tax will be replaced by consumption tax in the foreseeable future the choice of the baseline tax law system is probably the most controversial aspect in defining and measuring tax expenditures23 stanley surrey had in mind haigsimons definition of income as the basis for tax expenditure analysis24 simons defined personal income as the algebrai c sum of 1 the market value of rights exercised in consumption and 2 the change in the value of the store of property rights between the beginning nd end of the period in question25 the normal tax baseline however is an attempt to apply the haigsimons concept to the real world it does not include some items that w ould be considered income for example imputed rent home produced consumpti on goods and accrued capital gains andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34622crs10 26 see eric j toder tax expenditures and tax reform paper presented at the ninety eighth annual conference on

after the concept was introduced boris bittker points out the many ambiguities that become apparent as soon as one attempts to apply the haig simons definition to the protean stream of economic life27 he further argues that the base line is arbitrary and consequently tax expenditures will be defined as disparities between the tax code and whatever the observer thinks the tax code should be this theme was extended by douglas kahn and jeffrey lehman who argue that tax ex penditure analysis creates an illusion of valuefree scientific precision in heavily politicized domain28 leonard burman however argues that even with the lack of theoretical rigor the current list of tax expenditures is useful list of the extent of deviations of the tax code from an economic ideal and notes that many ta x expenditures would exist against any baseline29 he concludes that tax expenditu re analysis shows how government affects the allocation of resources both directly by financing public activities via tax concessions and indirec tly by altering aftertax pr ices and thus distorting the allocation of resources30 the joint committee of taxation pamphlet on tax expenditure analysis even with the criticisms the need for analysis of tax expenditures has long been recognized walter blum in 1955 joint economic committee report stated that tax expenditures are hidden in technicalities of the tax law they do not show up in the budget their cost frequently is difficult to calculate and their accomplishments are even more difficult to assess31 as result of this lack of transparency analysts argue that tax expenditure analysis is critical tool in achieving more accountable process for enacting and track ing government programs32 in may 2008 the jointhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34622crs11 33 joint committee on taxation reconsideration of tax expenditure analysis may 12 2008 jcx3708 hereafter referred to as reconsideration 34 reconsideration p 7 35 the jct also proposes to have third category that includes tax expenditures as defined under their current methodology but dont fit into either of these two categories 36 reconsideration p 9 37 reconsideration p 10committee on taxation jct released pamphlet justifying the need to reconsider their implementation of tax expenditure analysis33 the jct acknowledges the criticisms of th use of normal tax system and sets out to modify tax expenditure analysis so it will serve as an effective and neutral analytical tool for policymakers34 their approach is to revise the classification of tax expenditures without reference to the normal tax system the revised classification creates two broad categories of tax expenditures tax subsidies and tax induced structural distortions35 tax subsidies are tax provisions that are deliberately inconsistent with an identifiable general rule of the present tax law36 tax subsidies are further divided into three subcategories the first is tax transfers which are transfers to taxpayers regardless of their tax liab ility and would include the re fundable portions of various tax credits for example the earned income credit eic and the child tax credit the second subcategory is so cial spending which is signed to induce behaviors unconnected to the production of business income examples would include the charitable giving deduction deductions nd exclusions for individual retirement accounts iras and the nonrefundable portions of the eic and child tax credit the final subcategory is business synthetic sp ending which includes subsidies designed to induce behaviors direc tly related to the producti on of business income for example various energy tax subsidies taxinduced structural distortions cont ain the elements of the tax code that materially affect economic decisions in manner that imposes substantial economic efficiency costs37 an example of this category of tax expenditure is the differential taxation of debt and equity fi nancing since interest is deductible business expense corporations may be encour aged to raise capital as debt rather than equity issues in measuring tax expenditures there are several issues associated with measuring tax expenditures one issue is estimating the revenue loss of tax expenditures another issue is estimating their distributional impact both the revenue ss and distributional effects depend on the parameters of the tax code both will change when the parameters of the tax code change such as marginal tax rates consequently tax expenditure estimates can change from year to year not only because of direct changes to the tax expenditures themselves but also because of changes else where in the tax code this is illustrated in table 2 for nine selected deductions and excl usions the table reports the changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34622crs12 38 the public use data file is nationally re presentative sample of tax returns for the 2004 tax year the most recent year for which data are available to the

standard deduction these four itemized deductions display the classic upside down distributional pattern because of th progressive nature of the individual income tax and higher income taxpayers have greater deductions this upside down distribution is demonstrated in column 1 of each panel in the table the average tax savings increases as income increases for example the average tax savings from the mortgage interest deduction is 4 for the poorest 20 of taxpayers quintile 1 but is nearly 6000 for the richest 1 of taxpayers the 2000 tax rates were slightly more progressive than the 2004 tax rates the tax rates were higher for higher income taxpayers conseque ntly the reduction in tax liability from itemized ductions is greater as income increases under the 2000 tax rates than under the 2004 tax rates see the second column in each panel the value of the mortgage interest deduction increases by 12 for the richest 1 of taxpayers on average but essentially remains the same for the poorest 20 ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34622crs14 taxpayers even though the income tax is more progressive under the 2000 tax rates the benefits of itemized deductions are more re gressively

public use data file note the amt is excluded from the analysis the flat tax rate increases the value of itemized deductions for the bottom 80 of taxpayers and reduces the value for the richest 20 of taxpayers see the third column in each panel of table 3 the primary reason is the flat tax rate raises the tax rate for those in the bottom 80 of th income distribution and reduces the taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34622crs15 rate for the top 20 taxes become ss progressive but the value of deductions becomes less regressive the distributional effects of the three abovetheline deducti ons are reported in table 4 these deductions are generally limited to lower and middle income taxpayers and unlike itemized deductions are available to all w ho qualify rather than solely to those who itemize the average value of these deductions generally rises with income at first and then declines with income for those taxpayers at the top of the income distribution the average va lue of these tax expenditures across the income distribution vary by the progressivity of the tax rates see the second and third column in each panel table 4 average tax savings from abovetheline deductions under

all benefits from social security received by lower income individuals and families are not taxed and many do not file income tax returns these individuals and families are not included in the analysis part of social security income received by high income taxpayers however is included in income and taxe d on the other hand all state and local public purpose bond interest income is excluded

analytical perspectives budget of the united st ates government fiscal year 2002 feb 2001the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts reduced the ta x rates to their current levels40 the tax rates are scheduled to revert back to their pre2001 levels after 2010 this reversion alone will change the revenue loss estimates and distributional impacts of tax expenditures conclusions tax expenditures account for large pr oportion of the resources the federal government uses to achieve various na tional goals by 2007 it was estimated that tax expenditures amounted to about 1 tr illion and accounted for about quarter of total expenditures when combined with outlays for mandatory spending programs and net interest payments almost threequarters of total expenditures are for permanent programs that many claim are more or less on autopilot the proportion of total expenditures subject to annual review by the appropriations committees in the appropriations process has been declin ing over the past two decades given the longterm fiscal imbalances part of the solution will likely involve tax reform and the limitation or outright elimination of some tax expenditures tax expenditure analysis can be useful tool for policymakers considering tax reform proposals but tax expenditure anal ysis has been criticiz ed by several policy analysts as well as by the bush administration41 in response to these criticisms the jct is working to change their implementation of tax expenditure analysis estimates of the revenue losses and distributional effects of tax expenditures depend on the parameters of the tax code both will change not only because of direct changes to the tax expenditures themselves but also because of changes elsewhere in the tax code consequen tly while many tax expenditures may be considered permanent the revenue losses can vary year to year because of changing economic conditions and changes to the tax code for example the revenue loss and distributional impacts of many tax expe nditures will change after 2010 when the individual income tax rates are scheduled to revert b ack to their pre2001 levels
