were authorized to increase the numbers of health professionals in underserved mostly rural or innercity areas and to improve the racial and ethnic diversity of the health workforce in addition programs were developed to counter the nationwide trend among medical residents toward specialization the major objective of th programs was to increase support for training and curriculum development

technicians or other practitioners depending on which degrees they may hold if any but the classification scheme misses the fact that their practice is on populations rather than i ndividuals an analysis of efforts to enumerate workers in the nations local health departments found that the soc system did not correspond in meaningful wa ys with actual workers and their roles and concluded that state or national system is in place to track local public health workers in any way15 one of the few attempts to enumerate the national public health workforce estimated it at about 448000 individuals though this effort raised as many questions as it answered what ty pes of training do these individuals have what proportion of their time is spent solely on public health practice versus personal health care teaching or research have they also been counted erroneously toward some other health workforce16 attempts by professional associations to enumerate workers in their disciplines

gaothehs97117 april 25 1997the effectiveness of title vii programs the effectiveness of title vii health professions programs in meeting variety of stated objectives has long been subject of debate on the one hand administrations have proposed to eliminat many of the programs recommendations which have persisted for many years on the other hand cong ress has continued to fund these programs and they continue to evolve complicating the task of evaluating program effectiveness numerous view s on program effectiv eness and ways to improve program evaluati on are discussed below differing views on program goals in general evaluating program effec tiveness depends on linking performance to predetermined goals this simple maxim has proved troubl esome when applied to hrsa title vii programs different parties from stakeholders to the administration to the congress have articulated different goals ranging from the very broad to the very specific and sometimes in conflict this has led to wide swath of official determinati ons of effectiveness and historical difference of opinion between congress and the executive branch regarding the merits of these programs in addition the evolution of program goal s over time adds to the script of stated purposes for example the advisory committee for section 747 primary care medicine and dentistry prog rams recounted chronology of purposes in

clustershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32546crs19 53 most of the clusters also have the stat ed purpose of administrative simplification an overarching goal behind creating the clusterscongressional views

specific components within each cluster but the accompan ying senate repor t 105220 june 23 1998 provided glimpse of congre ssional intent toward broade r goals for each cluster as follows minority

but lacks data to demonstrate progress in her testimony to congressional ppropriators regarding the fy2005 budget proposal hrsa administrator elizabeth duke expanded on the administrations rationale for cutting back or eliminating the health professions programs stating that the preference of the administration is to put more money into direct health care delivery and less money into some of the programs that have been historically used only 30 percent of the graduates of these programs actually end up in care to the underserved and the administrations position is that better way to go would

in program performance the committee is comprised of individuals who either work for institutions or represent professions that benefit from title vii progra ms the committee has issued two reports in the first published in november 2001 the committee concluded that these programs are effective in improving the numbers and distribution of targeted providers though much of the evidence c ited is anecdotal and causal link between the program and outcomes is not always demonstrated56 the committee acknowledges this though in several statem ents about the difficulty in evaluating these programs saying several factors make it difficult to obt ain direct evidence relevant to the influence of title vii section 747 programs on its primary goals first the program has continued to evolve since it began with these changes reporting methods have been modified and have not necessarily provided data relevant to the supply distribution and compos ition of primary care providers57 ironically the committee adds to the deba about title vii programs serving as counterweights to the marketdriven specialization trend suggesting that public funds as well as private sector forces may work against program outcomes and hamper their actual or perceived effectiveness the committee notes judgments about the effectiveness of these programs are further muddied because these programs represent only minor fraction of overall f unding for medical education and training the billions of dollars in support of other national priorities such as biomedical re search through the national institutes of health and the support through medicare graduate medical education in subspecialty areas have been powerful in fluences toward specialty rather than primary care training that dwarf th amounts

data to increase our understanding of why results occur and what value program adds performance measurement cannot repl ace data on progra m costs political judgments about priorities creativity about solutions or common sense major purpose of performance measurement is to raise fundamental questions the measures seldom by themselves provide definitive answers64 omb then describes six types of obstacl to good performance measurement and ways to mitigate them four of the descriptions apply to title vii programs as follows the programs outcomes are extremely difficult to measure this problem can result when the progra m purpose is not clear when the beneficiary or customer is not clearly defined when stakeholders and programs managers have differe nt views of the program and when good data are not availabl omb suggests using qualitative information such as expert panel reviews when quantitative measures are lacking the program is one of many contributors to the desired outcome this problem results when severa l federal programs programs from various levels of government federal state local and privatesector or nonpr ofit activities all contri bute to achieving the same goal omb recommends as one approach veloping broad yet measurable outcome goals for the collection of programs while also having programsp ecific performance goals results will not be achieved for many years to address this issue omb suggests defining specific s hort and mediumterm steps or milestones to accomplish the longter m outcome goal these steps are likely to be outputoriented interim goals the program has multiple purposes and funding can be used for arange of activities this problem occurs with federal programs that must offer some degree of local flexibility while still aiming toward national goals omb suggests developing both performance measures and national standards to provide joint accountability for programs and setting local targets for aggregation into national
