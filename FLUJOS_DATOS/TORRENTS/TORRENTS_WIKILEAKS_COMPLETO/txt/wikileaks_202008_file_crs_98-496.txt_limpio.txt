background and issues updated april 27 2000 amy f woolf specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report discusses the content of and issues related to the abm treaty succession and demarcation agreements signed in september 1997 the senate will be asked to provide its advice and consent to the ratification of these agreements as amendments to the 1972 abm treaty the house may also review the implications of these agreements when it debates us national and theater ballistic missile defense programs the report begins with brief overview of the 1972 abm treaty and summary of the circumstances that led to negotiations on the new agreements it then describes the rationale for the negotiations and the substance of the agreements the report also contains discussion of issues such as the role of congress in reviewing the agreements the implications of the agreements for us missile defense programs and their relationship to strategic offensive arms reductions that have come up during debates on defense authorization and appropriations legislation the senate may address many of these issues when the administration submits the agreements for its review this report will be updated as events warrant antiballistic missile treaty demarcation and succession agreements background and issues summary in september 1997 the united states and russia signed several agreements related to the 1972 abm treaty the clinton administration has stated that it will submit these agreements to the senate as amendments to the abm treaty after the russian parliament approves the start ii treaty the memorandum of understanding on succession responds to questions about the legal status of the abm treaty after the demise of the soviet union it names russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan as the successors to the soviet union for that agreement together these states can deploy the single abm site permitted by the treaty the clinton administration argued that this mou was not an amendment to the abm treaty and therefore did not need the senates advice and consent many in congress disagreed and the senate compelled the administration to submit the mou in condition attached to another treatys resolution of ratification some in congress believe the mou will strengthen the abm treaty and the arms control process others argue that the agreement undermines us interests because it preserves an outdated treaty and will complicate efforts to negotiate amendments to the treaty that may be needed for the united states to deploy nationwide ballistic missile defense system the united states initiated negotiations on the agreed statements on demarcation because the abm treaty did not contain precise dividing line between abm systems which are limited by the treaty and tmd systems which are not the united states wanted to develop advanced tmd systems that might have some theoretical capabilities against strategic ballistic missiles so it sought agreements that would ensure that these systems were not limited by the treaty russia on the other hand sought provisions that would limit the capabilities of us tmd systems because it feared that the united states might direct these systems against russias strategic ballistic missiles undermining russias nuclear deterrent the resulting agreements divide tmd systems into two categories those with interceptor velocities below 3 kmsec and those with faster interceptors systems with slower interceptors will not be limited by the treaty as long as they are not tested against target missiles with velocities above 5 kmsec and ranges above 3500 kilometers systems with faster interceptors also cannot be tested against such targets and their interceptors cannot be based in space but each country must still determine for itself whether systems with faster interceptors comply with the abm treaty the united states and russia also agreed to number of confidencebuilding measures and general principles that are designed to ease russias concerns about the capabilities of us tmd systems the clinton administration contends that these agreements will not impede the development of any us tmd systems but some in congress have argued that the united states will unilaterally restrain its tmd systems and restrict their deployments to avoid lengthy compliance debates with the russians some believe the united states should deploy whatever defenses are necessary to defend us territory forces and allies even if it must abandon the abm treaty to do so contents introduction 1 background 2 overview of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 2 international events and the abm treaty 3 demise of the

background and issues introduction on september 26 1997 the united states and russia signed several agreements related to the 1972 antiballistic missile abm treaty these agreements addressed succession questions that came up after the demise of the soviet union and demarcation issues related to the us development of advanced theater ballistic missile defenses president clinton has stated that he will treat these agreements as amendments to the abm treaty and submit them to the senate for its advice and consent to ratification1 many members of congress have questioned whether these agreements serve us national security interests some members argue that the succession agreement which names russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan as legal successors to the soviet union in the abm treaty perpetuates treaty that is longer in the us interest because it denies the us the ability to deploy missile defenses to protect its entire national territory others contend that this agreement preserves the original intent of treaty that continues to serve as the foundation of the usrussian strategic balance similarly some members support the administrations view that the demarcation agreements which define the differences between abm systems which are limited by the treaty and theater missile defense systems which are not will preserve both the integrity of the abm treaty and us options for theater missile defenses but some believe that these agreements will permit too much missile defense and therefore undermine the abm treaty while others argue they will unduly constrain us missile defenses simply to maintain an outdated treaty this report describes the background behind the negotiations of these agreements and the issues raised by their provisions it begins with brief overview of the 1972 abm treaty and summary of the circumstances that led to the negotiations it then describes the rationale for the negotiations the substance of the agreements and issues that many in congress and outside the government have raised during debates over these agreements 1 it is unclear at this time when the senate will receive the amendments the clinton administration stated that it would not submit them until the russian parliament approved the 1993 start ii treaty the united states and russia also signed protocol to that treaty in september 1997 the russian parliament did this in midapril 2000 but the administration may withhold these agreements while it seeks to negotiate both additional modifications to the abm treaty and deeper reductions in start iii treaty crs2 background overview of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty the united states and soviet union signed the treaty on the limitation of anti ballistic missile abm systems on may 26 1972 this treaty was one of two agreements reached during the first strategic arms limitation talks salt i the second the interim agreement on the limitation of strategic offensive arms imposed freeze on the number of launchers each country could deploy for its strategic offensive nuclear weapons and called for further negotiations that would lead to reductions together these agreements were intended to slow and eventually reverse the nuclear arms race between the united states and soviet union the limits on offenses and defenses were related because many analysts and government officials believed that neither side would be willing to limit or reduce its offensive forces if the other side deployed widespread defenses against those forces instead both sides would seek to expand their offensive forces to be sure that they could penetrate and overwhelm the defenses on the other side if conflict occurred to preclude this offensedefense arms race both sides agreed to limit sharply their deployments of defensive systems and to freeze their deployments of offensive systems while they negotiated more comprehensive treaty to limit and reduce those forces the salt ii treaty signed in 19792 the abm treaty prohibits the deployment of abm systems for the defense of the nations entire territory but permits each side to deploy limited abm systems at two locations one centered on the nations capital and one at location containing icbm silo launchers 1974 protocol further limited each nation to one abm site located either at the nations capital or around an icbm deployment area the treaty specifies that the radius of the deployment area for each abm system cannot exceed 150 kilometers and that each site can contain more than 100 abm launchers and 100 abm interceptor missiles the treaty also limits the number and power of the abm radars at each abm site and specifies that in the future any radars that provide early warning of strategic ballistic missile attack must be located on the periphery of the national territory and oriented outward furthermore the treaty bans the development testing and deployment of seabased airbased spacebased or mobile landbased abm systems and abm system components the treaty lists these 2 many participants in the current debate over national missile defenses and the future of the abm treaty continue to highlight this relationship between limits on offensive and defensive systems some in the united states argue that russia will not continue to reduce its forces under the start i and start ii treaties if the united states deploys ballistic missile defenses that exceed the limits in the abm treaty because such defenses would undermine russias nuclear deterrent many members of russias parliament have also cited this offense defense relationship in their discussions and criticisms of the start ii treaty consequently those who support the demarcation agreements often note that by ensuring that the united states will not violate the abm treaty with tmd systems these agreements should clear the way for the russian parliament to approve the start ii treaty see for example myers steven lee us and russians agree to put off deadline on arms new york times september 27 1997 p a1 crs3 components as interceptor missiles launchers and radars or other sensors that can substitute for radars the numerical limits and deployment restrictions in the abm treaty do not apply to other types of defensive systems such as defenses against aircraft or defenses against ballistic missiles that are not strategic ballistic missiles such as shorterrange battlefield or theater ballistic missiles however the treaty does state that the parties cannot give these other types of defenses abm capabilities in particular the parties agreed that they would not give these types of systems the capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles or their elements in flight trajectory the parties also cannot test these other types of defenses in an abm mode international events and the abm treaty demise of the soviet union the demise of the soviet union in late 1991 raised questions about the future of the abm treaty some wondered whether all the facilities that had been part of the soviet abm system would remain legal in the absence of periphery for the national territory of the soviet union for example although russia was the most likely successor to the soviet union in the treaty some of the soviet abm facilities were outside russian borders some also questioned whether the treaty could remain in force at all after one of the signatory nations ceased to exist in fact many critics of the abm treaty and supporters of policies that would lead to us missile defense deployments found the situation to be advantageous without treaty partner the treaty could lapse and the united states could deploy missile defenses without limits on the other hand the united states and soviet union had signed several arms control agreements such as the 1987 intermediate nuclear forces inftreaty the 1991 conventional armed forces in europe cfe treaty and the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty start that the parties sought to maintain after the demise of the soviet state in each case they worked out arrangements that would permit several of the former soviet republics to participate as successors to the soviet union3 because the clinton administration believed that the abm treaty remained in the us national security interest it began negotiations in late 1993 on succession agreement that would resolve these questions about the future of the treaty the growing theater ballistic missile threat desert storm the persian gulf war in 1991 also contributed to renewed interest in the limits in the abm treaty during that conflict iraq launched dozens of shortrange scud missiles at 3 the tashkent agreement of 1992 allocated soviet allotments under the cfe treaty to azerbaijan armenia belarus kazakhstan moldova russia ukraine and georgia the lisbon protocol of 1992 names russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan as the successors to the soviet union in the start i treaty ukraine and belarus have also participated in the implementation of the inf treaty through agreements reached in the treatys special verification commission svc the senate did review the lisbon protocol when it offered its advice and consent to the start i treaty but it did not request or receive an opportunity to review the multilaterlization arrangements made for the inf and cfe treaties for description of these agreements see library of congress congressional research service arms control and disarmament activities catalog of recent events crs report 97 177f amy f woolf coordinator updated january 5 1998 crs4 israel and at allied forces in saudi arabia the united states had deployed patriot airdefense systems in the region to counter the scud attacks but these defenses proved to have limited capabilities against ballistic missiles although the united states had already initiated the development of more capable defensive systems to counter short and mediumrange ballistic missiles iraqs attacks alerted many in the united states to the growing threat posed by ballistic missiles in regional conflicts and generated new interest in the development of advanced theater missile defenses tmd by 1993 some analysts and officials in the clinton administration had begun to ask whether these advanced tmd systems would be covered by the limits in the abm treaty all agreed that the treaty did not explicitly limit tmd systems but it also did not define precisely the difference between abm systems and tmd systems and as is noted above it prohibits giving these systems capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles as result in order to avoid possible compliance questions the clinton administration sought to reach an agreement with russia on the characteristics that would distinguish between abm systems and tmd systems the memorandum of understanding on succession after the 1991 demise of the soviet union russia inherited the vast majority of the soviet unions abm facilities and most of its strategic offensive nuclear forces consequently russia appeared to be logical successor to the soviet union for the abm treaty however political and military circumstances mitigated against this outcome for example at the bishkek conference in 1992 all the former soviet republics except the baltic states which had never considered themselves part of the soviet union agreed that they would jointly assume the treaty obligations of soviet union4 the united states had already participated in negotiations to name many of these states as parties to other ussoviet arms control agreements in addition these states were acting on their own to join multilateral arms control regimes such as the nuclear nonproliferation treaty some such as belarus kazakhstan and ukraine reportedly viewed participation in these arms control regimes as an important element of their status as independent nations5 consequently they probably would not have welcomed us or russian efforts to name russia as the sole successor to the soviet union in the abm treaty in addition the location of some of the soviet unions abm facilities would have made it difficult for russia alone to replace the soviet union in the abm treaty as is noted above the abm treaty requires that all early warning radars for ballistic missile attack be located on the periphery of the nation oriented outward the treaty also prohibits the transfer of abm systems or their components to other nations but the soviet union had deployed two early warning radars in ukraine and one each in latvia kazakhstan and azerbaijan the soviet union also had located its test range for abm interceptor missiles in kazakhstan each of these facilities would have been 4 this is referred to in new threat to the abm treaty the administrations tmd proposal arms control today januaryfebruary 1994 p 12 5 scc parties sign agreements on multilateralization tmd systems arms control today september 1997 p 26 crs5 inconsistent with the provisions in the abm treaty if russia was named as the sole successor to the soviet union they would have been outside russias periphery and russia could not have legally transferred them to these states in addition russia has started construction on new radar facility in belarus to replace the radar in latvia6 even if the united states had agreed to grandfather older soviet facilities that were outside russia this new radar would have violated the treatys mandate that all future radars be located on the nations periphery as result russia expressed an interest in including other former soviet states as parties in the abm treaty so that it could maintain the soviet abm system without violating the treaty7 negotiating the agreement the standing consultative commission began its consideration of memorandum of understanding on succession in late 1993 at that time the united states proposed that the abm treaty be open to any former soviet republic that wanted to participate there was some debate within the us interagency process about this proposal for example the department of defense reportedly wanted to limit the number of new parties in the abm treaty although it acknowledged that this number would include more than just russia to minimize potential problems that might arise if the united states sought to negotiate changes to the treaty in the future but the state department argued and the white house agreed that the united states should not prejudge the outcome of negotiations on succession and should instead leave the decisions on whether to participate up to the potential successor states the scc reportedly completed preliminary agreement on the memorandum of understanding in may 1996 that would have allowed any former soviet state to become party to the abm treaty however only four states russia belarus ukraine and kazakhstan had participated in the discussions up to that point and they were the only ones that expressed an interest in joining the treaty as result the final agreement limited treaty participation to five nations these four former soviet states and the united states 6 at the present time russia has an agreement with the latvian government that permits it to operate the radar facility at skrunda latvia through august 31 1998 russian officials report that construction of the new radar at baranovichi belarus is behind schedule and therefore russia must extend the lease on the skrunda radar see aleksey meshkov russia latvian radar closure not to diminish detection potential moscow ria novosti february 19 1998 and mikhail shevtsov russia building radar station in belarus itar tass february 12 1998 7 scc parties sign agreements on multilateralizaiton tmd systems arms control today september 1997 p 26 crs6 substance of the agreement the memorandum of understanding mou on succession8 states that the united states of america the republic of belarus the republic of kazakhstan the russian federation and ukraine shall constitute the parties to the treaty it further states that the ussr successor states shall assume the rights and obligations of the former ussr under the treaty and shall each implement the provisions of the treaty with regard to its territory and activities either independently or in cooperation with any other state but these states cannot each deploy their own independent abm systems article vi of the mou states that the successor states shall collectively be limited at any one time to single antiballistic missile system deployment area and to total of more than fifteen abm launchers at abm test ranges the mou goes on to state that the terms national territory and territory of its country which referred to the territory of the soviet union would now refer to the combined territories of these successor states and the periphery of its national territory would now mean the periphery of the combined territories of the successor states these provisions would permit russia to continue to operate the test facility in kazakhstan and the radars in ukraine and to construct new early warning radar in belarus however with only four new participants some former soviet union abm facilities would still remain outside the territory of these participating states as result article v of the mou states that the successor states may continue to use any facility covered by the treaty that is currently located on the territory on any state that is not party to the treaty with the consent of such state consequently russia can continue to operate the early warning radars in latvia and azerbaijan as long as those states agree even though these radars are now outside the periphery of the participating nations issues for congress congressional review of the mou on succession the most contentious issue that came up during congressional discussions about the mou on succession was whether the agreement represented substantive change to the abm treaty and therefore was an amendment that should be subject to the advice and consent of the senate beginning in 1996 the clinton administration asserted that the mou would not represent substantive change to the treaty and therefore would not require the senates advice and consent because it would not alter the fundamental limits in the treaty the successors still could deploy only one abm site with 100 interceptor launchers and missiles and could not deploy an abm defense of their entire territory to the contrary the administration claimed that the mou works to preserve the original object and purpose of the abm treaty and that the us objective in negotiating the mou was to reconstitute the original treaty arrangement as closely 8 the formal title of this agreement is the memorandum of understanding relating to the treaty between the untied states of america and the union of the soviet socialist republics on the limitation of antiballistic missile systems of may 26 1972 the text of the agreement can be found at the arms control and disarmament site on the world wide web wwwacdagovfactsheemissdef crs7 as possible9 furthermore the administration argued that the resolution of succession questions after the dissolution of state has been regarded as function of the executive branch and that many executive agreements have been concluded that recognized the succession of new states to the treaty rights and obligations of their predecessors such agreements have not been regarded as treaty amendments but rather as the implementation of existing treaties10 congress has on several occasions however highlighted its interest in having any agreements related to the abm treaty submitted to the senate for its advice and consent for example in the defense authorization act for fy1995 pl103337 sec 232 congress stated that any international agreement that would substantively modify the abm treaty would not be binding unless the senate offered its advice and consent the conference report accompanying that legislation noted that there were wide range of views on what changes would be considered substantive so it requested that the administration consult with the senate to determine if changes were substantive11 the 104th congress sought to be more specific in the fy1997 defense authorization act the house stated that an agreement that added anyone other than the united states and russia to the abm treaty would constitute an amendment to the treaty and require advice and consent of the senate the final version of the defense authorization act for fy1997 did not contain this language in part because the clinton administration had threatened to veto bill with language requiring the submission of the succession agreement but the conference committee nevertheless noted in its report that congress would consider succession agreement to be substantive change to the treaty12 in addition in the defense appropriations bill for fy1997 the house sought to withhold funding for the standing consultative commission or for implementation of any new agreements reached in that commission until the president certified that he would submit the agreements to the senate for its advice and consent this language did not however become law the final version of the legislation which was included in the omnibus consolidated appropriations act for 1997 withheld funding for the scc until the president submitted report containing detailed analysis of whether the mou on succession would represent substantive change to the treaty13 the clinton administration submitted its analysis to congress on november 25 1996 in the report the administration presented the arguments described above to conclude that the mou on succession did not constitute substantive change to the 9 letter from national security advisor sandy berger to senate majority leader trent lott march 25 1997 10 us department of justice office of legal counsel office of the assistant attorney general memorandum for john m quinn counsel to the president from walter dellinger assistant attorney general re section 233a of s1745 june 26 1996 11 us congress house national defense

treaty and therefore did not require the advice and consent of the senate the administration also repeated its rationale in march 1997 in letter from national security advisor berger to senator lott and stated that it continued to believe that the mou would not need senate approval or any other congressional action to enter into force many in congress however disagreed with the administrations conclusions some argued that the mou would represent substantive change to the abm treaty even if it did not permit the deployment of additional abm defenses because it would limit the rights of and extend new obligations to states that had not possessed these rights and obligations before some members also argued that the agreement would change the substance of the treaty because it would redefine the territory and redraw the periphery of the nation covered by the treaty14 some analysts outside congress also claimed that the mou would change the substance of the treaty because it would change the composition of the standing consultative commission and because the parties had to negotiate new procedures for that body15 this however may not be relevant because the treaty specifically states that the parties to the treaty should establish and amend as necessary the regulations for the scc that govern its procedures composition and relevant matters consequently because the treaty in its original form foresaw the possible need for changes in the scc these changes probably do not constitute substantive changes in the treaty during its consideration of amendments to the conventional armed forces in europe treaty the cfe flank agreements the senate added condition to the resolution of ratification stating that the president must certify that he would submit the mou on succession to the senate before he could deposit the instruments of ratification for the cfe flank agreement the administration objected to this condition in part because it addressed an unrelated treaty in the resolution of ratification for amendments to the cfe treaty however when it realized that it did not have the votes to defeat the condition it accepted the senates mandate and agreed to submit the mou on succession to the senate for its advice and consent the president stated that he would submit this agreement along with the demarcation agreements and the protocol extending the elimination period in the start ii treaty to the senate after the russian parliament approved the ratification of start ii the russian parliament approved start ii in midapril 2000 but the administration has not yet indicated when it will submit the agreements to the senate the future of the abm treaty the clinton administration has argued that the mou on succession is needed to preserve the abm treaty and allow it to remain in force the administration supports this goal because it believes the treaty serves as the foundation of the usrussian strategic relationship16 the treatys supporters 14 these arguments are extended in the conference report to the fy 1997 defense authorization bill which can be found in congressional record july 30 1996 p h9250 15 moore thomas and baker spring the senates right to approve abm treaty changes must be upheld the heritage foundation executive memorandum 479 may 12 1997 p 2 16 see for example us department of state remarks by secretary of state madeleine k continued crs9 note that it remains relevant to this relationship even after the demise of the soviet union because it permits continuing reductions in strategic offensive nuclear weapons they believe that if the abm treaty were permitted to lapse due to the absence of succession agreement russia would not only fail to ratify the start ii agreement it might also stop implementing the start i agreement this is because officials in russia have argued that russia should not continue to implement reductions in its offensive weapons if the united states moves to deploy nationwide ballistic missile system and these same russian officials believe that the united states would deploy such system as soon as it was released from the obligations in the abm treaty17 in contrast some analysts and members of congress oppose the mou on succession precisely because it might prolong the life of the abm treaty18 they argue that the treaty is longer in the us national security interest because it limits the united states ability to defend itself against missile attacks instead they believe the united states should develop and deploy whatever missile defenses are necessary to respond to emerging ballistic missile threats from china north korea and other potential adversaries even if that means exceeding the limits in the abm treaty their insistence that the administration submit the mou to the senate was in part due to their interest in using the debate on the mou as foundation for broader debate to review the entire treaty19 others have opposed the mou on more specific grounds arguing that the added parties will complicate efforts to negotiate changes in the treatys restrictions on abm deployments20 they believe that the united states will need to seek changes 16 continued albright at

inconsistent with the national security of the united states our troops and our allies policy statement on missile defense and the helsinki summit by the 1997 house republican policy committee issued march 19 1997 19 some senators who support the continued implementation of the abm treaty also believe the senate should review the mou as an amendment to the treaty their position is motivated by their interests in preserving the senates constitutional role on treaties 20 see for example the prepared statement of r james woolsey in us congress house ballistic missile defense responding to the current ballistic missile threat committee on continued crs10 such as increases in the permitted numbers of abm sites and interceptor missiles or relaxation on the ban on spacebased sensors if it wants to deploy an effective national missile defense system and they fear that the new participants in the treaty will support russia if it objects to the changes in the abm treaty which could prolong the negotiations or even lead to vote of 41 against any us proposals 21 officials in the clinton administration have disputed this assertion they note that ukraine kazakhstan and belarus have their own interests and they do not always correspond to russias interests in addition john holum the director of the arms control and disarmament agency testified that these three nations had participated in the abmtmd demarcation discussions in the scc and that their participation had not complicated the negotiations22 agreed statements on abmtmd demarcation theater missile defenses and the abm treaty the 1972 abm treatys limits apply to missile defenses that are designed to intercept strategic offensive ballistic missiles but not to defensive systems that are designed to intercept shorterrange ballistic missiles or aircraft but the treaty states that other types of defensive systems cannot be given capabilities that will allow them to defend against strategic ballistic missiles and they cannot be tested in an abm mode23 the treaty does not however define strategic ballistic missiles or tested in an abm mode strategic ballistic missiles when the united states and russia signed the abm treaty they understood that strategic ballistic missiles were those systems limited by the interim agreement on offensive weapons that they signed at the same time in an agreed statement accompanying that agreement the parties specified that landbased strategic ballistic missiles were those with the range to reach from the northeastern border of the continental united states

missiles launchers or radars other than abm missiles abm launchers or abm radars capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles or their elements in flight trajectory and not to test them in an abm mode see us arms control and disarmament agency arms control and disarmament agreements texts and histories of the negotiations 1990 edition washington dc p 159 crs11 continental soviet union distance of 5500 kilometers but that distance did not define the range of submarinebased strategic ballistic missiles because these could move closer to the shores of the other nation nevertheless the parties shared an understanding of which submarinelaunched ballistic missiles were strategic because they agreed on the number of submarines and launchers covered by the treaty and some of these submarines and launchers carried the soviet ssn5 slbm submarinelaunched ballistic missile which had range of only 1400 kilometers24 tested in an abm mode although the abm treaty does not contain an agreed definition of tested in an abm mode the united states outlined its own definition in unilateral statement issued at the time it signed the treaty it said it would consider an interceptor missile to be tested in an abm mode if it were tested against target vehicle with flight trajectory of strategic ballistic missile or if it were flight tested in conjunction with the test of an abm interceptor missile or an abm radar at the same test range or if it were flight tested to an altitude inconsistent with the interception of targets against which air defenses are deployed the united states also indicated that it would consider radar to be tested in an abm mode if it made measurements on target vehicle with strategic ballistic missile trajectory during the reentry portion of the targets trajectory or made measurements in conjunction with the test of an abm interceptor missile or an abm radar at the same test range25 the united states and soviet union adopted an agreed statement that defined tested in an abm mode in 1978 the specific provisions of this statement remain classified but it contains the criteria that the two sides use when independently assessing whether tests of their missile defense components or systems will demonstrate capabilities against strategic ballistic missiles26 24 us library of congress congressional research service the abm

senate committee on governmental affairs subcommittee on international security proliferation and federal services compliance review process and missile defense hearing 105th cong 1st sess july 21 1997 washington dc p 5 the united states has also used concept known as the foster box when determining whether its defensive systems are tested in an abm mode during the 1972 senate debate over the abm treaty the director of pentagon defense research and engineering john foster testified that the upper threshold for nonabm testing should be an interceptor tested against target with maximum velocity of 2 kilometerssecond and maximum intercept altitude of 40 kilometers the united states has not used this threshold to mean that any defensive system tested against target with greater velocity or intercept altitude was tested in an abm mode it has instead used it to indicate that such tests would require further review using the standards in the 1978 statement to determine whether they were tests in an abm mode crs12 the demarcation problem based on the agreed statements therefore defensive system apparently would become subject to the limits in the abm treaty if it were given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles or if it were tested against targets that resembled strategic ballistic missiles in their flight trajectories as is noted above the parties included the 1400 km soviet ssn5 submarinelaunched ballistic among those limited by the salt i interim agreement using this standard any missile with range greater than 1400 kilometers could be considered strategic and any defensive system designed to counter missiles with that range or tested against missiles with that range could be subject to the limits in the abm treaty by the 1990s however some countries had developed theater ballistic missiles with ranges that exceeded 1400 kilometers china in particular had developed the 3500kilometer css2 intermediaterange missile at the same time both the united states and soviet union had retired their older shorter range submarinelaunched ballistic missiles as result threshold of 1400 kilometers for strategic ballistic missiles would be well below the range needed to define current strategic ballistic missiles but it would capture many modern theater ballistic missiles this was the crux of the demarcation problem for the united states if range of 1400 kilometers defined strategic ballistic missile then the limits in the abm treaty would apply to advanced theater missile defense systems even if they were never tested against and had only limited capabilities against modern strategic ballistic missiles negotiating the demarcation agreements the united states entered the abmtmd demarcation negotiations with simple objective it wanted to maintain the flexibility to develop advanced theater missile defense tmd systems without having those systems fall under the limits in the abm treaty according to administration documents the united states wanted to record clear understanding on the compliance of tmd systems and preclude disputes or ambiguities concerning current and future tmd systems27 the united states initially proposed simple demarcation rule that would define an abm interceptor as one that demonstrated the capability to destroy target ballistic missile with velocity greater than 5 kmsec28 anything tested against less capable targets would not be subject to the treaty limits this demarcation line would have defined the difference between theater and strategic ballistic missiles in way that would have permitted the united states to develop tmd systems to defend against missiles such as the chinese css2 which reportedly has peak velocity of around 5 kilometers per second without raising questions about whether the defenses could intercept modern strategic ballistic missiles which reportedly have peak velocities of at least 7 kilometers per second 27 us ballistic missile defense organization 1997 report to congress on ballistic missile defense washington dc p 15 28 us proposal to retool abm treaty reopens debate on missile defense arms control today januaryfebruary 1994 p 24 crs13 the united states recognized that tmd systems that were designed and tested against more advanced theater ballistic missiles might also have some theoretical capability against strategic ballistic missiles this is why it proposed that tmd systems not be covered by the treaty unless they demonstrated that capability presumably in test program russias objectives in the negotiations differed markedly from those of the united states instead of seeking demarcation line that would exclude advanced tmd programs from abm treaty limits russia sought formula that would capture advanced programs within the treatys confines this is because russia feared that the united states might deploy its advanced tmd systems in way that would allow the united states to intercept russias strategic ballistic missiles and therefore undermine russias nuclear deterrent29 to address these concerns russia proposed that an abm interceptor be defined as one with the capability to intercept targets with velocity of 3 kilometers per second rather than 5 kilometers per second russia also suggested that the parties limit the range of the target missile in tmd interceptor tests to 3500 kilometers and it proposed limit on the velocity of the interceptor missile at 3 kilometers per second any interceptor tested with greater velocity even if it were tested against shorter range or slower target missile would be considered to be an abm interceptor subject to the limits in the treaty russia also rejected the demonstrated capability criteria in the us proposal because it believed that us tmd systems could have capabilities against strategic ballistic missiles even if they had never been tested against those missiles hence under the russian proposal the limits in the abm treaty would apply to us tmd systems that might also have some capability against russias strategic ballistic missiles even if they never demonstrated that capability finally russia suggested that the parties link the number and location of deployed tmd systems to size and scope of threat and that they restrict the power of tmd radars these provisions were also intended to reduce the likelihood that the united states could deploy tmd systems in way that would threaten russias strategic offensive forces the united states rejected russias proposal to limit tmd interceptor velocity for all tmd systems to 3 kmsec although this would not have impeded the most mature of the advanced tmd systems the army theater high altitude area defense thaad which reportedly has an interceptor velocity of around 28 kmsec it would have precluded the development of two options for the navys wide area defense system the lightweight exoatmospheric projectile leap on an sm2 missile 4348 kmsec and modified thaad with mk72 booster 445 kmsec30 nevertheless the united states said it would accept limit of 3 kmsec for the velocity of landbased tmd interceptors and that it would also accept this limit for lowertier seabased interceptors ie tmd systems that would intercept their targets in the lower atmosphere but it would reserve the right to revisit the issue in 29 us proposal to retool abm treaty reopens debate on

navys options for wide area defense the united states sought the right to conduct up to 6 tests per year of faster interceptors those with speeds of 4045 kilometers per second that were designed to destroy targets in the upper atmosphere and to protect the air force boostphase interceptor program the united states offered to limit airbased interceptors to speed of 55 kmsec and range of 600 kilometers in tests32 in negotiations during the latter half of 1994 the united states and russia were unable to resolve their differences over the specific limits on interceptor velocity russia also repeated its proposal for restrictions on the numbers and locations of deployed tmd systems33 the united states objected because it did not want the abm treaty to limit the deployments of tmd systems the demarcation discussions in the scc were postponed during the first half of 199534 in the united states the new republican majority in congress objected to the negotiations and called on the president to suspend them35 during this time the united states reportedly reconsidered its position and reverted to its original proposal that the demarcation agreement limit the speed of target missiles not interceptor missiles36 at the same time high level talks between us and russian officials continued in an effort to develop joint declaration of principles that presidents clinton and 31 us officials emphasized this point to highlight the fact that they did not consider these limits to be permanent 32 us takes new offer to abm talks but dod in hurry for resolution inside the pentagon

as the cornerstone of strategic stability but they also agreed that both parties must have the option to establish and deploy effective tmd systems they also agreed that these tmd systems must not lead to the violation or circumvention of the abm treaty ie russias concern that the united states might use tmd systems to undermine russias strategic nuclear forces and that their deployment would not pose realistic threat as opposed to theoretical threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side this addressed the us concern about limits on tmd systems that were never tested against strategic targets they also agreed that their tmd systems would not be tested in way that would give them capabilities against each others forces and that the scale of tmd deployment would be consistent with the threat38 in june 1995 the united states offered new proposal that would have excluded from the abm treaty limits any tmd system with interceptor velocities below 3 kmsec as long as the system were tested against target with velocity of less than 5 kmsec but this 3 kmsec velocity for interceptors was not limit it was instead dividing line between slower and faster tmd interceptors the united states suggested that until they agreed on more formal arrangements the parties agree that testing and deployment of tmd systems with faster interceptors would be permitted subject to each sides own internal compliance review russia appeared willing to accept the us proposal for systems with slower interceptors but it rejected the proposal for systems with faster interceptors39 in midnovember 1995 the united states and russia incorporated their areas of agreement in framework that stated that all tmd systems could be tested against targets with velocities below 5 kmsec and ranges below 3500 kilometers40 they also agreed that interceptors tested with velocities of less than 3 kmsec would be considered to be treatycompliant as nonabm systems the framework also included confidencebuilding measures that were designed to address russias concerns about the potential capabilities of us tmd systems the parties agreed that they would provide prior notification of tmd tests against ballistic missile targets allow reciprocal visits at test ranges provide data exchanges on systems and programs provide annual notifications on routine deployment areas offer assurances that neither would deploy tmd systems in way that would jeopardize the other sides strategic nuclear forces provide an annual review of tmd and the theater missile threat and

systems with faster interceptors or the question of whether tests of these systems would be permitted in the absence of more formal arrangements41 in letter to secretary of state christopher42 russias foreign minister primakov insisted that an agreement on these systems limit them to tests against targets with maximum velocity of 5 kmsec and maximum range of 3500 km the same target limits that applied to slower interceptors ban tests of faster interceptors against targets with multiple warheads or strategic ballistic missile warheads ban spacebased tmd interceptors ban spacebased tracking and guidance sensors ban tmd systems based on other physical principles such as lasers and permit tmd systems with nuclear warheads this would have accommodated possible russian tmd program primakov also suggested that the two sides discuss limits on the basing of airlaunched faster tmd systems limit the velocity of these faster interceptors and restrict the numbers and locations of deployed tmd systems with faster interceptors the united states had already rejected many of the points in primakovs proposal including the limits on interceptor velocity limits on numbers and deployment areas for tmd systems and bans on spacebased components in addition the united states objected to ban on tests against targets with multiple warheads because it thought this would encourage rogue nations to develop multiple warhead missiles to evade us tmd systems the stalemate on an agreement for faster systems persisted through the end of 199643 the stalemate broke when presidents clinton and yeltsin met at helsinki in march 1997 and agreed on framework that balanced the us interest in leaving the velocity of interceptor missiles unlimited and compliance judgements up to the individual nations with russias interest in ensuring that us tmd deployments did not undermine russias strategic offensive forces in this framework the parties reaffirmed the may 1995 principles that stated their support for the abm treaty and their agreement that the parties could deploy tmd systems that did not undermine the treaty or pose realistic threat to the strategic forces of the other side the two sides also agreed as they had for slower tmd systems that they would only test faster interceptors against targets with velocities below 5 kilometers per second and ranges below 3500 kilometers the united states also accepted russias proposals for ban on spacebased tmd interceptors but it did not accept any constraints on spacebased sensors at helsinki the united states and russia also agreed to

before 1999 not to deploy faster land and airbased interceptors and not to test tmd interceptors against targets with multiple warheads or targets with strategic warheads these unilateral statements which the parties would issue annually and could change at any time were in lieu of russias proposal for explicit bans on these activities the provisions in these agreements became the agreed statements and associated documents that the parties signed in september 199744 substance of the agreements the abmtmd demarcation agreements consist of two separate agreed statements with common understandings an agreement on confidencebuilding measures related to tmd systems joint statement on the annual exchange of information on the status of plans and programs for tmd systems and us and russian unilateral statements on plans for tmd systems the following section describes the contents of each of these documents45 first agreed statement this document addresses the relationship between tmd systems with slowervelocity interceptors and the abm treaty specifically it defines slowervelocity systems as those with interceptors whose demonstrated velocity does not exceed 3 kmsec over any part of flight trajectory these systems will be considered compliant with the abm treaty as long as they meet two conditions during their flight tests the velocity of the ballistic targetmissile does not exceed 5 kmsec over any part of its flight trajectory and the range of the ballistic targetmissile does not exceed 3500 kilometers46 these characteristics of the target missile provide demarcation line between theater and strategic ballistic missiles which is consistent with the us approach from the beginning of the negotiations as long as tmd system with slowervelocity interceptor is not tested against strategic target ballistic missile it will be considered to have not been given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles and not been tested in an abm mode47 this is not however new definition of 44 the united states russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan all signed the documents on abmtmd demarcation and they agreed that these would enter into force simultaneously with the memorandum of understanding on succession 45 the text of these documents can be found at the arms control and disarmament site on the world wide web wwwacdagovfactsheemissdef 46 fact sheet on first agreed statement on abm treaty white house office of the press secretary september 26 1997 47 fact sheet on first agreed statement on abm treaty white house office of the press continued crs18 tested in an abm mode in the common understandings that accompany this statement the parties agreed that the provisions of this agreement are not intended to replace or amend the 1978 agreed statement that defines tested in an abm mode instead this agreement simply indicates that tmd systems that meet the conditions in this new agreed statement need not be assessed against the terms of the 1978 statement they will automatically be considered to be tmd systems that are not covered by the limits in the abm treaty the parties also agreed in common understanding that the velocity of space based interceptor missiles shall be considered to exceed 3 kilometers per second as result this agreed statement would not apply to tmd systems with spacebased interceptors some analysts believe that this agreed statement imposes limit on the velocity of tmd interceptor missiles they have concluded that because slower speed systems are automatically excluded from the limits in the abm treaty unless they are tested against strategic targets faster speed systems must automatically be covered by the limits in the abm treaty these conclusions are not true the designated speed for interceptor missiles is not limit but dividing line between those that are covered by the first agreed statement and those that are covered by the second agreed statement the united states can test tmd interceptors with velocities greater than 3 kmsec and they can deploy these tmd systems without abm treaty restriction as long as they meet the conditions set out in the second agreed statement and are not tested in an abm mode as defined by the 1978 joint statement second agreed statement the second agreed statement contains three specific limits on tmd systems with fastervelocity interceptors first these systems cannot be tested against ballistic targetmissiles with velocities that exceed 5 kmsec second they cannot be tested against ballistic targetmissiles with ranges that exceed 3500 kilometers and third the parties cannot develop test or deploy spacebased interceptor missiles for tmd systems or spacebased tmd interceptors based on other physical principles such as spacebased lasers the agreement states that this ban is designed to preclude the possibility of ambiguous situations or misunderstandings related to compliance because it is difficult to distinguish between spacebased abm and tmd interceptors the abm treaty already bans spacebased abm interceptors this provision does not however preclude the development of spacebased tmd sensors restriction that russia had sought throughout the negotiations beyond these three specific limits the second agreed statement does not include any further statements about when or whether tmd systems with faster velocity interceptors will be considered to have capabilities against strategic ballistic missiles or to be tested in an abm mode as result the parties must still refer to the 1978 statement when designing and developing these types of tmd systems nevertheless the parties agreed that they would hold further consultations in scc to 47 continued secretary september 26 1997 crs19 address questions and concerns that may come up as tmd technologies evolve the clinton administration has emphasized that this provision does not provide russia with veto over us advanced tmd systems and it is still up to the individual countries to determine whether their systems are consistent with the provisions of the abm treaty however some russian observers have argued that this provision means that the united states and russia must agree that tmd system is consistent with the terms of the second agreed statement including the principles in the preamble before the united states can deploy the system the second agreed statements preamble incorporates the principles that the united states and russia had first agreed on in may 1995 it states that the parties are committed to the abm treaty as the cornerstone of strategic stability that the parties have the option of deploying effective tmd systems but that such systems will not lead to the violation or circumvention of the abm treaty that the tmd systems will not pose realistic threat to the strategic nuclear forces of the other party that the tmd systems will not be deployed for use against the other party and that the scale of deployment will be consistent with the theater missile threat facing each party as is noted above russia had sought specific limits on the numbers and locations of tmd systems to ensure that the united states could not circumvent the abm treaty and deploy tmd systems in ways that would threaten russias strategic offensive forces the united states refused to accept limits on its tmd deployments but it was willing to reassure russia about its intentions by highlighting these principles agreement on confidencebuilding measures the united states and russia began discussing many of the provisions in this agreement during the early years of demarcation negotiations in it they agree to provide information that would help each side keep track of tmd development programs assess the capabilities of these systems and remain confident that these systems would not pose realistic threat to their strategic ballistic missiles the agreement states that the parties must provide the specified information for the us thaad and navy theaterwide systems and for the russian and ukrainian s300v sa12 system but they also agreed that all systems covered by the second agreed statement ie those with interceptor velocities greater than 3 kmsec will be subject to the confidencebuilding measures even if they are not listed when the agreement enters into force this is designed to address russias concerns about the potential capabilities of future us tmd programs by ensuring that russia will receive wide range of information and assurances about these systems as well the parties agreed to exchange tmd systems information on an annual basis beginning 90 days after the agreement enters into force included in this information are notifications that are designed to help the parties monitor tests of tmd systems these include c notifications about the locations of test ranges and test areas where launches of interceptor missiles for tmd systems will take place and c for launches of interceptor missiles when ballistic targetmissiles will be used in the test notifications about the location of the test range the type of interceptor crs20 to be used the planned date of the test and the location of the launch for both the interceptor and target missile each party can also arrange on voluntary basis to provide demonstration of its tmd systems or to allow visitors from the other parties to observe tests of systems covered by the agreement the parties also agreed to provide assurances that they would not deploy advanced tmd systems in numbers and locations that could pose realistic threat to strategic nuclear forces of the other side towards this end each side agreed to provide information about the theater ballistic missile threat confronting the nation and prompting the tmd deployment they also agreed to provide detailed information about the tmd programs covered by the agreement this information which would help each side understand the capabilities of the other parties tmd systems would include c the name basing mode and general concept of operations for the tmd systems c the status of plans and programs c for systems in testing the number of systems it plans to possess c information about the basing modes for tmd systems including the number of launchers in landbased battalion the type of ship and number of launchers on each type of ship the type of aircraft and number of interceptor missiles each type of aircraft is capable of carrying and the number of interceptors on fully loaded launcher and c technical data about the components of the systems including the length diameter type of propellant and maximum velocity demonstrated during launches of interceptor missiles the length and diameter of launch cannisters the number of missiles per launchers and the frequency band and potential of radars joint statement on annual exchange of information on the status of plans and programs as is noted above the parties agreed to provide information on the status of their plans and programs for tmd systems covered by the second agreed statement this information must include statements about whether the parties plan to test before april 1999 an interceptor with velocity greater than 3 kmsec whether they plan to develop systems with interceptors whose velocity exceeds 55 kmsec for landbased and airbased systems and 45 kmsec for seabased systems and whether they plan to test tmd systems against mirved targets or rvs planned for deployment on strategic ballistic missiles they agreed to provide this information each year and to hold consultations in the scc to address questions and concerns about activities related to any changes in the statements of the other parties in the initial statements provided in september 1997 all the parties stated that they had plans to undertake the designated activities crs21 during the negotiations russia had sought to ban the activities described in these statements the united states refused direct limits but did agree to reassure russia with the information in these statements some critics of the demarcation agreements fear either that the united states will essentially treat these statements as bans by avoiding the proscribed activity so that it will not have to change its statement or that russia will use scc consultations about changes in the statements as an opportunity to challenge and object to us plans and programs issues for congress congressional review as was true with the memorandum of understanding on succession congress and the clinton administration differed on whether the demarcation agreements would represent substantive changes to the abm treaty and therefore would require the advice and consent of the senate for their ratification when the administration opened the negotiations in 1993 it described the process as an effort to clarify the abm treaty as such it argued that the agreements would not need the advice and consent of the senate however many in congress disagreed in part because they objected to the substance of the negotiations and wanted to make sure that congress had chance to review and vote on the outcome in 1996 after the demarcation agreement for tmd systems with slowervelocity interceptors began to take shape the administration acknowledged that the agreement would represent substantive change to the abm treaty however it still did not agree that it would submit the agreement to the senate in letter to senator lott national security advisor berger noted that the justice departments office of legal counsel had noted that substantive change could be approved by majority vote of both houses of congress and that the administration could seek this approval after the agreement was completed or in advance of negotiation of an agreement provided the standards specified in advance by congress for an agreement are met48 prior to march 1997 the administration appeared to be willing to claim that congress had given this prior authorization for demarcation agreement based on the 5 kmsec velocity and 3500 kilometer range for target ballistic missiles this is because in the defense authorization bill for fy1996 congress had stated that tmd system should not be covered by the limits in the abm treaty unless its components were tested in an abm qualifying test and it defined an abm qualifying test as one conducted against target ballistic missile with velocity of 5 kmsec and range of 3500 kilometers because these characteristics were included in the agreement for tmd systems with slowervelocity interceptors the administration sought to claim that congress had already approved the demarcation line for those systems many in congress disagreed with the administrations conclusions in part because these characteristics were only part of the demarcation agreement and in part because it would have denied congress the chance to review and vote on the 48 letter from the national security advisor to senate majority leader lott march 25 1997 p 2 crs22 complete demarcation agreements after added pressure from congress and as part of the broader effort by the administration to win congressional approval of the flank agreement amending the conventional armed forces in europe cfe treaty the administration agreed in march 1997 that it would submit the agreed statements on demarcation to the senate for its advice and consent legislated vs negotiated standards many in congress took great interest in the specific details of the demarcation agreements and sought to legislate limits on the presidents ability to negotiate those agreements for example the house version of the missile defense act of 1995 which was debated as part of the fy1996 defense authorization bill stated that unless and until missile defense system system upgrade or system component is flight tested in an abm qualifying flight test such system upgrade or component has not for purposes of the abm treaty been tested in an abm mode nor been given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles and therefore is not subject to abm treaty as is noted above the legislation defined qualifying flight test as one against ballistic missile that exceeds range of 3500 km or velocity of 5 kilometers per second if this provision had become law the administration would have had reason to continue demarcation negotiations any result that was not consistent with this language would have been inconsistent with us law as result many in the house called on the president to suspend the negotiations with russia the senate version of the bill included the same definition of an abm qualifying flight test but instead of declaring that such flight test would be the demarcation line between abm and tmd systems required that any demarcation agreement with more restrictive criteria be sent to the senate for its advice and consent this formula remained in the final version of the legislation and not only permitted the administration to continue the negotiations it also served as the source of the administrations claim that congress had preauthorized the eventual demarcation agreements effects on us tmd programs the clinton administration has stated unequivocally that the demarcation agreements will not impede the development or deployment of any us tmd programs49 all six systems that are currently part of the us core tmd program can continue without raising abm treaty compliance issues50 five of those programs the armys patriot advanced capability system pac3 the marine corps hawk weapons systems improvements the armys theater high altitude area defense thaad program the navys area defense program and the medium extended air defense system meads are all covered by the first agreed statement51 all will be tested with interceptor velocities below 3 kmsec and none will be tested against target ballistic missiles with velocities that 49 see for example the remarks of secretary of defense william s cohen before the navy league exposition washington dc march 27 1997 50 press briefing by robert bell senior director for the nsc for defense policy and arms control the white house office of the press secretary march 24 1997 p 3 51 for detailed descriptions of these tmd programs see us ballistic missile defense organization 1997 report to congress on ballistic missile defense washington dc chapter 2 crs23 exceed 5 kmsec or ranges that exceed 3500 kilometers as result according to the first agreed statement none will be considered to be tested in an abm mode and all of the five will be compliant with the abm treaty the sixth system in the us core program the navy theater wide program is covered by the second agreed statement this system will not be tested against target ballistic missiles with velocities that exceed 5 kmsec or ranges that exceed 3500 kilometers and the united states has determined through its own unilateral compliance review process that this program will not violate the abm treatys prohibition on testing nonabm systems in an abm mode52 critics of the demarcation agreements however question the administrations conclusions some mistakenly believe that the 3 kmsec dividing line between missile defense systems with slower and faster interceptors would preclude the development of more capable tmd systems with faster interceptors53 most however recognize that the agreed statements do not limit the velocity of tmd interceptor missiles but they believe that the clinton administration may do so anyway they contend that the united states will unilaterally dumb down its tmd systems to avoid raising any compliance concerns that could lead to protracted discussions with the russians54 some observers have raised similar concerns about the statements on plans and programs that the parties agreed to update on an annual basis in these statements the united states has indicated that it has plans to test tmd interceptor with velocity greater than 3 kmsec against ballistic missile target before april 1999 that it has plans to develop tmd interceptors with velocities greater than 55 kmsec for landbased and airbased systems and 45 kmsec for seabased systems the only fasterspeed system under development the navys theater wide system reportedly will have interceptor velocities just under 45 kmsec and plans to test tmd systems against targets with multiple warheads or warheads for strategic ballistic missiles some critics argue that these unilateral statements could become virtual bans on the stated activities because the united states might restrict the capabilities of its tmd programs to avoid changing the statements and raising russian concerns or they believe that even if the united states changes its plans russia will use the promised consultations in the scc to delay or obstruct us plans the administration has responded by denying that the consultations would provide russia with veto over us plans and programs but this does not satisfy those who believe that the united states will restrain its programs itself to avoid these consultations and possible confrontations with the russians 52 see the statement of dr kent stansberry deputy assistant secretary of defense in us congress senate committee on governmental affairs subcommittee on international security proliferation and federal services compliance review process and missile defense hearing 105th cong 1st sess july 21 1997 washington dc p 8 53 see for example another abm giveaway the wall street journal march 24 1997 54 representative curt weldon has frequently expressed concerns about the possibility that the united states might dumb down its tmd systems to remain within the bounds of the limits in the demarcation agreements see another abm giveaway the wall street journal march 24 1997 crs24 some analysts have also questioned whether the general principles listed at the beginning of the second agreed statement might eventually limit the scope of us tmd systems in these principles the united states and russia have agreed that they will not deploy tmd systems that pose realistic threat to the strategic offensive forces of the other side and that the numbers and location of their tmd deployments will be consistent with the theater missile threat faced by each country these principles are designed to address russias concerns about the possibility that the united states might use advanced tmd systems to counter russias strategic ballistic missiles but they fall short of russias earlier insistence that the agreements limit the numbers and geographical locations of us tmd systems some critics fear that russia might question us deployment plans and use discussions in the scc as means to limit the numbers and locations of us tmd deployments55 implications of the ban on spacebased interceptors the clinton administration argues that the united states lost nothing when it agreed to ban space based theater missile defense interceptors in the second agreed statement because the united states currently has plans to develop or deploy such interceptors in addition administration officials have noted that for all practical purposes it would be impossible to distinguish between spacebased abm interceptors and spacebased tmd interceptors56 this is because it would actually be easier to intercept strategic ballistic missile than theater ballistic missile with space based interceptor because the strategic ballistic missile with its longer range would spend greater amount of time outside the atmosphere and within range of the interceptor missile hence if spacebased system had the capabilities needed to identify and intercept theater ballistic missile it would also be able to identify and intercept strategic ballistic missiles consequently according to administration officials because the abm treaty already bans spacebased abm components it also already bans space based tmd interceptors some analysts disagree with the administrations approach they argue that even though the united states currently has plans to develop spacebased tmd interceptors these plans could change in the future and some believe these plans should change they contend that spacebased interceptors may be the most promising technology for missile defense57 if given choice between maintaining the abm treaty with its ban on spacebased abm components and deploying space based abm or tmd interceptors they might recommend abrogation of the treaty and

administration has argued that the demarcation agreements strengthen the abm treaty by clarifying when tmd systems are not covered by the limits in the treaty and by calling for extensive data exchanges and notifications the agreements can eliminate potential disputes that might undermine the treaty and when it agreed that it would not deploy tmd systems that could pose realistic threat to russias ballistic missile forces the united states assured russia and others that it would not use tmd systems to undermine or circumvent the limits in the treaty some analysts in the arms control community disagree with the administrations assertions and instead argue that the demarcation agreements will undermine the abm treaty and strategic stability58 some contend that tmd systems with demonstrated capabilities against target missiles with velocities up to 5 kmsec would also have significant capabilities against ballistic missiles with velocities of 7 kmsec which is characteristic of strategic ballistic missile because the capabilities of the interceptors would degrade gradually not instantly beyond the threshold in the demarcation agreement59 as result these critics have argued that the demarcation agreements would permit the united states to develop advanced tmd systems that could intercept strategic ballistic missiles and provide nationwide defense of the united states some in the arms control community have also criticized the preamble to the second agreed statement because the united states and russia agreed that they would not deploy tmd systems that would pose realistic threat to the strategic ballistic missiles of the other side they claim that this weakens the abm treaty because it is far less stringent than the standards in the treaty when determining whether tmd system posed realistic threat to the strategic ballistic missiles of the other side the analysts assumed the nations would use forceonforce assessment would the deployed tmd system realistically be able to intercept enough strategic ballistic missiles to undermine the deterrent of the other side but these critics noted the abm treaty used different standard it prohibited giving even single interceptor capabilities against even single strategic ballistic missile hence the demarcation agreements would permit more robust defenses than the treaty would have allowed others argue that the demarcation agreements are not in the us interest because they would preserve the abm treaty at the expense of us tmd programs and missile defense deployments some including senator john kyl object specifically to the principle that states that the abm treaty remains the cornerstone 58 see for example new threat to the abm treaty the administrations tmd proposal arms control

public policy september 1994 pp 2628 crs26 of strategic stability60 these critics either do not accept the argument that offensive arms control reductions will be threatened by the deployment of missile defenses in the united states or they believe that the emerging threats to the united states justify the deployment of widespread theater and strategic missile defenses even if this undermines progress in offensive arms control others believe that the united states did not need to clarify the difference between abm and tmd systems to maintain the treaty they note that the treaty was never intended to apply to tmd systems and by negotiating limits on these systems the united states had converted the abm treaty into an abmtmd treaty the clinton administration has denied this contention noting that the treaty does cover tmd systems when it states that these cannot be given capabilities against strategic ballistic missiles or tested in an abm mode and the administration has argued that it did not negotiate abm treaty limits on tmd systems in the demarcation agreements to the contrary it negotiated provisions that would clarify the circumstances under which tmd systems were not covered by the abm treaty nevertheless critics argue that this effort was unnecessary they believe that the united states should pursue whatever tmd and national missile defense programs it needs to protect its own security without letting the abm treaty constrain those efforts instead they believe that the administration put the preservation of an obsolete agreement ahead of us national security interests61 others argue that the clinton administration went too far to preserve the abm treaty because they believe it is an inappropriate foundation for the relationship between the united states and russia some object to the administrations efforts to preserve the abm treaty because they see it as the foundation of an adversarial relationship between the united states and russia based on mutual vulnerability rather than cooperative relationship based on mutual respect62 instead some analysts have suggested that the united states and russia cooperate in the development of early warning systems and ballistic missile defenses because both face adversaries who are developing more effective ballistic missile systems that might deliver nuclear chemical or biological warheads63 they note that the bush administration pursued this type of agreement in negotiations conducted in 1991 and 1992 but the clinton administration stopped these discussions when it initiated the demarcation discussions in late 1993 when the senate reviews the agreed statements and associated documents it will address many of the questions raised here do the agreements interfere with 60 gertz bill clinton

concerns that could lead to russian objections will russia use further consultations about tmd systems as means to slow or stop us tmd programs and ultimately does the abm treaty continue to serve us
