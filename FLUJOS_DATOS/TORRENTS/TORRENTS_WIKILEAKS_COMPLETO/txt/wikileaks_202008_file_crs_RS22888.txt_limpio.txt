affairs defense and trade division updated may 30 2008 abstract the m4 carbine is the armys primary individual combat weapon for infantry units the m4 uses direct gas impingement system that blows carbon from the fired cartridge back into the weapons receiver which can lead to weapon malfunctions the us special operations command ussocom is replacing its m4s with the special operations combat assault rifle scar it is modular weapon with shortstroke piston system which eliminates carbon blow back that theoretically improves reliability some have questioned why the army has not adopted the scar or another similarly designed weapon series of studies and tests of the m4 and potential competitors have added to this debate order code rs22888 may 30 2008 the armys m4 carbine background and

added to this debate this report will be updated as events warrant background in the mid1990s the army began fielding the m4 carbine lighter more compact version of the vietnamera m16 rifle both m16 and m4 carbines are 556 mm caliber weapons and are primarily manufactured by colt defense llc hartford ct army officials are said to be satisfied with the m16 family of weapons suggesting that the m 16 is simply too expensive to replace with anything less than significant leap in technology1 the armys leap ahead program to replace the m16 family of weapons the objective individual combat weapon oicw program began in 1994 and one weapon evaluated in that program heckler kochs xm8 assault rifle was considered by some as the m16sm4s replacement as late as 2005 the xm8 was reportedly close to being officially approved as the armys new assault rifle but alleged acquisition and bureaucratic conflicts compelled the army to cancel the xm8 in october 2005 the army plans to continue its

some in congress have called for an open competition to choose successor to the m 16 and m4 assault rifles2 concerns with m4 reliability and lethality reports suggest that soldiers have expressed concerns regarding the reliability and lethality of the m43 reliability can be described as the probability that an item can perform its intended function for specified interval under stated conditions and lethality as the killing or stopping power of bullet when fired from weapon4 center for naval analyses cna study on small arms in combat5 in december 2006 the center for naval analyses cna published survey and study at the request of the armys project managersoldier weapons of 2600 soldiers who had returned from iraq and afghanistan and who had engaged in firefight using variety of small arms some of the m4specific observations were as follows over 50 of soldiers using the m4 and m16 reported that they never experienced stoppage malfunction while in theater to include during httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22888 training firing of the weapons p 2 frequency of disassembled cleaning had effect on the occurrences of stoppages variations in lubrication practices such as the type of lubrication used and the amount of lubrication applied also had little effect on stoppages using dry lubricant decreased reports for stoppages only for m4 users p 3 of soldiers surveyed who used the m4 89 reported being satisfied with their weapon p 11 of m4 users 20 recommended larger bullet for the m4 to increase lethality p 30 regarding m16s and m4smany soldiers and experts in theater commented on the limited ability to effectively stop targets saying that those personnel targets who were shot multiple times were still able to continue fighting p 29 although m4 critics cite this report as evidence of unsuitability of the m4 it might also be interpreted as favorable report on the m4s overall reliability and acceptance by soldiers the larger bullet recommendation for lethality purposes may in fact be valid recommendation based on observations from iraq and afghanistan but the bigger bullet debate has been source of contention for many small arms experts ever since the army adopted the 556 mm m16 during vietnam in lieu of the 762 mm m14 rifle 2 ibid 3 ibid 4 shawn t jenkins and douglas s lowrey comparative small analysis of current and planned small arms weapon systems

command ussocom was said to have documented m4 reliability problems in an official report noting that the m4 suffered from an obsolete operating system and recommending the redesign of the current gas system7 the ussocom report allegedly described the m4s shortened barrel and gas tube as fundamentally flaweddesign which contributed to failures extracting and ejecting spent cartridges during firing in recognition of these deficiencies the 1st special forces operational detachmentdelta also referred to as delta forcereportedly began working with german arms manufacturer heckler koch to replace the m4s gas system with piston operating system to improve reliability and increase parts life in 2004 delta reportedly replaced their m4s with the hk416 weapon that combines the operating characteristics of the m4 with the piston operating system8 in early 2003 ussocom officials initiated efforts to identify potential new combat rifle capabilities9 from may through august 2004 ussocom evaluated 12 weapons from nine different manufacturers10 in november 2004 ussocom awarded contract to fnh usa11 to develop the special operations combat assault rifle scar12 the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22888 scar will come in two variants the heavy 762 mm scarh and the light 556 mm scarl 13 each variant will accommodate three different barrels standard 357 cm barrel 255 cm

evaluation nears conclusion janes defence weekly march 19 2009 p 12 crs4 armys asymmetric warfare group and the hk416 the army describes the recently established asymmetric warfare group awg based in ft meade md as an army special missions unit consisting of carefully selected military department of the army civilians and contractors who observe and collect information about the evolving asymmetric operating environment by providing advisors to deployed and deploying forces in support in the global war on terrorism15 the army reportedly initially approved awg acquisition and use of hk416s in lieu of m4s but then reversed this decision stating the awg also advises units on training tactics and procedures in this capacity the use of the standard issue m4 is required in support of this mission set the decision was made to transition to the m4 and the awg is now turning in its hk rifles16 report maintains that awg fought to keep its several hundred 416s arguing that they outperform the armys m4 and require far less maintenance because the hk416 operates in similar fashion to the m4 and has comparable performance characteristics it is unlikely that training tactics and procedures vary greatly between the two weapons thereby causing some to question the motives behind the armys decision to recall the awgs hk416s httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22888 m4 reliability testing 2002 marine corps systems command test was said to have concluded that the m4 malfunctioned three times more often that the m16a4 as the m4 failed 186 times for variety of reasons over the course of 69000 rounds fired while the m16a4 failed 61 times17 in test conducted by the army between october 2005 and april 2006 10 new m16s and 10 new m4s were fired in 35000round test under laboratory conditions with both weapons firing approximately 5000 rounds between stoppages congressionally requested m4 test in april 2007 senator tom coburn roklahoma sent letter to then acting secretary of the army peter geren questioning why the army planned to spend 375 million on m4 carbines through fy2009 without considering newer and possibly better weapons available on the commercial market18 senator coburns letter also cited m4 reliability and lethality concerns and called for competition to evaluate alternatives to the m4 citing need to conduct free and open competition the army initially agreed to begin the tests in august 2007 at the army test and evaluation center at aberdeen proving ground md but then postponed the test until december 200719 the test evaluated the m4 against the hk416 the hk xm8 and the fnh scar with each weapon firing 6000 rounds under sandstorm conditions 15 see 2008 us army posture statement information paper asymmetric warfare group

in the following xm8 127 stoppages fnh scar 226 stoppages hk416 233 stoppages and the m4 882 stoppages20 on december 17 2007 when the army briefed congress and the press the army reportedly claimed that the m4 suffered only 296 stoppages during the test explaining that the stoppage discrepancy from the original 882 m4 stoppages reported could have been due to the application of the army test and evaluation centers posttest reliability availability and maintainability ram scoring conference21 this process attributes failures to such factors as operator error or part failure and as an example if evaluators linked 10 stoppages to broken part on weapon they could eliminate nine of the stoppages and count only one failure for reporting purposes it is not known whether the army also applied the ram process to the other three weapons in the test but it might be assumed that if the other three weapons were given equal treatment those weapons stoppages would also likely be decreased in manner similar to the m4 recent congressional action the administration requested 1511 million in fy2009 for the procurement of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22888 88964 m4 carbines to be produced by colt of hartford ct at 1200 per weapon not including combat optics and other accessories22 there is also request for an additional 795 million for 47185 m4s in the pending fy2008 global war on terror

11335 potential issues for congress additional reliability and lethality testing although many feel that recent tests studies and surveys call into question the armys decision to continue to procure and employ the m4 carbine it can also be argued that the m4 is generally wellregarded by the soldiers who use it in combat and its lethality may be more function of the round used as opposed to the actual weapon itself one potential option for gaining greater insight into this issue might be to outfit selected army infantry companies about 120 soldiers in both iraq and afghanistan with xm8s hk416s and fnh scars for yearlong comparative study with an infantry company equipped with m4s such 20 matthew cox new carbines outperform m4 in dust test army times december 17 2007 21 information in

exhibit p1g february 2008 p a9 crs6 study conducted in combat as opposed to in laboratories and on firing ranges might provide what could be described as the ultimate test of these weapons such testing is not unprecedented as the army has recently tested its land warrior integrated modular combat system in iraq with an infantry battalion in actual combat ussocom implications of replacing m4s it can be argued that ussocoms decision to adopt the fnh scar has implications for the army in one sense the scar is the first modular small arms system adopted by the military the scarl and scarh will replace the following weapons m4a1 mk18 close quarter carbine mk11 sniper security rifle mk12 special purpose rifle and the m14 rifle24 there is also 90 parts commonality between the scarl and scarh including common upper receiver and stock and trigger housing and an enhanced grenade launcher can be attached to either model25 while the scar might not meet all of the conventional armys requirements its adaptability in terms of missions close quarters combat to long range sniper operations being able to rapidly convert from 556 mm to 762 mm weapon and the ability to accommodate variety of modifications such as grenade launchers and special optics might be factors worth considering as the modular armyplans future small arms programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22888 open competition for an m4 replacement some small arms analysts have detected growing frustration among arms makers that the army is wedded to single company26 congress has also asked the army and dod to study and report on the feasibility and advisability of conducting an open competition for carbinetype weapons and to develop longterm competitive strategy for small arms if such an effort is undertaken by the army and the other services some might argue that lessons learned from past army small arms initiatives such as the objective individual combat weapon oicw program and more recently ussocoms special operations combat assault rifle scar program would facilitate such competition and procurement the scar program involved 10month full and open competition resulting in nine manufacturers submitting 12 weapons for consideration27 the program was described as operatorenvisioned operatortested and operator chosenwith navy army and marine special operators being extensively involved in design and testing28 supporters of competition maintain that number of existing carbine manufacturers are available and that precedent for joint development and testing is already established from their perspective new army initiative would benefit both in terms of reduced procurement time and developmental costs 24 scott r gourley soldier armed special operations forces combat
