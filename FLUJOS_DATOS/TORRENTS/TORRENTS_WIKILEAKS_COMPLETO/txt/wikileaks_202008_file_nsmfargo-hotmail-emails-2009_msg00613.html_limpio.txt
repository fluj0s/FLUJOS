is something fellow americansplease know i am black i grew up in the segregated south i did not vote for barack obama i wrote in ron pauls name as my choice for president most importantly i am not race conscious i do not require black president to know that i am person of worth and that life is worth living i do not require black president to love the ideal of americai cannot join you in your celebration i feel elation there is smile on my face i am not jumping with joy there are tears of triumph in my eyes for such emotions and behavior to come from i would have to deny all that i know about the requirements of human flourishing and survival all that i know about the history of the united states of america all that i know about american race relations and all that i know about barack obama as politician i would have to deny the nature of the change that obama asserts has come to americamost importantly i would have to abnegate my certain understanding that you have chosen to sprint down the road to serfdom that we have been on for over century i would have to pretend that individual liberty has value for the success of human life i would have to evade your rejection of the slender reed of capitalism on which your success and mine depend i would have to think it somehow rational that 94 percent of the 12 million blacks in this country voted for man because he looks like them that blacks are permitted to play the race card and that they were joined by selfdeclared progressive whites who voted for him because he doesnt look like themi would have to wipe my mind clean of all that i know about the kind of people who have advised and taught barack obama and will fill posts in his administration political intellectuals like my former colleagues at harvard universitys kennedy school of governmenti would have to believe that fairness is the equivalent of justice i would have to believe that man who asks to go forward in new spirit of service in new service of sacrifice is speaking in my interest i would have to accept the premise of man that economic prosperity comes from the bottom up and who arrogantly believes that he can will it into existence by the use of government force i would have to admire man who thinks the standard of living of the masses can be improved by destroying the most productive and the generators of wealth finally americans i would have to erase from my consciousness the scene of 125000 screaming crying cheering people in grant park chicago irrationally chanting yes we can finally i would have to wipe all memory of all the times i have heard politicians pundits journalists editorialists bloggers and intellectuals declare that capitalism is dead and one including and especially alan greenspan objected to their assumption that the particular version of the anticapitalistic mentality that they want to replace with their own version of anticapitalism is anything remotely equivalent to capitalism so you have made history americans you and your children have elected black man to the office of the president of the united states the wounded giant of the world the battle between john wayne and jane fonda is over and that fonda won eugene mccarthy and george mcgovern must be very happy men jimmie carter too and the kennedys have at last gotten their kennedy lookalike the selfrighteous welfare statists in the suburbs can feel warm moments of satisfaction for having elected black personso toast yourselves 60s countercultural radicals 80s yuppies and 90s bourgeois bohemians toast yourselves black america shout your glee harvard princeton yale duke stanford and berkeley you have elected not an individual who is qualified to be president but black man who like the pragmatist franklin roosevelt promises to do something you now have someone who has picked up the baton of lyndon johnsons great society but you have also foolishly traded your freedom and mine what little there is left for the chance to feel good there is nothing in that can share your happy obliviousness windows live hotmail celebrate the moment with your favorite sports pics check it out
