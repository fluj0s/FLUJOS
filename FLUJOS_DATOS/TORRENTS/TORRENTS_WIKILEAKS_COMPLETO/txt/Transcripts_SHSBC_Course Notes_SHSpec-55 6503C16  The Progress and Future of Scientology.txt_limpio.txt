6503c16 shspec55 the progress and future of scientology in 1950 people used to yammer at lrh about fixing up the organization he was caught flatfooted when dmsmh was published one expected it to be bestseller but it was and it stayed at the top of the list for months the publishing firm that published it was overwhelmed by it when others set up the foundation and asked lrh to run it he said ok but he had management control he proposed some ideas then which are only now being put into action until about july 1950 his attitude was well i just wrote it the name lrh was getting very popular but he was trying to avoid the hat but he was setting the place up giving eight hours or so of lecture day getting the building the furniture etc the building had three main railroad lines one on each side lrh used to fix up pcs that other auditors couldnt handle he started the has course using the data straight out of book one the students all went onto the original hca course the word hubbard in hubbard dianetic auditor and in other titles was chosen by the elizabeth and auditors lrh went along with it with certain misgivings few days before the publication of dmsmh palmer at the explorers club offered lrh an expedition to the dodecanese islands south of greece to find sunken ship with statuary the deeper into 1950 it got the better the expedition looked the organization took more and more of lrhs time lrh was still telling people this kind of thing the general manager said to lrh you must front up the organization these people are depending on you lrh found out that joe winter was squirreling telling people that dianetics was developed by some nonexistent group of scientists and that auditing was an art with nothing scientific about it contemporary subjects were things like psychodrama moreno et these things looked good but they didnt work so two hours after the first meeting of the dianetic foundation lrh put his time on the line and took responsibility for the development of the subject rather reluctantly he wasnt prepared to make his life an open book because it was too incredible for people to believe and they would call him liar lrh is not in bad favor with washington senators etc in 1955 if he had wanted to lrh could have gotten legislation passed that would have protected scientology the fbi was very nice when he wanted to find out who out of about 200 staff people were communists they told him who were not communists about thirty out of 200 there was an airplane waiting to take lrh to st louis and put him in spinbin fortunately the people who were sent to get him werent as well trained in combat as he was he took care of them this all occurred subsequent to lrh taking on his hat it has taken fifteen years to get to state where the hat could be worn because lrhs hat assaults the foundations of the society we live in by talking about freeing man bettering man etc ours is philosophy that says that people cant be lied to that we can see through the black magic spells this is an interesting civilization because people dont know who they are where they are where they are going or what they are doing you start laying truth on the line and confusion starts to blow off the early days of dianetics followed that rule we got through it because in july 1955 lrh wore his hat of being him and one has been able to throw him off it since lrh is also capable of occupying subordinate role lrh worried for awhile that he was one of those guys who can only lead and cannot follow however he was delighted to find out in the navy that he was also an excellent subordinate but to occupy topdog role all the way up you know theres government or any mystic vision back of you and confront everything simultaneously and stand there regardless of the dead cats the alarm clocks and bricks and everything else which are coming your way that took some doing and thats all you look at when you look at this early history it was stable datum going into very very aberrated world from where i looked it looked awful lonesome occasionally it took some doing and some confront we have changed things in the world we have changed psychology for one thing it wasnt done alone early staffs took beating at times eg in philadelphia when fifteen or twenty cops came to arrest lrh as witness in bankruptcy hearing by the time the federal marshalls got to lrh they were utterly demoralized they took him downtown before judge and there was great embarrassment when the lies from the wichita foundation were uncovered but we have been standing still waiting for the dead cats to clear from the air our early history is that of trying at first unsuccessfully to just hold position putting in dianetics as stable datum blew off enough confusion in the society so that we could move for long time it was impossible to hold position stably hence the way the early foundations moved around lrh was standing there as being but as an organization we couldnt stand up lrhs idea was to do his research and get it to the point where there was dependable gain there for every case easily attainable and deliverable he paid attention to the dead cats that may have been rough on people the group has been asking him to advance line into society while he has been fixing up the technology so that it could be delivered he has kept organizations running but he has not put much time in on organization comparatively in the early days the reason we didnt deliver was that there was way to enforce the way to do it dianetics got enturbulated because unstraight tech poorly delivered prevented case advance and there wasnt any way you could discipline the administration of the technology to discipline the administration of the tech the following is required 1 youve got to have the technology and not hidden standards 2 youve got to be able to make it known 3 you have to police its use ie to make sure that it is that technology that is applied that is the 123 of an administration early on we lacked not only the tech to handle simple things like ow and pt concerns of the pc but also the means to see that what we did have got applied dianetics was not and we are not just an idea book copyright or nice philosophy lying in book on shelf we are bringing live human beings up to recognition of their own beingness and that is live action we dont face it because it is easier to confront concept than live being we have never been anything but beings going through society when we started up the line it was the enturbulation of the trillions starting to blow we had more ways to knock out the whole track than to get the overt out of the last hour we had started to make hole in the collective aberration of mankind it was we as beings making the hole not the idea not with good tools not with administration to enforce what tech we had you are perfectly right to say its rons fault that it didnt all go smoothly i should have been an ot who came to earth and got ahold of someone named moses and said hey moses here are some rules now you go back and front for is there anything wrong with that story can you imagine anyone doing that if he had all that power this didnt happen it just required more nerve to stand up by yourself the people who attacked us are dead or in terrible shape the organizations that attacked us are weaker we have held the fort successfully and we can now begin to do what we want rather than what we have to do we are holding our position as an organization now we are able to get tech applied our organization takes the form we want it to take in 1950 lrh said it will go as far as it works he has been pushing the tech to its limit despite pleas to take over the admin things are becoming more orderly now lrh is in position to put in administrative form and structure we had gotten ourselves to position where we were holding ourselves from expanding now the instructor can wear his hat in the course the action of administration is simply smoothing out the enturbulence of the environment when you introduce someone to scientology he can run into lots of confusion with the other people in his environment he has changed and they havent as an individual he goes through what scientology as group has gone through however it wont take him fifteen years to get up to point where he can hold his case gain there is terrific relationship between the environment the individual and the speed with which process works the earlier auditing on case is race between the auditor and the pcs environment that was true of the introduction of dianetics and scientology into the environment also that was also race the guy who has an early win in scientology tells his friends and confusion blows off which may spin him in he gets inval etc he has put in stable datum and cant hold his position in the resultant confusion youve got to get process working on somebody that is effective enough so that the environment wont knock him down faster than you can pull him up you have to deliver to him the kind of technology that he can somehow stand up with you must not unsettle him eg with r6 you want him to be stable furthermore you want to give him some administrative protection today you have been given weapons of administrative protection for your pc as well as method of forcing pc to take action and not keep messing up in his environment we are more powerful and things are more stable than ever before and will continue to be so as long as we follow the channels of the administrative system as long as our mutual understanding of the existing situation and the lessons of what we have been through are applied we have had lines that were blocked lrh is pulling out the blocks now putting in comm lines etc the trick is to avoid unsettling lines that are already in and working the goal is an accelerating curve we are past the critical point of organizational case gain now we can hold our gains now we have to get in comm lines and put policy to work if you want to strengthen an organization just find the blocks to expansion and pull them out open up your comm lines put your barriers on the edges of the lines to channel them and put life into the group last summer lrh changed the whole org board to make it more workable this action resulted in smoother flows and less upset we are about to complete that reorganization without cutting out any working lines but paralleling them duplicative functions are being cut out so there is less traffic all we ask of staff member is to discipline his comm line there is vast rush to get the tech all published we need to get the organizational lines in first so that when we hit the society with new material there will be lines for the traffic to flow on the levels checksheets and processes are ready for release the processes are simpler than you would expect earlier technology was more advanced in some instances than later tech for instance the material in the philadelphia doctorate course is level vii material the old technology was workable ever since excalibur was written in 1938 but the chances of it being received followed or applied were remote we are now moving ahead to some law and order which smooths things out man was too far down to know that he was confused now he can come up through the confusion
