claims implications for us interests summary the relatively shallow and resourcerich waters surrounding the peoples republic of china prc are of growing economic and strategic importance yet they often remain invisible in the american foreign policy process the united states along with most of the international community regards these as international waters through which approximately half of the worlds seagoing commercial shipments pass each year consequently primary us economic and strategic objective in the region has been the maintenance of freedomofnavigation through these waters but apart from their economic and strategic importance the semienclosed south and east china seas are filled with political and diplomatic complexities nine surrounding states have competing territorial claims to the hundreds of various islets shoals reefs and maritime zones in these waters the common claimant in all cases is the prc which increasing ly has sought to define its sovereignty and economic exclusivity here in the broadest possible way hundreds of miles from its shores to include the spratly islands pratas islands paracel islands macclesfield bank and senkaku islands successful prosecution of these wideranging maritime claims by the prc could greatly change the economic and strategic makeup of the region other claimants of these islands and maritime zones include countries with which the united states has defense commitments such as japan thailand and the philippines making peaceful resolution of these claims an important us interest in addition to claims of sovereignty over the islands and reefs in these waters the prc increasingly is narrowly interpreting provisions of international law that govern activity in the 200mile maritime zone the exclusive economic zone eez off its coast as demonstrated by the april 2001 us navy ep3 reconnaissance plane incident the prc now appears to be arguing that its 200mile maritime jurisdiction extends to the airspace over its eez moreover the prc is claiming that the freedom of navigation and overflight in eezs provided under the convention on the law of the sea convention should be subordinate to the broad jurisdiction of the sovereign state not as the convention is generally read subject only to the economic and resourcerelated rights of the sovereign state in addition to their economic implications competing regional maritime claims and disagreements over provisions of international law have farranging security implications the prc views its southern coast as fairly vulnerable particularly to us naval forces although prc military forces are still limited the prc is steadily expanding its presence in the south china sea prepositio ning supplies and equipment and building up outposts on various islands some believe that over the longer term continued prc expansion and assertiven ess in these maritime regions will put beijing in position to more effectively challenge us economic political and security

maritime territorial claims implications for us interests overview and issue definition1 the collision on april 1 2001 of chinese jet fighter with us navy reconnaissance plane over the south china sea drew unusual public attention to the ocean areas south and east of the peoples republic of china prc the south china sea and the east china sea these relatively shallow resourcerich waters are of growing economic and strategic importance yet they often remain invisible in the american policy process the united states along with most of the international community regards these as international waters according to one estimate more than half of the worlds seagoing commercial shipments pass through this area each year including the bulk of interasian trade and most of japans annual oil imports consequently primary us economic and strategic objective in the region has been the maintenance of freedomofnavigation through these waters but apart from their economic and strategic importance the semienclosed south and east china seas are filled with political and diplomatic complexities nine surrounding states have competing territorial claims to the hundreds of various islets shoals reefs and maritime zones in these waters the common claimant in all cases is the prc which increasingly has sought to define its sovereignty and economic exclusivity here in the broadest possible way to include most or all of the south and east china seas other claimants include countries with which the united states has defense commitments such as japan thailand and the philippines making peaceful resolution of these claims vital us interest in further complication the island of taiwan easily the most sensitive and longstanding issue in usprc relations straddles the east and south china seas separated from the prc mainland by 90 miles across the taiwan strait taiwan makes the same claims as the prc to islands in these waters but its claims are based on the taiwan governments precivil war status as the republic of china on the mainland on this issue then both the taiwan and prc governments find themselves in the unusual position of being on the same side as both make their claims on behalf of the chinese nation this report provides an overview of which islands and reefs are in dispute and who claims them background on chinese assertions and justifications about the extent of chinese sovereignty in these waters the economic and strategic significance of the relevant sea lines of communication both for asia and for us interests an analysis of prc military activity and interests in the region as well as an overview ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs2 2 according to stein tonnesson the ninedotted line was drawn in the 1930s although first published officially only in 1947 by the chiang kaishek roc government tonnes stein china and the south china sea peace proposal in security dialogue vol 313 september 2000 p 312 3 peter kienhong yu makes this point in his article the chinese broken ushaped line points lines and zones in the south china sea not yet published other scholars have argued that only the islands and land masses themselves are being claimed another problematic point given the lowtide elevations of many of them confrontations in the area and an analysis of international legal interpret ations of these issues finally the report discusses the implications of competing southeast china sea claims for us economic and strategic interests and the implications that us treaty obligations to claimant states have for resolution of these claims issues surrounding chinas maritime claims the south china sea is semienclosed sea bordered by china taiwan vietnam brunei malaysia indonesia and the philippines all of which have long maintained claims to some or all of the islands and shoals that dot the sea another set of claims involves the ryukyu and kyushu islands in the east china sea bordered by china taiwan and japan beginning in the 1970s when seismic explorations indicated the potential for vast offshore oil and gas fields in the south and east china sea areas claimant countries began to pay more attention to their competing maritime claims in these waters and began to press their claims more assertively three interrelated issues are involved in these claims conflicting claims about sovereignty over territory conflicting interpretations about national exclusive economic zones eezs and maritime zones and disagreements over the extent of freedom of navigation and overflight that is permitted under the convention on the law of the sea hereafter called convention territorialsovereignty claims south china sea since the early 1900s the chinese government has used what has come to be known as the ninedotted or ushaped line to define its territorial claims in the south china sea2 official chinese maps both those of the prc and of taiwan continue to show this dotted line marking the presumed area claimed as sovereign chinese territory see figure 1 there is international legal controversy and disagreement over this drawn line even among some chinese scholars first the exact boundaries of the line are unknown as they contain reference to latitude and longitude points making its legal validity questionable second that the line is drawn on maps of china appears to suggest that china claims sovereignty over not only the islands within this line but the sea and seabed itself including all marine and natural resources an interpretation at variance with the convention which the prc has ratified3 some chinese scholars justify this claim on the grounds that this is chinas historic bay despite the fact that many western scholars say that waters surrounded by so many other sovereign states can be single countrys historic bay under the convention state is allowed tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs3 4 ji guoxing china versus south china sea security in security dialogue vol 29 1 1998 p 101 5 in addition the 1992 territorial waters law asserts prc sovereignty over taiwan the senkaku islands and the pescadoresfigure 1 chinas ninedotted linesubsume waters in its historic bay which otherwise would be subject to the 200 nautical mile eez limitations thus any exploration or other economic activity can be conducted in an historic bay only with the express permission of the sovereign government other chinese scholars however allege that western concepts that china wants to make the south china sea domestic lake are misconceptions4 in 1992 the prc attempted to codify the claims implied by the ninedotted line by enacting the law on the territorial sea and the contiguous zones which specifically stated its territorial claims over four island and reef groups in the south china sea5 the following year in 1993 taiwan established its own policy position for all of its south china sea claims through the executive yuans policy guidelines for the south china sea the economic implications of the conflicting claims in this region are profound in addition to potentially large offshore oil and gas deposits these shallow waters provide transit for much of the worlds shipping through the south china sea by way of the strait of malacca between thailand and indonesia the sunda strait and the lombok strait both within the indonesian island chain in addition bordering countries are placing increasing emphasis on the rich fishinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs4 6 from 19391945 japan occupied both the spratlys and the paracels establishing submarine bases there after japans surrender the republic of china government briefly established garrison in the spratlys before abandoning it and fleeing to taiwan after defeat by chinese communist troops 7 under the convention body of land meets the definition of an island if it is above water at high tide see convention 1211resources in this region the health of which increasingly depends on coordinated and environmentally sound ocean transport and marine management policies spratly islands the largest group of the south china sea islands is the spratly group the 400 or so islands islets reefs and rocks spread across approximately 800000 square miles in the far southeast of the area delineated by the prcs ninedotted line and due west of the philippine coast see figure 2 the prc claims sovereignty over all of the spratly islands nansha as do taiwan and vietnam6 since 1955 taiwan has maintained naval presence on the northern island of itu aba or taiping island the largest of the spratly islands although in 1999 taiwan replaced its military troops with coast guard personnel claiming the island could not be defended common problem with all the islets and reefs in the spratly group other islands in the spratlys are claimed by brunei which claims one reef and occupies territory in the spratlys the philippines and malaysia although china taiwan vietnam the philippines and malaysia all occupy territory in the spratlys none of the islands has been permanently inhabited an important distinction in the convention in another important convention distinction only 22 to 40 of the spratly islands are above water at high tide7 mischief reef one of the spratlys on which the prc has constructed permanent structures is below water at high tide and thus is not considered an island under convention definitions the paracel islands the prc also lays claim to all of the paracel islands xisha group of islands east of the vietnam coast and closer to the south china coast than are the spratlys see figure 1 although the paracels are also claimed by vietnam prc military forces have been the sole occupants of the islands since 1974 the prcs navy maintains an airbase on one of the islands in the paracel group woody island located midway between the prcs hainan island and the macclesfield bank the pratas islands although the prc also claims the small pratas island dongsha group off the southwestern taiwan and southern prc coasts taiwan physically occupies the one island and two coral reefs making up this grouping as pratas island is always above water taiwan maintains an airfield on pratas as well as several emergency service centers for fishing boats operating in this area of the south china sea the macclesfield bank the fourth island archipelago claimed by the prc in the south china sea is the macclesfield bank zhongsha including scarborough reef both north of the spratly islands scarborough reef is also claimed by taiwan and the philippines

formosa to the japanese since this treaty did not mention the senkakus japan has claimed that its rights to the islands were conveyed in separate action unrelated to the war this becomes relevant later during allied agreements at potsdam in which the allies agreed to restore to china those territories it lost to japan through military aggression 9 us civil administration of the ryukyus proclamation 27 uscar 27 10 inclusion of both the ryukyus and the senkakus was clarified in an agreed minute to the okinawa reversion treaty see us congress senate committee on foreign relations okinawa reversion treaty hearings 92nd congress 1st session october 27 29 1971 washington us govt printing office 1971senkaku and ryukyu islands east china sea different set of issues surrounds chinas competing claims over the eight uninhabited senkaku diaoyu islands and the ryukyu islands the largest of which is okinawa in the east china sea the prc taiwan and japan have all had longstanding claims to these islands which like the south china sea islands are presumed to have good potential for oil and gas deposits the chinese side both the prc and taiwan traces its claims back to the 14th century when ming dynasty fishing vessels frequented the islands although the ming never established permanent presence there japans claim to the islands dates from january of 1895 during the sinojapanese war when the chinese emperor agreed to cede the senkakus to japan8 in the 1951 treaty of peace with japan the united states assumed control over both the senkakus and the ryukyus although the former were not specifically mentioned in the 1951 treaty in 1953 proclamation us officials responsible for administering the ryukyus broadly defined the region under us control to include the senkakus9 thus in 1971 when the united states signed the okinawa reversion treaty with japan returning to japan the areas and territories being administered by the united states the senkakus were included10 japans claim to the senkaku islands has been in dispute with both china and taiwan ever since subsequently and despite language in the okinawa reversion treaty that has been interpreted to apply the usjapan security treaty to both the ryukyu and senkaku islands us officials have maintained neutral position over the islands status repeatedly stating that the okinawa treaty language has bearing on any outstanding claims to sovereignty over the islands in question internat ional law gives some guidance for resolving the conflicting claims of sovereignty over these various islands the decided cases are few but the elements that have been used in determining sovereignty have included discovery occupation exercise of authority and acquiescence by other states thus historical facts about these elements play crucial legal role in any given situation and the cases are necessarily factspecific while it seems doubtful that the competing claimants to the islands in the south china sea and east china sea are amenable to legal resolution of the various disputes at present their public justifications are often rooted in these legal concepts see appendix for summary of the international legal cases involving questions of sovereignty over islandshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs7 11 prepared by dave ackerman american law division august 2001 12 the convention entered into force on november 16 1994 and as of september 2nd 2001 has been ratified by 137 states including the prc and all of the other state claimants to the spratly islands with the exception of taiwan 13 convention articles 2 and 3 14 id art 33 15 convention articles 5557 16 id articles 7677 17 id art 121maritimeexclusive economic zones11 the second set of issues involved in competing maritime claims is the definition of maritime and exclusive economic zones or eezs these issues are primarily governed by the convention which is intended to establish comprehensive legal regime governing all uses of the oceans and of their resources12 the convention recognizes that every coastal state may lay claim to number of differing maritime zones that give it designated rights territorial sea first coastal state is entitled to claim belt of sea adjacent to its coast as its territorial sea this territorial sea may extend up to 12 miles from the coast and in this belt of sea the coastal state may exercise full sovereignty13 contiguous zone second coastal state may also establish zone adjacent to its territorial sea as contiguous zone within this zone the coastal state is not sovereign but it may exercise the control necessary to prevent and punish infringements of the customs fiscal immigration and sanitary laws and regulations that apply in its territorial sea the contiguous zone may extend up to 24 miles from the coast14 exclusive economic zone eez third coastal state may claim belt of sea up to 200 miles from its coast as its exclusive economic zone eez in this area the coastal state is entitled to exercise sovereign rights over the living and nonliving resources of the sea the seabed and the subsoil of the seabed15 continental shelf finally the convention recognizes the legal right of every coastal state to control and exploit the natural resources of its continental shelf up to 350 miles from its coast16 the claims of malaysia and brunei apparently rest in part on the assertion that some of the islands in these waters are within one or more of their maritime zones but more importantly under the convention these maritime zones may extend not only from the primary land area of coastal state but also from any islands over which it is sovereign17 thus to the extent that any of the claimant states can successfully lay claim to sovereignty over disputed islands they may also establish the pertinent maritime zones around the islands and lay claim to their economic and otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs8 18 id 19 the convention provides that rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have exclusive economic zone or continental shelf id 20 in the convention archipelagic states are accorded special privileges the convention defines an archipelagic state as group of islands including parts of islands interconnecting waters and other natural features which are so closely interrelated that such islands waters and other natural features form an intrinsic geographical economic and political entity the convention allows archipelagic nations such as indonesia to draw baselines connecting their islands which essentially create sovereign archipelagic waters states also have rights of transit passage and overflight through archipelagic waters 21 convention art 87benefits that could include the fisheries of the islands eez as well as the oil and mineral resources of their eezs and continental shelfs nonetheless it deserves emphasis that serious questions exist concerning the extent to which some of these disputed islands possess the characteristics necessary to give rise to these maritime zones under the convention an island is broadly defined to mean naturally formed area of land surrounded by water which is above water at high tide18 however few of these islands for instance only 22 40 of the more than 400 islands in the spratly group are above water at high tide thus they do not meet the convention definition of an island moreover the convention also provides that an eez and continental shelf may be generated by an island only if the island is habitable or able to sustain an economic life in other words these zones may not be based on possession of an uninhabitable rock19 although these standards concerning habitability and economic viability are not entirely transparent they likely pose additional barriers to the capacity of at least some of the islands to be used as basis for establishing an eez or claiming the resources of their continental shelfs freedoms of navigation and overflight the foregoing maritime zones also have implications for navigation in and overflight of parts of the south china sea the third set of issues in competing maritime claims in the region under the convention the high seas are deemed to comprise all parts of the sea that are not included in states internal waters territorial sea or eez or in the archipelagic waters of an archipelagic state20 on and over the high seas the principles of freedom of navigation and freedom of overflight govern21 similarly the convention states that the principles of freedom of navigation and of overflight apply with respect to the 200mile eez on and over internal waters and the territorial sea 12 miles however there is right of overflight at all overflight is allowed only with the permission of the coastal state in these areas moreover navigation is subject to the control of the coastal state while the ships of other states have right to traverse the territorial sea but not internal waters of coastal state that passage is required to be innocent in nature ie it must not be prejudicial to the peace good order or security of the coastalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs9 22 id art

convention the freedoms referred to in article 87 of navigation and overflight and of the laying of submarine cables and pipelines and other internationally lawful uses of the sea related to these freedoms such as those associated with the operation of ships aircraft and submarine cables and pipelines and compatible with the other provisions of this convention in exercising their rights and performing their duties under this convention in the exclusive economic zone states shall have due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal state and shall comply with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal state in accordance with the provisions of this convention and other rules of international law in so far as they are not incompatible with this part httpwwwoceanlawnettextsloschtmstate22 also the coastal state may impose variety of regulations on navigation in the territorial sea thus to the extent that the contending nations establish sovereignty over part or all of the islands under dispute some limitations on overflight and navigation in the region may result uschina differences on freedom of navigation23 the united states has not ratified the convention but has actively sought to maintain broad scope for the freedom of navigation around the world position supported equally by most developed and maritime powers with global trading interests for purposes of navigation and overflight the united states asserts that the convention treats eezs as international waters in which all states rights to freedom of navigation and overflight are assured subject only to the rights that sovereign states have economically to exploit the resources in their own eezs for freedom of navigation then eezs are equivalent to the high seas through which vessels of all states can navigate freely without paying much attention to the incidental economic interests of the relevant sovereign state us specialists further argue that the convention allows overflight in aircraft of an eez the prc has ratified the convention but argues that the rights of states to control and exploit resources in their own eezs should predominate over international rights of freedom of navigation and overflight in the prc view then the convention subordinates freedom of navigation and overflight in the 200 mile eezs to the economic interests of the coastal sovereign state24 furthermore as demonstrated by the us navy ep3 incident the prc now appears to be arguing that these restrictions should extend as well to the airspace over an eez25

diplomacy26 spratlys and paracels the prcs physical occupation of islands reefs and shoals in the south china sea has brought chinas broad claims into competition with the claims of several members of the association of southeast asian nations asean27 this is especially so of vietnam the philippines and malaysia which also occupy islands shoals and reefs in the areas and who have territorial disputes both among themselves and with china brunei maintains claim but does not occupy territory there is also question of whether chinas territorial claim to the southern region of the south china sea overlaps with indonesias claim to natural gas fields near its natuna islands indonesia currently is developing these gas fields through contracts with american oil companies prior to 1995 prc actions affected only vietnam which claimed both the spratly and the paracel islands prc forces had occupied the paracel islands in 1974 near the end of the vietnam war driving out south vietnamese forces although communist vietnam has continued to maintain these maritime claims after 1975 chinas occupation of several positions in the area of the spratly islands resulted in military clashes and confrontations between the chinese and vietnamese navies including the years 1988 1992 and 1994 although vietnam was not member of asean at the time asean did take diplomatic initiatives to resolve sino vietnamese disputes in 1990 for instance indonesia began holding annual south china sea workshops attended by government officials and private experts these workshops discussed areas of potential cooperation among states in developing the natural resources of the south china sea as well as possible confidence building measures cbms among claimant countries the workshops were defined as unofficial and produced formal agreements28 in 1992 asean took formal action in response to new tensions between china and vietnam and in response to chinas issuance in february 1992 of its law on territorial waters and their contiguous areas which specified chinas claim to most of the south china sea basin asean foreign ministers issued an asean declaration on the south china sea which called on claimant governments to exercise restraint and resolve disputes without resort to force the declaration also called on governments to put aside the issue of sovereignty and cooperate on issues like navigation maritime pollution search and rescue and combating piracy with an eye toward china the declaration invited all parties concerned to subscribe to this declaration of

with some success these positions are 1 china will negotiate bilaterally with other claimant countries 2 china will not negotiate multilaterally with other claimant countries 3 china opposes the participation of any outside country ie the united states in negotiations on the south china sea 4 china opposes internationalization of the dispute such as taking the dispute to an international forum for arbitration or legal rulings29 little further diplomacy occurred until early 1995 when the prc seized mischief reef in the spratly islands this marked the first time that the prc had seized territory claimed by an asean country the philippines consequently asean intensified its diplomatic efforts to address south china sea territorial claims these efforts had three elements 1 bilateral negotiations with china mainly by the philippines 2 pressure on china to discuss the south china sea multilaterally with asean and 3 focus on negotiating code of conduct with china to regulate and place limits on the actions of the claimant countries philippineprc diplomacy and confr ontation unilaterally the philippines responded to chinas seizure of mischief reef with more activist diplomatic and even military efforts to pressure china to end its occupation of the reef and to deter china from occupying other philippineclaimed territories in the spratlys as result of its diplomatic efforts the philippines succeeded in negotiating code of conduct agreement with china on august 910 1995 which contained joint pledge to refrain from using force or threat of force in the south china sea to initiate joint cooperation in fields like maritime environment marine research safety of navigation etc and to settle disputes in accord with international law including the convention on the law of the sea the philippine government also was able to persuade other asean members to adopt more assertive policies the actual impact of the philippineprc code of conduct agreement however has been limited there has been little joint cooperation in the specified areas although the prc has not seized more positions in the philippineclaimed part of the spratlys it has established regular presence of chinese fishing and naval vessels and has placed prc territorial markers on islands and reefs leading some to believe it intends to occupy more territory china also has asserted claim to scarborough shoal located about 125 miles west of the philippine main island of luzon and it has tried to establish regular presence in that area despite the code of conducts pledges to avoid force in the south china sea there have been series of incidents and confrontations since 1996 between prc vessels and the philippine navy in the disputed area as the prc established more permanent presence of naval and fishing vessels the philippine government adopted policy of physically challenging this chinese presence in numerous clashes and confrontations in the spratlys and near scarborough shoal the

prc proposal to ban the arrest of fishermen in the disputed region for its part the prc rejected philippine proposal for mediation and philippine proposal that each side refrain from any new

reiterated their adherence to their original code of conduct agreement in statement of march 22 199931 meeting that month between the two governments broke up when the prc rejected philippine proposals for dismantling the mischief reef structures transferring control of mischief reef to the philippines and assuring that the prc government would build new structures the philippine side rejected prc proposals to ban arrests of chinese fishermen avoid sending filipino vessels and aircraft into chinese territory and ending the philippine governments antichina statements32 asean diplomacy when the prc first seized mischief reef in 1995 asean supported the philippines in diplomatic effort reminiscent of its 1980s diplomacy toward vietnams occupation of cambodia two factors stood out first aseans six members at the time vietnam was admitted as seventh member later in july 1995 presented united front at prcasean meeting in april 1995 where asean ministers warned china that its relations with asean countries would suffer because of mischief reef second indonesia took leadership role criticizing chinas territorial claim to the south china sea calling for an early settlement of the competing claims and pressing beijing for specific answer on whether its territorial claims included the natuna gas fields aseans stand appeared to produce two chinese concessions china agreed to negotiate with asean thus modifying its earlier position of holding bilateral negotiations only china also agreed to resolve the dispute in accord with the convention subsequently stated in the philippineprc code of conduct but china held firm that third parties ie the united states should not be involved the prcs formal ratification of the convention in may 1996 seemed to be

admission of laos cambodia and burma after 1995 added countries that had little interest in the south china sea instead the priority of these new asean members was to improve relations with china whose economic and political influence throughout southeast asia was growing the onset of the asian financial crisis in 1997 further distracted asean governments from security issues and from giving priority to asean itself the collapse of indonesias suharto government in 1998 removed the crucial element of indonesian leadership in aseans policy toward the south china sea interasean tensions over competing claims also increased when malaysia placed structures on two reefs in its claimed area in 1999 which the philippines and vietnam protested asean and the proposed code of conduct in january 1999 philippine president joseph estradas national security council formulated new strategy toward the spratly islands the council decided to ask regional and international bodies to consider chinas actions and to urge asean to negotiate regional code of conduct with china reminiscent of the philippineprc codeofconduct agreement of 1995 consequently the philippines proposed regional code of conduct at an aseanprc consultative meeting in april 1999 throughout the year asean members negotiated over the proposal the philippines vietnam and malaysia disagreed over the proposals content malaysia reportedly was cool to the proposal while vietnam wanted it to cover the paracels as well as the spratlys senior asean officials finally agreed in november 1999 to draft code of conduct that would include the paracels they presented it informally to prc officials attending an asean plus three prc south korea and japan meeting the prc rejected it objecting to inclusion of the paracels and to clause providing for halt to any new occupation of reefs shoals and islets in the disputed area prc officials did propose further discussion of code of conduct but with two qualifications that the discussions be bilateral with individual relevant asean members and that the process proceed gradually in an orderly fashion35 prc officials produced their own draft code of conduct in march 2000 clauses related to peaceful settlement of disputes and freedom of navigation were similar to the asean draft but the prc draft differed on three other issues it included prohibition of the arrest or use of force against chinese fishermen it stated that signatories would refrain from dangerous and closein reconnaissance and military patrols thus limiting asean country surveillance of prc activities this positionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs14 36 jiji press tokyo report march 14 2000 jiji quoted from chinese draft it said it had obtained an associated press report of march 15 2000

similar to the prcs position in the ep3 collision incident to whit that the united states should cease military activities including reconnaissance in the areas off the south china coast and within the prcs 200mile exclusive economic zone finally the prc draft did not include the asean drafts ban on new occupation of reefs shoals and islets instead calling on parties only to exercise selfrestraint36 the production of both the asean and prc drafts created mechanism to negotiate specific differences over code of conduct however there appears to have been little progress in negotiations since the issuance of the prc draft in may 2001 dino patti djalal political counselor of the indonesian embassy in washington praised the idea of south china sea code of conduct and said that negotiations were continuing but he did not indicate that talks were achieving progress37 according to informed sources interviewed by crs for this report the prc is taking hard line against including the paracels in any regional code of conduct china appears to be following this line partly in knowledge that malaysia also favors excluding the paracels malaysias split with vietnam and the philippines on this issue divides asean to chinas diplomatic advantage according to these sources china hints at flexibility toward the asean proposal to prohibit new seizures and structures in the spratlys this could signal change in the prcs position but it also could be tactic to appeal to malaysia since the prc undoubtedly knows that the deadlock over the paracels gives china diplomatic flexibility to maneuver and exploit asean divisions without having to make firm commitments and promises on other issues us policy toward chinas south china sea claims until the prcs seizure of mischief reef us policy toward the south china sea dispute had minimal content the stance of us administrations since the 1970s had been that the united states takes position on the merits of the competing claims supports peaceful resolution of the conflict and opposes the threat or use of force in the region by any of the claimants there was little active diplomacy the prcs seizure of mischief reef changed all this on may 10 1995 the clinton administration issued statement on the south china sea that led to an exchange with china relevant to the us navy ep3 reconnaissance plane episode in its may 10 statement the clinton administration reiterated that the united states takes position on the legal merits of competing claims and opposes the use of force the statement also expressed concern over the pattern of unilateral actions and reactions and that the united states has an abiding interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in the south china sea the statement focused on the issue of freedom of navigation warning against any attempt to hinder it it declared the united states would however view with serious concern any maritime claim or restriction on

freedom of navigation were threatened china reacted to the us may 10 statement with foreign ministry statement on freedom of navigation declaring that the prc claim to group of islands in the south china sea is not meant to impede freedom of navigation or the safe passage of aircraft and other ships of other countries39 after these statements us diplomacy settled back into low level of activity although press reports of highlevel usprc meetings after 1995 describe continuous discussions of the issues of taiwan human rights proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and trade and investment they contain little or mention of the south china sea as topic in these encounters this suggested either that the clinton administration did not raise the south china sea issue at such meetings or if it did it did so infrequently and did not seek substantive dialogue with the chinese early high level usprc talks under the george w bush administration show similar pattern the low profile us approach also appears to be true of us diplomacy relative to the aseanchin negotiations including the talks over regional code of conduct for the most part the united states has not raised the south china sea issue at aseansponsored conferences with dialogue partners such as the asean regional forum arf an exception to this approach apparently occurred in 1999 possibly in response to the situation created by chinas emplacement of permanent structures on mischief reef state department spokesman james rubin warned china on january 6 1999 to avoid actions that create tensions in the

opposed more direct us diplomatic role44 and the us proposal apparently received minimal support from other asean governments the lack of positive response to the 1999 us initiative reflected the existing divisions within asean on the south china sea discussed earlier malaysias apparent rejection also may be due to the antagonisms in usmalaysia relations that existed for several years under malaysian prime minister mahathir mohammed the asean reaction also probably reflected the prcs diplomatic successes particularly the influence of its constantly stated position that outside parties should not be involved in the south china sea issue within asean only the philippines us ally has challenged publicly the chinese position number of american observers at that time also concluded that aseans stance stemmed from uncertainty over the extent of us support45 the most active component of us policy related to the south china sea has been the us effort to revitalize its security relations with the philippines46 until 1992 the philippines and the united states had an intimate security relationship based on 1947 military bases agreement and 1952 mutual defense treaty the security relationship was frayed in 1991 when the philippine senate voted to reject ratification of new usphilippine agreement to extend us rights to military bases beyond 1992 the expiration date of the 1947

describing it as very positive step that they are taking to promote this code of conduct47 philippine defense planners envisaged program of us assistance that would give the afp the capability to

their competing claims in the east china sea reflect the interrelationship of the dual nature of their claims the claims of sovereignty over the senkaku diaoyu islands including actual control of the islands and the overlapping claims to exclusive economic zones eezs may be legally distinct but they are intertwined for two reasons one is that control of the senkakus by japan reinforces its

the august 1995 incident and particularly heavy prc ship activities in early 1996 led to an escalation of tensions between japan and the prc lasting until the end of 1996 when prc activities reach high levels the japanese become suspicious that the prc is preparing to occupy the senkakus the prcs occupation of mischief reef in the south china sea in early 1995 increased japanese suspicions while japan has not established permanent physical presence on the senkakus it responded to the 19921993 shooting incidents frequently by deploying patrol boats of the maritime safety agency near the islands it also stepped up air reconnaissance the japanese government also responds with verbal assertions of its sovereignty over the senkakus and the legality of its claimed eez this sometimes is contained in diplomatic notes to beijing the prc responds with similar assertions the heating of the rhetoric over sovereignty has had the effect of weakening an understanding the prc and japan reached in 1978 to shelve the dispute over sovereignty59 the japanese government also has had to deal with the actions of japanese right wing groups these groups periodically send members to the

became clear in july 2001 when prc research vessels operated near the senkakus without prior notification of japan63 prc actions at that time suggest that beijing holds that the notification requirement does not apply to its claimed eez but only to its maritime research in japans eez outside the geographical limits of chinas claim the japanese foreign ministry did not formally protest the chinese activities in july 2001 claiming that it did not have sufficient legal grounds64 us policy toward the senkakus maritime disputes in the east china sea are primarily between the prc and japan and arise from three different factors 1 us administration of the senkakus as part of the ryukyu islands from the end of world war ii until 1971 2 the 1971 us agreement with japan to revert administration of the ryukyu islands to japan and 3 the debated question of the application of the usjapan security treaty to the senkakus these elements make the united states more directly involved

discussions john foster dulles chief us delegate to the peace conference and later secretary of state during the eisenhower administration set forth the concept that japan had residual sovereignty over the ryukyu islands according to an official analysis prepared by the us army residual sovereignty meant that the united states will not transfer its sovereign powers over the ryukyu islands to any nation other than japan67 kenneth younger the british delegate to the conference stated that the peace treaty did not remove the ryukyus from japanese sovereignty68 president eisenhower confirmed this at the usjapan summit meeting of june 1957 telling japanese prime minister nobusuke kishi that residual sovereignty over the ryukyus meant that the united states would exercise its rights for period and that the sovereignty would then return to japan69 in march 1962 president kennedy stated in an executive order for the ryukyus that i recognize the ryukyus to be part of the japanese homeland and look forward to the day when the security interests of the free world will permit their restoration to full japanese sovereignty70 since there was us action to separate the senkakus from

reversion treaty contained the terms and conditions for the reversion of the ryukyu islands including the senkakus73 however in presenting the okinawa reversion treaty to the us senate for ratification the nixon administration removed the senkakus from its inclusion in the concept of japanese residual sovereignty the nixon administration asserted that the united states took position on the issue of competing japanese and chinese claims to sovereignty acting assistant legal adviser robert starr stated that the united states had returned only administrative rights to japan and that return of administrative rights over those islands to japan from which the rights were received can in way prejudice any underlying claims secretary of state rogers testified that this treaty does not affect the legal status of those islands at all74 several experts have attributed this nixon administration policy shift as having been influenced by white house overtures to china during 19711972

noted that the united states takes position on who owns the islands and has said american forces would not be compelled by the treaty to intervene in dispute over them the new york times later quoted mondale that the status of the senkakus was similar to that of taiwan with which the united states has defense treaty77 in contrast to ambassador mondale the state department did not give specific

should ever doubt that america will honor its security agreement to japan and we will81 the differences between the state and defense departments over this issue appears to represent broader disagreement over us policy priorities in east asia at that time the state departments position likely was influenced by the clinton administrations policy of engagement with china which stressed improving relations with china after the period of tensions in the taiwan straits in early 1996 the sinojapanese tensions of 1996 arose as the united states was negotiating with prc officials over holding series of high level meetings secretary of state christophers visit to china in november 1996 chinese defense minister chi haotians visit to washington in december 1996 vice president gores visit to china in january 1997 and an exchange of presidential visits between presidents clinton and jiang zemin in 1997 and 1998 state department officials may have judged that an affirmation of the security treatys coverage of the senkakus could anger china and disrupt these plans the defense departments priorities on the other hand were tilted toward strengthening usjapan security relations the

568 billion annually mainly attributed to europe japan and other countries of northeast asia south korea taiwan and hong kong and the southeast asian economies as the ndu report noted traffic moving west to east is dominated by bulk cargoes such as oil iron ore and coal destined for the manufacturing economies of northeast asia while manufactured goods tend to move southward and westward towards markets in southeast asia the united states has relatively small stake in these shipments which predominantly serve japan and other industrialized economies of northeast asia since these data were compiled the prc also has emerged as major destination for persian gulf oil and point of origin for manufactured goods shipments from this perspective the primary us interest may be in what the authors of the ndu study term maritime stability which is essential to freedom of navigation and the smooth functioning of the global trading system84 equally important however are the increments of regional economic growth that would be gained or lost dependi ng on whether the disputes are resolved peacefully or at least contained or become sources of instability and conflict the possibility of military conflict over maritime territorial disputes has been of particular concern to number of members of asean especially those who have disputes with china asean countries which have prospered in recent years through exportle d growth are worried both about the potential loss of valuable resources rights and the disruption of trade and commerce that could result from prc military move to seize territory in the spratlys or the oil fields in the paracels85 china for its part has denied any intention of disrupting sea lines of communication sloc in the south china sea in the midst of its assertive moves to seize mischief reef the prc foreign ministry asserted in april 1995 while safeguarding its sovereignty over the nansha spratly islands and its maritime rights and interests china will fulfill its duty of guaranteeing freedom of navigation for foreign ships and air routes through and over the international passage of the south china sea according to international law86 resources affected by territorial disputes the total value of natural resources that are affected in one way or another by the maritime territorial disputes cannot be established with any precision since the existence and value of many of the resources such as offshore oil and seabed minerals are largely speculative fisheries are probably the most clearly measurable resource and appear to be uppermost in the case of the senkakusdiaoyutais dispute betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs27 87 ting david k the world paper online december 1996 88 federation of american scientists fas military analysis network wwwfasorgmandod101opswarspratlyhtmljapan and china and taiwan the very word diaoyutai is said to mean fishing platform or terrace in the chinese mandarin dialect87 deep sea resources especially in the area around the spratlys and the paracels in the south china sea are by all accounts extensive but meaningful value can currently be assigned to these resources whatever the value of the resources their exploitation currently is limited by the territorial disputes since these highly capital intensive activities generally require the participation of multinatio nal companies which are very sensitive to issues of conflicting legal claims already however the south china sea area is the source of about 1367000 barrels per day in oil output involving eight nations with about half being accounted for by malaysia and onefifth by china this output is slightly more than us production in the gulf of mexico about onefourth of the north sea output and just small fraction of the 19226000 barrels produced in the persian gulf chinese claims or claims that are implied in chinese produced maps reportedly include oil and gas producing areas of indonesia natuna island group the philippines malaysia and vietnam by one account the most optimistic western estimates are that the area around the spratly islands themselves may hold 12 billion barrels which might yield maximum output of 180000370000 per day equivalent to the current production of brunei or vietnam88 the economics of using armed force to resolve disputes although nations often cast economic concerns aside when responding to armed attacks or armed challenges to their territorial interests the consequences of initiating military action to resolve territorial disputes tend to have deterrent effect number of the east asian territorial disputes in fact are the residue of major military conflicts or the outcome of colonialstyle expansion that took advantag of periods of weakness or collapse involving one or more of the claimants disputes such as those between china and japan and between japan and either of the koreas could provide minor military confrontations but are not expected to lead either to full scale war or to the change of possession of the disputed territories the major exception is the prctaiwan issue which is dispute of very different nature clearly if the prc were to succeed in gaining control of taiwan either by negotiation or force the geopolitical map of east asia would change dramatically the economic consequences would depend on how the scenario originated and played out but they certainly would be major one clearly identifiable consequence would be beijings acquisition of taiwans 200 nautical mile eezhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs28 89 chan john

vulnerabilities china became net oil importing nation in 1993 and currently imports about 20 percent of its oil mainly from the persian gulf these imports are expected to surge to 40 percent of total domestic consumption by 2010 and they appear to be significant motive for beijings efforts to develop its own oil and gas reserves in xinjiang and to construct oil pipelines from xinjiang and from central asian oil supplies because of the rapid almost exponential growth of chinas oil and gas consumption these overland projects are not likely to end chinas dependance on sea borne shipments also because of the vast sums and special technologies required for these massive planned pipeline projects china has entered into partnerships with multinational oil companies notably bpamoco and exxonmobil the prcs two largest stateowned oil companies have also listed shares of subsidiar ies on wall street in order to raise funds for pipeline construction89 in theory then the us government could counter any chinese efforts to disrupt sealanes in the south china sea by military diplomatic and financial means predominance of interregional maritime trade the largest share of seaborne traffic in areas subject to maritime territorial disputes is accounted for by asian countries particularly japan the japanese economy despite decadelong slump remains the largest economy in the region and the core economy for northeast and southeast asia in southeast asia especially japan is usually the first or second after the united states source of foreign direct investment fdi and shipping traffic is dominated by the movement of raw materials from southeast asia to japan and manufactured goods from japan to southeast asia large share of interregional trade in southeast asia involves shipments of parts and components by japanese companies for local assembly operations overall export manufacturing in southeast asia tends to be linked backwards to japanese technology parts and components and forward to the us and other third markets90 economic implications for the united states given the range and nature of the us economic stake in the disputed territories in the maritime

disputed spratly islands have the most relevance to us interests because of their importance to sealines of communication and the implications for control of the seabed resources if chinas concept of its legal right were to be accepted the spratlys would appear to be of greater importance from an economic than from military standpoint as they are militarily indefensible third economic stakes are less important to the united states than to its southeast and northeast asian allies and friends even if the maritime disputes were resolved in chinas favor beijing would have logical motive or incentive to seek to interfere with international shipping save for the possible case of crossstraits conflict or an effort to strangle taiwan economically even in this case the main determinant would be the power of the prc navy not the status of prc claims to the spratlys finally the most important threat to us economic interests is instability or conflict arising out of the maritime territorial disputes or obstacles to resources extraction caused by disputed claims in this respect us interests and those of all of the claimants would best be served by some form of agreement to facilitate resources sharing even without resolution of the claims themselves considering the issue from the widest perspective us economic interests in the south china sea region may be more threatened by the sheer weight of chinas economy and its tendency at the moment to draw trade and investment away from the asean countries chinas economic competitiveness which may be artificially enhanced by various distortions of the market caused by the still large state role in the economy and an undervalued currency has enabled the prc to attract the lions share of inward foreign direct investment into the region ideally chinas entry into the wto will create more expandings um relationship with the chinese economy serving as an engine of growth for neighboring economies even though direct us interests in the maritime territorial disputes in east asia may be comparatively small the nature of economic globalization guarantees that disturbances in east asia arising out of interruptions of shipping would reverberate in the american economy for this reason as well as in the interest of broader geopolitical concerns the current deployment of us military power throughout the region would appear important to supporting stability and if necessar enforcing rights of free passage in international sealanes security and strategic issues91 for some observers the april 2001 ep3 incident92

today so that it would have difficulty militarily enforcing its many maritime claims in 1996 the center for naval analysis assessed the prospects of the pla navy plan becoming blue water navy compared to green water or regional navy96 the study found that the prc cannot indigenously develop and build even regional navy by 2010 it could choose to reverseengineer regional navy but such process would take more than 15 years perhaps by 2020 if china enjoys an optimistic economic growth rate of 8 percent per year for 15 years and it purchases naval assets from abroad it could buy green water navy but not blue water one thus american and regional observers are watchful of longerterm plan strategy of first developing green water capabilities out to the first island chain early in the 21st century which some believe could have implications for the prcs ability to pursue maritime claims in the region then achieving blue water status further out to the second island chain perhaps by the

10 percent of its military forces recognizing the limits of its own weapons development to replace obsolete systems beijing has turned to moscow for advanced arms since 1990 particularly air and naval

destroyers equipped with sunburn antiship cruise missiles from russia 1 luhaiclass destroyer 2 luhuclass destroyers and 10 jiangweiclass frigates100 the plan has limited air support at sea and aircraft carriers the modernization of the plan air force has lagged behind that of the pla air force plaaf the plaaf has turned to moscow since 1990 to acquire advanced russian aircraft like the su27 fighter among its more modern equipment the prcs naval aviation uses upgraded versions of old f7 and f8 fighters and b6 bombers the plan air force also has limited inventory perhaps 20 of newer

initially advocated by the plans first commander xiao jinguang 1949 1979 and approved by mao zedong in 1975 as way to project the plas perimeter of maritime defense farther away from coastal waters

has expanded its activities further out into the maritime areas off chinas coastline123 still it is not clear with the available indicators that the plan per has particularly significant influence on prc decisionmaking liu huaqing rose through the ranks in the plan and promoted its role in chinas military strategy but he also wore an army uniform while in the cmc symbolizing the armys traditional

highestranking pla officers were taken by generals zhang wannian and chi haotian who were not from the plan and neither inherited lius place on the politburo standing committee thus liu huaqing did not represent particular plan seat on the cmc or politburo standing committee and any supposed plan or broader pla influence at the apex of decisionmaking likely was owed to liu personally moreover during the april 2001 aircraft collision incident involving the ep3 plane president and cmc chairman jiang zemin vice premier qian qichen and the foreign ministry took the lead in taking hardline stance with the united states while top pla officers followed in stance and appearance with greater inflammatory rhetoric that incident suggested that while military leaders tend to take conservative

the plans assertiveness around the region has been remarkable because it has occurred even with the increased tensions over taiwan since 1995 this boldness may reflect little concern in beijing over contentions with multiple neighbors on more than one front beijing appears to believe that it can afford to contend with taipei and washington in the taiwan strait even as it confronts other neighbors elsewhere on the periphery there are several possible explanations for the plans increased challenges in the region beijing may perceive its strategy to be necessary defense to counter usled chain of neighbors undermining chinas interests as early as august 1954 prc premier zhou enlai chou enlai criticized the united states for building chain of alliances around china130 beijings sense of insecurity has increased since the end of the cold war with one superpower commanding what beijing sees as unilateral powers more recently one expert at the china institute of contemporary international relations cicir wrote that the united states is preparing to construct strategy chain to contain china through ties with and presence in japan south korea india taiwan and guam131 other articles also discuss the inclusion of guam singapore india and indonesia in this antichina chain132 the prc may seek to prevent perceived attempts to encircle china safeguard maritime

1999 center for naval analyses december 2000 the secretary of defense also mentioned this debate in china in the 2000 report to congress military power of the peoples republic of chinaas its economy develops protect historical territorial claims and resources as other countries have and defend against invasions from the sea moreover beijing may calculate that its strategy to successfully claim more maritime territory involves little risk or strong reaction because of the attraction of its economic growth the weakness of some neighbors the lack of strong us position on territorial claims and worldwide attention to the larger issues of the koreas and taiwan the plan efforts have entailed modest acquisitions of advanced equipment and the pla for the most part has not disrupted civilian navigation of international waters and airspace but even if beijings strategy is undertaken in defense there are evident elements of preemption strategic initiative and offensive operations perhaps necessary for military relying on asymmetric tactics and inferior equipment according to the plas media destroyers in the east sea fleet practiced launching missiles before the enemy noting that the time needed for responding to missile attack is crucial to gaining the initiative by striking the enemy first133 the surprise aspects may well involve the use of difficulttodetect submarines prc newspaper wrote that two plan submarines had trained in the south china sea to destroy an invading enemy carrier battle group and to take the initiative in launching attacks134 further the prc strategy in part relies on developing sufficient military force in order to achieve political objectives in crossstrait policies or diplomacy with other neighbors the prcs threats to use force may not be limited to intimidation of taipei for example at the prcjapan summit in tokyo on november 26 1998 prime minister keizo obuchi refused to give jiang zemin written apology for japanese atrocities during world war ii and declined to repeat president clintons opposition to taiwans membership in the united nations135 after this tense meeting plan ships operating close to japan became an issue in their bilateral relations pla confrontations directed against countries such as japan the philippines and australia also are directed at undermining usled alliances raising the costs to us regional allies or bringing into question us commitments in the region in addition while taiwan scenario has provided an important catalyst for pla modernization since 1995 natos mistaken bombing of the prc embassy in yugoslavi in 1999 has apparently spurred the pla to accelerate modernization efforts136 plan ships have carried out reconnaissance operations closer to japan since 1999 missions believed by some in japan as partly related to plan submarinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs39 137 prepared by kerry dumbaugh foreign affairs defense and trade division november 2001operations plan fighters and ships have confronted foreign militaries with increased boldness and frequency factor contributing to the f8s collision with the us navy ep3 plane as pla training takes on greater urgency and tougher tasks especially beyond chinas coast further confrontations with regional or us forces may occur thus there are continuing debates about whether the prcs strategy is essentially defensive or offensive aimed at the status quo or at expanding prc power and limited or not to the taiwan question at the same time the generally conservative and insecure leadership in beijing has looked offshore to extend its maritime perimeter in efforts to project the plas presence it has heightened multi front assertiveness despite limited capabilities incorporated preemptive moves as advantageous aspects of strategy and doctrine and used the military to pursue political objectives these trends have prompted increasing concerns in asia and the united states options and implications for the united states137 as territorial disputes have continued number of options have been suggested for addressing the maritime claims and freedom of navigation issues in the region among these are the following assurances from all claimants that there will be further seizure of territory confidencebuilding measures including regular military exchanges and greater transparency on military spending regular multilateral discussions involving tradeof fs and compromise for competing claims clearer understanding of what is meant by joint resource development and exploration of establishing relevant regulatory regime further clarification of and agreement on what kinds of international activity is expressly permitted in eezs oversight authority of shared eezs by an agreedupon international body nothing on the policy horizon suggests that either the united states or the prc is likely to change traditional objectives with respect to asian maritime areas the united states will continue to focus on assuring freedom of navigation along with the economic and physical wellbeing of its regional allies while the prc will concentrate more on protecting its offshore economic interests and enhancing naval security along its southern and eastern flanks given the stronger us policy emphasis on asia increasing global transport of goods through regional waters and longterm projected growth of prc economic and military power us and prc interests in the region are likely to continue to bump up against one another add to this the intersection ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs40 so many other political interests including the volatility of the taiwan issue the growing prc concern over more active regional military role by japan and the network of us defense commitments with some claimant countries and it becomes apparent how farreaching the consequences of serious diplomatic and military confrontations could be nevertheless some analysts have argued that it is this very tangle of diplomatic economic and political interests that suggests series of regional grand bargains may be possible as the current research shows there are significant economic political and logistical constraints on the ability of any regional military even the pla to effectively enforce all its maritime claims morever national economic imperatives and the desire to protect global trade relationships give claimant countries an incentive to reach accommodations that will minimize costs and maximize benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs41 138 prepared by dave ackerman american law division september 2001 139 22 ajil 867 1928 140 26 ajil 290 1932appendix territorial claims cases in international law138 the fundamental issue of contention with respect to the spratly and other islands in contention concerns which state is or states are sovereign international courts have rendered several decisions in the past with respect to the ownership of islands that give some guidance as to the legal criteria that may apply to the competing claims of china vietnam malaysia the philippines taiwan indonesia japan and brunei as follows in the island of palmas case or miangas139 in 1928 both the united states and the netherlands claimed sovereignty over an island between the archipelago of the philippines and what was then the dutch east indies archipelago the us contended that the island had first been discovered by spain in the 16th century that spains title had been ceded to the united states in the treaty of paris at the end of the spanishamerican war in 1898 and that in any event the islands proximity to the philippines sufficed to establish us sovereignty but the permanent court of arbitration held that discovery alone is insufficient to confer title actual possession and the effective exercise of sovereign authority it said are more important determinants it further held that international law lends support to claim based on contiguity or proximity because the netherlands established that it had effectively peacefully and openly exercised political authority by means of agreements with native princes on the island for 200 years before and after the treaty of paris the court held that it had by prescription acquired valid title of sovereignty in the case of arbitral award on the subject of the difference relative to the sovereignty over clipperton island140 in 1932 france and mexico vied for sovereignty over an atoll 600 miles south of mexico in the pacific ocean french sailors had landed on the atoll in 1858 and claimed it for france and france subsequently publicized that declaration but it had made further effort at occupation mexico for its part contended that the atoll had been claimed by spain in the 18th century and devolved to mexico as the successor state in 1836 and that its sovereignty was further evidenced by its removal of several americans who were found mining the guano beds on the atoll in 1897 the arbitrator king victor emmanuel iii of italy noted that ordinarily an initial claim of sovereignty must be complemented by an effective occupation for territorial acquisition to be valid but that there may be cases where it is unnecessary to have recourse to this method it may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31183crs42 141 icj judgment of november 17 1953 142 icj judgment of september 11 1992sufficient he concluded that an uninhabited territory remains at the absolute and undisputed disposition of the state making the claim finding evidence to support the claim of spanish discovery and occupation and determining that france had not only claimed the island but had widely publicized that claim and protested occupancy by others he held clipperton island to have been legitimately acquired by france in the minquiers and ecrehos case141 in 1953 england and france asked the international court of justice to determine which country was sovereign over two islands lying between the british channel island of jersey and the french coast the court found historical documents to lend somewhat more support to englands claim than that of france but said that any definitive conclusion as to sovereignty must ultimately depend on the evidence which relates directly to possession the court concluded that the evidence demonstrated longstanding exercise of administrative authority over both islands by the english authorities on jersey and as consequence held england to have sovereignty over them in the case concerning land island and maritime frontier dispute among salvador honduras and nicaragua142 in 1992 chamber of the international court of justice had to determine which country owned three islands in the gulf of fonseca which is located where the boundaries of the three countries meet spain had governed the area until 1821 and the federal republic of central america had done so until 1839 but the federal republic had then disintegra ted and given rise to the present states the court ruled that because the islands were not undiscovered territory in 1821 sovereignty could not be established by discovery and occupation the initial question it said was whether any of the contending states had succeeded to spains title but finding evidence on that to be confused and conflicting the court relied instead on evidence concerning which country subsequently exercised political authority over the islands and whether the other countries acquiesced in that exercise finding honduras to have exercised authority over one island since 1849 and salvador to have done so over two islands since the latter part of the 19th century and discovering evidence of contemporaneous protests by the other states the court held that one island belonged to honduras and two belonged to salvador these decisions obvious ly are not determinative of the contending states various claims to sovereignty over part or all of the islands in the south and east china seas but they do clarify the elements that necessarily are involved in such claims discovery possession exercise of authority and acquiescence they also suggest that of these elements discovery alone is weak basis for claim of sovereignty
