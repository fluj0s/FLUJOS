of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrant s shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation an d particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to b seized the supreme court has i nterpreted this language as imposing presumptive warrant requirement on all searches and seizures predicated upon governmenta l authority and has ruled that any violations of this standard will result in th suppression of any material or information derived therefrom however the court has also recognized that certain circumstances render the obtainment of warrant impractical or unnecessary and accordingly has crafte d exceptions to an otherwise inflexible constitutional standard among the variou s exceptions established by the court are warrantless searches based on exigen t circumstances plain view seizures searches incident to valid arrest and searche s where law enforcement needs surpass the warrant requirement some of the mos t pervasive and controversial exceptions reco gnized by the court have centered on law enforcement authority to conduct warrantless searches and investigatory detentions in the vehicular context recent court decisions in this area have imbued w enforcement officers with greater authority to act without warrant during traffi c stops based upon the previously established automobile exception and the need for adequate protective measures to ensure police safety this apparent expansion f police power has led many commentators to assert that fourth amendmen t protections have been essentially eviscerated in the automobil and traffic stop setting upon examining the scope of law enforcement authority subsequent to thes decisions however it appears that basic fourth amendment privacy strictures stil l pertain to traffic detention s with the recent court rulings simply applying previously established rationales to new factual scenarioshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30316contents introduction 1 the fourth amendment 1 the automobile exception 2 investigatory detentions 3 pretextual stops 4

introduction in its past few terms the supreme court of the united states has exhibited renewed interest in fourth amendment iss ues surrounding law enforcement practices in the traffic detention search and seizure contexts in the majority of these cases the court has determined that the state action at issue is either presumptively valid or that the public interest in the deterrence and detection of criminal activit outweighs any potential intrusion upon asserted personal liberty and privacy interests this paper addresses the dynamics and scope of law enforcement authority in th traffic detention context in l ight of these recent decisions with an analytical focus on the extent to which they impact fundamental fourth amendment principles the fourth amendment the fourth amendment to the constitut ion of the united states establishes that search or sei zure conducted by governmental agent must be reasonable and that probable cause support any judicially granted warrant originally the supreme court1 interprete d this provision as imposing presumptive warrant requirement declaring that searches conducted outside the ju dicial process without prior approval by judge or magistrate are per unreasonable under the fourth amendment subject only to few specifically established and well delineated exceptions the court s2 eschewed this approach at times determining that warrant is not required t establish the reasonableness of all government searches and when warrant is t requiredprobable cause is not invariably required either in the criminal setting3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30316crs2 continued3 see illinois v rodriguez 497 us 177 1990 johnson v united states 333 us 10 1314 19484 camara v municipal court 387 us 523 539540 19675 for

in an automobile see california v carney 471 us 386 392 1985 united states v ros s 456 us 798 825 1982 in ross the court declared that search11 under the automobile exception may extend as far as magistrate could legitimatel continuedhowever this warrant requirement traditionally has been viewed as protectiv mechanism placing the authority to determine probable cause in the hands of neutral magistrate as opposed to law enf orcement authorities who are engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting ut crime in instances where the interests of the4 public outweigh those of private individuals however the court has recognize d specifically blished exceptions to the warrant and probable cause requirements of the fourth amendment indeed such exceptions have been recognized fo r5 searches incident to valid arres t plain view seizures vehicle searches investigatory detentions and exigent circumstances among others 6 the automobile exception in carroll v united states the supre court determined that automobiles are inherently mobile creating exigent circumstances which render the obtainment of warrant impractical specifically the co urt found it significant that unlike building7 or house vehicle and any contraband therein could be readily removed from jurisdiction pending the issuance of warrant as such the court held that w8 enforcement authorities need not obtain warrant to searc h an automobile when there is probable cause indicating illegal activity the supreme court has further buttressed9 the automobile exception by declaring that there is reduced expectation in th privacy of automobiles given that they are rarely used as repository for persona l effects their occupants and contents are generally in plain view and are subject t extensive state regulation10 regarding the proper scope of searches conducted pursuant to the automobile exception the supreme court has held that when police have probable cause t believe that vehic contains contraband they may conduct thorough warrantless search including any containers which may conceal the object of the search11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30316crs3 continued11 authorize by warrant id 119

passenger confederates could simply claim all belongings in the car as their own 392 us 1 2224 196818the supreme court recently clarified the extent to which police officers ma search belongings in vehicle in wyoming v houghton there the court held that12 police officers with probable cause to search car may inspect passengers personal belongings inside the vehicle in instances where those items are capable of concealing the object of the search irrespective of whether the passenger is under suspicion in13 reaching this co nclusion the court pointed to several factors first the court noted that there was strong body of law empowering government agents with probabl cause to conduct warrantless searches of vessels for contraband including th automobile exception as delineated in carroll and clarified in ross also the court14 found that none of these cases indicated that the scope of such searches rested upon distinction among packages or containers based on ownership15 balancing the relative governmental interests against individual privacy in thi s scenario the court determined that passengers have reduced expectation of privacy in property transported i n automobiles and that search of such property is minimally intrusive co nversely the court found that the governmental interests at stake were substan tial specifically the court held that law enforcement efforts would b impaired if authoritie s were unable to search passengers belongings when there is reason to believe contraband or evidence of criminal wrongd oing is hidden in the car given that the mobility of an automobi creates risk that evidence will be lost while warrant is obtained also the court found it significant that car passengers will16 often be engaged in common enterprise with the driver and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing in view of thes e17 factors the court ruled that such searches were permissible investigatory detentions in terry v ohio the supreme court held that police officer may stop an d question an individual who is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity as well as perform limited frisk to ascertain whether the individual in question i s armed specifically the court addresse d factual scenario where an officer lacking18 both warrant and probable cause detained three individuals after observing the m loitering near store in suspicious manner the officer stopped the individuals i n order to ascertain their identities and fearing that they might be armed patted down the outside of their clothing this frisk resulted in the discovery of two revolvers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30316crs4 id at 20 specifically the court explained that stop and frisk encounter involves n19 entire rubric of police conductnecessarily swift action predicated upon the onthespo t observations of the officer on the beatwhich historically has not been and as practica l matter could not be subjected to the warrant proce dure instead the conduct in this case must be tested by the fourth amen dments general proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures id at 20 id at 2120 id at 21 accordingly inarticulable hunches or generalized suspicions cannot serve as the21 basis for an investigative detention id at 22 berkemer v mccarty 468 us 420 439 198422 see united states v sharpe 470 us 675 6 82 1985 delaware v prouse 440 us 64823 6611979 noting that the state action at issue was governed by the fourth amendment th court stated that the constitutional validity of stop and frisk hinged upon reasonableness inquiry as opposed to probable cause analysis as such the court19 determined it necessary t balance the need to search or seize against the invasion which the search or seizure entails accordingly the court identified two factors20 which it deemed essential to valid investigative detention first law enforcement officers ma initiate an investigative detention only when there is reasonable articulable suspicion criminal activity thus for stop to be valid law enforcement officer must be able to po int to specific and articulable facts which taken together with rational inferences from those facts reasonably warrant that intrusion second the scope of law enforcement activity resulting from n21 investigative detention must be reasonably related to th circumstances supporting the initial stop if these factors are present according to the court brief investigative detention may be justified in light of significant governmental interests even where probable cause is lacking this analysis has been applied in the vehicular conte xt as well specifically while the supreme court has ruled that even brief traffic detention constitutes seizure under the fourth amendment the court has also determin ed that traffic stops are less onerous than formal custodial detentions as such traffic stops are equivalent t o22 traditional terry stops requiring that law enforcement action be predicated upon reasonable rticulable suspicion of criminal conduct and that ensuing police activity be reasonably related in scope to the initial basis of the stop 23 pretextual stops whereas the stop and frisk rationale ineated in terry can be of great utility to police in the traffic detention context it must be remembered that an officer mus t have reasonable articulable suspicion of ill egal activity to justify an initial stop to surmount this potential impediment law enforcement authorities have engaged in the controversial practice of stopping individuals for m inor offenses as pretext to search for evidence of other criminal wrongdoing generally speaking pretextual traffic stop occur s when police effectuate stop based on probable cause that violation has occurred while in actuality the primary motivation for the detention is t ohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30316crs5 thus under this definitio n pretextual stop is an objectively reasonable and valid exercise24 of police powe r as opposed to the notion that an officer may simply fabricate an underlying justification for stop see united states v whren 517 us 806 812 1996 517 us at 81025 id at 81126

whren two plainclothes vice officers of the district of co lumbia metropolitan police partment were patrolling an area of high drug activity in an unmarked car the officers passed dark nissan sentra pathfinder with temporary license plate s occupied by two young males and observed that the driv er of the vehicle was looking toward the lap of the passenger the officers noticed that the vehicle had paused at stop sign for an abnormal period of time as the officers executed uturn towards the vehicle the nissan made sudden right turn without signaling and accelerate d from the int ersection at an unreasonable speed the officers subsequently stopped the vehicle and observed two large bags of crack cocaine in the defendants hands the defendants were arrested and an ensuing search resulted i n the discovery of other illegal drugs the defendants were indicted on fou r counts of federal drug law violations the defendants moved to supp ress the evidence maintaining that the traffic stop was not predicated on probable cause or reasonable suspicion and as such was violative of the fourth amendment the district court denied the motion stating that the sto p conformed with normal traffic enforcement procedures the defendants wer ultimately convicted and the disposition of their case was affirmed by the court of appeals for the district of columbia in regards to the suppression argument th court of appeals held that regardless of whether police officer subjectively believes that the occupant s of an automobile may be engaging in some other illegal behavior traffic stop is permissible as long as reasonable officer in the same circumstances could have stopped the car for the suspected traffic violation in its subsequent consideration of the case unanimous supreme cour t adopted an objective test declaring that the decision to stop an automobile i s reasonable where the police have proba ble cause to believe that traffic violation has occurred in reaching this conclusion the court rejected the contention that prior25 precede nt established that law enforcement should not be permitted to use vali d bases of action against citizens as pretexts for pursuing oth er investigatory agendas26 specific ally the court noted that the cases in question dealt with searches in th administrative and inventory contexts wh ich were conducted without probable cause accordingl the court determined that such decisions gave support to th principle that ult erior motives can invalidate police conduct that is justifiable on the basis of probable cause to believe that violation of law has occurred further27 clarifyin g this point the court stated not only have we never held outside th context of inventory search or administrative inspection that an officers motiv

justifiable behav ior under the fourth amendment but we have repeatedly held and asserted the contrary28 in view of this case law the court held that there was constitutional basis for hinging the validity of traffic stop on th actual motivations of the officers involved indeed the court went on to state that adoption of subjective test would require casebycase assessment of particular police actions at particular times compromising the invariable nature of fourth amendment search and seizure protections 29 addressing the argument that pretextual stops might be employed in n intentionally discriminatory f ashion by authorities the supreme court noted that it is well settled that the constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race the court declared however that the prope r constitutional basis for such biased police action is the equal protection clause s opposed to the fourth amendment the court concluded its consideration of th issue by declaring that sub jective intentions play role in ordinary probablecause fourth amendment analysis 30 many commentators have decried the whren decision arguing tha t the court has essentially bestowed unbridled authority on law enforcement officers to detain an individual upon the merest of suspicions in particular it has been argued that given31 the pervasive and arcane na ture of traffic laws police officer will invariably be able to effectuate an investigatory sto p upon an inarticulable hunch as opposed to valid reasonable suspicion as suc h these commentators maintain the supreme court has departed from th spirit if not the letter of the terry standard while whren indeed imbues officers with yet another tool with which they may investigate individuals of whom they are suspicious strong case can be made that the courts decision does not reflect substantial change in fourth amendment precepts specifically it i s important to note that officers c onducting stop under the whren standard must still possess probable cause to initially stop vehicle which necessarily requires that valid traffic law has been violated furthermore the whren decision does not abrogate fourth amendment strictures which limit police power after an initial stop indeed officers must still satisfy probable cause and reasonable suspicion standards befor

be yond the scope of the original objective purpose for the stop furthermore the court recognized the potential that pretextual traffic stop s could be made in an intentionally discriminatory fashion and ruled that the prope r remedy for such an offense would be an equal protection claim this holding i s consistent with supreme court precedent whi ch mandates that objectively reasonable enforcement measures should not be prohibited due to the possibility f unconstitutional applic ation rather the proper remedy in such circumstance is for the aggrieved party to file suit accordingly it seems that while the whren decision sanctions objective reasonable police action based upon underlying motivations the ruling comports with traditional constitutional principles fashioned by the court having established the main avenues by which law enforcement officers ma conduct valid vehicular seizure or investigatory detention it is now necessary t ascertain the scope of and nature of permissible police activity subsequent to traffic stop poststop conduct as noted above the reasonableness clause of the fourth amendment s interpreted in terry requires that any search or seizure subsequent to traffic stop be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place however employing the officer safety rationale which supported32 the stop and frisk at issue in terry the court has expanded the range of protective measures officers may take in the traffic s top context recognizing that investigative detentions involving suspects in vehicles are especially fraught with danger th court has ruled that law enfor cement officers may order individuals to exit vehicle search passenger compartments and frisk individuals for weapons in certai n circumstances33 protective searches in pennsylvania v mimms the supreme court held that law enforcement officers may order driver to exit an automobile during traffi c stop and may conduct frisk if there is reasonable belie f that the detained individual is armed in mimms two police officers observed the defendant driving with n34 expired license plate upon stopping the vehicle one of the officers directed th defendant to exit the vehicle and produce his license and registration as th defenda nt exited the vehicle one of the officers noticed large bulge under th defendants clothing fearing that the b ulge could be weapon the officer frisked the defendant and discovered loaded 38 caliber pistol passenger was subsequently discovered to be in possession of 3 2 caliber pistol the

person seated in an aut omobile and that significant portion of police shootings involve suspects seated in automobiles furthermore the cour t36 determined that asking driver to exit vehicle could also lessen the danger posed by nearby moving traffic balancing these factors with the intrusiveness of an exi t request the court found that ordering an individual from vehicle subsequent to lawful stop const itutes minimis imposition on personal liberty in particular the court explained that after being initially detained the additional requirement that driver exit vehicle exposes little more of his person than is already exposed and does not constitute serious intrusion upon the sanctity of the person in light of37 this minimal i ntrusion the court declared that mere inconvenience cannot prevail when balanced against legitimate concerns for officer safety accordingly th e38 court held that law enforcement officers may order driver to exit his vehicl pursuant to lawful traffic detention 39 the court also determined that the frisk at issue was constitutionally valid in reaching this determination the court explained that pursuant to terry the bulg observed under the defendants jacket provided sufficient basis to suspect th presence of firearm as such the court d eemed the ensuing frisk to be reasonable action to ensure officer safety40 recently in maryland v wil the supreme court extended upon its ruling in mimms declaring that law enforcement officers could order passengers as well s drivers to exit vehicle detained in valid traffic stop in wilson police

whether passengers could be subjected to such polic action pursuant to traffic detention the court pointed to the same officer safet factors considered dispositive in mimms while acknowledging that in the case of42 passeng ers the danger posed by incoming traffic would be lessened the cour t determined that the pres ence of multiple occupants increased the danger posed to an officer the court noted

ractical matter passengers were already stopped as result of the vehicle detention the court determined that an exit order constituted mino r intrusion as it would simply place passe nger outside of vehicle which was already detained pursuant to this charac terization the court determined that the safety concerns at issue prevailed since passengers ordered out of vehicle would be denied access to weapons co ncealed in the interior of the passenger compartment this factor was deemed especially pertinent by the court which surmised that potential violen t encounter would not stem from the traffic stop itself but rather from more sinister criminal activity which might be uncovered by such detention having determined44 that the danger posed to an officer during traffic sto p is greater when passengers are present the court held that an exit order constituted minimal intrusion allowin g officers conducting such stops to rder passengers from vehicles pending completion of the detention45 the wilson decision has also been criticized as an unreasonable extension f police authority by potentially increasing the impact of the plain view exception and encourag ing arbitrary police action indeed it has even been argued that the wilson decision will ultimately lead to the court sanctioned detention of individuals upon general traffic stop while th decision does indeed increase police authority in this46 context it is not apparent that any substantial fourth amendment rights have bee n impinged indeed the court noted that the intrusion of an exit order appears minimal when compared to concerns of offic er safety also it does not seem that the notion47 that wilso n will expand the plain view doctrine is of any substantial significance i n search and seizure analysis given that by its nature the plain view exception i s outside the purview of the fourth amendment rather in the doctrinal sense i t48 seems that wilson like whren serves mainly to illustrate the courts preference for objective fourth amendment standards furthermore given the courts matteroffact analysis wilson could be regarded merely as the application of preexistin g constitutional standards to new factual scenario the supreme court has also extended the terry standard to permit protective searches of the interior of an automobile in certain instan ces in michigan v long for instance the court held that limited protective searches are permissible i n circumstances where an officer reasonably believes that there may be safety ris k from weapons potentially located within the vehicle and accessible by the detainee in long two police officers observed car which was traveling erratically and t excessive speed as the officers observed the vehicle turn down side road i t

revealed approximately 75 pounds f marijuana considering the question of whether t he safety considerations of terry search extended to search of the passenger compartment of vehicle pursuant to lawfu l investigatory stop the supreme court held that police protecti on principles compelled the conclusion that such search is permissible if the police officer possesses reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which taken together with the rational inferences from those facts reasonably warrant the officers in believing that the spect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control f weapons 49 in reaching this determination the court reiterated its holdings in mimms and other cases which established that officers could conduct constitutional stop an d frisk if reasonable suspicion of potential danger existed given this standard th court concluded that the same safety considerations adhered to interior areas of vehicle which might harbor weapons the court also made it clear that such search50 was justified even though the suspect was ostensibly under the control of th officers at the time of the protective search specifically the court explained that during the course of any investigative detention pect is under police control only in the sense th at he may be briefly detained against his will as such the court51 explained that detain ed individual may still produce weapon from his clothing or may break away from police control long enough to retrieve weapon from th interior of an automobile furthermore the court noted that detained individua l could have access to weapons inside car after the investigate stop is complete d absent pr otective sweep of the interior in light of these factors the court again52 emphasized that safety

as long as the officer continues to interrogate them accordingly ohio established bright line rule stating that63 when the purpose of an initial stop i s completed the officer involved must inform the individual that he or she is legally free to go 64 the preme court of the united states reversed declaring that w enforcement officials do not ve constitutional duty under the fourth amendment to inform individuals as to whether particular police encounter is consensual specificall the court explained that the central focus of any inquiry into such n encounter must center on reasonablene ss measured in objective terms by examining the totality of the circumstances furthermore the court stressed that it eschewed65 brightline rules of the sort proposed by ohio finding it more appropriate to focus on the fact specific nature of reasonableness inquiry in the fourth amendmen t context66 illustrating this approach the court discussed schneckloth v bustamonte where it held that the validity of an individuals consent to vehicle search did not require that the def endant know of his right to refuse such request specifically the court stated that while knowledge of the right to refuse consent is one factor to be taken into account the gove rnment need not establish such knowledge as the sine qua non of an effective consent the court further explained that it would be thoroughly67 impractical to impose on the normal consent search the detailed requirements of an effective warning applying this rationale to the case at hand the court i n68 robin ette declared that it would be unrealistic to require police officers to alway s inform detainees that they are free to go before consent to search may be deemed voluntary the court concluded its discussion by stressing again that the fourth69httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30316crs13 id70 new york v belton 453 us 454 1981 united states v robinson 414 us 218 197371 see robinson 414 us at 22972 395 us 752 763 196973 belton

anywhere within the passenger compartment as well as luggage boxes bags clothing and the like id the court cl arified the scope of its holding noting that authority to search did not exte nd to the trunk of an automobile id however search of the hatch area of an automobile has been upheld due to the accessibility of such an area from the passenger area see united states v doward 41 f3d 789 794 1 cir 1994st 119 sct 484 199875amendment test for valid search consent is whether such consent was voluntary as determined by factual inquiry focusing on totality of the circumstances 70 search incident to arrest the supreme court has also established that subsequent to lawful custodial arrest police may conduct warrantless search f an arrestee irrespective of probable cause and reasonable suspicion to indicate the presence of either weapons or evidence unlike the limited focus of terry stop and71 frisk police may m ake full search for weapons and evidence in search conducted incident to valid arrest furthermore in chimel v california the supreme court72 ruled that police could also search the area within the immediate control of n arrestee explaining that the scope of such search was necessary to ensure office r safety and maintain evidence integrity in new york v belton the court extended73 the scope of its ruling in chimel holding that custodial arrest imbued police with the power to conduct search of the passenger compartment of an automobile specifically the court declared that authorities may search the passenge r compartment and any containers located therein even after establishing exclusiv custody over the vehicle and arrestee74 from the aforementioned c ases it is evident that the supreme court has placed significant weight on officer safety considerations in delineating the scope of police power to conduct searches and seizures in the traffic stop context as noted thes decisions have led many legal scholars to the conclusion tha t the court has established strong law enforcement preference in fourth amendment issues impinging upo n personal liberty interests guaranteed under the constitution while these may be valid concerns it is important to note that the co urt continues to operate within traditional fourth amendment parameters this is illustrated in the search incident to arres t context in the recent case of knowles v iowa 75 in knowles v iowa the united states supreme court overturned ruling from the supreme court of iowa whic h had validated police officers warrantless search of an automobile stopped for traffic violation even though the driver was t arrested for the offense but rather had merely been issued citation the iow supreme court validated the arch on the basis that so long as the arresting officer had probabl cause to make custodial arrest there need not in fact have been ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30316crs14 id at 48776 id at 488 quoting united states v robinson 414 us 218 234235 197377 knowles 119 sct at 48878 id at 48879 id at 48880custodial ar rest the supreme court of the united states noting that none of the76 justifications supporting searches incident to arrest adhere to typical traffic stop held that the police action was violative of the fourth amendment specifically the court explained tha t the officer safety rationale was not applicable in that the threat posed by the issuance of traffic citation is substantially less than in the custodia l arrest context which is of special concern given the extended exposure whic h follows the taking of suspect into custody and transporting him to the polic station clarifying this point the court stated tha t while safety concerns are present77 in routi ne traffic stop they do not justify the significant intrusion effected by full search rather the court found it significant that officers possess other means b which they may protect thems elves such as ordering individuals to exit vehicles and to conduct terry frisks and searches where justified furthermore the cour t78 declared that search incident to citation exception to the fourth amendment could not be justified by need to preserve evidence since once an individual is stopped and issued citation all evidence necessary to prosecute that offense has bee n obtained the court also declared that such search could not be justified on the79 basis that an individual stopped for traffic offens might destroy evidence of another crime noting that the possibility of disc overing evidence unrelated to traffic offense was too remote80 conclusion in light of the aforementioned cases it is evident that the supreme court s crafted sign ificant exceptions to the warrant and probable cause requirements of the fourth amendment in the traffic detention context as has been shown recen t decisions in particular have arguably expanded the scope of law enforcement power leading some commentators to declare that the fourth amendment has been all but abrogated in the vehicular context however while cases such as whren and wilson show that the court has indeed clarified and sanctioned greater protective and investigative police authority in th traffic context it is important to remember that these rulings have been predicate d upon well settled constitutional principles furthermore the courts decision i n knowles establishes that the same rationales supporting extension s of law enforcement authority also serve to circumscribe police power as such it seems that while police officers do indeed possess broad authority under these decisions the courts rulings have adhered to the basic principles which fostered the initial development of th exceptions discussed above as such rather than forging n ew doctrinal interpretations of fourth amendment boundaries and exceptions it appears that the court s applied settled constitutional principles to previously unencountered factual scenarios expanding police power in certain respects while restricting it in others
